Do you wonder how this world will turn out? Are you a pessimistic person? This book is one author's story about a world that prejudice against the different has taken over. The main character in this book is a boy named Jonah. He lives with his father and mother. Although these are not his birth parents they treat him as their own son. But one major part of a parent is their love. In this book feelings are mild. No pain no love and no hatred. The Community has no feelings and death is not painful. The old people in the community take a painless shot and then they are dead. Only one person in the community can feel sorrow, hurt, happiness and all the feelings we feel. Another thing that this Community has abolished is color. All people can see is a dull gray. Again the same person that has feelings can see colors.Jonah is nearly 12 years old. This is when jobs are assigned. He hopes for a simple job that involves his interests. But nothing of the sort is given to him. The people at the community have been watching Jonah and he has been assigned the job as the Givers apprentice.The Giver is a person in the community that carries all the memories of the world. All the rainbows, the pain and the world as we know it. The Giver is the only one who knows the memories. And now the giver is growing old and he must pass his knowledge to Jonah. It is a hard time for Jonah because all he ever knew is begin reversed as he sees the world that he lives in is cruel and harsh and all the people are nave. Finally a plan is made as Jonah tries to save the world as he knows it from utter destruction."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I was required to buy this book for a class. I had never heard of the book before. It became the kind of book that was difficult to put down once I began reading it. Somewhat unusual story line, but as a future teacher, the book contains so many great concepts from which to teach from. Highly recommend it, though I would probably not involve children until late middle school."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a fantastic book. I first read this in elementary school, before it was famous. This is a great pick for young readers, but teens and adults will be challenged accordingly.

It makes me wonder what happened to them, how the community reacted, and when Gabe grew up could he give the memories to others or did he even remember them. I really yearn for a sequel.

I also found it interesting because my dad's name is Gabe and it kind of makes me question."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read the Giver a few years ago and I still remember how great it was.

There was a lapse of time where we stopped and I was in so much suspence I had to check the book out from the library. This is one of the best books I've ever read. In comment to the one-star review, this book is very confusing at the beginning and leaves many ends open. But that is a good thing because it really makes you think. There are a lot of shocking surprises in this Utopian community. I recommend this book to anyone that is at least in 8th grade and who really likes to think about what they read. I finished this book stunned. One piece of advise: read this book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"At sometimes it was hard to understand but I liked it. Read this book only if you're 14 or older.

When &quot;The Giver&quot;, by Louis Lowry, is about a community that has no famine, violence, crime, prejudism, and diseases. In the community where a twelve-year-old boy named Jonas lives, family units are picked out, you have no thoughts, and when you have dreams, you get a pill to make them go away. Jonas wonders what career he'll get and if he'll get the same career as his friend Asher. I sort of liked and disliked this book because of how the people have their careers picked out for them and that when you have dreams, they're controlled by pills that make them go away. What I like about this book is that it's very calm and a very quiet place and you can't get hurt really bad. What I also disliked about this book is that your careers are chosen for you and the families are being chosen.

I was captured from the first paragraph. My children's literature professor recommeded that all of the elementary education majors read this book. I finished it in two days while studying for finals. The book has since been passed along among my classmates. Each time one of us finish it we express our feelings and show such enthusiasm about it that someone else wants to read it. I would not recommend this book to those of you with no imagination. It does not offer definte closure, but imagination is what reading is. If you want someone to tell you every detail and what happens next then watch T.V. and leave the books to those of us who imagine."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read a review that gave this book one star the person said that they did not like this book because it made her question averything she had ever been taught.This book makes me realize that maybe we need tho question our values sometimes. this book could teach you alot."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is very like-able. It moves at a good rate and keeps the reader in curiousity. It is easy to understand and relatable to the reader. It is about a oung boy named Jonas and hs escaping the place in which he lives in. He gets picked to recieve the thoughts of the world as t was before it was monitored and perfect. When there was pain and suffering, as well as pleasure and happiness. After experiencing this he takes his little brother Gabrielle and ventures to find a world in which he can experience those emotions. He leaves without telling anybody and it is known that he left. This part leaves the reader in the most suspence. He also leaves when having feuds with his family, about their beliefs and their sayings. He also is't emotionally attached to them because they aren't his birth parents. He was put in this family when he was just a kid with no choice. His thoughts and emotional suffering, as well as his happiness with the Giver,(the man giving him all the memories of the times before) is relatable to the young reader's own feelings. I would definetely recommend this book to any reader. This book is right for all readers because it has a little bit of everything. It is heartfelt, adventurous, and has a comfort to it that any reader would like. This book should definetly be read, if you are young or old, or in between, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"An award winning book is a great thing to read.

It's a masterpiece that all new dystopian writes keep getting ideas from and stealing from. In fact, my daughter was reading a series called matched i think and another series. Both owe the Giver everything in them. Whenever my daughter tells about an idea in the books, I have to laugh at how this was stolen from the Giver. So what is this review about?It's a bout that Lois Lowry set the perfect name for the book.Why?Because The Giver GIVES 90% of today's dystopian fiction ideas and is never mentioned."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Although read frequently by school-aged childred across the country, The Giver is a great read for tose of all ages. Lowry paints a detailed world of totalitarianism and those who live in it. Somehow I missed out on reading this book during my formative years and found myself glued to it while reading it a a twentysomething."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book back in middle school. So, I decided to revisit this classic tale now that I have more appreciation for literature than my pre-teen self.At first the writing seemed overly simple, lacking in any deep descriptive detail, but as I read, I found how well it seemed to fit with the tone and the story overall. The tale is told from the perspective of a young boy in a highly controlled society where even emotions are kept under tight wraps. All that changes when he is chosen to be the next Receiver, keeper of the society's memories. Things start to unfold gradually, then a little more rapidly as time goes on. The boy learns that the world used to be different, and how people gave up many things, like pain and emotions and feelings of attachment, in order not to feel that way anymore, if everything is the same, then no one would have to suffer anymore. A sort of play on the famous saying, 'It's better to have love and lost...', except this society truly believes it's better to have never loved at all.I believe the themes in this book are pretty poignant, even in this day. How much are we willing to give up in order to feel safe and protected? Our rights? Our families? Even our humanity? Jonas slowly starts to realize this as the tale progresses and he learns dark secrets about the family and home that he grew up with, delightfully ignorant to all that is around him. I loved his curiosity to find out more, to experience even the memories that were painful.Overall, this book is not an exciting read. There aren't many action scenes. But it is an enjoyable one, one I was glad I revisited now that I am older, and I would like to believe, somewhat wiser. However, I was a little disappointed by the ending. There was so much build up, so many questions that begged to be answered, but sadly they weren't. Where did Jonas go? Is the rest of the world like the society he lived in? There were so many. Instead, we are left with a slight hope and a town that somehow reminded me of the Christmas town from Nightmare Before Christmas..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In a perfect world, the hero of the story dissents from the perfect lifestyle for reasonable and beautiful reasons.

I truly enjoy it and recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Incredible imaginative story that challenged my notions about how far one can go with political correctness. Indeed, if the world was made up of people who looked the same, personalities would be easier to manage; but certainly, as you dig deeper there is so much that makes us unique. And one must question who are the deciders of who difference is ok to a conformist society. A great read on many levels. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry has created a book about the future, but unlike other books about the future, this one does more than just talk about huge television sets and weird cars. Lowry had created a whole new world for her readers; a world of Sameness; a world where no one can be hurt--except for the Receiver. The Receiver has to hold onto all of the memories from the past--all the wars, all the bloodshed. But the Receiver also holds onto all the joys that his Community gave up when they went to Sameness: music, color, and beautiful weather. When Jonas is chosen to be the next Receiver, his normal world is turned up side down. And to make things worse, baby Gabriel is about to be killed. When Jonas leaves the community with Gabriel, he makes a hard decision. In this powerful book, Lois Lowry creates a world where everything is safe and secure--except for one person. I really enjoyed this book, and I would gladly recommend it to anyone of any age."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is an excellent book that pictures another side to our world.

Some of the ideas might need a bit of explaining, but it is a story that kids can really get into."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It's a bit difficult to put into words how I felt about Lowry's The Giver. The first thing that came to mind and just wouldn't go away is \\"horrific\\". And though one can't really be caught surprised with the unfolding of events since Lowry, as a measure of her skill as a storyteller, quite expertly built up the climax, there's still a part of me that kept thinking, \\"Surely it wouldn't be so bad...\\"Of course, it was inevitable that this seemingly eerily perfect world she created would topple. And it was all brought about by the power of memories and one's yearning for love. It made me realize that I've never felt so perplexed and awed by a story in a long while.Certainly dialectic and begging for a multitude of interpretations, The Giver is another one of those worthy reads that dared to explore, among other things, the boundaries of threshold a person can reach, along with one's capacity to break free of bonds just to truly realize what it is to be human."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"First of all, WOW, WHAT A BOOK! Of all the newbery books I've read so far this one has been the best, and pushed me to read faster than any book I've ever read.The Giver introduces the reader to some interesting subject matter such as communistic living, where everyone has a place and everyone works for the greater good. While there is benefit to this style of life, you eliminate indiviuality, and the freedom of choice. Uniqueness is thrown out the window in favor of predictability and stability.What makes the book interesting is how the different characters handle the mode of life, especially Jonas, who is suddenly given a taste of the truth, and finds the world he is living in unbearable.The book reminded me of the movie \\"The Time Machine\\" (the one with Rod Taylor), In the movie when George gets to the distant future the people there live similarly to the way they do in the book, communaly with no thought to emotion, knowledge, or creativity. There is one scene in the movie that is eerily like a scene in the book where someone falls into the river and drowns. I can't help but wonder if Lois Lowry watched the Time Machine before she wrote the book.The book is great and Lois Lowry is a brilliant writer, I can't wait to read more of her work."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is one of the most thought provoking stories that I have ever read! I read it when I was in the 6th grade and I didn't get it... only after reading it again in highschool did I really see the wonderful creativity of this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I hear that they are making a movie of this book that should come out by 2011. I only wish 2 things: 1)they don't take so many liberties; 2)that it would come out sooner, Christmas 2009, perhaps. I really don't know why I like this book. I've never read its \\"adult counterpart\\" 1984 by George Orwell. It is a Newberry award winner. While I read many Newberry winners as a child, I didn't read this one until I was grown. Maybe that's good because some things about this book may shock children. It is very cerebral until the end, not your usual children's book, in my opinion. I guess I enjoy it because it is disturbing and also hopeful. It teaches readers of any age to appreciate things that we now take for granted and gives us a look at what life would be like without them. A Dark but Wonderful Read!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This story made me think of the old movie \\"green sun\\". It should make everyone react at his/her level without any age distinction but mostly teenagers. No robot in the futurist story, just human conditioned and controlled (by who?) at the extreme. It is wonderfully explained how one ends up not questioning the system and how he/she can escape it. The end is splendid except for a \\"prop\\" which appears from nowhere. This excepted, the book is beautiful. I strongly recommend it to everyone over 13. I warranty parents they won't hear \\"I'm bored\\" or \\"I have nothing to do\\" the time of this book reading and may be thinking of :). For grown ups, it is a fabulous and clear reply to Finkenkraut's \\"Vain memory\\".Claude"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I loved this book. Sameness is presented as a good, simple way to live, which at first seems like such a good idea. I loved experiencing the injustice and horror Jonas experiences as he learns, discovering with him the severe shortcomings of the only world he knows. Jonas and the Giver are strong characters who were a pleasure to meet.My only small complaint with the book is that the end seemed rushed. After becoming attached to the characters and invested in their futures, the end feels hurried with assumptions without any definite conclusion. The setting of the ending is certainly fitting, I just would have liked the last scene to have been more fully fleshed out.Nonetheless, this was a wonderful book, full of the joys of individuality and differences."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"If the ultimate goal of book club is to develop deep comprehension and critical thinking skills, then this book is the perfect tool. There is so much for students to pour over in search for meaning. It is unsettling at several different levels, and I would expect a fairly mature book club to find their way into conversation without much prodding from the teacher.I would not start book club rookies out on this for their first book. I think the group would need to be fairly comfortable with each other and have a high level of trust and acceptance - students (and even teachers!) would need to feel confident to try out ideas without judgement and be able to sort out their thoughts in an open, caring atmosphere.In my experience, many book club books often have very superficial themes that students grasp and extract connections from. I don't think such books propel them to higher levels of thought and understanding. I often hear something like, \\"This book is about a brother and sister fighting, and I sometimes fight with my sister too.\\" There just isn't anything for them to take their ideas a step futher. When the book clearly presents thought-provoking themes that students grab onto and want to discuss, it is a wonderful thing. Book clubs are for books that MUST be discussed and CANNOT be read and understood (quite as fully) by yourself. This is exactly the type of book that is made for book club."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" is a must-read book for both tweens and adults. Lois Lowry delivers a powerful message in a compelling story, which is written in a lively and lovely manner. My 12-year-old son loved it as much as I did. Ms. Lowry has made a note-worthy contribution to modern day literature. Read it! Have your kids read it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is one of those stories that keeps you involved from start to finish. You spend much of the book trying to figure out where you are, only to discover that the utopia does not exist. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great book to read!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is just another example of a potential classic destroyed by lack of any interest whatsoever. Social-Science fiction writing is by no means Lowry's strength. She should have stuck with those Anastastia books I recall reading in the 2nd grade. Anyway, within the last four years or so I've grown an affection for those types of books that are all aimed at explaining \\"alternate universe/societies\\" that we should be glad we don't live in. For example, 1984 by George Orwell, and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and The Martian Chronicles. If I had not previously read these, I probably would have liked The Giver a lot more. The problem was that Lowry left too many questions unanswered for the book's own good. Sure, with a story like this it's always good to leave some things open for you to consider, but Lowry led it to the point where parts of the book lacked continuity. Another thing that bothered me was how the Giver \\"gave\\" the memories into Jonas via telekinesis. That was somewhat understandable, but when it got to the point where Jonas saves Gabriel's life by giving him the memory of warmth. That crossed the line in my mind... plus all the other things thrown in to it... so, Ok, let me see if I've got this straight... no heat, no cold, no hills, no weather, no sex, no choices... and too much unanswered. There also appears to be a lot of confusion as to Jonas' world being considered by its citizens as the \\"perfect world\\" or the \\"ideal society\\". The problem with that of course is that how would the people know what a perfect world was? They know only their society and no others (with the exception of the Giver himself). However, most of what I just wrote could be cancelled out if Lowry just meant for The Giver to be just a quickly-read little novel for entertainment (it would have dragged on had it been any longer), and I agree it's a good lead-in to other books with the same idea. However, if Lowry meant to write a big, unsettling, revolutionary, thought-provoking book, she could have tried a lot harder. I'm pretty sure that she didn't, though. After reading The Giver I yearned to read something with more depth and theory... so I did. I went and picked up the first book of The Martian Chronicles, and I felt a little better. So to sum it all up, The Giver was a quick read (the chapters are short), and is probably a good book for a twelve year old to read if he/she has a lot of questions about society and what it could be (sixth-grade teachers, this means you!), or if he/she has an interest in social-science fiction. I have just been spoiled (or enriched) with books that do a lot of a better job explaining themselves. Whether or not you found my review helpful, I'm just glad you read what I had to say."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in a community that appears, on first acquaintance, to be perfect. It's a world without crime, and with no unemployment--and therefore no poverty--nobody has to suffer hunger pangs, never mind the torment of starvation and homelessness. All members of a family unit share the experiences and \\"feelings\\" of their day each evening and nobody lies. Or so Jonas believes. Only when he learns that his lifetime job is to be the Receiver (taking on all the memories of both pain and joy that have been banished from his society, and being given permission to lie) does he realise the community's creators have banished even more good than evil from his society. Jonas and his tutor, the previous Receiver, to whom he gives the title the Giver, decide that the cost of their stable society is too high ...Jonas's community clearly doesn't cover the whole world in which it's set, and one doesn't even have to travel over water to reach \\"Elsewhere\\", of which there are hints relatively early in the book. Most members of the community clearly believe that this is where people who are \\"released\\" go. Young readers possibly might not guess the truth here but I'm sure adult readers will.For a book with such a complex set-up The Giver is amazingly short at less than 200 pages. If it had been a novel for adults I think it would have contained a lot more detail on how this utopian society was set up, because it does leave you asking questions about it. Lowry does, however, give enough detail for the purpose of her story and she handles it deftly, never getting in the way of the forward motion of the plot and therefore taking the risk of boring young readers.I was amazed to hear that The Giver was on the list of \\"most challenged\\" books for 2000, on the grounds of \\"being sexually explicit, having occult themes, violence\\". I didn't see anything in it that wasn't appropriate to its audience of young adults. It's a thoroughly gripping read and beautifully written."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book immediately captivates you and puts you inside of a world unlike what we know. It was a real page turner at first. But, there were some things that I feel should have been better explained to make the story feel more real. For example, that author didn't explain HOW the people were unable to see color or HOW all hills were removed. About 3/4 of the way done, I realized that the end of the book was rapidly approaching and wondered how it would end. Well, it seems the author got a little bored and just decided to end it. The ending was terrible. TERRIBLE. This book had so much potential and the storyline itself was interesting. I really wish the author would have made the book longer and added an ending that would have made sense."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry raises excellent questions for adults (and young adults alike) to wrestle with, in the spirit of all good literature. But while the book is designated \\"science fiction,\\" the \\"GOTCHA!\\" ending evaporates into fantasy, leaving the SF reader grasping at vapor.While more and more modern authors seem content to leave countless narrative strings hanging, it's too bad that happened with this particular story. As a result, I don't think I'll be picking up any more of Lois Lowry's books, because I'll be expecting lazy writing (and an unsatisfying read) inside."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver exposes the dark side of trying to create a perfect world. On the bright side, everyone is harmonious and obedient, there is no poverty and no want or need, but with light, there's shadow. The main character Jonas has led a sheltered life of ease. Upon his twelfth birthday he is assigned his job that he will do for the rest of his life as everyone else will, he becomes \\"The Receiver of Memories\\". The role is one of high honor and Jonas accepts it with a twinge of sadness but with pride. As he trains for his new role in the community he begins to learn of the horrors of human history and the present. His perspective on the world is forever altered. He must decide his fate, but is it the right one?This book is fantastic and I'm very glad I spent the time to read it. The Giver offers a view into what would go wrong if one tried to create a utopian society. Lois Lowry does a wonderful job of creating a world that the reader feels involved in. She sets up contrasts and foil that keep a reader enthralled in the story. The Giver is definitely a book that everyone should add to their library."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was a great book. It was a little confusing in the beginning because I didn't understand why they didn't have sunshine or the other things Jonas saw in the memories. I figured it out when The Giver started talking about Samness. The only thing I didn't really like about the book was the end. It just ended without telling what happend to him. He was just sitting there. I think there should be an epilogue or a sequel. (if there already is a sequel I have never heard of it)I don't think this book would have been good in first person because it would be like Jonas is telling the story. I don't think the book would be good in present tense either because it just wouldn't make sense.I like how it doesn't explain a lot about what happends in between 12 and 13. It doesn't need to because The Giver is just basically giving him memories. Anything else that happends (if it's important) is said. This is a great book and I recomend it for all children, young adults and adults who can read. If you are one of these people, READ IT!Doris"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a young adult book by Lois Lowry about an utopian world where everybody are happy, everybody live in peace an harmony, life is good.

His task is to become the next \\"Giver\\" in this perfect society.Through his meeting with the old Giver Jonas discovers that his world is breaking up into peaces. His life gets a new dimension, or actually several dimension, and he is given the choice to save his world.All young adults should read this book, to learn that their life is important and that what they do, the way they live can make a change. To the better or to the worse. But as individual human beings we all have the possibility, and the human right to choose our path. And the way we live is not only ours. We live in a world together with the rest of the creation, and the way we live make us responsible for the rest of the world.I gave the book a four, due to the ending. The ending was short and also kind of weak in my oppinion. But all in all the book was very good, and a must to read for all of us.Britt Arnhild Lindland in Norway"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This seems to be a rather heavy-handed polemic, a _1984_ for kids, though frankly I think the kids should skip straight to _1984_. Lowry's manufactured rightspeak is awkward, the dark surprises hidden beneath the placid surface of the supposedly Utopian society are not at all surprising, and, worst of all, her world is just not believable. Yes, it's fictional, and probably even allegorical. It still should be possible, or at least believable, in order to be chilling and convincing. A society that has learned to control the climate, iron the hills out of the landscape, prevent anyone from seeing colors, etc.? Give me a break. To say nothing of the fact that apparently many citizens are aware of the \\"secrets\\" underlying their paradise--the old, defective, or just plain extra are euthanized, etc.--but yet no one before Jonas has tried to blow the top off the system for centuries. And the old \\"they had perfect lives, but yet they did not feel LOVE\\" line is trotted out in all its triteness. And while I understand that Lowry was trying to depict a society startlingly different from our own, it's a little sinister that this supposedly-perfect-and-actually-EVIL society is notable for having women in positions of responsibility and power, and allowing men to work in childcare (though I have to note that this was a minor detail, and not the major thrust of the book at all).Also, I find Rifkin's reading extremely annoying. Surely they could have found someone with a perfect, bland, middle American non-accent to narrate the story of the perfect bland society. He makes the kids sound whiny and the Giver sound like he's been chain smoking for the past 40 years. The background music is also cheesy.I gave 2 stars rather than 1 as the writing wasn't completely bad and I appreciate her inventiveness and attempt to spread warnings about conformity. However, I hate to see classrooms using this dumbed-down dystopian tale; there's enough REAL literature out there that teenagers should be at least trying to read _1984_ or _Brave New World_ instead."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Though THE GIVER was an interesting story, with interesting ideas, I felt it left much to be desired. I personally while reading the book kept waiting for it to be brought to the next, deeper, level but instead it seemed to stay on one less meaningful platau. Also the ending of the book made very little sense to me, and although intriguing to speculate upon, I feel more shoul dhave been written."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I enjoyed the story of The Giver. The character of Jonas is a great one especially when he becomes the new Receiver. Reading the story gives you the impression of a perfect society until you realize what the citizens gave up for perfection. The book could have been a little longer--what happened to Jonas' family? What happened to the Giver? And the ending was very vague. What exactly happened? I would have rated the book 5 stars but the ending was anti-climatic and hard to understand. Altho it was a good read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Although this book is a kids' book, I found it very engaging.

This story is a well written one about a boy named Jonas that is elected for the highest position in the community.

My only negative comment is regarding the chapters starting in the middle of tracks, and sometimes even needing to change the cd in the middle of a chapter. If I was only listening to it for enjoyment, this would not be a concern, but I am using it for my class and it becomes a hassle when reading 1-2 chapters a day.

I had no idea about the constructs that society places on us, conformity etc. at the time but it helped me to think for myself and look outside the norm. I will certainly give this to my children to read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver won a myriad of awards and deserved every one. My criteria for awarding my 5 stars is, \\"Will I remember this story next week and does it leave me pondering the book's ending?\\" The Giver makes us think about freedom at the most basic level. We must also ponder which is more important, freedom or safety, having needs immediately satisfied through keeping people ignorant or allowing people to make their own decisions though they won't have the cushion of large numbers of people to accomplish goals. Can people live with harsh punishments for breaking miniscule rules? The Giver asks us to ponder many such questions and to contemplate how the story may relate to our own government and how our liberty and freedoms have been and continue to be diluted and even stolen by socialistic leaders."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Have you ever read a book that's so great you can't put it down to use the bathroom.

There is one person chosen in the society that has to hold all of the memories from the past. The chosen one is a 12 year old boy named Jonas. Once the Giver has successfully passed on all of the memories, Jonas alone will have all of the infomation from the past- good and bad. When Jonas starts to feel the true pains and pleasures in life there's no turning back. He has to make a decision based on his limited knowledge at the risk of hurting everyone in the society. Maybe living in a utopian society would be nice. Being told how and what to do at all times, but how do you deside who is in charge? Is it possible to let someone else controle your every move? This is the kind of society that Jonas has lived in for 12 years. How would you react if you suddenly had the freedom to think for yourself? You will have to read the book to find out what he decides."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" gave me a new perspective on how I view life.

I was engrossed in the novel and all the events that took place; I could some what relate to the characters and how they sometimes felt. \\"The Giver\\" is an \\"A\\" class novel and one of my all time favorites, any one who enjoys reading will definatly enjoy reading \\"The Giver\\"."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver By Lois Lowry is a truly remarkable book! It is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a community where the rest of your life (your job) is decided for you. Jonas is just reaching that point of the Ceremony Of Twelve and he is very nervous. His friend Asher hopes for a job that has something to do with taking care of kids, and Fiona, another friend of Jonas's hopes to take care of the elderly. Jonas doesn't really hope for anything, just something that will suit him. When he is chosen to be the new receiver of memory, he is shocked! So is the rest of the community! From now on, he will be studying with The Giver, and will find out the real meaning of life.While I was reading the book, I was kind of wondering what was going on. At the end/ middle of the book though it was all clear. I thought that the book was wonderful and very original. You will never read anything like it! The Giver is definitely on my top 5 list of books to recommend and I would hope that everybody who reads it will enjoy it just as much as me!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book when I was in elementary school. I am now a sophmore in college, and have brought my copy with me- my roommate has her's too.

Anyone can find pleasure in it because it never gets old!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry did an excellent job writing the narration of the story. The perspective is very clear, and most of the ideas expressed are easy to understand by the masses. Of course, there are some things I couldn't stand.For example:'Jonas almost gasped aloud. To have the power to turn the speaker off? It was an astonishing thing.'-End of Chapter 10 of 'The Giver''As O'Brien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strike himm. He stopped, turned aside, and pressed a switch on the wall. There was a sharp snap. The voice had stopped.'-Excerpt from 1984 by George OrwellAbout less than a paragraph later, the protagonist in 1984 says the exact thing that Jonas said at the end of Chapter 10.Another thing that I couldn't stand was the sudden, almost magical transition of the characters' moral appearances seen by the protagonist.The Giver was an excellent read. If you like The Giver and wish to read more difficult selections, both Dune by Frank Herbert and 1984 by George Orwell are outstanding novels."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really enjoyed this novel. I love how Lowery creates a world where it seems as though everyone is satisfied, but it is obvious that there could be so much more. It is beautfully written and fun and easy to read, but, at the same time, contains very deep and complicated themes. Its a great book for a kid to read and a great book for an adult on another level."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Have you ever imagined yourself in a \\"perfect\\" world? Where there is no war, battles, pain, suffering or even love. Well, in this science-fiction book The Giver by Lois Lowry, The main character, Jonas didn't have to imagine it, he lived in a perfect world. Jonas was pretty satisfied with his world. Although, Jonas lives in a \\"perfect\\" world, there are some good and bad things about this world.Jonas lives in a town were everything is controlled by the elders. The weather that happens in the world is controlled. Your future husband or wife is not up to you. Or even the food you eat, are chosen by the elders. The elders control everything. When someone turns 12 years old, the elders assign a job for that person. They will have to do this job for the rest of their lives.When Jonas turned 12 years old, the elders assigned him the next Receiver of Memory. With this job, Jonas will go through tough times. Jonas's teacher is The Giver. The Giver will give Jonas memories that have been lost in the community. Jonas has no clue what will happen.If you like or are learning about similes or metaphors I suggest you read The Giver. You should read The Giver because Lois Lowry uses a lot of similes and metaphors in the book. I think that this book was interesting and mysterious. When you read the book, a lot of questions pop into your head. But at the end you start to connect the dots. I think that Lois Lowry made this book to making your self believe in things that you think that will never be true."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book the giver has a very great meaning. In this book jonas the main character lives in a perfect world were everything is choosen by the elders, Jonas thinks his life is great until at the ceremony of 12 he is selcted the reciver The reciver recives memories from the past.. Jonas meets the giver(gives memories to jonas) Now that Jonas has experienced Love, family, war and hatred he has to chose between living in a world where people have no choices or where everyone has choices and you live a good life. Jonas dicision results in a very good ending. I would reccomend this book to everyone... because it is a GREAT book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry did a really good job on this book.

Its about a boy named Jonas and how he is raised,and that every December they have a ceremony. The ceremony goes up to . Each year they acomplish something or get something. Jonas is an 11 and he is getting ready to be a 12. Read the book to find out what happens. The book is in a junior high level. I'd give it an 8 out of 10. Try it.

I had to read it twice because it was so amazing to me, a world that was perfect, but not. Recently, I just saw a movie titled \\"Equilibrium\\". It has the same theme. No pain or war but also no love. Feelings were outlawed. The movie was definitely no blockbuster, and it was pretty violent, but it reminded me of this book. After seeing the movie, I had to read this book again. I'm 23, and to this day this book has stuck with me. I would recomend this to anyone, young and old just because it makes you think of what it would be like to live that kind of life and if you would have the courage as Jonas did to show the community what it was missing."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in a community that can't see in color. He is just like you and me except that he is able to do a lot of things that nobody can do. He is the only one that can see in color. In the book he received memories and ran away to help his community. Jonas is a brave young man.Jonas took on the responsibility of receiving the memories. He didn't have to do that job. At the ceremony he could have said he wasn't going to do that, but he didn't. Next, he went to the Old Receiver and he told Jonas that he would experience great pain. If I knew something I was going to do would involve a lot of pain, not just physically but emotionally, I wouldn't want that job. But Jonas didn't mind, he was willing to do all of this for his community.To help his people he ran away from the town. The Old Receiver, which he called The Giver, told him that it wasn't fair to him or Jonas to be the only ones that had to keep the memories. The people needed to know about other things in the world than just their community. Jonas broke so many rules that he lost count when he escaped and had the community see all of the wonderful and horrible things in the world. This took a lot of courage on Jonas' part.Jonas was very brave. He willingly received the painful memories. In the process, he helped his community. On the way Jonas became braver. Jonas is a very good character."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverBy: Ying Yang ChanI was reading the book the Giver. What I am going to talk to you about today is why it is so hard to make connections to a world that is all black and white world where everything is exactly the same. I don't understand why a good author like Lois Lowery would write a book with really no good connection able to be made to the present time because it is all the same. I mean if you have an assignment where you have to make connections from your book to the present time you wouldn't be able to do the assignment because you can't make connections to the story.I think that teachers shouldn't recomend the Giver because of that simple fact you can't make any good connections. I thought the Giver was a good book and all but I just couldn't relate to it. i think that if Lois Lowery (Giver author) made the book a little bit more realistic and really able to happen more kids would read it more because they would be able to relate to the story. So in this last sentance I will tell you if you like to read science fiction/ fiction you should read the Giver. Also if you like really in-depth books you should read this book because Lois discribes everything perfectly and you are able to picture everything very easily.-Ying Yang Chan"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I was assigned to read this book when I was twelve. When I looked at he cover I thought this book would be one of he books that are boring, until I read the book. The Giver was absolutely wonderful. The book was about a twelve year old named Jonas living in a community black and white world, a community with no poverty, no feelings, no fear or pain. There were no choices. Every person was assigned to a job. After turning into an adult, doing s special job, Jonas experienced a life never before.When Jonas turned twelve he was considered as an adult so he was assigned to have a job. Jonas had enough courage, intelligence, and integrity so the chief thought he would be the next receiver and gain wisdom. His job was to hold painful and pleasurable memories to carry on from The Giver.I would strongly recommended this book to anyone who likes to read fantasies and read alouds. If you read the books Tuck Everlasting or Bridge of Terabithia this is a book you should enjoy."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A boy named Jonas is in a town were everything is perfect until he starts realizing that he can feel love and what happens when you are released which is when you are poisoned.Nobody in the community of Jonas can see colors. They also can not feel any emotions such as love or hate. The Elders ignore or don't know any bad things that have happened. This is partially why they are the most important people, because they can tell people what to do, but not have to deal the problem that might come up.In conclusion I think this would be a great book for you to read because it is a great book to read as a group and discuss what might happen next and what will be the big climax of the book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very strong book, dealing with many pressures of normal and abnormal life. The main character, Jonas, shows how one can make life better by helping others. Also the lessons of trusting, learning how to cope with pain, and bravery are all shown throughout the book. All of the characters are seen in a very in-depth way, from learning the deepest secrets of the community this book may be fiction, but the story is told with such detail that the town almost becomes real.

Jonas is selected by the elders of his community to be the receiver of memories, which is a very respected job. Jonas is given memories of what life was like before the community was made by an old man called the Giver.

It's about a boy named Jonas who lives in a perfect world. Nobody ever is upset, nothing ever dramatically changes, and nobody cares or realizes the one thing everybody is missing: memories. Jonas, apprehensive about the coming December that brings new changes, doesn't know what his assigned role in the community will be. But when the day comes, he is selected to be the Receiver of Memory. The Giver, who brings a whole new light to Jonas from the past, alone holds the pain, joy, and sorrow of the world in the past. Wanting to change, Jonas does one thing that could change the community forever.I enjoyed this book because of the alarming things being discovered about the community that Jonas lives in. The feelings Jonas discovered that he had never had before were the very things that changed his community. I disliked the fact that everyone was constantly apologizing in order to not break the rules. But overall this book was very good and had not a lot of action, but a lot of emotional feelings."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is a good book. It's about a boy named Jonas and his community. His fater is a nurturer and his mother works in the department laws an justice. He has a sister named Lilly. His friends are Fiona and Asher.

They are held on 2 days in December. At the ceremony of 12 all the 12s get an assignment (job) then start their training. Jonas wasn't assigned, he was selected. He was selected to be the new reciever of memories.I think the Giver is a good book I like the story. One thing I don't like (and maybe you won't either) is the ending.

Some of the characters are Mother, who is in the departmant o justace, Fateher who is in a nurturer, a person who takes care of the newborn children, and Lilly who is Jonas's sister. All of those characters are in Jonas's family unit, but the more important characters are Gabe who is an enjoyable newborn child, The Giver who is older, kind and smart, and Jonas. Jonas is the main character in The Giver and seems to be very brave and heroic.The Community that Jonas lives in is very safe, the same, and orderly, with no contact to the world outside of the community's walls. Everyone's life is chosen for them, their family unit, name, job, and absolutly everything else.On the day that they get their jobs, Jonas is chosen as the reciever of memory. The Giver shows him things that he never kew existed, and cannot talk to anyone about them except The Giver. Soon Jonas makes a big decision to help the Community.I enjoyed The Giver alot. It has many exciting lines in it such as 'He killed it. My father killed it!'. Another reason I loved this book is because it had many descriptive feelings in it such as 'Apprehensive, Jonas decided, that's what I am.'. One more reason I enjoyed this book is that I had the same feelings jonas had. I felt as if I were Jonas. I highly recoment this book to anyoe. You are garenteed a great book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"At the beginning of The Giver by Lois Lowry, Jonas, one of the main characters, and an eleven feels apprehensive on page one. The other main characters are the Giver who is the Reciever of Memory, and Gabriel who is a newborn and is having trouble sleeping in the nurturing center.The setting is somewhat plain, colorless, and sameness meaning no one but the reciever of memory has books, no one has individual birthdays, and everyone sees black and white except for the reciever of memory and the reciever in training. At the beginning of the book Jonas feels apprehensive due to the age ceremony, he gets selected for the reciever of memory and later on doesn't like his community or his father. Here is one of the sentences in the story,\\"The daily training continued and now it always included pain.\\"I highly recommend that you read this book for three reasons. Lois Lowry fills minds with interesting facts. She makes it interesting. And she makes you want to read on.(...). The main theme of this book is that sameness is not important."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"&quot;The Giver&quot; by Lois Lowry is a very good book.

When Jonas is selected to be the Receiver of memory (A very high honor) he has to learn from the Giver. Now that Jonas is able to see color see is to learn what no one else has.In this book there are many good and bad points. Like at the beginning it is somewhat boring and dull.

He has never known colors, felt fear or love. In December, his life changes.At the ceremony of Twelve, he is selected to recieve the memories of pain and joy. The Giver transmitts the memories by placing his hands on Jonas' back.Some memories are painful. 'They have never known pain,' He thought. He's overwhelmed with responsiblity. 'But you suffer all the time.' When he becomes so stressed, he runs away with Gabriel, a Newchild. As he rides down the hill with the sled, memories of joy and love come to him. The end is ambiguous, leaving the reader to decide Jonas and Gabe's fate.The Giver is a Newberry Medal winner. It's a, &quot;One more chapter!&quot; book. If you read The Giver, you will be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought that one of the most interesting elements in &quot;The Giver&quot; was the way in which the Giver introduced Jonas to pain. Lowry clearly distinguishes between types and degrees of pain. The first pain that Jonas experiences is the physical pain associated with sunburn. Jonas tells the Giver that he understands pain after feeling his skin burn. The Giver wisely tells Jonas that there are memories he must give Jonas that would be far more painful. Shortly thereafter, Jonas finds the Giver in anguish and asks if he can do anything to help. The Giver asks Jonas to relieve some of his burden by taking a war memory from the Giver. Jonas lies on the couch and finds himself in the midst of a post-battle scene. Jonas sees and hears a dying man, bloody and thirsty, asking for water. Next he hears the moans of all of the men around him, some crying for death, some for mommy. Jonas could never have imagined such a painful place. The community in which Jonas grew up not only prohibited such pain, it made it utterly impossible for its citizens to comprehend or feel such pain.Jonas experiences physical pain in the sunburn and later in the novel when he experiences, contrary to the prophecy of an adult earlier in Jonas' life, actual starvation. He experiences emotional pain in the transmitted memory of war, in the inability to be understood by his friends, and in the betrayal he felt when he learned of the underlying lies that were being used in the community he had grown up in without questioning.I rate this a 4-star book because I believe it is definitely better than average, it contains interesting ideas and concepts, and it deals with important and mature issues in a way that is accessable to a relatively young audience. I would have liked to read about what the effects of his &quot;stirrings&quot; had been. I also would have liked to gain some closure. The book ends in a way that leaves me wanting to hear more about &quot;what happens.&quot; I respect the fact that Lowry leaves me to use my own mind to think about what would have happened and why. I only hope that Jonas didn't end up getting released."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is about a seemingly utopian society. It is written about the future. In the community that Jonas lives in, no one experiences things like pain, urges, color, and weather. The community has very specific rules and even decides who a person will marry and what job they will have. Jonas grows up in a normal family with a mom, dad, and younger sister. He is different from the other children his age and is given the assignment of &quot;Receiver of Memory&quot;. After receiving memories, Jonas finally begins to understand what people in his community were really missing.Lowis Lowry uses this book to show the readers that in order to understand how wonderful things are, they must experience the not so wonderful side of things. Jonas had to learn this the hard way by being the only one who received the memories. Jonas begins to realize that there are other places out there beyond his community. Jonas has to decide what to do with the memories he receives. Should he stay or leave his community? Read the book to find out what Jonas does?This book is motivating to children and easy to read. Some of the concepts are almost unimaginable compared to our lives, but the author uses vivid word descriptions to help the reader understand. It also teaches that children can make a difference in this world. Most importantly it teaches that people have to experience the bad to appreciate the good. People must be able to reflect on their past and their memories in order to move forward in the world."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book for everyone. It also has a nice imagination for readers. This book is mostly about a unusual theory that the author, Lois Lowry, has about the future. It also teaches a great lesson of growing up and beleiving in what you think is right. After reading this book you will also have a great imagination about your future!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"this book called the giver is a pretty good book.It shows good realationship between the boy,Jonas and the old man,the giver.The reason why I like this book is because its diffrent from other books.How its diiffrent is because of the no color and how they get grouped and get a number for a name.Thats why I reconmmend this book to every one who enjoys unusal books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is very interesting and detailed. To begin with, it is about a boy who lives in a large city that is colorless and the same in temperature year round. When you are 12 years old your job in life is decided for you. There are family units with 2 children (1girl and boy). There are no real grades but ages that you learn by. Everybody in this city turns a different age in December. If twins are born and are both the same genders they weigh them and see which one is smaller and kill it. It is called the Giver because the boy becomes it. A Giver is a person that takes all the memories from years and years over time. Then when you turn old they put you in the old house. When you're too old they kill you. In this book he finds memories and color. He also finds what the world is really like outside of the town. Louis Lowery is one my favorite authors."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I loved this book! Even though I have never been one to read Science Fiction or Fantasy, I can't wait to share this book with students! The 'open-ended' conclusion will make wonderful discussion questions. We will all probably write our own endings. Lois Lowry writes about a young boy named Jonas who lives in a 'perfect' society. There are no decisions to be made, no hatred, no war, no memories and...no love. When Jonas turns 12 he becomes the \\"Receiver\\" of all memories and feelings. What an interesting story unfurls from there! I would highly recommend this book for any mature young adult readers (and for us \\"oldies\\", too)."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In response to the book The Giver, I have to say this. My virtual high school class is discussing how this book relates to folklore and the lack of it in this society. This book well reflects what will happen to society without the influence of folklore. I enjoyed it because the main character comes to a better realization about the world that he lives in and gets to decide things on his own. I think that the world of today one day could end up like the world in The Giver if we are not careful about what we do. This book may be on the elementary level but it is still an excellent book to read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, as it brought me happiness as well as grief within its visually colorful scriptures. Jonas, a boy of only twelve, discovers that he is destined to do more than what meets the naked eye, no pun intended. His community, known for its equality, or rather today this can be labeled as communism, assigns Jonas to work as the keeper of memories, where he is to deal with the pain and strife that the rest of the population does not deal with. This is supposedly done to ensure the happiness of his clan. Ever so slowly Jonas realizes that his life had been shielded from reality. Jonas had been lied to about what life was supposed to be like, and in this trap of bland grays, Jonas decided that he had to escape.I felt that Louis Lowery almost perfectly described this utopia in which Jonas resided. Everything was explained in utmost detail to give everyone the distinct view of life through Jonas's eyes. Lowery's use of allusion to the topic of Communism was also a powerful topic that I felt was delicately embedded within the text. Very craftily it was used to depict a community where everything was \`provided and cared-for equally,' but not necessarily \`perfect.' I would recommend this book to any age group. It is simple to read for any age, but what you get out of the book lies in how deeply you understand its levels. To a sixth grader, this could just be a story about following your heart, but to a junior in high school such as myself, this is a story about the need to escape from a world of depressing equality to a life of color and true love."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"We've read the book \\"The Giver\\" in our English lessons in school.First, it was very difficult to read, but the more we read, the more we understood. It was interesting to get to know such a world which is so different to ours: no colours, no love, no emotions,... It was Jonas's assignment to become \\"The Receiver\\" to get all those memories back. It was exciting to read how Jonas bears them.We like the fact that Louis Lowry chose an open end, because everybody can use his or her own imagination to decide what will happen next.All in all, we think the book is very advisable to read!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I definitely enjoyed the storyline of this book very much. You are presented in the beginning of the book with Jonas, a boy about to turn twelve. You meet his family and see that there is much emphasis on job titles in the community, as well as much emphasis on what is called Sameness. Jonas' story of being selected as the next Receiver of Memory is definitely riveting. You encounter his trials and tribulations as he learns about the world and begins to feel and see things for what they really are.This book most definitely had touches of Communism, in that everything is the same and everyone has an important role in the community. Everyone has the same things, and everyone (mainly the Committee of Elders) is the government. Jonas begins to see through this as he learns more about his job, and begins to feel things such as love for the very first time.This story is powerful. It has so much inner meaning behind it, such as in the end. The symbolism in the book is amazing, as is the storyline. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone of all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was a very interesting read, despite the extremely simple language Lowry used, as it is on a relatively low reading level. The Giver appeared to be used as a tool to point out things in our society that we take for granted and also to show what life would be like if we were to try to create the world in this book. Many people dislike pain, however Lowry shows through The Giver that pain is a necessary evil of life and something that cannot just be done away with. She indirectly shows the importance of differences in our lives. Another very important aspect is the reader's shock when he/she comes across things and ideas that are expected in this fictional world, but happen to be the characters had never heard of. The Giver is, in my opinion, a very good book with many different levels and should not only be read a younger age but also by older readers so that the full value and concept of the book can be understood. Lowry presents a very important message about our society and culture and the dangers of assimilation in a very unique way. Although I feel that the ending could have been far better, for there were so many things the author could have done, I believe it was an overall well-written book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is awesome, I give it five stars. It's filled with action, suspense and drama.A boy named Jonas lives in a town with very strict laws and very weird ways. People have no memories, see no colors, and everything they have is the same. People here live in dwelings with one of each a mother, a father, an adopted son and daughter. The adopted son and daughter come from birthmothers who are the only ones who give birth.Jonas lives with his mother, father, and sister Lily. Jonas is worried becuse he is soon going to get his assignment. An assignment is a person's job for the future. When Jonas gets his assignment he becomes Reciever of Memory. The Reciever is the most important job there is, Jonas will soon hold all the memories of the past and will hold colors to see with. Jonas will hold good memories but also bad ones. Jonas soon starts training from the old Reciever that Jonas calls the Giver.Jonas continues training for about a year, when he finds out what happens during a release. A release is when an elder, a new child, criminal, or anyone goes on to another place. What Jonas finds out is horrible. So Jonas and the Giver devise a plan to get away from the release process and getaway from sameness, but does the plan work? Read The Giver to find out!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I found the Giver a very interesting book. It really made me think about what life would be like in a world where everyone is the same. It's a great discussion book, and I really reccomend it for people who need a good read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This novel is a brilliant work with deep insight into the future should humanity continue to try to control nature. There are unfortunate things that happen and that is just as important and exciting a part of life as anything else.The book gives us a look at the moral choices of a 12 year old boy that makes decisions that todays adults should be proud to have such integrity to choose. The ending is absolutely brilliant. It allows the reader to think whatever he or she chooses happened to Jonah. Lois Lowry herself said that the end is up to the reader.If you haven't read this book do. It is far above its reading level. Every adult out there should take in this quick read - it has a heart we all need."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I read the book The Giver at first I thought NOT EXCITING WHAT'S SO EVER. After we kept on reading it wasn't all that bad.The story of The Giver is set in a utopia. There is a 12 year old boy named Jonas who lives in a community where there is no fear, pain, sadness, no colour, no feeling. The children are born into a family with only 2 children. Each person in the community receives the responsibility of a job that they must complete. Overall I would recommend this book to People between the ages of 14 and up. Only if they are into this kind of book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"How can you live in a world with so many different rules?. I thought that the novel was a very interesting story.

Its setting was interesting because it took place in a perfect world called the Utopia, where everything was the same. It was a good fiction novel because the setting is different from our world. I like how the author keeps you thinking after each chapter, and makes you want to keep reading. I also like all the suspenful events that take place throughout the novel. Most of all, I like the message the author gives being \\"Does a perfect world exist\\"."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very interesting and inspiring book. It's about a boy named Jonas living in a community that is perfect. This community has no feelings, nor colours. Jonas has been chosen to be the Receiver of Memory on his 12th birthday and discovers the real world of pain, the feelings and learns all the colours. Lois Lowry's creative mind touched me, with her amazing story. This book leaves you with a surprising ending. I strongly recommend this to all the readers out there who love to read and children from ages 10 and up."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Reading The GIver makes me feel like I am living in a utopia world. While I was reading this book, I put myself into this pretenting that I am Jonas. I think everybody should read this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a great novel because it always keeps you on your toes and makes you stop and think about life. It is a novel about a boy named Jonas who lives in a utopia with no differences, he is given a respected job, he is notified that in the training of his new job there will be pain it is called the job of receiving memory. In training Jonas receives things that people in the community are not given such as color, choice, memory of war, snow, sun, love and hate. Jonas is overwhelmed with painful and cherished memories and realizes that a perfect world for one person is not a perfect world for another, but he and the previous receiver of memory are the only ones that know this because the other people if the communities don&#8217;t experience choice, love or hate. Jonas finally decides to escape the community and leave all the memories to the community and the old receiver of memory."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book shows what it is like in a world with everyonethe same and no choices. Jonas is chosen to be the Receiverand discovers the pain and joy of the earlier years. It is avery good and inspiring book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an excellent newbery that portraits a world unlike our own. That world is a well organized society where people are put into jobs by the Elderly and a happy, peaceful place. However, this world is dull in color and sound. This is a place that needs color and music. It also needs it's people to sense feelings and even weather: happiness, coldness, and disaster. A boy named Jonas has been chosen to hold these memories of the past, for his job is the Receiver ,from the Giver (pervious Receiver). But, now he sees how his world is dull in appearance and understanding, he's goimg to change it.I highly recommend this book because of it's text. This book has adventure and lots of cliffhangers, which will make you want to just keep reading. I believe, one of the most important things this book is trying to help us understand our world. There are still many thing we haven't experienced like real starvation in poor countries or being bombed by planes.The Giver has helped me really understand our world.My favorite part of this newbery is when Jonas is thinking about what he has learned as a Receiver. He started to think about the world's past (our world). He compared it to his world to our's and found out one thing: the other people in the community have no experience with real feelings. Once, his sister said she was very angry for a boy cutting inline for a slide. However, she has no idea what anger is, like Jonas. She felt only shallow impatience, not true anger. This is why it is my favorite part."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really liked this book.(I read this book in a classroom) I have to admit that at first I was board with the book, but as time passed and i paid more attention to what the reader was reading, I got really into the book and i could really relate to what the author was trying to say in each chapter. I recommend this book to...well, everyone because it will leave you with many thoughts and will make you enjoy the world as it is, even with the major problems we face in everyday life. I was really touched by the main character's courage and his determination. He sets an example for us all. Please take my advise into consideration and read this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book was okay, it was a good idea too have a futuristic communitty, but there was a lot more the author could have done with the book, I mean The auther could have made it more interesting than she did. The ending was really bad too. It was confusing, and I just thought it was like the author gave up on it. I don't think she tried hard enough to make it good."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The most recent time I read this book it only took a matter of hours. It was required reading in both seventh and eighth grades, and now again in tenth. The notion behind this book is sound, however it fails to have a target audience. Its brevity makes it appealling to younger children, however most ten year olds would miss the deeper meanings imbedded in this novel. Older children, or adults, would I believe not appreciate this book because of its length. It would be much better to read Zamyatin or Huxley, if you are of an age to understand the sociopolitical issues that are behind this story. As a book, it is only of value as a diverting read for younger children, with minimal deeper meaning."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a quite possibly the best book that I have ever read, I could not put the book down. The whole concept for \\"sameness\\" is a great idea and the book is riveting. The ideas are so interesting and thoughtful that it made me appreciate what I have, choice. The rebellious Jonas was quite inspiring as he dynamically changed. From his once bored, predetermined life, he became human, showing real emotion.The story has many intellectual concepts as well. \\"Seeing beyond\\" and \\"hearing beyond\\" are some of them. Jonas's first memory as the \\"Receiver of Memories\\" is he on a sled, atop a hill, while it is snowing. Ironically that is how the book ends. Could Jonas have the mental capacity to see his future? I thought this is a very interesting concept."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Like thousands of other English classes around the country, mine has been reading The Giver. The Giver, in my opinion, is one of the most thought-provoking books of recent memory. The plot, which I won't give away as many other reviewers have, is very well crafted by Lowry. Though the book is intended for a younger audience, many adults will enjoy it as well. This book is a \\"must get\\" for any readers who truly understand and enjoy their books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Would you like to live in a \\"Perfect\\" community where every family is the same? Well in the book The Giver that's practically how it is. Jonas, the main character, lives in a community like this. Jonas is eleven and every year all the kids that are eleven turning twelve get their assignment or job at a ceremony held in December. It is time for the ceremony and Jonas will be getting his assignment and he can't wait. He doesn't know what his assignment will be, but he hopes for it to be something important and fits him well. This book is something you should really take time to read because it is interesting and enjoyable.The book The Giver is very interesting. One part of the book that shows this is when Jonas has his weird dream and his mom said it was his first stirrings. Another interesting point in the book is when Jonas is at the ceremony where he will find out what his assigment will be and it is very suspensful.This book is also enjoyable. One enjoyable part is when they share their dreams each morning from the night before. Also it was enjoyable how Jonas helped out at different places like the house of the old as volunteer work.The best age for this book is probably about ten to eighteen. This is because there are some parts and some words that younger children wouldn't understand. This book might be boring for older people but some still might enjoy it.You should really use your free time wisely and read this book The Giver because it is very interesting and also enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I realy enjoyed The Giver by Lois Lowry.

In this Utopia community every one goes to school, and work at the same time and gets home at the same time. In addition, the people have no cars. It is a wired story, the wirdist I have ever read.

In Jonas' world, there are no colors, no birds, no weather change and no emotions. A person's job is assigned to him or her at age twelve. Everything is regulated even who can give birth.Jonas' father is a Nurturer. He takes care of the babies in this world, but his job sometimes has a dark side. Jonas has a sister, Lily and a mother who works for the Department of Justice.Jonas likes to ride his bicycle, which every child receives at age seven. He also plays with his best friends a lot, Asher and Fiona. All of them are constantly wondering what future will be decided for them. They don't get to decide there own future, it is determined by people who have the job of picking careers for the twelve year olds (who are then considered adults).When Jonas turns twelve he gets the job of \\"Receiver of Memories.\\" His job is to receive all the memories from the old Receiver; the memories include stuff from our world, like seeing color, rain, animals and emotions. Jonas changes when he receives these memories and takes a giant step forward, and he starts doing stuff that he believes in.Out of five stars I give this book 3.5 stars. This book was a little confusing at times but over all I really enjoyed it. If you like science fiction I bet you will like this book even more then me.

Which is a very good thing. Having a opened mind lets you explore and imagine anything. The Giver was a great book all except the ending. The ending is like a big drop off. The ending is ambiguous and lets you think what happened insted of it telling you the real ending. I do like the fact that you get to pick your own ending you to your liking. The one thing that you need to have is a good ending or the reader wont remember the good parts only the last part which was a \\"Bad\\" ending. The sequelscame out a long time after the the first book. Those books made up for the \\"Bad\\" ending that you had read. Over all the book is Great and i would recomend it.Sencerly,The Giver Reader"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Ever wonder how the world would be without color, history, or the ability to choose? What if you no longer had the ability to feel pain? Would you take that choice if it meant you also couldn't feel love or treasure past memories?In the novel The Giver, young adult author Lois Lowry brings the reader into a whole new world. It is a world unlike anything we've ever known. In this world, everything is fixed and Jonas, the main character, is a boy who is chosen to be the receiver for the community by the \\"Elders.\\" This position in the community is a huge challenge for Jonas and the novel reveals his journey and struggle with this unique world.Each chapter unfolds an intricately woven plot that leaves you on the edge of your seat ready for the next chapter, which means I will not divulge much more of the plot. One of the most enjoyable and interesting aspects of reading this novel was the element of surprise and not knowing what lied ahead. In this case, it has been much more insightful and thought-provoking to discover the plot and themes from Lowry on my own.The book is well written and a fairly easy read. It is about grade 9 (according to my Fry Readability calculations), though students 12-13 and older should not have a big struggle to read this novel! Lowry uses her writing style to captivate your attention and clearly depict exactly what is happening at that moment. I felt like I was in the scene at times because the images were so vivid.The style and plot are intriguing, interesting, and fun, but one of the best parts about this book are the ideas that unfold behind the story. At the end of book you feel satisfied yet provoked, along with a unique mix of emotions that causes you to ponder different aspects of life you might have taken for granted.Although I think this book is a must read for everyone (though especially teens!), it is not necessarily loved by every reader. Some passages can be a little heavy to read at times or even a little strange to grasp and understand. Also, some chapters moved a little more slowly than others. But overall reading the book seemed to fly by!Whether you're a young teen or an older teen, this book is a great novel to read because of its enjoyability and uniqueness. You're never too old to read this 179 page fast and fun fantasy adventure. Though many classify this novel as Sci-fi, I think it crosses different genres of fiction and readers who don't normally read sci-fi or fantasy would also enjoy the book. At the very least it gives the reader much food for thought, and even challenges their perspectives or beliefs. Any book that inspires more thought and leaves you wanting to read more is worth reading and recommending! Published by Laurel Leaf in 1994, it's a classic that won't go out of style!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is one of the most fascinating books that I have ever had the good luck to read. My introduction to The Giver was in sixth grade and I am still enjoying it six years later. Lois Lowry writes in a way that, no matter how many times you read the story, each time you get something else out of it. She presents a strange and almost utopian land that is on one level a deeply enriching story about a boy growing up, and on another level profound with a deep philosophical slant. What is more important, an ordered controlled life free from pain and sadness, or a world with joy and happiness but also pain? Is erasing our differences with political correctness a good thing? Can there ever be a perfect society? The book does not give any answers, but like any good philosophical text, it points the way."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's \\"The Giver\\" explores a world where the passionate emotions that make humans individuals are absent from their existence. This world where Jonas lives is \\"perfect\\". There is no crime, no war, no hatred, but there is no true love. As 12-year-old Jonas learns more about emotions, he wants to escape. He realizes the utopia that he lives in is really a delusion. Murder is everywhere, yet no one realizes it. They kill those who are deemed insufficient for their community. Human thought is controlled and creativity doesn't exist. This is a must read for anyone looking for a though provoking story. Lowry does a wonderful job using her imagination to create such a world. It makes the reader really think about the individuality within the human race. Since the lives of the people are controlled, this book will make anybody thankful for their freedom.I really enjoyed reading this book and I would definitely recommend it. The book raises a lot of questions regarding diversity and individuality. It is a great book for the classroom since it brings up many topics for discussion."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am currently a college student, and this book has remained my favorite since I read it in fifth grade. I am a reading fanatic but have yet to find a better, more captivating, relevent, or touching story. Lowry has an immense ability to add subtle political commentary while handling situations with tact and delicacy. The character depth is amazing. I can't even recommend this book highly enough. I've forced all of my friends to read it, and they thank me countless times over. I showed it to my mom who now uses it as part of her fifth grade curriculum. It is the only book that every single one of her students enjoys. None of them want to stop reading. Still, my friends find the story engrossing-- it is highly developed and touching. Do yourself a favor and read this book, you won't forget it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Books may be banned but their ideas will still remain. The book The Giver is one of the most band books in schools around the country. Some people may think that it should be banned because it has situations that may seem inappropriate. An example of this is that Jonah's father killed a newborn by sticking a needle in his forehead and threw him away afterwards. Another example is that it talked about the young children washing the old, which involved nudity. One reason that people may feel that this book shouldn't be banned is because it allows you to create your own ending to the story. This makes the reader use their imagination more than they would with a book telling them what happens. Another reason others might feel it shouldn't be banned is because it shows that a censored community doesn't work out. I think that this book should not be banned because I enjoyed reading it. It had a good storyline and it kept my attention. If The Giver was banned, students wouldn't be able to read this book, and wouldn't feel the experience that I felt when reading it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It is said that censorship can only be caused by a community's lack of confidence in it self. This relates to Lois Lowry's book The Giver. People in this community are so afraid they would ban books because they believe they teach the wrong idea. Jonas's community in the book believes if youtake away books no more problems its utopia. Wrong! If you take away books it just pushes the problems aside, but they always come back. I believe that the ending to Lois Lowery's was good to keep you guessing and to make you ask, is this a community that doesn't ban books? Censorship means that you are scared or not confident in yourself. I believe that you shouldn't ban books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"To prohibit the reading of certain books because of their ideas is to assume the residents of a community to by slaves or fools, according to Claule-Adrein Helvetius. Censorship is becoming more and more rampant today (especially after that Janet Jackson case.... That was like sticking your head in a hornet's nest). Many books are being restricted from school libraries as well as personal libraries. The Giver by Lois Lowry is one such example. When I first read this book, I was about ten or eleven and did not find anything wrong with it (censorship-wise). Then we read it in 8th grade, and kids could not stop being grossed out. I feel that as far censorship, ideas should not be censored, but things like graphic violence and"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Censorship reflects a community's shortage of self-confidence. In the book The Giver written by Lois Lowry almost everything is censored in their community: the ability to see color, pick their own jobs, and read books. Also, there aren't any hills, weapons, music, fishing, birthdays, families, love, or memories. Censorship can be bad or good depending on what you are blocking. America is unlike the community in The Giver, less strict on what to block and what to allow. I would rather live in America because we can see color and we also have more rights."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver may be a little more advanced for some children but it is a very good book. The book expresses imagination and the wonder of a futuristic world. This book has been banned from many schools. It just doesn't make sense to ban such a wonderful book like that. The book makes you feel thankful that you live in the place that you live in now.Living in the place I live now has more fredome but would more safe there."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Censorship proves that the world has no assurance in its youth. Likewise, it exhibits an untrustworthy atmosphere by the elders. Screening is one person's beliefs forced upon everyone else. One book that has been banned by some school districts because of censorship is The Giver. In my opinion, I thought it was a very good book. It showed a world of sameness and what can happen when you take away the thoughts and choices of people in a community. Then the characters in the book discover the security is not the best choice. Censorship allows people to decide whether they can share their thoughts without being afraid of how the public will react. This is why censorship shows that leaders have no confidence in the rest of the community."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"THE GIVERCome up with your own opinions, and let others think what they want. This is what I think about The Giver. If you want it to be banned, then just don't read it. you don't have to ban a book just because it is bad or if you don't like it. After I had read the giver I thought it was a pretty good book, even though it had some choice language. The bad stuff was only in the beginning of the book anyway, and it wasn't that bad. This book was also kind of weird. It was weird because nobody in this town had memories, and I don't know how they can erase everyone's memory. I liked the ending because the town was back to normal and everyone had memories. That is what I have to say about censorship and The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"To reduce the press is to insult a nation is to prohibit the reading of certain books is to say the people are either fools or slaves. The book The Giver is one example of censorship because in The Giver they don't read books, so instead of books they have A Giver who collects all of those memories from the past. They have to select a new Giver to receive, since they don't read books. On the other hand, just in my opinion not having books isn't one of the best things. In some instances it would be okay but to have one person to receive all of the memories is not okay. To not read books is to not receive any knowledge. Overall the book The Giver was fun, interesting, eye catching. If I could read the book The Giver by Louis Lowrly. I probably would"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When a society believes it is right to ban a book they are showing that they have no confidence in their community. Censorship is a serious issue to be considered in a town or school. For instance, The Giver is book that many schools are considering banning or have already banned. After reading this book I found it to be a great book. I enjoyed this book because it kept the reader guessing and on the edge of his/her seat. Nevertheless, having a society of total sameness would be lame and uninteresting, with absolutely no interesting aspects about it. Having said that, I see no reason to even think about banning this book. There is no reasonable evidence for one to say this book is inappropriate for a young reader. Obviously, the school and the community authorities that wants to ban this book has no confidence, nor do they think the kids in their schools are mature enough to read this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The best way to combat bat ideas is to come up with ideas that are much better. Banning books is like locking books up in a room. Censorship of books doesn't give the book a chance or give the children a chance to learn what the book is trying to teach them or entertain them. The book The Giver by Lois Lowry was banned from many schools when actually it shouldn't have. This book has to keep you thinking and wondering to the very end. Its like you the reader get to choose what happens at the end. In the Givers society there is censorship because they are banning books, etc. so everybody is the same. They have NO options. Here today in our society there is censorship because they are banning books such as the Giver because they are trying to control what we read. Censorship of books shouldn't be allowed in schools."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverJonas lives in a so-called perfect world. Everyone believes this because they don't know any better.

To me this was not a issue. I found more important issues in the story. I found that this book gave me strength and that the world I live in is better then I thought.I would definitely recommend this book for children 10 years old and up.

In each family unit there is a mother, a father, a brother and a sister. When each citizen turns twelve they are assigned a job in the community, Jonas was chosen to de the Receiver. He would receive memories of happiness and colours. When Jonas sees that the real world is full of sadness, fear ,and pain he is scared. After a while Jonas escapes the community to find the real world. The author leaves you hanging to choose what happens to Jonas and the baby Gabe.I like the idea of a perfect world, but in some cases this isn't even a perfect world. Differences cause conflicts but complete sameness is not good. I think this is a great book to read in school, it shows twelve year old that they don't have to be perfect and now maybe more than ever they have to realize that.I give this*****(% stars)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book,\\"The Giver,\\" by Lois Lowry, is about a twelve-year old boy named Jonas. It is based on utopia and sameness. He lives in a community which is completely different from our society today. Everything the people do in the community is planned and discussed. In this world there is no anxiety, terror, pain nor war. In this book, there is a December ceremony which is something like a birthday in our world. At the ceremony people who are twelve get their assignments or tasks. Jonas is selected to be the \\" Receiver of memory\\" which is a powerful task in this community. The old receiver becomes The Giver and transmits memories from the past to Jonas. After revealing memories of joy, death, colour and love, Jonas discovers that his world is totally controlled by the Chief Elders. After finding out about his community, Jonas assembles a plan to escape. He takes his best friend or so-called brother Gabriel with him. By escaping from this world he's letting out memories that the people of this world have never experienced before.I think the end of the book put my class in awe because they didn't know whether Jonas and Gabriel died or survived.I thought this book was very fascinating and amusing. The way the author has written this book makes you want to read on further and further looking for another adventure. I think Lois Lowry wrote this book for children who entrust the future because she wanted to warn us what a perfect utopian world would be like.I think she wrote this book because she wanted the reader to use their imagination and intellect. In this novel, I think that the author presents us with a powerful thought of what the future may stand as and how marvelous our lives are. I would recommend this book to all readers who like both exhilarating and mournful books. I gave this book four stars because it was a terrific book. I thought Jonas was very brave when he crossed the bridge not even knowing where Elsewhere was. At the end of the book, I almost had tears in my eyes because it was so depressing. I found this book some-what confusing but all in all I thought this book was an exceptional read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, written by Lois Lowry, is not only a strange but an interesting novel.It is based on the theme on Utopia. To Jonas' world it is Utopia, but to us there are many flaws. One is \\"Release\\". Why should a utopian world want to kill because two people look alike or they are handicapped? Everything is planned out for everyone, which means no choices and no freedom. When Jonas is selected to be the \\"Receiver of Memory\\", the holder of the past, he realizes that the world he is living in is not perfect after all. Even though the past held pain and sorrow, there is unforgettable love to even it out. So Jonas decides to run away with Gabe for a better, more exciting life in \\"Elsewhre\\". On his way there, Jonas begins to see the beauty in life. The life that we are living in now. Lois Lowry is trying to convey an important message through this novel. You don't need to be perfect to succeed. In fact, being perfect is not a good thing. This is a very well written and unique novel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" was an excellent book! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I couldn't put it down! It was like I was addicted to it!I was always reading!The book taught me a lot about how we live. It taught me about how important love, pain and especially feelings are. Withoutthese things, we wouldn't be the people we are today. We need feelings to shape us into the people we are going to be. If you gothrough life without people loving you and sharing good and badtimes with you, your life is basically incomplete!Some people like teachers and parents, think that other kids shouldn't read this book because it sets bad examples and deals with serious, mature issues. One thing in the book that they might think is not appropriate is when the young girl injects a needle into her skin to kill herself. People think that this book shows that it is okay to end things when times get tough. They are wrong because the people in the book don't know what they are doing. They don't know death is.Overall, this is an exceptional book. I would have to say it is very rare that kids are interested in books they read in school and out, so I know this has to be a good book. This is a must-read book!Written By:Jordan Hobbs"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I love science-fiction books. This topic is one that I have never thought about... a perfect world. Life in the community is so orderly and planned out. It is too beyond belief to even begin to comprehend. You can predict what will happen each day. How incredibly boring! In the beginning of the book, it seemed that there was nothing that could be better about this community. Every one was caring, no one was hurt. But after Jonas learns what \\"release\\" REALLY is, he realizes that adults do lie. In fact, it is hard to distinguish a lie from the truth, unless you know first hand that the information is incorrect. When I found out that \\"release\\" is just a nice term for killing (just as \\"putting an animal to sleep\\" is to killing the animal) I learned that this wasn't a perfect world. It is a lieing and cheating world which puts on a crocodile smile to make everything seem as though it were perfect, when in fact, this community is far from it. Everyone is in hiding without the memories, but now that Jonas can release them to the community, they won't have to hide anymore. They can learn instead of following orders.I think that the end is very abrupt, though, and I would like to see a sequel, and find out what has happened to the community and Jonas and Gabriel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I like this book... and all of ideas are exciting to me."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas is the twelve-year-old protagonist of this novel.

When he meets The Giver, who gives him these memories of pain, love and the ability to see colours, his life changes.The journey to the realization that this system is not the right way to achieve peace and silence, is suspense-packed. At first,the daily life of the members of the community is described so lively that you think it is almost real. Every detail that the author mentions helps to create the apparent harmony and this \\"clean\\" atmosphere.When Jonas realizes that there must be a change, the dark secrets of the system come out and the action is rising. The suspense is even growing untill the end, which is open(I dislike this!).You can describe the developpment as a chain reaction- everything Jonas believed in becomes a lie.I think, that Lois Lowry has created a world like this to show us that our life- with all its positive and negative sides- is better than living in an utopia without the thing that made us human-beings human-beings: Humanity"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I found that The Giver quite amusing. The Giver is about a community not an ordinary community this community is so called perfect. This book is about a kid named Jonas.(Every year they have an assembly and all of the people(s) birthdays are all on the same day.)This last assembly Jonas received a job Jonas had been selected.Jonas is a very important person in this book. I really liked the book except for the end because it really stumped me did he die ?, or did he live?

What I'm trying to say is that this no ordinary book, this book is about a 12- year old boy that lives in a society that has no flaws,feelings or love and is perfect, but the people don't know that it has many flaws in it the people don't know there are flaws because their feelings where washed away fro m their memories so it becomes a perfect society. Jonas, is chosen to become the Receiver of Memory and has to keep all the good and bad memories which are given to him from the giver from the people so it become a perfect community.This book might have to do with a death but it becomes a cool mystery as it goes to the end, so if you like mystery books I guarantee you the you will like this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is about a young boy named Jonas who lives in a perfect organized world. In this world everyone is assigned a role. When Jonas was twelve he received the highest honor in the community, the job he was assigned to was \\"Receiver of Memory\\". Jonas's new job description was that he would bare the memories of the town and the world before the community was formed in order to protect the people. He has a specific ability to see color and that is how he was chosen for the job. Jonas meets with the old receiver, now called \\"The Giver\\", everyday in order for him to give him all the memories good and bad. After receiving most of the memories Jonas began to feel a great burden and understand the truth about this utopian society. Jonas knew the injustice and horror that occurred in order to keep the society in this \\"perfect\\" condition. Jonas believed that the memories he was receiving should belong to the people. He and the Giver think up a plan that will ensure Jonas's escape from the community and the return of all the memories. With his leaving the community the memories the Giver had given him would be released into the minds of all the residents of the community. It was the only way to change the communities understanding.I loved Lois Lowry's imagination in creating this story. She allows everyone when reading this book to examine their own values on controversial issues in their own society and indirectly challenges them to change the issues.I loved this book for its brilliant story. I really do feel that you get something different from it whenever you read it. I read this book in sixth or seventh grade and I did not get as much out of it as I did now. I loved following Jonas through the story. You could so easily imagine the society due to the very elaborate descriptions Lowry gave.

It could just as easily be a fundamentalist community of any religious stripe, or one of any ideologically-mandated group. Let's not forget that we have plenty of people right here in America who are convinced they know what's best for everyone, and who believe we should all be forced to live according to their beliefs; quite often they're the ones waving a flag and/or a cross most vehemently. In fact, there's one more book that readers of \\"The Giver\\" should consult: Sinclair Lewis' pre-WWII novel of Fascism coming to America, \\"It Can't Happen Here.\\" Because as \\"The Giver\\" warns us, it can happen anywhere.Including Here."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is science fiction.The main character would be a 12 yearold named Jonas.This is a community that everything is planned for them: their jobs, their clothing, everything!This community wants no mistakes.

This is their life work and it is chosen for them. Jonas is chosen to be the next Receiver, and he soon learns that the Receiver holds all the memories of the world so the members of the community do not have to experience anything other than the perfect life of the community.

Being released was always a mystery to Jonas, and when he discovers the truth, he discovers he also has the power to make a choice."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"First, in order to enjoy Lois Lowry's \\"The Giver,\\" you must understand, even if vaguely, the world in which the novel takes place; it is still Earth, but its society is utterly strange--despite the fact that this world is pain-free, no poverty, no illness. This is one of the novel's best qualities: it allows us to see how odd a world with no hardship is, compared to our society.In \\"The Giver,\\" Lowry follows Jonas, yet another citizen in this utopian society; here, your entire life, your entire future is planned for you...imagine the strictest yet most peaceful communist, totalitarian government (an oxymoron), combined with Orwell's \\"1984.\\" Speakers and monitors surround everyone's living center, so \\"they\\" can observe whenever the citizens mandatorily discuss their dreams. There is no such thing as birthparents; when you're born (or rather given birth by \\"birthmothers,\\" which is an official profession) you are assigned to a family. There are not even any cars, everyone rides bicycles.Jonas' birthday is coming up. Every citizen has the same birthday, and everyone is given a designated gift on each birthday; for instance, when everyone is seven, they get a bike; and when they turn twelve, they are given their job...for life. Jonas is estranged from his friends when he is given the job of Receiver of Memories.He is tutored by the town's current Receiver, a weak old man only known to us as the Giver. In this experience, Jonas is given a gift that no one else in this society has--the gift of knowing freedom, true freedom. The gift to heal and cope with pain (something Jonas was alienated to), the gift of knowing family, the gift of seeing the world...as it should be.With this newfound knowledge, Jonas' desire to leave and to find a place where humanism exists, to save someone from this society, continues to haunt him.\\"The Giver\\" is another one of Lois Lowry's crowning acheivements, winner of the 1994 Newberry Medal. This book is not to be looked over and placed into the shelf with no further attention; \\"The Giver\\" is brilliant, and is not only to be read, but to be deciphered."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book when i was in 5th grade.

Jonas decides that he wants to be free of the community and go to the \\"elsewhere\\". He steals the child that his family was caring for and escapes. He does this without preperation bacause the child was scheduled for release, to be killed, the following day. This almost cost them their lives.

It is time for the ceremony and Jonas will be getting his assignment and he can't wait. He doesn't know what his assignment will be, but he hopes for it to be something important and fits him well. This book is something you should really take time to read because it is interesting and enjoyable.The book The Giver is very interesting. One part of the book that shows this is when Jonas has his weird dream and his mom said it was his first stirrings. Another interesting point in the book is when Jonas is at the ceremony where he will find out what his assigment will be and it is very suspensful.This book is also enjoyable. One enjoyable part is when they share their dreams each morning from the night before. Also it was enjoyable how Jonas helped out at different places like the house of the old as volunteer work.The best age for this book is probably about ten to eighteen.

He must receive these from the Giver of memories and not share them with anyone. Everyone in this no-feeling world is being protected from these memories. Only the Giver and receiver can bear them. This book will really make you think. About life. About love. About sadness. About joy. About how we are lucky to have all these things."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is the best book ever! My English teacher was doing a sci-fi unit and to finish it up, we read The Giver. At first I was like ugh! I hate science fiction books, but then one day I had to stay home from school because I felt aweful. We were reading chapter 3 in class that day, so I decided it would be a good idea to read it. But after chapter 3, I went on to chapter 4, then 5, and then I couldn't stop. I read the whole book in 2 hours. If I were you, I would buy this book asap!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book in 4th grade. Now I am a 7th grader and have read it every year since then. This book reveals the imperfections of a \\"perfect society\\" (as it is revealed in Gathering Blue), and the concept of this book provokes thought and reflection. It's on a reading level that is not difficult and can be read in a day or more. This book is definitely one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Read it as a child and it was my favorite book, re-read it as an adult and I like it even more."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book moved me a lot when my teacher read it in class. I was always eager to hear what happened next. I was so eager that I got my mom to buy the book so that I could read it before the teacher finished. I've probably read it about 3 times since then and it's still not old.I would recommend it to those who would like to hear probable and interesting ideas about the future. (I love Ender's Game.)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is really interesting. It shows how sometimes that life isn't what some people really image on how it's going to be. To me, the position that he is in isn't something that I could see myself in but maybe it could happen, because you never really know."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In the book, a boy named Jonas becomes the Receiver for his town when he turns twelve and finds out the truth from The Giver. The story takes place in a community that is not normal. Everything is in order and everything is under control. The people have no worries and cares. Everyone is equal and everyday is the same. Each member in Community is assigned a position. When Jonas turns 12, the Community selects him to be the new receiver of memories. Only The Giver knows the truth and memories of the past, and now he must pass these memories on to Jonas. When he finds out the truth that how his father releases babies, it makes Jonas hate his family because his dad kills innocent babies by injecting poison into them. This point of change made him run away from his home, where the story ends questioning what would happen next. I really enjoyed reading this book because it was a wonderful adventurous book. And if you enjoy reading adventurous book, you definitely have to try this one."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is really good. I read it in 2 hours. I'm in fourth grade and I read it, and I would recomend it for ages 10 and above. This book is really cool, and I like imagining me as the main character, Jonas. While you read it your mind escapes complely, you become a part of Jonas and Fiona and Lily. You gradualy become to know the charecters like old friends and love hearing about them. This book is awsome!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I would recomend this book to others because it is a very good book and so interesting, it's a very well written non-fictional book. I really enjoyed it and I think that the people that had read it would agree with me.The reason that I like this book so much is because it's exciting and sad and all these emotions all in one. I wouldn't consider this book a boaring book, I would consider it the kind of book that you can't stop reading."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I would only recomend this book to a person who would like to take adventure and want to learn new things. The book is very adventoures and different. I enjoyed the book personally because it brought to me new feelings I didn't know I had.It brought color to my soul and definitly made me think I took everything for granteed.To live in a community so isolated would make me want to realy run away and not want to come back.I know I don't share the same feelings as Jonas does ,but I think now I know how Jonas had felt."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book has the feeling to get into your mind of what it is mlike to die, what you feel when someone dies.

I think you can only read this book if you know how to understand it.Unless theres another part to this story then there was no point of writing most of this.So this is my review of the Giver! I hope you like the story if you evre get a chance to read.Wich you should!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I would recemend this book because it explains alot about the culture and different events and activitys.Its is a wonderful and meaningful book that people should read because it explains alot about different things like secrets an memorys and that lying isnt the answer to everything."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Choices. Change. Love. Pain. Sensuality, growing up, becoming an individual, being DIFFERENT. Lies, overprotection, and even murder. Now tell me, how could such a book not be completely enjoyed?! The first time I read it, a couple years ago, I didn't comprehend the REAL meaning of this book...(or should I say several meanings?) To put it simply, I just didn't get it--especially the ending. At first I thought it was completely stupid..I mean, THERE IS NO REAL ENDING! How in the world are we supposed to enjoy that, Lois Lowry!?Hahaha.. what was I thinking? Now I take that all back. Upon reading this book again and actually analyzing it in my Language Arts class, I got a MUCH deeper meaning. The dying elephant memory that Jonas recieved could represent the MEMORIES, which are dying. (what do elephants have? a GOOD MEMORY.) I NEVER would have come to that conclusion until we had a class discussion...I've discussed this book with several of my friends and we all love this book. It covers all the topics we have/will come across in this world--in the past, present, and most likely the future. Perhaps Jonas may have traveled in a large circle back to his own community where the memories were released and things were back to normal with both love AND pain...Perhaps the music he heard was the Giver finally joining his beloved Rosemary. Who knows? This is a great book which made ME certainly think: would I rather live a life with color, music, love, pain, war,and hatred... or one without? The answer can only be up to you, along with the ending, which is one of the several reasons I have debated, reviewed, and loved THE GIVER."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book, The Giver, is a pretty ok book I guess. In some parts you get confused because Lois Lowry didnt really explain it that well. In some chapters it made me want to think ahead of what was going to happen next. In the beginning the book was pretty boring. However it was ok later on.This book makes you think of your own pictures in your head. Some things in the book shocked me like Jonas recieved memories and the punishment Babies and the Old's got.This book has very good vocabulary words, that some of them you have to look up while your reading ( unless you know the word) i recomened this book for kids starting from the age 12. Even so in that age, you will get confused a little. Lowry says something doesnt exist like war and the weapons, but later on it says that Asher and other friends were playing with imaginary \\"WEAPONS\\".

I have read and re-read it many times, and loved it every time.The book also forces you to think about things that most people don't think about that much, and to re-analzye certain common philosophical assumptions.I think that everyone should read this book at least once in their life.The biggest problem that I had with this book is the rather unsatisfactory ending; the story's resolution is suggested, but nothing is stated. Personally, I would have liked the story to have continued a little longer so as to find out what had happened later."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver tells the reader the story of Jonas, who lives in a community, which seems to be a perfect world by having very strict rules.

It was very different, but it just wasn't for me.I would recommend this book to people who just like to read wierd books!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is on my listmainia list of dystopias, because it does show a society gone in a different, and unpleasant, direction. It stands out on that list because, unlike other dystopias, this one requires a few elements borrowed from fantasy literature to make possible the relationship between the Giver and the Receiver.Perhaps if that had been worked differently, this would have gone from four to five stars.As a dystopia, this is one of the rare \\"female\\" dystopias. A male dystopia shows how each person plugs into the society and how it impacts the family. A female dystopia concentrates more on the family relationships and how they support society. The two are similar but not the same. This makes a good read for the reason of a refreshing perspective.Even though this is considered \\"adolescent literature\\", it was well written enough for an adult to enjoy. That's also quite a good thing, so parents can share this with their children."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is well written. Each chapter makes to reader want to see what is going to unfold next. The words the author uses will help build young peoples' vocabulary. The way Jonas makes sure that every word he uses to express his feelings or emotions have to be an accurate desription. The story line will appeal to any twelve year old because of the anxiety they are feeling at that age. The characters are believable. The Jonas's world is a serious place to live everyone must conform to the rules. The story is built around the responsibilities of turning twelve. The Giver teaches Jonas his responsiblities are the communty's new Reciever and it opens his eyes to a whole new way of life. I only have one caution for parents. Parents should read this book first because it has a shocking way of dealing with people when they are no longer useful or cannot conform to the communites way of life. I recommend the book for mature pre-teens to young adults."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Will BowlingWhen it comes to censorship, I think you can think about what you want to think about, and let other people think about what they want. After reading the book The Giver, thought it was an okay book. I don't really like to read so I don't read books unless I have to. The Giver is a weird book. I don't know why you would have a community with no color or memory or anything like that. It's just stupid. The Giver is a good book, I guess, if you can understand it, I thought it was very confusing because the whole town is colorblind except for a couple of people. And they can't have memory or experience pain. I got confused on that part. Only The Giver and the receiver of memories can see color. But at the end they get back to their community and everybody can see color and they are all having fun."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is one of the best books I have ever read. The Giver is about a boy named Jonas, and his family. It is about how he is going to become the nexted Receiver of Memory the person that helps him become this is the Giver. This is the most honored position in the community. Through his \\"training\\" he starts to experience colors, history (memories from the past), animals, various feelings etc ;through this he is experience pain, hurt, and awful memories from the past that the Giver is giving him. And then some things happened...but i am not going to tell you.In the Giver, the community is not like the one today. In the Giver, the community cannot choose what kind of job they want, the master chooses. When a child is born the mom does not have it, a women does it for them. Then the Master gets to choose the name. So I guess you can say they are as one. They are not different from one another, meaning they all have the same house, most of them have to same personality.I can see why this book can be banned, but I do not think that this book should be banned. This is because the Giver shows a likely lesson. When you want to act like someone because they are popular, think for one second do you really want to be? The book shows that when you act as one you are not experiencing \\"your life\\". Do you want someone control you, tell you what memories you can have, tell you what you can do? When you are in a \\"group\\" and they tell you what you can wear that day, have a list for who can sit at their table, tell you what your nickname is, do you really want to be in their group? I think that every kid should read this book, and next time a person say to me this is your nickname, I will go back to the Giver, and say no thanks I can make up my own."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lowry does a good job of keeping you interested in this book.

I reread it a few years ago. I think I realized something very important to the book: Jonas, Gabe, and the Giver die. I thought this because jonas reverted to his favorite memory as he died, and since Gabe was with him, he died as well. When it spoke of Jonas faintly hearing music comeng from where he had been (the community), I think it meant that the Giver had died as well and that meant that Jonas also got to receive the memory of music.This sad ending made me think. For me, the book did not end there, it was merely a beginning."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Most people want to live in a perfect world.

So, open your mind, and open this book! :-)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"&quot;The Giver,&quot; by Lois Lowry, is a novel about a perfect world that would never exist. The community in which these characters live in is surreal. Their lifestyle is based on what they are told to be and how they are told to live. This book has many themes and meanings. A particular theme is the study of folklore and cultures of different people. In this novel, Jonas is the main character. He is a twelve year old boy who will be turning thirteen in a short time. He is excited about this fact, because in his community, when you reach a certain age, you are given a job that you have to perform for the rest of your life. When it is time for the ceremony, and the children are all given their job assignments, Jonas believes that he had been forgotten about. Surprisingly, he was told that his job assignment would be that of the Giver. Jonas was to go into training immediately. The Givers' job was to receive the memories of all the people in the community. All the love, pain, hate, anger, happiness, worry, frustration, war, hunger, and every other emotion possible, would be in the hands of Jonas. After some training, and Jonas' witnessing of his father murdering an infant, Jonas decided that it is too much for him and he decides to go &quot;Elsewhere.&quot; This decision would be a very dangerous one, because no one was allowed to leave the community. Jonas does it anyway, and wonders what is waiting for him beyond his own community. The Giver is an appropriate book for the study of folklore because it shows how memories are supposed to be passed from one generation to another, for a person to truly understand who they are and where they are coming from. The Giver shows us that for a community to survived and live normally there has to be a balance of emotions and no one person should be able to hold all these emotions and not pass them one. Although our world and communities are not perfect, it is more important that we know who we are, and we be able to love and hate and feel whatever emotion we choose, than to live in a perfect world filled with no emotion."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Louis Lowry was an exceptional novel about the true nature of a utopian society. The society that the main character, 12-year-old Jonas, lives in is completely devoid of the emotions and pleasures of life in order to shield them from the bad points. However when Jonas is selected to receive all of the memories of the \\"old\\" world, his safe life is thrown into turmoil. Through this child's eyes, Lowry poses the question as to whether this utopia is actually superior to society today. Yes, there is no pain, war, hunger, ect., but in order to cause this \\"sameness\\" the people are forced to live in a world as if sedated, devoid of strong emotions, and ultimately the freedom of choice.Lowry attempts to answer her own question in the denouement of the novel, which although in a minority, I thought was an appropriate way to end. Since it does not supply a definite answer, she allows the reader to draw their own conclusions. It would have seemed trite to me if there were a simplistic end to the novel, since the ideal of a utopia is such a complex concept."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"THE GIVER is a good study of folklore and transcendentalism or the philosophy of the perfect world. It shows how it could or couldn't work, depending on the reader's point of view and how it changes the human being. It is most definitely worthy of its awards and is a good and easy read. It's not difficult to understand and yet provides a deeper meaning for anyone willing to look for it. Definitely 4 stars possibly 5."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Reading The Giver was a very interesting to me. At first,the thought of living in such a world of perfectness and simplicity was amazing. No worries, no tears, no broken promises, no hate, no pain. Wow, amazing. But then it seemed to be unbalanced because there was no love, no pleasure, no happiness. This is when the story gets confusing and emotions start to rise. Jonas was the main character in the story. He was to be the next upcoming Giver. This seemed to be an exciting job for Jonas. then the training began. Jonas was to be accepting the responsibility of feelings and emotions. Pain, hate, love, anger, sadness, happiness, war, joy and the ability to see colors and lie. This was all new to Jonas. He couldn't fathom how he would accept and carry the responsibility to bear all of these emotions. An incident occurs in which he sees his father murder a baby. This was apparently too much for Jonas to handle. He decides to run away from his community. This was a very dangerous decision for Jonas to make because it was illegal. There were some night watches looking out. Jonas didn't care and decided to go &quot;Elsewhere&quot;. Jonas shows bravery in his choice to leave his community which he realizes is filled with imperfection and ignorance."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Many people believe their community is perfect... but is it?

I'll stop here, but if you find this book READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Before and as I read The Giver, I heard constant compliments and praise on how it is such a fantastic book. I too agree with most peoples' opinion, for I found it a very well written book along with very interesting; however, I felt the ending to be unsatisfying. Obviously, the conclusion is meant to be hanging, allowing the reader to use their imagination to predict what could have happened, but it didn't seem to fit the rest of the book. As I read the book, I enjoyed the great details and could even picture everything as it happened, and to have an ending as it did, I was surprised. The book shows a glimpse into a world with no memories. Supposedly this is a \`utopia.' But again, I question this. Jonas and everyone else live in a world of no memories, knowing nothing of the past, with the exception of Jonas and the giver. With no memories of the past, the pain and the bad, along with all the good, what leaves them to learn from their mistakes. Being in a world with no memories to learn from, the world would be chaotic, constantly making the same mistakes over and over again."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a future civilization with his two parents and sister, Lily. Everything is perfect and everything is the same every day. When Jonas becomes a twelve-year-old and gets assigned to his new job, his job is not a regular job -- it is a special assignment. He becomes the Receiver, a painful but important job. He must receive the memories of past times, good and bad. His leader, The Giver, has the job of giving the memories to Jonas.The author has a way that makes you excited and tense by changing everything in the story until it makes sense. It is unpredictable. It is a mix of confusion, adventure, and a little bit of sadness."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The idea behind The Giver is clearly a unique perspective on things. It is the type of book where, you are placed in the middle of a totally different area, and you are left to figure out how it works. Gradually, you learn more and more, and things you thought were obviously true, weren't. However, there are some things in this book that are unacceptable. For instance, this society is very complex, and yet, there was still only one active plot throughout the entire book. There was not a single scene that did not contain the main character. This book has the potential to be alot more entertaining to read, if it were to have more subplots. Also, the book is very simply written when it comes to the grammar and choice of vocabulary, thus, you do not have to be &quot;mature&quot; to understand this book at all."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a pastiche of other books and stories, highly derivative in most ways but overall a worthy contribution to the dystopian genre. It's a good starter book on the subject. It is instructive, as all dystopian books are, to warn the reader of the results of a totalitarian mindset, of the end result of Plato's Republic.Totalitarianism can take several forms -- today it exists chiefly in communism (e.g., Cuba), cult of personality (e.g., North Korea) and religious fanaticism (e.g., Iran; Saudi Arabia) -- but the basis is always the insatiable impulse of need to control others.*Books from which The Giver freely borrows its plot and theme are:Brave New World - manipulation of the very young to determine life course; use of drugs to control behaviorWe - the existence and structure of the totalitarian community1984 - monitoring and control of the community; systemic and systematic lies to maintain controlCatcher in the Rye - perception by the adolescent that adult life is filled with phoniness and liesThe Lottery - near-random determination by the community of who should live and who should dieThe Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas - the rejection of unjust sufferingAnthem - flight by those who reject totalitarianismJonathan Livingston Seagull - perception of being different, and rejection of the group* Due to the constitutional structure and culture of liberty of the United States, the most that the totalitarian impulse has done so far is impose punitive taxes and heavy-handed regulations, and demonize non-conformity (i.e., political correctness)."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It would be odd wouldn't it to live in a world where everything was worked out for us? Sure, it would have its benefits, there'd be no tough choices to make, there'd be peace all the time, and hey, maybe it's a great idea and we are on our way already. Jonas, an eleven year old, lives in such a place. He lives with his parents who were picked out for him and so does his little sister. They live practical lives and never insult or attempt on purpose to say anything thoughtless. When kids get to be Twelves, their occupations are chosen and they are set to obtain appropriate training such as caring for the elderly who live in a special building and live their remaining days in comfort until they are 'released.' Even babies are raised in special nurseries where people are assigned to work and care for kids until they are old enough to go to a family unit. Things change for Jonas when he is assigned the job to take in the Giver's memories. These are memories of snowflakes and colors, and with them pain and war and suffering. The memories of the world remain hidden from the town so they can live in relative comfort, but Jonahs learns the cost of living such an easy, unfulfilled life.This is a wonderful read for a change of perspective. Lois Lowry creates a simple and complex world in one tiny short story that will have readers unable to put down until they find out how it all will end."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I just want to warn anyone who has yet to read this book NOT to read the review by Jedidiah Palosaari which is listed as the third review at the time of this writing (until after you've read the book). Although I think it's a well written review, it contains a spoiler! Now, for my comments... This story is provocative for sure. I read it out loud to my kids even though they're really old enough to read it for themselves. The images are vivid, and the author Lois Lowry does not shy away from the spectrum of human possibility, the good, the bad, the ugly. Lowry stirs up all kinds of moral and ethical questions in this book. There are some children's books that I love reading to my kids because they are great for the kids. This one is great even into adulthood. If you haven't read it yet, I highly recommend it. It is brilliant and, as others have noted, a classic. If you're a parent, this is a good family read (more older kids or screen it first) for opening lots of discussion and an opportunity to teach what you value.Laya Saul, author of the teen self help book \\"You Don't Have to Learn Everything the Hard Way\\""},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is absolutely sensational. There really is no other way to describe it. The specificity of the details that the author includes are astounding. It's really one of the best books I've ever read. It's entertaining, an inspirational story, and great for kids. Without a doubt, Five stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Some of the characteristics of good literature that were not present in this novel are believable characters, relation to my life, and most of all a surprise ending. This text is considered under par based on the absences of these three traits. First. the characters are so different from people in this time, that they are not believable to me. Also, this story does not at all relate to my life because I do not live that way, and I have no idea what living in a Socialist type of government would be like. Finally, there is no ending that is unexpected at all. \\"Downward, downward. Faster and faster. Suddenly he was aware with certainty and joy that down below that they were waiting for him; and they were waiting for the baby.\\" It closes with Jonas sliding down the familiar hill from the memory he had received. It's very subtle, and not very exciting or surprising at all. It doesn't answer any questions, doesn't provide the reader with any closure, and it was written this way because the author ran out of ideas. This is not very good literature because the characters are not believable, there is no relation to people in this time, and the ending is atrocious.And it's worse than the remake of Poseidon Adventure."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My 13 yr old son read this book he really liked it. He told me all about the book. It really made him realize that we live in a world where you can still pretty much make your own decision. He says it was easy to read and was interested in finding out what was happening on the next page. I think if it was able to keep my 13 year old intereseted it's got to be \\"good reading\\"."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a book of epic creativity. Lowry offers an indepth look into a society unlike any ever imagined before. Jonas, the protagonist, is a young boy in a colorless (literally!) world who is selected to become \\"The Receiver,\\" or the person who receives the memories of the entire human race. From birth to death, war to peace, animals to gods, et cetera, all is made aware to young Jonas through his mentor, \\"The Giver.\\" Once receiving these memories his world is flipped upside down, and you would have to read it to truly enjoy it's astonishing events!Overall, I would highly recommend buying this book. Whether it be for yourself, your child, or your younger brother, I am sure anyone would appreciate the quest that Jonas has to endure in this classic piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Wouldn't it be wonderful to live in a world without pain, divorce, unemployment, or sickness; a world where emotions are eradicated simply by taking a pill and where scientists have decided that a black and white world lacking color would be more orderly? A world where every child is told what his future in society will be on his twelfth birthday. A world where the old are sent to their assigned deaths after a farewell party? A world where flawed infants are simply discarded as though they were trash. A world that follows a schedule, a world lacking in surprises, a world of orderliness and structure where nothing unplanned for exists and where everything is controlled by a pill; in other words, a sterile world. This is a world of perfection, isn't it? Jonas believes that it is so until the day of his twelfth birthday arrives and he is told that his place in society is to be the receiver of memories, a job that only one special person is chosen for. Jonas is soon introduced to the giver, the only man left that has any remembrance of what the real world was like when their was color and pain. Now the memories must be passed on to Jonas, so that they may be kept and held where the rest of society need not be troubled with them, after all why would they want to be burdened with the memories of a time that was not \\"perfect\\". As time progresses Jonas continues to learn from the giver and he begins to long for a world that he never knew, a foreign world with pain and sorrow, love and joy. He soon comes to the conclusion that a world devoid of evil is a world devoid of good. The wheat cannot be separated from the chaff. To remove one will destroy the other. How can he impart this idea to the others in his family and in his community? How can he show them the beauty and the horror that exists now only in memories. Can he alone redeem his wayward world?A magnificent novel that causes the reader to think and draw definitive conclusions. The writing and character development were very well done and the story entertaining and thought provoking. The only detrimental aspect of the novel was the vague ending. After many years I still do not understand what actually occurred in the conclusion. Therefore, this book may be viewed as unfinished. However, the reader may simply wish to put their own conclusion on the end of the story. In summarization, I would recommend this book to children and adults alike; it is something that everyone should read. And, most importantly, my cat approves of this novel and enjoys sleeping on top of this book while I am trying to read it; tis alone makes it worthy.Ravenova"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought that this book was wonderful; it is one of my favorites. I thought that the detail Lois Lowry used was excellent in showing Jonas' thoughts and feelings as he slowly learns the truth about his world and his life. The end leaves you hanging somewhat, yet at the same time feeling fulfilled. It made me feel sadness, happiness, pity, and anger all at once. It also has an ominous undercurrent, making you wonder &quot;What if? What if this will happen?&quot; It's exciting, funny, sad, scary...in other words, it's everything that such a story should be!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought this book was great. I didn't get it at all the first time I read it. After a couple times, though, I really understood it. It really made me grateful for the little things.

He lives in a place where there is no crime and everybody is colorblind. They have ceremonies at the age of 12, where all children receive jobs. Jonas gets the job of receiver. He gets to receive memories from the old receiver known to Jonas as &quot;The Giver.&quot; Then everything goes wrong. He gets to see how people are &quot;dismissed&quot; from the community, and he finds out his dad is a murderer. I liked this book because Jonas finds out how his life is about to change. The memories he receives, both good and bad, help him through his journey. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think that you will like THE GIVER. It about a kid name Jonas he live in a would were there is no violence and Jonas see things that know one can see on lee THE GIVER can see the thing he see. When you turn 12 years old you get jobs.

The story is about a boy and the world is perfect no pain, no fear, no emotion . Jonah gets the job as Giver and they give him the memories of the past of the real world but when he gets emotions he feel sorry for a baby who they are going to kill. My favorite part is the end when he dies going down a snow hill dreaming there is a warm house ."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Dear Louis Lowry:I had just finished reading your book The Giver. It was a very astonishing book I have read. I like the background community you have built for the kid in. It&iexcl;s so imaginary and adventurous, where you need to think about it before you imagine it. I think the story was spectacular and makes you think if there is really a world in another dimension like that. I think that the story resembles about a creator and his people, but then in the story it&iexcl;s all perfect like nothing can go wrong and the weather is perfect at all the time. It is a predictable society, like people know what&iexcl;s going to happen next in the future. I like the idea you used like where the boy named Jonas has to help fix the society to make it imperfect cause people make mistakes and no one is perfect. It was like Jonas was the chosen one like in the matrix where Morphous had to look for the chosen one which was Neo. Jonas receives memories of both suffering and joy. In doing so, Jonas also learns that his community does not truly experience real joy or real pain. Jonas and the Giver are the only people who are able to see in color, and the only ones who can feel love. When Jonas learns that the community actually murders those who fail to conform to its rules, he resolves to change things. He and the Giver concoct a plan of escape for Jonas. Because there is no one who is old enough to take Jonas's place, the community will then be forced to bear the burden of the world's memories. As I come to the end I find the book very interesting. I recommend this book to everyone, and people who like to imagine a lot and go beyond their imagination. I am very inspired by your literacy. Also I hope to be able to read other book by you. Your talent is very extraordinary, and I am pleased that I was able to read a book such as The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"the giver is a book that I didentunder stand alote of the words I wodent give this book to some one under 10 years of ageor a new reader .PS. have a dictionary on hand."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought that this book was a great but it was kind of confusing.

I recommend it for anyone but expecially adolescents."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I remember this book very well from when I read it as a child. I advise parents looking for a book for their child to get this one if they are looking for an intellectual, thought-provoking, and captivating story. I recommend that a parent read the book first in order to be able to help your child understand it when they come to you with questions. The book may seem like a pleasant fiction book, but it has much deeper meaning about society. The book is set in a Utopian society (you may need to explain this to your child) where people live orderly and monotonous lives, until one boy is chosen for a special career of being the keeper of memories that existed before the society was created and he learns all that he was missing in life by being &quot;perfect&quot;.

That any person believes that a book this affecting should be banned is reflective of the very problems in society that Lowry tries so hard to illuminate in this novel. If this is what she does, then we need more of this.As someone who had the privilege to study Huxley's novel in-depth both in high school and college, however, this reads as nothing more than a gloss to a much greater work. The character of Jonas may be sort-of likeable, and the author's intentions may be admirable, but I can say nothing better about this book. She tries. She tries so hard. But even in the novel's most unsettling scene (spoiler) -- that of infanticide -- she fails to generate the kind of pathos inspired by even the dullest moment in Brave New World.I read this with my senior English class because Brave New World is frowned upon, but I wish -- Oh! How I wish! -- that we could read Huxley's Masterpiece instead."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is by far one of my favorite dystopian novels. It follows the story of Jonas, a boy growing up in a post-apocalyptic society where uniqueness and passion of the human condition are shunned in favor of sameness and contentment. But what exactly has been given up and what price has been paid to have such security and routine? Jonas soon learns the answer, and must make a decision that will determine the future of him and society. I found it uniquely refreshing to see what happens when morality, societal values, and individuality are turned on their head. The book itself ends on a bit of a cliff hanger, but reading all 4 books will make it satisfying."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The is just right for middle-school aged children. It's the idea that by getting rid of the 'bad', such as war, starvation, and suffering, will inadvertently get rid the 'good' , such as beauty, love, and relationships.However, the vehicles used to prove that idea are lacking. 12 year old boys do not worry about their careers; 12 year old boys do not plot a runaway for the sake of a baby; it is not remotely convincing that thousands of memories would come over a community because one person left. The thought behind this book is inadequate.Brave New World has more thought behind it and gets the same idea across."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Many kids including me only think this book is so so, but the adults in our school love it. Go figure"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Even though this book is considered a novel for younger adults, I think that it is great for any age.

I DEFINITELY recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The first half of the book is great. It is one of the most interesting stories I have ever read. This is part of the problem. I was so excited and anxious to find out what happens next, that I was hugely disappointed. To sum it up, the ending is a terrible disappointment.

I can honestly say, this book has the same impact on me today, as it did thirteen years ago. This beautifully written dark narrative on a Utopian society only becomes more relevant with time. It lacks the seriousness of \\"Brave New World\\" but somehow manages to be taken more seriously. Perhaps because the future described, could easily happen with today's technology.

But when I was a sophmore I picked it up in the library one day and couldnt put it down. If you dont have even a small life altering moment when you read this, you must be a very cold and angry person. So much of this book applies to our world today in such a powerful way I really wish some of our politicians and leaders would pick it up. I HIGHLY suggest every child read this as soon as they can handle the reading level (which isnt high), and I would hope that adults would read it as well. Some life lessons span beyond age groups.

It really brings up issues and makes you think, but some children (up to about 10 or 11) might not totally grasp the depth of this book at the first read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was AMAZING! It definitely makes you think about what the world is coming to. I stayed up until 10 (on a school night) to finish it.

I told her I didn't get the end and she tried to explain it. My response: \\"huh? I don't remember that.\\" So she dragged me over to my desk and pushed me down itno my seat and shoved the book under my nose. \\"Read!\\" she commanded. So I read the last few pages and was in total tears. Everyone was asking me what was wrong but I couldn't stop crying long enough to answer.

The characters were well-drawn out, and it was a heart-wrenching story; it showed you what the world would look like if we were all the same, condemmed to a live of normancy, and also showed you what happens when one person stands up and says this is wrong. I really enjoyed it, expecially since it's a book that I would not normally read. The only true promblem that I had with it was the end-I felt that it did not tie up the book as well as I might have wanted it to. It was much like the book Troy by Adele Geras- not the ending persay, but the way it was ended-it left the ending up to the readers, so that you constantly go back and forth between what could have happened, without ever knowing what actuaally did happen. Besides this fact, I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend anyone and everybody to read this book, as well as The Times Series(The first book being A Wrinkle In Time) by Madeleine L'Engle."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was very unique and different.

He felt no love, no pain, and had no real memories. In Sameness, that is normal. There is no color, and everyone is assigned a job and a family. People are restricted to be rude or to lie about anything. Everything seemed normal to Jonas, and he just thought that the world had always been that way. That was how life was for Jonas until the day he became a twelve. He was selected to be the next Reciever of Memory where he will recieve special training from The Giver, and in that training, Jonas will be brought into a whole new world of feeling. Although this sounds good, some of it isn't. Some of Jonas's memories are filled with sadness and pain, and one of them will reveal the awful truth of Jonas's community, where there is no turning back. Finally, Jonas can't stand it anymore. Something has to change. He must find a way to save a baby named Gabriel from an awful fate, he has to save himself, and he has to change his town. What will happen to Jonas, The Giver, Gabriel, and Sameness? The Giver is a wonderful story of love, hope, sadness, but most of all, courage. It will make you smile, cry, and you will never want to put it down. I definitely recommend it to any kind of reader, because reading this book is opportunity that you don't deserve to miss."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It's evident some of the reviewers are not old enough, or did not bother thinking about the plot before writing their reviews. The glaring obvious are those which, in their infinite wisdom, state that the perfect world depicted in this book is far from perfect. If you had thought about the plot, you'd realize this is the central problem of this story.The story revolves around the conflict between the main character, Jonas, and his knowledge about the truth. In his community, there is no pain, war, or hate - all which we experience in our daily life. On the other hand, the population is incapable of understanding joy, love, or even colors. They are in a state of Sameness, as it is known in their society.Jonas is chosen by the elders (without his opinion) to become the next Receiver. The Receiver holds all knowledge hidden from the rest of the community. They are all the memories and feelings from the past. Only the Receiver holds all the joys and sufferings, in order to maintain Sameness.When Jonas is selected, the current Receiver is called The Giver. He starts to give Jonas many memories - snow, war, sunshine, pain, color. Soon enough, Jonas realizes how society lacks uniqueness. Thus, he attempts to change things.The quality Lois Lowry puts in her books is excellent, but I have two problems with this particular story. (No, it's not about how the perfect world sucked.) First, it seems to be short. A year passes in just a short chapter - it would have been nice to read more about Jonas's training from The Giver. Second, the ending was not as good as the rest of the story. It is cryptic, and gives very little information as to what happened to Jonas.The Giver is much, much better than the way some people make it out to be. I would recommend it to those entering high-school and above."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Despite the multyiple criticisms of many individuals regarding this publication, I myself found it to be exceptionally well written with an intriguing concept that was a bit difficult to grasp, but with some speulation could be succeeded. The conclusion was truly moving, regarding the great heights Jonas was willing climb in order to escape the deceptive cruelties and lies belied by the utopian exterior. I myself am quite Kafkaesque and thus found this book quite enjoyable, however, not everyone must be in order to do so."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is very good, but it is confusing because of hard words and phrases that are never used it the world today.

Though it was confusing at times, as an active reader (with the help of my teacher)I was able to understand some things that were very confusing. Lois Lowry did an exelent job on symbolism. I also like the way that she kept you optomistic. Though you could predict what was going to happen, there would always be a turn in the story that was totally un expected. I urge you to buy this book and read it for yourself. This is one book that blows away all of the others!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My wife and I loved this book for the first 2/3, but then the plot lost its way and the characters went with it. I would still recommend reading the book, just borrow it from someone else!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My english class was asked...asked? No, not asked. We were forced to read this book for our English class. Being an avid reader, I read it way before my other classmates. When they finally got started reading this book, I had just finished reading it...for the third time. Indeed, I adored this novel. Lowry writes with such.... oh, I can't discribe it. Everything in this book is so well described that we can picture the setting in our head. Read this book. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I sincerely enjoyed this book even though I'm not a big fan of reading. With its on-going events and details, I found myself picturing it in my mind and really enjoying it! A rare occurrence in my case! This is a book you can read over and over and still find yourself making up different endings that you think could have happened. Also, with its twists and turns spread throughout the book you don't find yourself reading just to get to the big climax at the end. I salute the author and highly recommend that you read this book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"It was a sound of rage and grief and it seemed never to end\\". \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry is a book about a boy named Jonas that has been living in his world always looking forward to the \\"Ceremony of the Twelve\\", but when he is called last instead of 19th and given a special job his life changes forever. At the ceremony everybody was given a job. Jonas was separated from his friends and family. He was to receive all the information that was kept from the community. Now Jonas has to hold all of the memories of war, hate, peace and death.Jonas was a true rescuer. He was living in a community that had no connection to the outside world, and dealt with visions and thoughts no one in his society wanted to have. Jonas could have not gone for his training and left the Giver with the horrible memories but he took in all of the horrible ones and the good ones. Jonas played a very important role in the book. He was not only the Receiver of Memories and the main character, but a righteous, friendly, giving person.This is a very important book to read if you like fiction books. It is not a good Holocaust book unless you have a good imagination and can see how they live in a ghetto like situation. You should read this book for fun but not if you are studying the Holocaust. It is an excellent book for all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was a truly great book but I didn't like it because of the story. The most powerful book I've ever read.

The book was a little depressing towords the end of the book and I think it could have ended better. It ended in a way that makes you want to keep on reading. I was intriged by the world that the character lived in and curious on how their life compared to ours. The book also had some mystery in it that i liked. For example, when the apple changed and when he was about to find out what release was. It also had a lot of exciting parts, like when the main character recieved his first memory. It also had some sadness to balance the good. For instance, When you read about the Giver's daughter killing herself. The book had some really neat stuff in it, like the fact that everyone except the Giver and eventually Jonas couldn't see colors. The world that Jonas lived in also had a orginized way of life ,but in my opinion it was too perfect. If you are ever woundering if you should buy this book or not, I think you should."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" was an excellent book and it deffinatly deserves five stars hands down. I thought this book was very intresting and it will hold your attention till the very end. In the book it teaches you to be thankfull for what you have and not what you don't, because it shows you what life could be like in the future. I personally liked the end because it leaves you at a point where you're the one who has to make the decisions on what happens next. Over all I still give \\"The Giver\\" five stars because of the well writen text, not to mention the adventure."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really liked the book. It was a little different and exciting. I haven't read any books like that before, but I enjoyed reading it. I thought it wasn't the best book I have ever read before, but it was definetly one of my favorites. I rated The Giver 2 stars because in my opinion it needed more work. Overall the book was well-written and it seemed to me that the author put some time and effort into this book. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading books about the future and books that are a little out there. In the book, Jonas' world was a little weird. They had certain rules for everything. They were very precise and they wanted everything to be that way. That's the part of the book that really didn't appeal to me that much. I don't think that it was right the way that the people in Jonas' world thought was right. But there was also some advantages to the way they lived. It was nice reading this book because it was something that I had never read before."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I always wondered what it would be like if the world was perfect.

The Giver was interesting, but somewhat confusing on some parts. But no one's perfect.It is good to read about a world that is much different from ours once in a while, and The Giver was the right book to read for that. I hope the author of this book continues to write books like this one."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"To me the Giver was only okay to me. Although much of it made me think, but not as much as the Madeline L'Engles I enjoy reading. The setting in the Giver was a little boring, and at first I didn't understand the beggining.

The book made me consider a few things in my life, but it wasn't good enough to change what I thought."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is an excellent Newbery Award winning novel. I thought the different levels of thinking involved in this book are wonderful. It was a quick read because I couldn't stand to put it down.This book could pose thoughts and make people thankful for the way that things are. Jonas is a normal kid whose life gets turned upside down when he learns the truths about the community that he has been living in. It has a little bit of the White Mountains book feel in that the world they live in is over simplified and the way that we live is looked at badly. It is so thought provoking and heart felt though that Jonas finally takes the \\"newchild\\", Gabe, and tries to leave and give the memories to the whole community to try to save it. That would be a huge undertaking. The idea that they are always watching them and how they reprimand them is so odd to think about. Also the idea of applying for a wife and children is very strange. Ms. Lowry is an excellent writer and wholly deserves the award for this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book The Giver follows Jonas, a boy growing up in a Utopian society. The story follows Jonas to the age of 12 and at the age of 12 he recieves his job assignment. The most interesting part of the story is how perfect society is set uo and how it follows this young boy and a man discovering different things. What is unusual about this story is how the man is teaching Jonas his job assignment, has powers that he is able to give to give to this boy. The relationship between the Giver and Jonas is very interesting as the story follows each of them through the teaching of the job assignment. The first six chapters of the story were pretty slow and it was hard to keep my attention on the story. When Jonas finally recieved his job assignment the story went at a fairly fast pace and it got to the point where you dont want to put the book down. I would recommend the book for sixth through eigth grade because it tells the story of a different kind of world that we currently live in. Some of the book is hard to comprehend so I do not recommend it for younger kids."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is amazing! It clearly demonstrates many aspect in which I have never thought of. It really makes you think.

I read it before sending it and found the vocabulary to be at about an 8th grade level. This is a good book for a child who's of above-average reading ability in grammar school, especially because the topic lends itself to more than one level of meaning; consequently, the child could re-read it in a couple of years and find a different level of connection with the story. I think that children would identify with the plot, i.e. the hero child, and the values the book teaches are of the \\"Dr.Seuss\\" variety.

This community centers around duty, responsibility, correctness of speech, and courtesy to others. At the age of 11, each child must take his or her place as adults within the community. On the day of the Ceremony of 11, Jonas gets assigned the mysterious and highly respected position as The Receiver of memories. His training centers around receiving the unremembered memories of the world. Joy, pain, love, depression, and loss pass to Jonas through The Giver of memories. These new experiences give Jonas a new range of emotions and appreciation for life. At the same time, it begins to distance him from his family unit and isolates him from the rest of the community. He realizes the atrocities the community commits on a day to day basis to preserve sameness and to prevent the community from feeling. He begins to plan, with the help of The Giver, to release the memories to his community and allow them to look at life in all its rich colors, its devastating pain, and its overwhelming joy.Negative aspects of book:This book has a couple of disturbing moments centering around \\"being released\\" or the euthanization of those who cannot conform to sameness (the elderly, the sick, twins). My students found these parts difficult to read and even more difficult to understand. However, it did make for an interesting conversation about what a utopian society would be like and where conformity can lead a society. While I don't believe there are negative aspects of this book, these touchy areas should be approached with sensitivity and caution. At the same time, the issues that Lowry raises within real societies is unmistakably important for students to study and consider. We used some of the more disturbing areas in the book as a spring board for some incredible discussion. We even re-examined our own society in light of Lowry's critique.My personal appraisal of book:This book was interesting to me as a junior high student and even more interesting to me as a teacher of junior high students. It is a classic that holds readers and thinkers to a high standard. Parts of it may be hard to read for students with a lower reading level without teacher support (sentence structure and vocabulary might prove an obstacle to understanding). However, the story itself interested each student more and more the deeper we dug into the story. It is thought provoking while its characters are endearing, and its community is intriguing. It shows that without being taught, there is kindness, courage, love, and choices in a colorless, unvarying world."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverLowery, LoisPublished by Laurel Leaf (2002)Reading Level: 6.5192 PagesYouth Science FictionI remember reading The Giver for the first time as an emerging adolescent. For the first time I can remember, a novel challenged me to do more than just imagine. This powerful novel (to the my delight) forced me to consider and evaluate the circumstances and situations the author describes. Lois Lowry weaves together a provocative narrative that challenges our assumptions about the desirability of a utopian world, and explores the dark underside that so often accompanies flawed human attempts at manufacturing perfection. The story is less about Jonas, a 12-year old boy who is designated to become the receiver of memories, than it is about the twisted modern utopia he inhabits.The story is set in a world without extremes. There is no pain, no suffering, and no poverty, but at the same time, no joy, no meaning, and no love. The cost of ridding the world of its ills is sacrificing many of its greatest virtues. By introducing the reader into the sterile world Jonas is born into, and accompanying him as he breaks through personal and societal barriers, Lowry invites her audience to consider controversial issues about freedom of choice, the nature of authentic experiences, the conditions of righteous rebellion, the intrinsic value of human life, and the price of a painless existence.Jonas's experience reminds us of the simple joys we tend to take for granted in our world, full of endless variation, possibility, challenge, and choice. In the (literally) black and white world that Jonas inhabits, experiencing everything from the fundamental concepts of color and hunger to simple pleasures and pains like sledding and sunburns leaves Jonas profoundly changed. The way Jonas grows and matures through learning about his environment reminds the reader of how important it is to seek out new knowledge to better understand our world and ourselves.Despite the striking differences between the modern world and the society Jonas is born into, many of the decisions that Jonas grapples with upon discovering the true nature of his utopian existence are similar to those every teenager and adult must make as he or she matures to gain wisdom, and with it, responsibility. It is almost painful to watch Jonas, at a mere 12 years of age, carry the enormous burden of remembering (and experiencing) the imperfections and wonders of the past alone. Jonas's journey, beginning with his passage into adulthood with the Ceremony of Twelve, and culminating with his decision to flee the only world he has ever known (to what end, we will never know...), reveals the incredible range of emotions we all know well as the human experience."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"As soon as I picked up this book I was captivated by it. The people are all so ignorant ... the old saying ignorance is bliss Is best put here. Although there are some parts of the book that made me cry, don't ask me why but when I found out who got released I kind of knew it by the way he talked about her. Overall A great read and a captivating one at that."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverLowery, LoisPublished by Laurel Leaf (2002)Reading Level: 6.5192 PagesYouth Science FictionIn this captivating story, a young boy named Jonas struggles to come to terms with his own specialness, his community's secrets, and the full range of human experience. Jonas lives in a community where everything is carefully planned and carefully controlled. There is no suffering or discomfort, but likewise no joy and little individuality. Children are assigned to families, mates are chosen by a committee of elders, and the weather is always comfortable. The people's lives proceed in a course prescribed by the community's elders, marked by routine, ritual and procedure. With the passage of one such ritual, The Ceremony of Twelve, the youth of the community are assigned to a profession. As his friends begin preparing for their new adult roles in the community, Jonas embarks on an altogether different journey.Jonas has always known himself to be a bit different from his peers, and at his Ceremony of Twelve, he is chosen as the Receiver of Memories. As such, he is charged with holding all of the human memories passed from previous generations, so that the others in the community might be shielded from them. And so- bit by bit- Jonas begins to receive these memories from the pervious Receiver, an old man now know as the Giver. With these memories comes a whole range of emotions, good and bad, and wisdom well beyond his years. Armed with these insights, and the access granted to him as the Receiver, Jonas begins to see his community in a whole new way.This book is a wonderful read for young people or adults. It dramatically addresses the issues with which adolescents are already familiar: feeling deeply, leaving childhood behind, and questioning the rules of their upbringing. It challenges the mind to consider issues of conformity and rebellion, and the infinite pros and cons of the human condition. The reader must wrestle with the questions like \\"is the absence of unpleasantness really happiness?\\", \\"is getting rid of sadness and pain worth it if it means giving up things like love and creativity?\\", and \\"how far will people go to preserve harmony and avoid unpleasantness?\\". These questions challenge and extend young minds, but may be a bit complex for young readers. Additionally, the mood and subject matter of the book are quite dark at times, and may be upsetting to some. Overall, however, this is an intellectually and emotionally engaging book that I found hard to put down!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver -1. Publisher: Houghton Mifflin Co. (1993)2. Author: Lois Lowry3. Reading Level: Young Adults (Ages 11-15)4. Number of Pages: 1925. Genre: Science Fiction / FantasyLois Lowry's The Giver is written from the point of view of Jonas, an 11-year-old boy who lives in a perfect yet artificial community. There is no pain, no poverty, no fear, no war and no hatred. This society has also eliminated choice.Jonas has an unusual power of perception. Sometimes he perceives flashes of color, whereas for everyone else, there is no color. He also has instances where he sees objects change shapes. This foreshadows Jonas's assignment at the Ceremony of Twelve. Jonas' life changes the day he turns twelve. He is apprehensive about the upcoming Ceremony of Twelve, when he will be given his assignment as an adult member of society. The Committee of Elders tells Jonas that he has been chosen to be the Receiver. The Receiver is the sole keeper of the community's memory. Someone must keep the memories of pain, war, emotion, etc. so that the community can avoid mistakes that were made in the past. Jonas receives these memories from the current receiver, a wise old man who tells Jonas to call him Giver.Soon Jonas learns The Giver will transmit all of the past memories of the world to him, and his life will be difficult and lonely. He was no longer able to participate in family and community activities, and was no longer able to spend time with his friends. Jonas soon realizes that the world he knew is a lie. He asks permission to view a releasing ceremony and witnesses his father murder a baby boy by injecting him with a drug. His father \\"discards\\" the young boy into a garbage, because the boy constantly cried, unlike the \\"normal\\" newborns. After Jonas receives good and bad memories, he is deeply troubled and changed. He is not forbidden to share any of his training experiences with the community.Understanding for the first time that life is far better being aware of the memories of the past and being able to choose, the Giver helps Jonas develop an escape plan from the community. Jonas escapes and the book ends. Lowry wants the reader to create the ending to this thought-provoking chapter book.There are some negative aspects of this book. The people in the community are not allowed to feel. They only have one point of view - what they are taught by the elders. Also, the releasing ceremony is criminal and disturbing.In this book, young readers are asked to think about life without the ability to choose, where everyone is the same, where there is no religion. It is a provocative book that allows its readers to bring their own beliefs to find the symbolism. I recommend this well-written book be read in a school setting. After reading this book, readers can see what life could be like without diversity, and it makes readers appreciate the freedom we have to make our own choices."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Title: The GiverAuthor: Lois LowryNumber of pages: 192Level: 6th-8th grade reading levelGenre: Science FictionSynopsis of Plot: Jonas is a young boy, turning twelve at the beginning of the story. He has grown up in a fictional community where there is no crime, violence, poverty, or \\"memories\\" of the past. He has only know this eutopia, where there is only happiness, feelings are constantly shared, and everything is very well organized and planned out. There are very strict rules that guide daily life in the community. Every member of the community follows the same life plan, where no one chooses a husband or wife. Rather, couples are matched up, children are chosen to go to certain homes after being born by \\"birth mothers,\\" and each home is only allowed two children for population control. There are no choices to be made, but Jonas soon finds out that he will be faced with one as he turns twelve, a very important age in the community. At age twelve, every child is given a job that they will hold for the rest of their lives. Jonas receives the most important job in the community: Receiver of Memories. He is given memories and knowledge of the world as we know it now, by an Elder in the community called \\"The Giver.\\" Jonas learns of pain, of war, of weather, freedom, animals, color, family, and all of the things he has grown up not knowing. He realizes that choices can be made, and that life doesn't have to follow this dull, empty-of-joy pattern.Negative Aspects: The only negative aspects I have seen after reading this book many times, is that there are some dark sides to the book that some children may not be able to understand. For example, euthanizing and infant may be difficult for some children to understand, and also the scene where war-fare is described. The only other negative aspect that I could see, is that though the book is fictional, there are many aspects of the book that go unexplained. The community lives in this \\"ideal,\\" world, but no one ever explains how they got to where they are, with no memories, or color, or what happened to the rest of the world before \\"sameness.\\"My Rating: I give The Giver 4 stars personally. I have read the book numerous times, as well as having read it to my class. The book is a quick read, and never felt boring. It really gave students insight to what the world would be like without family, choices, pain, or joy. It was interesting, and brought up a lot of great discussions in class. It presented many ideas that I had never thought of before. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars, is the same reason I stated before. The book is fictional, but still needs to provide some type of explanation of how the community that Jonas grew up in, came to be. This would help readers to fully understand the history behind the book, and understand the choices that the people in the community had made.Overall, I would recommend this book for most middle-school students who are able to read at this level. It's an interesting book that really challenges the thought of what a community is, individual thinking, and how rules can affect everyday life"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry a children's SF for 8-12 year olds written in 1993 is part of a loose set trilogy set in the same imagined world but not necessarily with the same characters. It deals with a world where your life is one of conformity and happiness. The short novel honestly faces why a society such as this would arise with its benefits and essential failure explored. The core of that failure is that...grief is the price you pay for love. Without sadness, can love and laughter really exist?We discover a community of unlimited happiness and good manners set in a green and pleasant paradise of high but largely hidden technology. In this world, only 50 children per community are born from genetically approved placements in birth mothers. Regulations define your clothes, toys and your role in society from your first year. From eight you have to volunteer for a range of community duties so that your life long occupation from twelve can start. We join Jonas as the ceremony for 12's is near for the allotment of his calling. Much to his and the communities shock he is not allotted a job but is selected to be the Receiver. In learning what this is, he discovers the hidden pain and dark side of unlimited happiness. This sets off a chain of events as Jonas discovers what being released really means. He faces what growing up means, and consequences whose meaning you have to decide.The book has over 3000 ratings on Amazon.com alone so we are talking popular and critical success (it won the Newbury Medal- the USA children's literature award). Even so, it is banned in several USA State's School and Library systems because of the dark emotional issues dealt with. If you or your children have not read it then you have missed a classic. But if you have read it then you know why it's enjoyable and highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is about a boy, named Jonas who lives in what seems to be like a special community that is protected from everything. At first, it is a bit difficult to understand the rules of the community because they are not displayed early on for the reader. However, they are learned throughout the entire book. The rules of the family consist of: you cannot lie, each family must eat at the same time, they must tell about their dreams and fellings, and there are no secrets. Every child in the community experiences the same thing, and even receive the same gift for their birthdays. It is not until age nine that they can even ride a bicycle. However, age 12 is the most important brithday. This is when the children are assigned their job or duty within the community. The protagonist, Jonas, is given the most important job of the Receiver. He is allowed to lie, have secrets, and may not tell anyone what occurs at his job. The Giver is Jonas' trainer for his job, and he receives many things from the Giver. He is told he will learn about rain, snow, fire, the sun, and another world. The first memory he recieves is of snow, where he is sledding. The next memory is pain, while he is sledding he goes over ice, falls off his sled, and hurts his leg. At this point in the story it is explained that every time someone gets hurt, they receive a pill, and they don't receive pain. Jonas is the only one in the community who can feel pain.At the beginning of the book Jonas' father (who is the Nurturer), brings home a baby named Gabriel. Jonas realizes that him Gabriel are the only two in the community with Hazel eyes. Everyone else has dark eyes. Later, Jonas also notices that the Giver also has Hazel eyes. He puts all of this information together, and knows that Gabriel will be the next Receiver. One night, when Gabriel is crying Jonas accidentally gives him a memory. Throughout the book Jonas is faced with hardships. He is traumatized when he realizes that his father actually kills babies that don't belong in the community. THis transformation, and growth in his character makes him begin to think about leaving. His last memory that is given to him is the memor of the outside world. Jonas decides to try and find the place, and leaves one night with Gabriel in search of it. In the end, Jonas and Gabriel die of starvation and freezing temperatures.All of the aspects of this book are very dramatic and shocking for readers. It is a fantasy story, but could also be classified as a science fiction novel. Due to the content of the book, and the depth at which it can be analyzed it would be more appropriate for Juniour High or High School students. Children in this age range will be more able to think about the book and its true meaning about social norms. Classroom debates about having a sheltered community could be held with these students. The novel presents these topics in a very shattering way which draws in readers, and sparks motivation. However, a concern would be the emotional readiness of the reader to tackle a book that speaks out against things that are different from our society. One example is that, in the novel children are not nurtured by their parents while they are infants. They are nurtured by the Nurturers in the community, and then assigned to a family. This is a concept that may be too abstract for a younger audience. This book could be tied into any type of skill development while teaching reading. These skills included questioning, prediction, and of course the idea of forming opinions as readers. I na Social Studies class when introducing classroom debates, this story could be shared to illustrate a different culure, and teams could be formed to support various reader opinions on some of the themes in the book. It is a high quality book, that while it uses simple language it messages are brought with very descriptive words that help readers picture what is going on throughout the story."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, by Lois Lowry, was a very deep and influential book on the importance of remembrance and the gift of knowledge and freedom. The journey that Jonas took in the novel was one of great learning. Through his story, he showed the reader how important it is to cherish the freedom that we do have in this life. This book is a warning to those of all generations that remembrance is the key to keeping the freedoms of choice that people in the world enjoy. Jonas reminds us to never stop questioning the way the world is run, or we could end up living in a society like his. I think this book is extremely important for people of all ages and cultures to read because it teaches important lessons that all people should remember, lest we find ourselves color blind and memory-less in a world where all our choices are made for us."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Having just read The Giver by Lois Lowry, I can see why she won the prestigious Newbery Medal for this excellent tale about a futuristic, utopian(?) society, one which produces conditions of conformity, sameness and, as a result of strict adherence to the Community's Set of Rules, a society where turmoil does not exist........except for the few who are enlightened. As many have written, I had just as many questions as answers as I plowed thought this quick read in record time. I only wish that I had read this as a teenager, as my children did, where perhaps I could not accurately anticipate what would come next, as adults with more experience can oftentimes do. With that said, there were still suspenseful moments. What prompted me to pick this up from my youngest's bookshelves was the fact that I now work with a new band called Jonas Sees in Color. Read about the band and in particular see why they chose this name above others.Jonas Sees in Color"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lowry scores my highest mark for THE GIVER: a capital A for AWESOME.THE GIVER appeals to my deepest being, going into emotional depths where I'm most aware, where I experience anger, sadness, and fear but also enjoyment, surprise, and love. Not only that but it stimulates and informs my intellect. It is such a gut-wrenching but ultimately happy story. It makes me --- at sixty-one --- feel like a boy again, a boy who thinks he can make the impossible possible, who might be able to help a dulled humanity feel more fully again. I believe all of existence waxes and wanes, ebbs and flows, evolves and devolves with a slow but ever-present upward spiral. This story addresses one community's wane, its ebb, its devolution. Jonas, as a member of that community, is selected to spend his time learning about his community's state of affairs. Then, as the story climaxes, he makes his choice and acts.Overall, Jonas is a \\"chosen\\" hero --- not unlike one chosen in natural selection --- who's unafraid to explore every facet of being, to admit not just the sensory input, but to experience emotionally as well as intellectually. He's brave enough, in the end, to try to escape the constraints of knowledge and experience that have crept into his community of origin. Such perversions are no less ugly than those of Nazism or those characterized in the great literature of the past--the stories of Bradbury, Huxley, and Orwell and others. This story informs those. Here we have a boy who wants to progress on to a new and better life, not just for himself but for the sake of his entire community. He wants them to have it too. He is willing to risk his life for it. For me, this is the purpose of literature, of life. It is man's highest virtue. To do good; to help others. As the boy in Carmac McCarthy's THE ROAD asks, \\"Are we still the good guys?\\"The story makes it clear --- as do all great stories --- that morality comes by experiencing choices tending toward either good or evil and in having the courage to choose that which trends toward good or otherwise suffering tragedy. Jonas isn't ever over-inflated with pride. He retains humility in learning, eventually hoping for a culture beyond his limiting one.Critics suggest the book's climax presents \\"a symbolic faux-death event\\", as if that would somehow be a bad thing. But I don't read it that way at all. Its literal language doesn't so read. Two children literally coast into a more abundant realm, still alive, still aware. Ready to receive and to give.Further, critics complain that Lowery fails with THE GIVER because Jonas's community isn't based upon a real world of its author, as if a symbolic or hyperbolic one of the imagination is flawed, or somehow a weakness. To the contrary, in the progress of mankind, imagination becomes truth. Or, as in the fanciful words of Ursula LeGuin's character, Genley Ai, truth is a matter of the imagination. What is ultimately in the realm of mankind is what was first imagined well and then subjected to free agents who acted upon it for good.THE GIVER presents a degenerated human power structure. How or why it has degenerated is not important in its overall scheme. It kills people, the ultimate evil. \\" . . . twins are being born tomorrow, and the test results show that there are identical.\\" \\"One for here, one for Elsewhere . . .\\" This is not ambiguous. It's not an issue of unborn or near dead. It is out and out, clear-cut, calculated murder. It's Bergen-Belsen, Dachau, and Auschwitz, but on a more massive scale.At the same time, the human power structure that has chosen wickedness ironically chooses Jonas as the Receiver. There are two things Jonas has that are vital. The first is his ability to choose freely. Everyone has that. All his contemporizes have it and utilize it. The other is knowledge and experience. It is this later that the others are lacking in great measure.There is no magic in THE GIVER, no smoke and mirrors as some have suggested, but only the issues of knowledge and choice. Every child is born with the ability to choose. Not every child lives with the ability to get the necessary knowledge and experience required to choose well. It seems that to do so, to some degree, we have to be \\"chosen,\\" and then, even then, we have to choose to Receive it. But ultimately, what is most important, after all is said and done, is to choose to be a giver.THE GIVER."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books. I read it as an adolescent, and later in high school as required reading.As an adult, I once overheard some mothers talking about The Giver. I said \\"Oh, I love that book!\\" and immediately realized they did not. In their view, it was a horrible piece of trash and there was no WAY their innocent teens could ever be exposed to it. It was the first time I'd thought of someone having that reaction to what I thought was a brilliant piece of literature.So I read some of the 1-star reviews here, expecting to see comments in line with what those mothers said. But most of the negative reviews appear to have been written by students who had to read the book for class. I can only assume writing a review on Amazon was part of the assignment, too. A note to teachers: don't make your students write amazon reviews. If you want to read a million versions of \\"This stupid book was so boring,\\" at least don't subject the rest of the world to it.Also those forced reviews take away from legitimately critical reviews. There are people who are honestly offended by this book (and not because it's boring). While I disagree with them, I think it's a valid point for a potential reader to consider. If adult themes, including euthanasia, are not something you want to read about, you may not enjoy this book.As for me, I stand by what I said to that group of mothers."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I just finished listening to The Giver moments ago. I looked to if there is a sequel, and since there is none, it makes my feelings of grief all that more powerful! I listen to recorded books almost on a daily basis, for years, while driving. This is absolutely among my favorite top ten. Beside a perfect story, the narration was is so good - it's hard to believe all the voices were played by a single person!The Giver also made me feel a lot of other emotions - horror, anger, worry, trust, love, courage, empathy, hope, innocence, fear, loss, weariness, disbelief - you name it, you'll feel it! It's been a long time since I have felt such a smorgasbord of emotions from a single story! At one point I wanted to stop listening, so I listened in small doses over a several week period. By listening to the entire book I was rewarded by feeling strong feelings of empathy - and that one must do what is right no matter what the odds of one's success. For ultimately, The Giver is about courage, plain and simple!One final note: THIS IS A STORY HOLLYWOOD NEEDS TO TURN INTO A FILM! (But, please do a good job!) The Giver really needs to be told to a larger audience!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This story is set many generations in the future. The world described is in some ways like our own, but in many ways different. Jonas, the hero of the story, lives in a commune where life seems ideal. Each person has his place in the group and knows exactly what is expected of him. What is demanded rarely seems too much. The physical needs of each person are met and nobody goes hungry or homeless. The way people dress, the things they own and the houses they live in have conformity, so nobody is jealous or thinks overly much of themselves. People's mental well-being is looked after by rituals such as the evening \\"Telling of Feelings\\" and the morning \\"Telling of Dreams\\". In this apparently model world Jonas is eleven and waiting the December ceremony when he, and all his year, will officially become twelve. At that ceremony each child will be allotted a new role, which will be their career for life. As Twelves they will undergo an apprenticeship for that career, though their schooling will also continue. Jonas finds it hard to describe exactly how he feels about the coming ceremony. Will the Elders choose a career that is right for him? What will it be? Will he be a success at the task, or will he fail, as some do?This is a very interesting and exciting book, which encourages the reader to think about the society in which he or she lives. Is the way our society does things right? In what ways could it be improved? Of course in countries like Israel and Russia people have really experimented with living in communes. Were they successes and in what ways were they failures?The first half of the story rolls along at a leisurely but stimulating pace as we get to know Jonas' family, friends and world. In the second half the pace quickens as we are confronted with some emotional facts about the way the commune really works. These truths lead to exciting developments and a very well written climax.Jonas is described well as a character and he comes across as a quite ordinary boy who in many ways is much like us. The book demonstrates how ordinary people, when they act on their conviction, can become 'heroes' without really meaning to. The character of the old man, called The Giver, is also drawn quite well. In his personality we see someone who has born much pain, has thought much about what is right, and yet who in many ways is powerless to make changes for the good. Right answers are not always easy to come upon.This book can be read by children eleven and up, though I must point out that it covers issues which may be disturbing to the less mature. This would be a fine book for a school report as it contains much to be discussed and is at the same time a delight to read. This book is a winner of the American Library Association's Newberry Medal."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is one I read before a few years ago and wanted to buy it to read again. It's easy and quick reader but so enjoyable to read. I would recomend you to read this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book in 1995 when I was a 15 year old high school freshman. It was required reading for my English class, and while I've always been an avid reader, I HATED the stuff they made us read in class. 'The Giver' however, proved to be different. I blew threw the entire book in two days, WELL ahead of the allotted reading time. I have never, in 14 years, forgotten this book. Sure, many of the finer points of the story faded away with time, as well as character names, and descriptions, but the gist of the story always stayed with me.I decided it was finally time to re-read this, and I gotta say, it was just as powerful the second time around. I read this in one sitting as it was impossible to put down. I didn't realize just how much of the story I'd forgotten, so I'm very glad I finally got around to re-reading it. I'm going to start 'Gathering Blue' this evening, followed by 'Messenger', two books I have not previously read. I have high expectations for them, but am almost certain they won't hold a candle to 'The Giver'.I absolutely recommend this book to kids and adults alike. It's such an unforgettable story, and you better believe that when my son's old enough, I'm going have him read this. I tried to think just what it is about this story that makes it so gripping, and for me, I thinks it's the unknown, for both you and the main character Jonas. Jonas doesn't know exactly what transpires to make his community run as smoothly as it does, yet neither does the reader since this is a society that is alien to us. Unlike most books that take place in the present or past, we kind of know the ins and outs of the community the book is set in, but with 'The Giver', we're in the dark, just like Jonas. Everything he learns and feels is almost new to us as well...make sense? Ah, well, I tried! Overall, a GREAT book...PLEASE don't miss out on it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"the giver takes place in what seems to be a perfect world, the are no wars hunger sickness or pain of any kind. jonas becomes aware of hidden and horrible problems within the community with help from the giver.spoilersjonas learns in creating this &#34;perfect&#34; community many good things had to be lost. there is no color animals weather musicor even love. parents are assigned to their children and everyone is the same. there are no specific birthdays and you are not allowed to choose your job. many good things are lost to create the pain free world. all through the book you hear about release which is preformed to some newchildren and the old. you do not learn what it is until the end when twins are born and one is released. the horrible truth the inoccent child is killed just because they look alikethis was a great book. i would reccomend it to anyone it will leave you thinking thought the end is disappionting you will enjoy it may be shocked at some parts"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The best book I have ever read in a while.

I also thought this book was too long, but I like short books. This book has 180 pages.

The horror felt by the taking of innocent life for the convenience of the community is a breath of fresh air in our society.I love the narration. I listen to quite a few books and quite a few narrators and Ron Rifkin did a first rate job here.The Bad:It seems that the most difficult part of a story to write is the ending. In this case the author simply chose not to write an ending, leaving the decision of what actually happened up to the reader. While on the surface this sounds like a clever intellectually compelling device in practice it just seems like a copout."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverThe Giver is a very well thought out, original novel. Written by Lois Lowry, it is filled with interesting ideas in every chapter. It's a pretty simple read but with a sci-fi feel. It's hard to know if it took place in the future or the past. When I read it, I was full of questions as was the main character Jonas. At the beginning, Jonas is an 11 year-old boy with unique qualities unlike any of his friends or family. When Jonas attends the annual assignment ceremony, he has no idea what job he will receive for the rest of his life, but he could never imagine the one that he is selected for.

I read the whole book in one day, and I'm sorry to say but my family had to fend for themselves when it came time for dinner.Lois Lowry does such an excellent job of describing his characters, especially Jonas, and the city where everything is controlled.

A coming of age story of sorts that's rife with ideas and concepts of interest to young adolescents, the book is perfect for middle school literature classes. I do have a concern that the book is too often used in elementary schools with students who are not ready to explore the novel's dark speculative themes. There are many better choices (other Newbery winners as well as other great books) for the third to fifth grade set. Some may quibble that some of the science behind certain aspects of the society are not sound and readers focused on such matters will likely not enjoy this perfectly written thought provoking story. Those who are convinced the book promotes \\"baby killing\\" are also likely to be blind to the book's rich themes. The story's ending is ambiguous but perfect."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Imagine having your life whole life planned out and never having to make any decisions. Things like who you were going to marry, who your children were, and what job you had were decided by people in your community. This is the main plot in The Giver by Louis Lowery. Every year when children turn a year older they have ceremonies and are given certain items/ privileges such as when a person turns a nine he or she is given a bicycle. When the Ceremony of Twelve comes a twelve year old is assigned a job in the community. The main character Jonas is assigned the new receiver with special training from the giver. No one in his town has feelings or can't see any color. When Jonas is given both exciting and painful memories by the giver, he finds out what true love is and begins to have feelings. When twins are born one is \\"released\\" or killed, or unsuccessful babies and older people, however no one knows this is bad because they have no feelings for other people. In the end Jonas goes on a journey and searches for an \\"elsewhere\\" and the community he has dreamed of where people had feelings. The Giver was an interesting novel I would recommend.One of the reasons I liked this book was because of the interesting plot. It made the reader wonder how it must feel to live in Jonas's town where nobody makes their own decisions or has any feelings. They are not allowed to tell any lies and every night at dinner they share their feelings or dreams. The book was really unlike the communities people live in now, such as when a person turns twelve they are given a job they have to stick with for the rest of their lives until they get very old.Another reasons I really liked this book was because the author used very descriptive words to tell what was going on. Such as when the giver transferred his memories to Jonas he used descriptions that made you feel as if you were actually there. For example when they were remembering riding on sled in the snow and when Jonas had cut his leg, the author didn't just say \\"he cut his leg\\" but described how he felt, what was happening around him, and the scenery. Also this book was full of feelings, such as when they remembered Christmas and the fireplace Jonas started to know what love is.The plot was very suspenseful and kept the reader wanting to know more. An example was when Jonas was running away with the newchild, Gabriel to search for a new community. As he rides on his fathers bicycle with the infant, search planes fly over head. Also when they were at the ceremony of twelve for Jonas the name caller accidentally skipped Jonas, he began to get worried and it left the reader wondering what job he was going to get.The Giver is an excellent novel because of its great traits such as suspense, vivid details, and unique well built plot. It is about a boy who lives in a dull and boring world where no decisions have to be made until he meets the Giver. From him he learns the true meaning of friendship, love, and pain. This is a exciting, action packed book I would recommend to anyone.~ C. Cirillo"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Katie WilemanFantasy GenreLowry, L. (1993). The Giver. New York: Random House.Synopsis: The Giver is a story about Jonas; a young boy who lives in what he considers a normal life until he turns twelve. Once all students in his community turn twelve they are assigned a job by the elders. Jonah is selected to be the Receiver of Memories, the most honorable of all jobs. Jonas quickly learns that the life he once considered normal was in fact choice less and everything and everyone was the same. The Receiver of Memories job is to hold all the memories of many centuries. Eventually Jonas discovers what feelings like love, pain, joy and anger really are while the rest of the community are spared of this and live in ignorance. Jonas also discovers colors, seasons, and having the ability to make choices. But when Jonah discovers that when someone is released it is not a reason to celebrate because instead of being sent \\"Elsewhere,\\" the person is killed. At the end of the book Jonahs is so miserable he wants to be released, but instead plans an escape and sends his memories to the community for everyone to experience the memories he holds.Evaluation: I thought this book was outstanding and beautifully written with an original plot. Lowry writes in a manner that the reader is convinced that the other members of the community are really clueless to what true feelings like pain and love are, and that they truly live in a choice less, carefully planned world. In this fantasy book, Lowry writes the community where everything is opposite of real life, as we know. People don't marry for love, rather the elders match them, and instead of giving birth to their own children there are birthing mothers, and couples must apply for children. The characters have rigid and proper lives with a strict set of rules everyone must abide by. Additionally, children are grouped specifically by age and receive certain rules and responsibilities as each year passes. The community members will never know hunger, or war, or inclement weather because the Elders and Receiver have planned and controlled all of that. Last, members of the community do not know what choice, colors, or death is. Lowry writes the story so well that the story and the characters lives sound believable, and the story is logical and consistent throughout. The story ends openly for the readers to decide if Jonas and Gabe will survive. Between the open ending and the universal truth that this story brings to life give readers many issues to discuss. For example one universal truth is that every society is plagued with troubles and dangers that the government can't always control because of our rights and freedom. If the novel was used in a classroom it might provoke students to examine if the rules in our own society should be changed and choice restricted to make the world safer? Another question an instructor might pose why or why not does the reader believe if Jonas will survive?Another book that connects to The Giver, but contain different characters is Gathering Blue which is about a world similar to Jonah's a world of the future but this time the main character is a handicapped orphan named Kira who is spared because of her gifts as a weaver, making her useful to the guardians."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book about a boy who goe through a big adventure as he turns twelve and gets his first job. This book tells about how The Giver teaches more about life than anyone else he knows. He got a job extremely few, in his community ever get. It is called the Receiver. His job is much different then any other job. He goes through many good and bad trials during his job. He suffers pain and happiness in his life until he has to make the biggest decision in his life. The book is recommended for students who enjoy mystery, sadness, and abig twists. s will enjoy the book just as much.This book is perfect for middle school students and could help them to relate to their life. This book has great vocabulary for a middle school student and doesn't have many hard words. It may be harder to read for less experienced readers. The author spaced out the cahpters evenly so somebody could read it at a good pace without overwhilming theselves. This book, for some readers, is so addictive that as soon as you read the first chapter you're hooked and you won't be able to put it down until you read the whole thing.This book has very good morals and would be great for kids. It teaches us the values of life and how much we live it to the full extent, whether it is good circumstances that bring joy or things taht bring pain and sadness. This book also teaches us about making big decisions in our life, and that how we live life will lead up to those decisions. It shows how peole can lie to you your whole life and you might not even realize it. Jonas was lied to and has to make a big decision to leave his life behind.This book , most of all, tells an amazing story of a boy's life that you will be talking about for a very long time. This book has big twists and turns with amazing characters that experience happiness, sadness, humility, and much more. The ending of this book will leave you wanting to read more. Fortulately, there are two sequels that include some of the same characters so you can read about them more.The Giver is suggested for those who love an amazing story. It is recommended for middle school students who like mystery, deceit, happiness, good morals, and most of all, the values of life.

It includes such topics as infancide, mercy killings and child suicide. This book is not meant for children. Yes, blind conformity is evil. But this vehicle to preach against conformity is not for children under 14. Adults: Read this book before you decide to give it to a child. Is your nine or 12 year old ready to read about the killing of a newborn with an injection in the skull? Do you want your 11 year old to read about how suicide solved a twelve year old's problem? This book haunted my sleep and thoughts for quite a while. I pulled this book from my elementary school library shelves."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My son's 5th grade class had to read this book. I read it with him and spent the year writing his teacher, principal and the school superintendent explaining that, in my opinion, the subject matter, including the euthanasia of all babies who are less than perfect, was inappropriate for a 5th grader. Please don't write me off as a conservative nut who thinks everyone should share my beliefs. I am as liberal as they come and would never recommend banning a book. However, according to the US Library Association, in 1995, this book was among the top 3 most requested books to be banned in schools.In my opinion, K-8 children, and ESPECIALLY elementary aged children should be reading uplifting books that will encourage a love of reading. The Aldous Huxley-esk world of The Giver is immeasurably dark, and I cannot imagine any elementary aged child finishing this book and being left with a feeling of excitement that drives them to quickly pick up another book and continue reading.If your child is assigned this book, at the very least, please read it with them so you can discuss it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Spoiler alert:There is more than one way to read a story; more than one level of interpretation, implied and/or inferred. There are different aspects of a story one can stress.One might point to a story where the \\"Father\\" gives over his \\"son\\" to shoulder the sins of the world in order to save us so that we may live. Sounds like serious stuff until the story ends with the \\"son\\" arriving in the world via a red sleigh like Santa Claus on Christmas morning.I had to giggle. It is a children's book after all.I suppose I could be offended and take this story as seriously as many people do but just because the author values pride and individual choice above fairness, politeness, no war or hunger. . . well, that's up to her. But the fact that she feels the need to set up a society with faults that don't follow from any reason is troubling. One could suggest that pride and individualism (and the like) are right-wing values while being fair and polite (and the like) are left-wing values but few parents teach their children to be rude and unfair; values such as these are best left to dubious ideologies, as if larger society shouldn't be valued as highly as family. When all is said and done, there is not enough depth of religious or philosophical ideas for me to take it seriously . . . only a straw-man society that has flaws that are as unlikely as its strengths.But wait, there's more . . .One main rule for the main character is that he must not discuss with anybody including parents and elders, what goes on behind closed doors with the old man who is his trainer. What might go on in this room? Here's what we do know:\\"Move to the bed, and lie face down. Remove your tunic first\\" . . . \\"What are you going to do sir?\\" . . . .

This is not a story that you walk away from feeling good."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Now, as technology touch every inch of our existence, how much we think and to what extent should we allow them into our lives?The reason I am reflecting is that I read a book entitled The Giver which is written by Lois Lowry. This book actually is for a book for children, and in fact have won a good number of awards, including the John Newbery Medal for most distinguished contribution to American Literature for Children. It was originally read by my son who told me it was good, and I took it. Incidentally, it is always good to take an active interest in what your kids are reading, and ocassionally won't harm much if you actually read it as well. That i believe, always create good talking points with your kids.The story is quite thought provoking, and basically centers on a community in which the people, years into the future, use technology try to create a world where everything is perfect. It might seem bizarre, but overall, it does seem plausible that if we are too overzealous and if we could do it, we will be headed in that direction.When you consider that a lot of grief or sorrow is because of poverty, then solve poverty. A lot of bad things come because of war, then use technology to acquire peace. If hunger is the issue, then insure that there won't be any hunger. But the policymakers in this book went beyond that -- they noted that a lot of grief comes from pain, so they were able to work out the perfect medicines that will cure pain and disease. Much grief comes from love, envy, anger, and greed, so basically they develop the pills to control that as well.If you consider that people also becomes sorrowful because they make the wrong choice so they eliminated choice as well. So in this community, a committee of experts make the evaluation what jobs you get ( depending on detailed recordings and observations on your interests and talents), who you marry, and also they have systems to insure that only healthy kids are born, and these are assigned to the right 'nurturers' to insure comformance of the system.In short, this was supposedly a story about a society where there is supposedly no fear, or no pain. Something like nirvana, or heaven, where everything works and is programmed to be just right. There is nothing unexpected, unusual or even inconvenient. Everything works according to plan, just like clockwork.In short, the author perceives that we can actually not only use technology to improve our lives, but if we are not controlled, we will be moving forward to using it to shield us from everything that would cause sadness or grief, and if we allow technology to do that, sooner or later, we will come up with technology to do precisely that.Isn't that what we all want? Or where we are heading?The hero, a 12 year old boy was selected to receive special training which allows him to experience true pain and pleasure. He later tries to opt out of the system, because he believes being 'human' is something that is different. Which begs the question that if you don't know sorrow, would you know happiness? If you don't know or have experienced failure, would you appreciate what it is to be successful. If you never experience hunger, would you know how lucky you are to always have food in the t able?Now , more and more, as our society advance, we do start to being able to get practically everything we want, but we think we are doing our children a favor by doing everything to shield them from the bad things that we as parents also have experienced before. We shield them from pain, from hunger, from anything inconvenient or anything closely resembling hard work?Are we therefore using technology the right way? Is that how we envision technology to increasingly play in our lives - shield us from the real challenges of the world?by: wilson ngMy blog at : www.ngkhai.net/bizdrivenlife"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book should have never been read by a kids mind.

It has a poor mixture of mystery and drama. If you like action books, this one's not for you. It has a dull plot because it takes place in a discrete area that is disconnected from society that we know and love. Everything is perfect, except for one thing. The freedom of choice we have does not exist in that world. The main character is a young boy by the name Jonas. He is chosen to take on a job that the community depends on.

The setting is in a futuristic perfect community. As a child, the members of the community are observed by a comity and their jobs are selected for them. The main character in this book, Jonas, is selected to be the receiver of memory. Jonas no longer has to follow the rules of the community. He has the most important job in the entire community. He goes through strenuous training to absorb the information that his tutor, the giver, is passing to him. He is a very important person to have in the community because if something bad was about to happen he could warn them of what happened before.The wording in the book is very difficult to understand. It takes a lot of thinking to understand the concepts in this book. This book is supposed to portray a perfect world but I think that the community is far from perfect. Everything in the community is based on sameness. This means that there are no advances and no differences among people. I think a world like that would be very boring because you would wake up every day and know what was going to happen. There is very little change in the daily schedule. A major reason why I think this wasn't a very good book is because the author's idea of a perfect world isn't mine.I gave this book two out of five star for three simple reasons. First of all I didn't agree with her idea of a perfect world. Jonas's world is far from anything that I would consider perfect. Secondly, I didn't think this book was very interesting. I had trouble reading more than two chapters at a time because the concepts of the book bored me. And lastly, I disliked the ending. I can't tell you about it but if you read this book after my review you will probably agree with my opinion of the ending. I would recommend this book only to those who like slow reading books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is a very opinionated book. Different people will think different things about the book and I think there are too many choices to make at the end of the story. In The Giver, a child named Jonas is getting his new \`assignment' for his life and he just happens to get the \`Receiver of Memory'. He then must receive memories of things that other people in the community do not know.In the Giver, Lowry tried to make some sort of Utopia (Perfect World) and wanted to show that this would probably never happen and that this world might be perfect but there are still some flaws in it. The author also tries to show that our world also has flaws. I think the author tried to go too far into the future because it might be a long time until we invent or do things [are bad] as: people come and take your dishes at night, when you get hurt or have pain, they bring a pill to you and the pain just goes away.I believe this book should not be intended for children or young adults, I think it should be for people 14 years and up. This book should not have been made for everyone because it shows a kid that committing suicide will get you out of a problem or a bad situation. This book haunts me in my sleep and I am 12, I'm not scared of hardly anything but this book scared me. Just think about it, would you want your child to be reading a book where a 12 year old washes and cleans and elderly person? Would you want your child to be reading a book where somebody injects a baby in the head with some sort of liquid? Would you want your child to be reading a book where a boy dreams of bathing a girl in his sleep? If I could, I would ban this book in any library or store. Because of these reasons, I give The Giver one out of five stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought that the giver was a very good book, it was very suspensful and I really got in to it.

He begins to experience pain and suffering in our world today. These feelings are so strong to him because he lives in place called the \`'Community'' where everything is perfect, nothing goes wrong and there is no pain at all. As he learns more about these new experiences he begins to unveil the secrets oh the \`'Community.'' All in all, I highly recommend reading it and it's a great buy! -Julia C. Viegas"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois LowryHave you ever wondered what the world would be like if everything was perfect? What if there was no violence and no hatred? Imagine a world devoid of color and only minor differences exist. Imagine being able to take a pill that solves all of your problems. For the normal person, this type of world seems to be non-existent. There is no way in our world, which is consumed by chaos and violence, could such a perfect place exist. However, if one was to pick up The Giver by Lois Lowry, they would enter a world that is seemingly perfect. After exploring its pages, we begin to question the validity of this utopia. This book is the perfect introduction to utopic societies and leaves the reader wandering, \\"Can a utopia actually exist?\\"The Giver is about a boy named Jonas who lives in an utopic society. The story begins right before Jonas's Ceremony of Twelve. At this ceremony, all of the students born the same year as Jonas will turn 12 years old and receive their life assignment. Unlike in our society, Jonas and his peers are not able to choose their profession. Rather, they are assigned a profession based off the observations of the elders in the society. Jonas anxiously awaits his ceremony with nervous anticipation. This will be his last ceremony and the most important ceremony of his life. All ceremonies up until this point each presented a new element to Jonas's life. For example, at age one babies leave the nursery and are given to their parents, at age nine students are given their bicycles and become mobile. However, at age 12 students are given their life assignments and officially become adults.When the big day finally comes, Jonas is told that he would be the new Receiver of Memory. This is the most important job in the community, and only one is selected every several decades. Jonas is afraid and excited to receive his new position. Jonas soon begins his training and falls under the leadership of The Giver. The Giver is the current Receiver of Memory and his job is to hold all of the memories of the world. He slowly begins to give Jonas memories of happiness, love, joy, and excitement. However, after Jonas becomes comfortable, The Giver begins to give Jonas memories of pain, suffering, sadness, hunger, heartache, and other terrible feelings. Jonas has never been exposed to these things and it becomes very difficult to bear.Convinced that the community must change so that they too can experience all of the wonderful and painful memories, Jonas and The Giver makes the decision that Jonas will leave the community. After he leaves the community, his memories begin to fade, and it is believed that they fall back on the community which he left. The end of the novel is quite vague. Jonas and baby Gabriel, a child that he has taken with him, are at the top of a snow peeked mountain and begin to ride down on a sled. In the distance he hears what he believes to be music. At that moment the novel abruptly ends. Some speculate that Jonas and baby Gabriel actually die and he is going to heaven. Others suggest that he has returned to his society, except the society now has the memories that he left behind. The author never gives a definitive answer, but it is up to the reader to decide.This is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is written in such a way that it can appeal to readers of all ages. It forces the reader to think outside of the box and dare to imagine a world which is perceivably perfect. It also forces the reader to question their own ideas of perfection and the possibility of a perfect world. I can think of no negative traits about this book. Lowry has truly opened our eyes to a world that is so crazy, that it actually makes sense."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I just got done reading this book for the second time. I decided to teach it to a young girl I am privately tutoring in English. I hadn't read it in about five years and was concerned that it might seem dated the second time around. HARDLY!This masterpiece of Lowry's is for the ages. My student, who normally does not enjoy reading, would take every opportunity she got to \\"see what happens next\\" and often read past what I had assigned her.This book is a wonderful look at what happens when we cease to celebrate diversity and difference. Granted, this is a science fiction novel, but it stems from very real problems. \\"Sameness\\" may be convenient, but it is also a tragedy.Furthermore, for any of you who have read and loved Margaret Atwood's \\"The Handmaid's Tale,\\" this is the junior version.This is a book for every age group and a book that is guaranteed to have one asking questions not only of society, but of oneself as well.A Fabulous Read, and at 180 pages, there is no good excuse to pass it by.P.S. The ending is something of a controversy and it makes you, as the reader, decide what has happened (much like Atwood's novel). Truly, this is an exercise that will show you whether you see the glass as half full, or half empty."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am not the kind of person who reads one book more than once in a short period of time but the Giver was an exception. The first time I read it I couldn't put it down. I read through math class, through dinner, after my parents told me to turn my light off I read it with a flashlight under my covers until I was done. For the next month I couldn't get it out of my head (the first sign of a good book) so I picked it up again. I read for what seemed like barely minutes but must have been hours because by the time I stopped I was more than half way through. I seriously got lost in the Giver and I have a feeling I will need to read it quite a few more times before the year is over.This book is about a perfect era. There is no pain. There is no fear. There is no sorrow. But there is also no love, no color, no music, no snow, no pure joy. Everything is planned and calculated so there are no choices. There are rules for everything. When you get too old, break the rules three times, or are simply a baby that won't develop fast enough, you are released, sent Elsewhere. But Elsewhere isn't what the people are led to believe. Children don't live with the people who gave birth to them but with a 'family unit,' two people who applied for spouses; babies. There is only one person who remembers what used to be, who remembers love, color, music, choice. He is the Reciever of Memory. The Giver.I guess I don't really have much original to say about this book that hasn't been analysed and discussed thouroughly already, but just imagine if that is our future, total sameness. No individuality, no pride, simply sameness. If that is what we are to become, than what is the true cost of pain? It's true that war must end and that starvation is torturous, but I think we can fix these things without getting rid of love.I think everyone should read this book. It is a bit disturbing and it makes you think, but it is not jut your ordinary fluffly little kid's book. Some people commented that because it was about a perfect place it wasn't exciting or scary. But it was the perfectness that scared me. Now I know that perfection has a cost. And that even that whicg appeears perfect could be, in fact, sheilding the lies."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I was unprepared for the depth of emotion that this lovely little book showed me. This book is not as famous in Australia and I bought it on the strength of the reviews here on Amazon, but I must say that whereas the reviews do it justice in terms of how strong it is and well written it is, I was not prepared for the tears I cried at the end, and how much the story has effected me. I find myself thinking of the central characters days after I have finished reading it.I need not relate the plot, that has been done very well here, but it is all too easy to think of the things that we so willingly give up for an easy life. Is this a prophetic book? This is certainly an interesting point of discussion. My copy has a commentary by Ms Lowry at the back, and I noted with interest (through my tears) that the book is well read in Germany, where students read it in conjunction with stories of their own modern history, and I thought that this was a really telling observation.I bought this book for my 12 year old daughter, but as she was half way through Harry Potter's fifth adventure, I thought I would read it first, and I'm pleased I did, as \\"The Giver\\" is a book that needs to be discussed and the reader almost de-briefed - it is such a powerful book. So a message to all you parents out there - if your children have read or are going to read this book, you need to read it too, and give them the opportunity to discuss the themes and issues raised within. This is not to suggest in any way that the book should be withheld from young readers - just that there will be value in your family to be able to discuss the characters and the future world in which they live.It is a wonderful book - witty at times, and as I said, I cried at the end. It is a truly powerful book that can make you laugh or cry, and this does both. But anyone who dismisses this as a simple \\"young adult\\" novel is sadly mistaken."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I began The Giver there was a sense of longing. A world where there is no crime, hate, or fear sounds perfect. It describes utopia, 'a place of ideal perfection especially in laws, government, and social conditions'. It is very similar to Sir Thomas More's book Utopia. And like Utopia, there are many contradictions in this world.The community's purpose is to create uniformity throughout the society. This is seen in the indistinguishable clothing that is worn, the elimination of material possessions, and the identical family units consisting of a male and female parent and a son and daughter.\\"Almost every citizen in the community had dark eyes. But there were a few exceptions. Jonas himself, and a female Five who he had noticed the different, lighter eyes. No one mentioned such things; it was not a rule, but was considered rude to call attention to things that were unsettling or different about individuals.\\"(p. Lowry 20)Using the word individual in this quote contradicts the message it is trying to convey because the goal of this community is to eradicate any form of uniqueness.In a Utopian society everybody's work is considered equal and important. Yet the book includes undertones, which uncovers hierarchy within jobs. When Lily confesses her desire to 'get assigned to be a birthmother' she is immediately chastised and is told \\"There's very little honor in that Assignment.\\"(Lowry. p21) This alone shows the societies unfavorable stance towards life when a job that is directly related to the giving of life is thought of as inferior.Overall Lowry's Utopian society exemplifies a lack of trust in human nature. Decisions are left up to 'The Elders' therefore eliminating any free will."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A great Book in which A boy in a socioty based on everything being the same finds out he is to be the next &quot;receiver of memories&quot; someone who bears memories so that the people are satisfied with what they have and don't want to be different."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Givers plot and characters pull you into the book, you find yourself unable to let go.

A life without any feelings or memories of the past is an excelent theme for a (children's)book! In my opinon her writing-style is simple and good understandable,without foreign words,which is typical of children's books.Her usage contains some extraordinary words like &quot;Receiver&quot;,&quot;Giver&quot;,&quot;Sameness&quot;,&quot;Elsewhere&quot;or&quot;Family unit&quot;.Makeing use of these she builds up her (and also the reader's)&quot;futur-world&quot;, which is very best explaind. The story is pretty exciting because of the strange atmosphere of a life without feelings or emotions,a lot of rules/regulations and the rise of Jonas's behavior the more he knows about the past. There are some highpoints, f.ex. the videotape of Jonas's father killing the babies or the warfar-ememory,which lead to the &quot;real climax&quot;,that is Jonas's and Gabriel's flight out of the community.This rise shows that Jonas's character changes in the story."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lowrey's &quot;The Giver&quot; deals with the story about the 12 years old boy Jonas.In a perfect world with no crime, poverty and feelings, Jonas is choosen to be the &quot;Receiver Of Memories&quot;.

In my opinion everyone should read the book, because it is very interesting to see what a society can be like.And also Lowry's ideas, how the society is characterized, are very interesting."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry\`s book &quot;The Giver&quot; is very interesting.It is about a world in the future where love,pain and feelings do not exist.At the Ceremony of Twelve Jonas ,a twelve years old boy, is chosen to be the new &quot;Receiver of Memories&quot;.After this day he gets the point that life is not so perfect like he has thought before. The book is written in 23chapters.In my opinion the first eight chapters are a little bit boring.But after the Ceremony of Twelve in chapter eight the storie changes.It is very fascinating because you gets an interesting insight into the future.I can only recommend this book,because it is very interesting how other people think about the future.In this book the future is discribed realistically."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's &quot;The Giver&quot; is about a world without emotions and truth and about Jonas, a twelve-year-old boy who lives inside this world. He is chosen to be the &quot;Receiver of Memory&quot; and works together with &quot;The Giver&quot; to reveal the truth about their existence. Lois Lowry's style is not too difficult to read and the links are easy to understand. However, she knows how to present a book, in which she wants to make people think about themselves and the world around them but is never getting boring. By writing the book in that way she creates a wide readership and does not stay on a small group where the age chooses the reader. The book deals with an interesting idea of moral and ethic and tries, from my point-of-view, to stimulatepeople to think again and not only live their lives but also look to the left and the right and the rest of the world and the rest of each ones own world. When everyone knows what happens around, things cannot change without the choice of the people. In fact, the first parts of the book are far too unexciting and unsurprising but around the 12th chapter, the book becomes more and more a psychological one with deeper meanings. For myself, it is a book which is a must-read but more than something to beat a bored evening. The Miracle"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's novel &quot;The Giver&quot; deals with the prolems which a perfect world -one without pain, hunger or diseases- might cause. I think that this is the most provoking book I have ever read. With echoes of &quot;Brave New World&quot;, Lowry examines the idea that people might freely choose to give up their humanity in order to create a more stable society. The story is skillfully written and the theme of balancing the values of freedom and security is convincingly presented. Lois Lowry steps beyond the limits of the life we know and develops new concepts never thought of before. Skillfully she brings the latter into the reader's mind."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a fantastic story. If you like a story that grabs you and holds on - this is it. I loved being in another world with different ideas and values and customs but most of this book challenged my thinking."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book overall was great. The Giver talks about a utopian society that aims for sameness. The receiver escapes and causes the memories he has received go back to the people. It is all good except that in the last chapter it is a terrible ending. The receiver is ending his journey and yet the author cuts it off with that he saw lights and remembered love. Then it all ends. No mention of how it was like to get to the houses or anything. Completely terrible ending. And the trilogy as described in wikipedia is loosley connected. In fact, not even the same main character is used in the next book, gathering blue."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is a Fantasy Dystopia tale about a young man named Jonas who lives in a \\"utopian\\" society where no one questions authority and no onehas access to information about the Earth's history or human history. In this society everyone is assigned their career or duties at the age of twelve, Jonas discoversthat he has been chosen to be the new Receiver, a mysterious job that is rarely assigned. Jonas reports to \\"The Giver\\" and learns that he has been chosen to receivethe precious gift of truth. In a world where everyone has been shielded from pain, hurt, emotions, and choice Jonas must learn to deal with the harsh reality ofhis perfect world."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book gave me the chills. I loved the bold, crazy concept of it: a young child learns what it means to be The Giver of knowledge to his bizarre society...he's been chosen to absorb the experiences and emotions of the wise, old sage (the giver), but in the process, Jonas loses his childhood. Although I saw some of the hardballs of this story coming, they still whacked me in the head as I read them. Nicely done! I haven't been able to shake this story from my brain."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Really enjoyed this book. Easy read...interesting storyline. I wasn't thrilled with the ending. Would love to see a sequel written."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a book that I cannot wait for my children to get old enough to read. My husband, father and I all read it at the same time because a friend of ours who is a school teacher asked for our opinion. We were all in unanimous agreement that this is a fantastic book that everyone should read. Lois Lowery does a great job weaving a story about a different kind of society in which everything seems okay - at least until about a third of the way through the book. Once she's reeled you in she lowers the subtle boom and shocks you with the way in which this \\"okay society\\" isn't so okay and leaves you wondering if it ever will be.Respectfully - CB Anderson"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book \\"stirred\\" my imagination, made me think, and will stick with me for a long time. The problem for me was the fact that it was a little too believable. Scary, but far-fetched? I'm not so sure! I think that there are those out there that would like to control our world...just think, no conflict on any level.(Now I'm sounding paranoid!) I certainly don't mean to imply that I agree with the book, because I don't....but..well, food for thought. I didn't realize how far the control went until I got to the part about the colors. Wow! I thought at first that I didn't like the ending all that much...I like to have things spelled out for me. But, once again, the more I thought about it the clearer the final picture became. Really good read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I was a bit hesitant to read this one - the cover doesn't speak to me. BUT, boy, am I glad I did! The Giver gave far more than I could ever have expected. The characters were so real, I could reach out and touch them. And the world is hauntingly terrifying in its sameness. That is exactly what would happen to us if we gave up our free agency to choose - even though agency is a double-edged sword that can inflict so much pain on us. I really like the concept of The Giver as a custodian of memory. This book is a brilliant read - sadly a bit short, I could have done with a few more chapters - for anyone wanting to explore how the world would be without choice. I loved it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Another book bought for someone. Received the book in near new condition, and friend was satisfied and happy. thanks again!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I do not usually read books set in an Utopian society. I first read this because it was assigned reading in school. Since then I have read the book I read over and over again. The characters are strong. The messages are strong. It would make an amazing movie."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I found this book a very interesting story. I especially liked the way the world in which Jonas lived in was displayed. It was a sad story, because you could see the frustration that Jonas was having, yet you knew that almost no-one could help him. The giver himself was a kind gentleman but it was hard for Jonas to get through to him. You felt for Jonas and the giver, because of the secluded world that they would have to live in. This book touched my heart and I thank Lois Lowry for writing such an inspiring story for young adult readers."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"On a scale of 1 to 5 stars, this book is definitely a 6! I bought this book on Friday, didn't began it until Saturday morning and had it finished by Saturday afternoon. It is excellent! Set in a Utopian-type village, where life is &quot;perfect&quot;, one boy, Jonas, is selected to be the next &quot;Receiver&quot;. He will learn about what life used to be like. He will discover all the joy and pain that accompanied people in the land of &quot;Elsewhere&quot;. This book is incredible! I'd love to sit here and tell you every little detail, but hey, that would ruin an outstanding book for you! I absolutely loved it, and there couldn't have been a more appropriate ending, for those of you who said the ending wasn't so great. Read it! One of the best I have ever read, and I have read a lot of books! JANE EYRE is still my favorite, but then again, it is hard to compete with the classics. Lois Lowry does an excellent job, very different from her usual &quot;Anastasia&quot; books. This novel is superior! Well, stop listening to my praise of this book and go out and buy it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an excellent book to read. It was kind of hard to get into the book at first, but after I knew what was going on, I loved it. Lois Lowry wrote this book superbly. The ending, however, was very strange. Maybe it's just me, but &quot;maybe it was just an echo&quot; doesn't sum up what happened to Jonas. I don't understand the connection of the ending to how &quot;The Giver&quot; in the book told how he had the capacity to hear beyond his regular limits."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"THIS BOOK WAS UNDESCRIBABLE.IT WAS SO AMAZING HOW THE AUTHOR WROTE THIS.

The rest of the book was very nice and easy to follow. I think that all children should read this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought that this book was wonderful...in many ways, it is a lot about philosophy. It was interesting to find out that in the time that the story is set, there isn't any color, any feelings, any hurt. Everything around the whole Community is controlled, even the weather. Everything is perfect. At least, it seems that way.When Jonas has to recieve all the memories, he learns that life in the community is not what it seems. There's cruelty behind many things that the community does, and they do it without even realizing that it's cruel.I thought that this was a great book, and recommend it to anyone who is interested in philosophy and the way the world is, or wonders what the world would be like if everything was the same, or perfect."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It gave me a view I had never seen before, that maybe perfection wouldn't be so great. I realize now that differences are wonderful.

It is about a 12 year old boy named Jonas. He lives in a community where everything is decided by the goverment. There is no free will or choice or color. When Jonas turns 12, he is given the job to be a reciever of memories. A way to think of him is an encyclopedia of memories, feelings, and pain(like sunburn) that is never used. When he is given his job, he learns by the end of the book that his &quot;perfect&quot; world is not that at all. The ceromony of releasing, which at first is said to be expelation, is really fatal injection done to people ranging from the age of newborn to elderly.

He is shocked about what the lives of people are like outside of the commuity, and about there &quot;choices&quot; in life and how there is color. This is a very good book and I highly recomend it!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"i dont read very often, but i took the time to read this one. i absolutely loved it. if you are into science-fiction you will enjoy this. i still to this day read, and re-read this book. it is possibly my favorite book i have ever read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This well-written book portrays the journey of a young boy who fights to give the society in which he grows up in a better understanding of the world they live in. The Giver is a fantasy that explores a utopian community and allows for the reader to question their beliefs on the definition of a perfect world. The novel fits the fantasy genre because it is set in an imaginative world. The main character, Jonas, is living in a fantasy world fighting to live in the \\"real world\\". The author, Lois Lowry, has a well-developed plot with a definite rising action, climax, conflict, and resolution. Also, there are many literary elements that help keep the readers actively involved with the use of figurative language and suspense that is created throughout. The author uses euphemisms to help soften the reality and build vocabulary and comprehension skills. The book's ending, however, leaves many unanswered questions to what really happened to Jonas and the community he left behind. However, this seems to have been the author's purpose. The Giver is a great instructional tool for building reading skills in the upper middle grades to early high school. There is adult content in the novel that is definitely for a mature audience. It should not be taught as a silent reading book. There are many instructional activities to enhance learning through out the book such as; journal articles, creating a graphic novel, comparing/ contrasting activities, and many more. There are also many Internet resources for both students and teachers that provide excellent learning materials to follow the novel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think it must be more difficult to write Children's fiction than Adult Fiction, and more difficult still to write a Children's story that adults like and can relate to. Lois Lowry has this gift. The story is very compelling and thought provoking.It is ultimately about the lack of freedom of choice and its consequences. Everything in The Community is controlled and you have absolute rules to live by in order to keep the community peaceful and happy. Only one person in the community knows the truth and sacrifices made to be able to live without strife....he is The Receiver of Memories. He holds the memories of what was the past. He holds pain, sorrow, loss, love, joy, torture, war, climate: He holds it all so the community doesn't have to. Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memories when he becomes a 12. The old R of M becomes The Giver as Jonas becomes the new R of M. Through The Giver, Jonas begins to understand what is behind the facade of his community, thereby forever separating himself from it because he can never go back to the way it was, not with his knowing. Then he is faced with a life or death choice. What he chooses is brave and mature.I absolutely will read more of Lois Lowry. She does not disappoint. I recommend Gossamer, a very heartfelt and engaging story."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a house with his \\"family.\\" He lives in a world where you go to school until you're twelve, you get assigned a job, and you start training. When you start having certain dreams you are given a dream to calm them. You may apply for a wife/ husband and the council will give you one. The families can contain two adults and children. He lives in a world with no choices and no decisions.This book is about decision-making and how to make choices. I have a strong connection to the book because of my family of five. It is hard to choose a favorite part to the book because of how well the subject is enforced and how well it is written. My least favorite part of the book however is the ending because it leaves such a large cliffhanger for you.I recommend this book to anyone who likes sad books or can withstand them. This is a very well written book and anyone can read it, 11 or above.By,Alex Roesch"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was assigned to my kids for 7th grade Language Arts.

All the people who wrote one, two, or three star reviews didn't understand the concept of the book! I am in middle school and i got this book. When i started it, it was confusing but if you keep reading, you get the since that Ms. Lowry doesn't give away everything-and that makes it such a great book. YOU have to fill in the pieces. About the concept of releasing though-it isn't good for children under 5th grade, but it isn't as gory as many percieve. At first i didn't think of it as a gross thing by the actual process, but the fact that one of the main characters didn't give a care about it!

Several years ago I read \\"Gathering Blue\\" for my own enjoyment. Both of these books are by the author Lois Lowry. Overall, I think these books are great.In \\"The Giver\\", Lois Lowry creates a world where society is peaceful but very boring. The people in the Community know nothing about true pain, or love, or death because they are sheltered from it. At birth, they are born into a world which is shielded from anything in life that can harm them physically or mentaly.Lois Lowry uses interesting dialogue and unexpected plot twists to keep the reader interested in this world and its people. The main characters are mostly children around 7 to 12 years old. Some adults interact with htese characters. Some are teachers and others are parents. In fact, The Giver himself is an old man.I wouldn't say that this is a happy book. In fact, there are some disturbing ideas in it. There is a part of the book that refers to children being deliberately killed. The parents of younger readers may not want their children exposed to this kind of subject matter.However, I and other kids in my class found Lois Lowry's \\"The Giver\\" to be a very interesting read. I loved it, and went on to read her book \\"The Messenger\\" which uses characters from \\"The Giver\\" and \\"Gathering Blue\\". If you like science fiction/fantasy literature, then you might like these books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Would you give up color, uniqueness, and choice to live in a community without pain, hunger, or feeling? In Lois Lowry's The Giver, Jonas finds himself asking whether he could do the same. He has grown up in acommunity of sameness, and after a suprising ceremony of the twelve, he become the next Receiver. Some ofthe main characters are Jonas, his family unit, the Giver, and the new child Gabriel. As the Givertransmits memories of love, truth, and pain, Jonas begins to realize that his community and family haveno true pain or knowledge. I really love this book because of the unpredictable twists that are put in,like the true meaning of release. Also, as Jonas takes us through his point of view, on a quest to free hismemories, everything fits together so perfectly. The open ending does leave me hanging, but Lowry mentionsa young boy with pale eyes in Gathering Blue, the closest thing to a sequel to this fiction novel. I would recommend this novel to all middleschoolers who like reading man against world and courage. The only question left is, Can he make it?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book,as distrubing as it was, was an excellent sci-fi book that, though odd, makes us all see that there is not, on the Earth we know, a place where everything is perfect.......as we can not know true happines or pleasure without first expiriancing pain and suffering. Jonas makes me(I am also 12) think more, though this is a reach, more about the freedom of choice, for in the Community, there is none. The book striked as a powerful reminder that there is not a better world than that the one we live in, for there would be no happieness if it were the same as the Community, and no feelings. Without feelings, we are not human, and the people in this book scared me that some day there really may be a place that comes around here or in some other life where there are no feelings, color, or, most importantly, love. :"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A universal Utopia, that's what the Giver is about.

It was through doing this that we came to the conclusion that this book is too simple for our mature minds. We believe this is an appropriate book for younger children, ages ranging from 10 - 14. High schoolers tend to think more profound and educated thoughts and this book was not realistic in terms of a teenager's state of mind. We believe this is a good sci-fi book, but in our class room atmosphere, we analyzed it when it should not have been analyzed.

They were in 7th grade, and didn't understand the significance of a utopian society. How could they? They don't have the tools to understand something so deep. However, reading this book as an adult was amazing. I started looking around the world and looking at things in a whole new light. Today we live in a world that is being made more and more centerist, one in which everyone has the same things, same opportunities, etc. Like the world Lois Lowry creates, we are losing history and it's a very small group that still remembers and studies what life was like.

I think it is a good book, and definitely a powerful read for children since it introduces some thought provoking questions and makes some very pertinent points about individuality, the balance of pain and pleasure, and other such topics. But I was not amazed by the book.The story lacks a certain depth that I'm accustomed to, which is likely attributed to the fact that it is a children's book. I'd give it five stars for being a great read *as a child's book*. From an adult perspective, it's probably more of a three star book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Here are reviews from three very different people (mine, and then my two kids)...This book is definitely worth the read, and NEVER should be banned from any library (as it has been and some think it should be). Every library should have several copies. I don't think it should be required reading for children under the age of 12, however I don't think it would really hurt them, they just won't get as much out of it as they will when they are older. My kids didn't like the ending, but I thought it was a good dending, especially if there will be sequels (which we learned there are).I want to quote portions of the two top reviews because they made some very good points and I agree whole-heartedly with them:\\"Good literature makes readers think. Banning this book takes away the freedom of speech, the freedom to read, and the freedom to learn and explore. The banning of The Giver is ironically similar to the actions of the Community that lead the Community to its suppressive and stifling state. A powerful story, The Giver keeps readers in suspense, touches them, and stays with them for a long time...\\"\\"Although there are aspects of this Community that we may find unsettling, we must remember that Lowry is not advocating this system. She is, in fact, inviting us to consider whether our own society has any of the characteristics of the Community that disturb us:Do we attempt to make our lives pain free?Do we attempt to erase unpleasant memories?Do we use euphemisms?Do we use robotic phrases, as for apologies?Do we have anything resembling the \\"House of the Old\\"?Do we have a ritual that might be called a \\"Ceremony of Loss\\"?Do we attempt Climate Control?Do we avoid talking about ways in which we differ from each other?In our own Society, without a designated Receiver of Memory, that responsibility -- with its inherent pain and exhilaration -- falls to each of us. Vital questions for us to consider are Which memories will we receive? Which will we give?\\"P.S. I had the privilege of listening to the audio book by Listening Library (unabridged, read by Ron Rifkin), rather than reading it myself. The reader did an excellent job and it was probably more enjoyable and better understood than just reading the book for myself.I aked my kids to write (or give) a review of their own, and since they do not have their own Amazon account, I will just add them here:Here is what my son says about the book (he is 11, in 6th grade):\\"I enjoyed the book, it was entertaining, but it was very confusing at first. The end was very stupid to me, and I do not recommend reading this book if you don't like to read a whole book and then the end ruins it.\\"Here is my daughter's review (she is in 8th grade):\\"I'm 13, and I liked this book very much. At first it was a bit confusing because the world in the story isn't like it is today, but soon I realized what was going on, and I really enjoyed it. I didn't quite like the ending because the book didn't feel finished, but since there are sequels I guess it's ok. I liked the over-all story line; there was a lot of mystery and suspense, and it was very fascinating because it is so different from the world we live in today. It was very weird, but it made the story that much more interesting.The world the main character, Jonas, lives in is a \\"perfect\\" world; a world without conflict, poverty, unemployment, or divorce. Children never disobey, and everyone gets along. But as the story goes along, Jonas realizes that his world isn't so perfect after all, when he realizes what the real world is like. His world doesn't have snow, it doesn't have hills, it doesn't have the ocean, and it doesn\`t have birds. You don't get to pick your own spouse, and you are only allowed two children, one male, one female. Everyone except Jonas thinks it's perfect. Jonas wants to change things back to the way the real world was, but that's a lot harder than he thought.\\""},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I'd never read the Giver until a couple years ago. Great book. Kind of a children's Gattica, or a slant on A Brave New World, except with hope instead of depression.Journey with the main character as he finds a magical layer of reality beyond the drugged mundane life The Government had planned for him (and the rest of society...).I thought the ending was a set up for a sequel... And it was. I haven't read that one yet, though."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is all about what it would be to live in a perfect world and have everything planned out for you. Everything is in perfect order. The people have no worries or cares in the world. The community strives for \\"sameness\\" in which everyone is equal or the same. Each member is assigned a position in society. Jonas sees this as a problem. The community selects him to be the \\"reciever of memories\\"Only the giver can bestow this gift and only he knows the truth and he must pass this knowledge off to Jonas.But how will Jonas percieve it. The giver is an extroadinary book about what it means to live in a perfect world.

It really makes you think and offers many different interpretations and readings. A must-read book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A really terrific read. This book is ostensibly for the Young Adult market, but I was thoroughly engaged. It reminded me of Ursula LeGuin's \\"The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas.\\" It is a dystopian children's novel, which you wouldn't think of as being a big hit, would you? But it is. Slowly, the dark side of the \\"Sameness\\" cloack under which the community lives is revealed, and it's quite chilling. It made me think, and question. It kept me guessing, and desperately wanting to know what happens next. I look forward to reading the next book in the trilogy. Well done."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Although I have not read this edition, I read this book in middle school and it genuinely changed my life as a reader, a writer and the way I live my life and view the world. I know, it's that good."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I've been looking for this book forever. I first read it as a small kid & had forgotten the name. It's a story of a seemingly perfect society but something amazing & deeply disturbing is behind it. A science fiction story in its own right. That will leave you feeling more than you might want to."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I was in 8th grade five years ago, this book was assigned for the class to read. Never, up until that point, had a book made me cry as when I read this book. I can truly say that this book is one of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this back when I was in seventh grade. This is a very interesting story and still till this day I enjoy reading this book now at 22 years old. I'm not a fan of reading novels, the book has to come to life for me to stay entertained and this book does so.Lois sends you to this world they are living in, you feel everything that is going on in the story. The society that is illistrated in this book is very different but yet similar to governments in the past. They live in this perfect world where your future is chosen for you. I highly recommend this book, its a book you can read over and over."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a book about a boy, Jonas, living in an idealistic society. I enjoyed this book because it made me think. It was also, in my opinion, well written and quite interesting. Other people who wrote reviews stated that the book \\"was boring,\\" \\"wasn't appropriate for children,\\" or \\"was poorly written.\\" One even said that this book would turn kids off from reading. Some books are written to make you think, not to make you go off and buy the sequel. I liked the simplicity, too, and thought it reflected the society in which the book took place. Personally, I would recommend this book to a person who has the ability to think about somewhat deep topics. Regardless of your age or gender, The Giver is a book that will leave you thinking."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was a beautiful read. It sucked me in from the beginning. Classic Dystiopian! Well thought out characters, great descriptions, easy to picture this story in my head. A short 188 pages but felt like it contained so many more pages than that.Jonas is worried about what the society with assign him as his job. In this society there is \\"Sameness\\". No color, no difference. A pill is taken to repress sexual feelings birth and death is handled very clinically and very detached. All of society has no feelings and no choices. The society has decided that this is the best way. When Jonas is chose to be the new Receiver, he must receive all of the memories that the society cannot experience. As he does, he awakens to how limiting his society is and a world without love, color, feelings and memories is very plain. For a society who emphasizes the correct use of words, many words have lost their meanings without feelings and memories to define them. Jonas struggles in his position of Receiver and questions the organization of the society. He questions his fathers role as nurturer and his friend as caregiver for the old. Ultimately Jonas make a choice that will impact society and his life and things will have to change.I was sad to reach the end of the book, and it left me having more questions than answers. I am really looking forward to the next book. I hope it will answer my questions.This is more that a YA book. This book is relevant to adults as well. In a society that values \\"Sameness\\" how is there room for individuals and acceptance of those individuals? Our society should pay closer attention to the words between the lines found within this fabulous book! One of my top 5 reads this year!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"my teacher had us read this book with my seventh grade class and i felt like this book was the only book that i really enjoyed out of all the book she has picked"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought the book was different and kind of weird.

I would recommend to people who like fiction and have a good imagination!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Because Lois Lowry received a Newbery Award for this book I began reading with high expectations.

I'm not much on Science Fiction/Fantasy, but with this book it seems almost like it could happen. It's so easy to get in to. The way it's written, you get something different out of it each time.

It was interesting how Jonas finally found out what price his community paid to have a perfect society, and how he alone had to bear the burden of the memories.

I believe every young person should read The Giver--if for no other reason than to be provoked to thought about these issues."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was definitly one of my favorite books.

It's a very unfamilair world where no families exist only units. I thought Lowis Lowery was very creative and the book was wonderful. I still think it was one of those books you can't put down and have to finish. One of the best books I've ever read!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was a great book and it made you ask a lot of questions. The problem with that is that there aren't any ANSWERS!!!!!!!!I know the author wants us to use our imaginations but at least give us something to build on. Nobody knows.

Or, is it something more like the INVASION OF THE HUMAN BODY SNATCHERS????Too many questions, not enough answers!!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is truly a remarkable story in many ways. From the first, I fell in love with the utopian Community, a place of comfort and belonging. Like the main character, Jonas, I had to learn the hard way that nothing's perfect. As it was meant to do, this book raises questions about the balance of freedom and order in society, but the truly remarkable thing about it is that it tells this in such a way that us children can appreciate. I read this book every year, each time understanding a little bit more about what makes us human and what the ambiguous ending really means. I will never be the same for having read this book, and I thank you, Lois Lowry"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was the best book I have ever read.

This book is about a boy named Jonas that lives in the community and has been selected by the Giver and the Chief Elders to be the new reciever of memory. At first Jonas feels a little weird about being the new reciever, but then later in the story he learns to like the memories that he recieves (except the bad ones.) Jonas did not enjoy getting all the sad memories.Once Jonas starts getting these memories there is no turning back. Can Jonas learn to live with these memories? Will Jonas have the heart to pass them on? READ AND FIND OUT!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A Thank You to the author of this fantastic story. A friend suggested this book a while back, I'm sorry I did not read it sooner.

Until the character &quot;The Giver&quot; exposed to Jonas how cruel the actual world was, and used to be. The truth about release, and how this one receiver carries such a huge responsibility. The last 10 chapters are what makes this book a certain classic. A GREAT book with a riviting and unexpected ending. A must read for anyone who likes books at all"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Hi, my name is Ashley Dean. I am a seventh grader at Cadillac Middle School. In the past month I have read a book of yours. I thought The Giver was a great book, especially at the end. My favorite part of it was at the ceremony of twelve when the Chief Elder skipped Jonas. I think it would be a good idea to make a sequel to it. It was very tempting to read especially at the end, but I wish it would have told what happens to Jonas and Gabe."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was one of the most interesting books to read. It was very easy to read, and I would really recommend it to people of all ages. These people lived in a world where there were restrictions on practically everything. Even left over food was to be recycled. But for a community that was to be so perfect, well I've got my own response. When Jonas was picked to be the new reciever he was very scared because he really did not know what to think. Jonas and the Giver developed a friendship that could last forever. But I believe that the best thing that could ever happen to him was to just plain and simply leave his home. But what really got to me was the fact of how they decieved others of what being released really meant. The fact that they killed the lighter of the twins just because there could not be two of them was one of the most cruelest things yet. But in a so called perfect society I believe things like that would happen every day. It's just the only two people who knew what feelings where just couldn't take it anymore. Jonas left and the Giver had been living ten years of grief because his only daughter Rosemary had wanted to be realeased. So if you have an hour or so to spare this book would be a great one for you to read. Or if you were interested in what you might think the future would be like in another 100 years I believe this would give you some insight."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Your book the giver was a very good book and I hope that you keep on writing the same kind of good books for me to read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I loved this book.

At least make a second book that is about 100 pages or more. I read the book every chance I get because it's a great book. Next, I would like to talk about Number The Stars.

My class just finished the book, The Giver. I thought the book was very well written with a lot of detail. My favorite part of the book was when you described the memory of snow. I liked the way you described it using words like: crisp and cool. As I read further into the book the more I wanted to read it. I thought the part were he is at the ceromony of twelve and gets his assignment was a good part because you didn't know what was going to happen. Toward the middle of the book you started to see that his world was very diffrent from ours. I think you should write a sequel to The Giver because at the end of the book it just left you sitting there thinking about what could happen.

I thought the book was a good view into science fictioned life. It started out very detailed and explanatory, which I like, but toward the end it became a little confusing. Like when Jonas and Gabriel reached Elsewhere. What I thought from that was that you wanted the readers to make-up their own ending, but I think you should help us out and tell us what you thought was going to happen by writing a conclusion to The Giver. Thank you for taking your time to read this letter. I hope you consider writing another book about Jonas, Gabriel, and Elsewhere, and what happened after Jonas stopped taking his pills.

Unfortunately for \\"The Giver\\" it has also been one of the most controversial and banned books throughout the years. \\"The Giver\\" has been banned by many schools and other institutions because of some of its themes such as euthanasia, infanticide, suicide, and also some of the violent and sexual passages that many thought were inappropriate for young minds. I disagree with the banning of this book because it is one of the more inspiring intellectual reads out there. I believe that many, young people especially, could learn and benefit from the themes that are taught in this book.Lois Lowry uses the premise of a utopian society to introduce to its readers the lifestyle and cultural differences that could be faced, while still having a subtle undercurrent of deception. This Let the reader know that something was seriously wrong in this seemingly wonderful lifestyle. I really loved learning about this secretive world and discovering along with Jonas that not everything is as it seems and that some rules were meant to be broken. \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry is a though provoking and delightful read for readers of all ages and personalities."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"How would we react to a perfectly organized world? This story gives us a glimpse of what that would be like. We meet the characters and learn what moves them or what doesn't. At first we accept the world as it is, just like Jonas and his family. We wait to see a little deeper into this society and when we do, through Jonas' memory transfers, we see its grevious faults. We are rewarded by Jonas' heroism and his great sacrifice to reach something better.The reader is moved through the plot at a steady pace.

It is a very satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read a lot of young adult books growing up, and I couldn't tell you the names to more than half of them any longer, but The Giver is one of those books that I distinctly and vividly remember to this day.

Some of the situations are disturbing - I remember getting nauseous when learning about the main character's father's real job within the society.

Very good book for a bookclub."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver starts off like a X-Files thriller, a strange airplane appears in the sky. Jonas's intensity -palpable-will make your heart throb. Yet, you will soon realize that it is a false alarm and the story settles down-you begin to be drawn into Jonas' world, his life, and his rules. This is suppose to be a futuristic book, but many of the aspects of the story are true today-society and parents are trying to control every aspect of the life of their children, without much input from the them. More than that, I think author showed that even if we try, we will in the end fail. Many parents would deny this claim, but in doing so, they are being disingenuous."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a well thought out book with excellent descriptions, realistic characters, and a strong moral, and yet it follows a depressingly familiar path worn to a rut by Aldous Huxley, Ray Bradbury, and George Orwell. Lowry obviously thought very hard about what would be the most realistic and assessable utopian society and wrote a tight and believable description of it which gives the reader a strong, but not overbearing, feeling that this indeed could happen. Sadly enough, Lowry's ingenuity and superb writing skill are overshadowed by the superlative predictability of the plot. The triteness of yet one more anti-utopian society will probably be lost on reader in the intended age bracket, but it would be hard to cover the fact that Jonas takes a while to make revelations anticipated by his audience, and his readers will be ahead of him throughout most of the book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had read this book when I was younger, but was reassigned to read it for a class assignment. The first time I read it, the futuristic awe of the book passed me by, but after reading it again I've realized what a great vision into the future and inspiring novel it is. If you liked this book, you should also read the book 1984."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Analysis of THE GIVER After I had completed reading The Giver, by Lois Lowry I began to think about life in a different perspective. The ways society was run and how the people were selectively placed in their family groups, was all very thought provoking for me. I felt that it was interesting how the community determines what job each individual would perform once reaching the age of twelve. It was obvious to me that the state of government in this story was run entirely by communism. This made me realize how much I take for granted how appealing it is to live in a democratic society. This aspect where every citizen in the community is tightly controlled and limited to almost everything they chose to do frustrated me. It was like there were no freedoms given to these people at all. The memories received by Jonas from the Giver really added an important factor to an important theme to this novel. This part of the novel was very enjoyable to me. These memories passed on by the giver made me realize the things in life I take for granted so frequently. I really felt sympathetic to Jonas and to the other people of the community that had never experienced the simple things in life, which the Giver was giving to Jonas. Although this present state of life within the community revolves around protecting its citizens from receiving unfavorable memories, in effect restrains many enjoyable memories, which these people can't experience."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It has been several years since I have read any Lois Lowry, yet The Giver fully met my expectations and the standard I have come to recognize from Lowry's works.I think the book's importance is to make the reader realize that one is never helpless, regardless of the situation at hand, and that some how there is a way out. For our world to keep on turning we must be forever instigating change, at any cost. Jonas' world was one of regulation, control and most importantly denial. Everything from the matchings of husband and wife to the climate was carefully and meticulously calculated assuring that nothing or no one could go wrong. When Jonas becomes aware of the &quot;Elsewhere&quot; (the outside world, only alive in the memories of the Receiver) he realizes the importance of getting out of the control, and so he runs away saving the live of baby Gabriel who would have been &quot;released&quot; because he did not fit the so-called standards of the society. In other words something had gone terribly wrong during his production and he, a difference must be weeded out and destroyed.Another very important theme in The Giver is the importance of memory. Before Jonas is given the assignment of &quot;Receiver&quot; he is unable to realize that another way of life could exist. Yet his ignorance is by no way his own fault, for until he is introduced, or given the memories of another life, he couldn't possibly realize that it once existed. His society has successfully extracted all emotion, all feelings including love, the warmth of sunshine, the coldness and adventure of snow and the brightness of colors. Once he is given the memories he escapes his controlled community in search of the very essence of life his memory has been filled with.Because this book was written as a children's book, I think that many times it is easily overlooked. Though the language is simplistic, the ideas and themes are by no means easy to understand. The struggle for independence, change and difference are important to any person searching for themselves, and extremely vital to teenagers who are desperately searching for their own freedom. The theme of memory teaches so many lessons, ensuring that mistakes won't be made as strong as they were the first time, enabling a person keep in touch with their roots, and reminding us that we are forever changing, and that we constantly need to be changing.I strongly recommend this book, as a reminder to ourselves that we mustn't forget who we are and that we can't close ourselves off to change."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas' world could very well describe what our world will be like in the future. Color, emotion, and free choice will be nonexistent. One person will hold every single memory in the world. Old people and unwanted infants will be silently and invisibly killed to keep the population steady. The entire enviroment will be monitered so food can be grown all year long. Lowry beautifully writes this as a warning to us that if we don't take care of our world, this imaginary place in our minds may one day become all too real."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I could not believe that this book was threatened to be taken out of the school district by the parents.

The Giver is very incomplete, with a lack of detail about the society and an incomplete ending. It is prophetic in fortelling a possible future, but I just read This Perfect Day, and Ira Levin's reality seems more feasible."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was one of the best books that I have ever read. It was unpredictable the whole way through! I cried when I found out about Gabriel. I suggest every reader to read this! A five star!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Our class read &quot;The Giver&quot; as our class novel. At first, I didn't think I would like the book because I'm not really into science fiction. But once we started reading it, I kept looking ahead to see what was going to happen next. Our teacher always kept us in suspense by stopping at a really good part. I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It is a very good book. It's about Jonas who was selected to be something very rare, he was selected to be the Receiver of Memory. He thought he lived in a utopia, a perfect world, until he found he paid a terrible price for it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's award winning book, The Giver, is about exactly what I want to avoid in the future...a totally mapped out life. Jonas, a young boy about twelve, has a very important position in his society. After he turns twelve he and other twelve year olds in his community are given jobs to have for the rest of their lives to serve for their community. The world and atmosphere that they live in is colorless, the children have no real family, and they can see what their future will be on a piece of paper before they live it. When Jonas' special twelve year old ceremony comes around he is appointed the most important job of all... The Giver. The Giver is a person who stores all the memories, colors, feelings, and worries of the blan people in his town. But the Giver is a toughter job than Jonas expects, he is scared to face what lay ahead of him. He has heard of a Giver before that suffered much pain, for she was not used to the real world, only her sheltered one. But can Jonas withold the position?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"As a child, my younger sister once said, &quot;Interesting is an interesting word.&quot; In that context, &quot;The Giver&quot; is a VERY interesting book.I've been reading for decades. My youngest daughter has been reading a few years. After reading &quot;The Giver&quot;, she was anxious for me to read it. She wanted, perhaps even needed, to discuss it with someone. This was a first, and I obliged.Some books tell compelling stories. Others exhibit artistry with language. Some do both. &quot;The Giver&quot; does something else too. I'm not sure what it is, but it was there, you could feel it. If you're looking for an unusual reading experience, read this one."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is just one of those books that just sucks you in; you just can't stop reading it. If you're one of those people who is not really keen on reading, then this is the book for you. If you don't really know what you're taste in reading is and you like exciting and interesting books, this book is perfect. The Giver takes the reader into the future and describes what life would be like with out feelings or LOVE! One boy is singeled out because he is different, and he is taught to become the Giver. Although this book is set in the future, you can stikll relate to it's message. The Giver is a book that I will never forget. by Amanda Tarplin"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book, like Number the Stars, is serious but well writen. I pull it out out of my bookcase again and again. The Giver though it is a good book, has a sudden ending which cheats the readers out of enjoying it as much. It could have had a much better ending. Still, I highly recomend this book [the middle part at least]!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It is good because it makes you think, it's not just there for pure intertainment.

To be honest, I didn't think I would like this book, but several hours later I finished it. WOW!!! I couldn't put it down. I truly liked Jonas, his family and his friends. And, as I came to know The Giver, my heart went out to this man. I hope all goes well for Jonas and the members of this community. Lois Lowry did an outstanding job of creating a furturistic world which seems to be perfect, but in reality is as imperfect as our own world. I am busy recommending this book to everyone I know. We are going to have a book discussion program in our church for children fourth grade and up accompanied by a parent, teens and adults. We are looking forward to it. Those in our church who have yet to read it are very curious when those of us who have read it go into a corner and discuss what we've read in hushed whispers. Thank you to Lois Lowry for a fantastic story!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book was great. Our grade 8 class read it, usually I find books boring to read, but in my perspective I found that I was really interested on the ways they did things. This book was probably in the far future or it was on a different planet because nothing really made sense to be in our modern world or any kind of community in the past. I think the end was really open for thought because the memories could've made him see or hear anything or maybe it was real and there was such places that were described in the memories and he had gone there. It could've been the ending for a sequel to a next book, I'm not sure. To say it again, I thought the book was !!EXELLENT!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowery is the true &quot;Giver&quot; in this book. She offers the reader a lot to think about, and digest. The time is the future. What seems like utopia, slowly turns into a furturistic nightmare. It makes the reader think long and hard about the world we live in now, and how some of the choices we've made could lead to disaster down the line. This book should be read by everyone from ages 12 years through adult. This should be an Oprah Book Club choice."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"From its terrific opening line (\\"It was almost December, and Jonas was beginning to be frightened\\") to its closing image of an exhilarating sled ride, this work of speculative fiction keeps the reader engaged and thinking. Imagine a closed community in the far distant future which has no animals, no music, no weather apart from mild nothing, and no love. It's a village from which variety and diversity have been expunged, full of people who do not experience strong emotions or perceive colors.The rule-driven community runs like clockwork: everyone has an assigned job, mate, and children. Difference, disabilities, and dissent are simply not tolerated. As in the dystopian novel Brave New World, children are created in batches. They are raised to the age of one by a staff of nurturers, then distributed to suitable couples who have been matched up by committee. Everything is mandated by committee, down to the smallest detail like what toys children can play with and for how long. Sickly children, elderly people, and disorderly citizens are eliminated by lethal injection (\\"released\\").But the normal emotions, perceptions and memories of human beings have not been lost: they repose in the mind and person of the community's Receiver. Like a bizarre Christ figure, the Receiver bears alone the messy, complicated, chaotic thoughts that human beings used to experience. He or she (the Receiver is an appointed post) also contains the positive memories: sunshine, rainbows, Christmas gatherings. The Receiver holds those emotions and memories apart which would otherwise complicate the perfectly ordered community. Without a container, these memories would be part of everyone in the community.Jonas, the protagonist, becomes the Receiver in training, and starts to receive the memories telepathically. He quickly becomes convinced that the situation is untenable. The people should experience these emotions and learn to cope with them. With the encouragement of the Giver (the former Receiver), Jonas makes a daring escape from Sameness. The community, without its Receiver for the first time in ages, will have to manage as humans have always done.The book is smoothly written, and presents a credible alternative universe. It might legitimately be called fantasy fiction, or even science fiction. Any middle school reader could handle the text and its underlying ideas, but like all great children's literature, adults would appreciate it as well. The author turned this book into the first of a trilogy; the other titles are Gathering Blue and The Messenger."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I picked up this book because I wanted to compare Utopian to the Dystopian literature I've been reading lately. A Newberry award winning novel published in 1994, Lois Lowry's, The Giver, tells of a world in which choice and free will are virtually unknown by it's inhabitants--There is also no crime, hunger, pain or poverty. This seemingly perfect existence is appealing on the surface, but all a reader needs to do, is explore the world that Lowry creates in The Giver, to understand the concept of a Utopian society is a misnomer.The plot revolves around the novels young protagonist, Jonas, as he approaches his twelfth birthday. Upon the twelfth birthday, all children begin the transition into adulthood and are assigned their occupational roles in the community. Jonas is chosen to become the next Receiver of Memories, the most honored position in the community and a skill no other member of the community has. During his tutelage, Jonas gains the memories of centuries past, of those that lived before, that go \\"back and back and back\\", and the facade of his safe existence crumbles around him as he learns about choice and free will.Some of the imagery that Lowry creates reminds me of the 1998 Hollywood blockbuster, Pleasantville, staring Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon. Jonas, the 12 year old protagonist in the novel is like a younger version of the character, Mr. Maguire played in Pleasantville, and he wins you over with his upstanding moral character, innocence, compassion and curiosity.The Giver is a very short book at only 180 pages, but complete in it's message. Supporting characters never fully get fleshed out, but they're not the driving force behind the authors message. The world building is--it's precise and genius in it's simplicity. I found this book a quick, utterly fascinating read--the ending, disturbing yet thought provoking. Thousands of reviews demonstrate why this novel is a must read for those interested in Utopian or Dystopian Sci-fi."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Village constitutes a totally controlled society where people's lives have been stripped of every possible kind of experience -- the lack of sexual feeling, strong emotions, color, and music, are stressed, yet remain placid because they are provided the basic physical amenities. Control is exercised over children with punishment sticks whenever they break any rule. Repeated transgressions can lead to being \\"released\\", which children are led to believe means being sent away from the village. Anyone who has read this book will understand the goals of a totalitarian society to control every aspect of their people's \\"lives\\". I feel that even people robbed of memory and culture would still feel more need for self-expression and individuality than permitted, and not be so docile. I half-expected to learn that they were simply being raised as fodder for some alien race, so empty were their lives. I found nothing to praise about their lives, and hoped for a more general revolution.While the book is unexpectedly creepy, it has value as an extreme working out of the absurdity of the desire for a society where all people are the same. I believe it would be very disturbing, especially the ambiguous ending, for children."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book, like most, in junior high as an English requirement. It turned out to be one of the best books I think I read as a teenager. There was a lot to learn in this book, like all of Lowry's books. There is so much emotional detail to the main characters it is impossible to avoid feeling the happiness, sadness, confusion and remorse that they feel. When I am between reads and looking for another, this has become one of my go to books for a quick re-read. Although I absolutely love the book itself, I gave it 4 stars due to the nature of the read. The emotion that is so well written into the characters can really be too much depending on the emotional maturity of the child reading. I do however recommend this book as a quick, fun and informative read to any adult. It is truly an eye opener into the issue of the problems of conformity and makes you truly thankful for the freedoms and diversity we have for us today."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry uses very direct writing to express how humans have changed their lives into something that cannot exactly be called 'life' anymore. Set in the future, the book describes the life of a boy named Jonas who lives in a 'Community'. Jonas gets selected as the Receiver of Memory at the age of twelve, the age of maturity in his Community. Before his training, Jonas was like the rest of the Community; ignorant to all that is happening elsewhere. They do not even know what animals, snow, rain, music, colors and sunshine are. But during his training, Jonas learns about the true meaning of life; its joys and pains which have been eradicated from the Community. During this whole time, a baby boy named Gabriel has been transferred to Jonas's family unit, to be taken care by his father, a Nurturer. Gabriel could not sleep soundly, and was sentenced to be 'Released' at first, but was given the chance to be cared by Jonas's parents, to see if he could change his sleeping habits. However, Jonas soon learns that Release was not all what he thought it was; it was not just the simple, humane and helpful act of transferring disabled citizens of the community to somewhere else where they could be better cared for. It was something that Jonas did not even think the Committee could ever imagine doing until the Giver shows Jonas 'Release' before his very own eyes...The book is a thoughtful and reflective read. It demonstrates how humans can become ignorant and toss away what is important and welcome unnatural things that they think are important into their lives. The only flaw in this book is that there is no clear ending of what happens to Jonas (who escapes the Community with Gabriel after seeing the Release). Readers are left at the cliffhanger worrying what Jonas will end up in. However, this might also leave readers pensive and allow them to think more on the book and its true meaning. Overall, a good and timeless read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Words Aren't FairBy Martha J. BieryAs a teacher of reluctant readers, I am always looking for a book that will spark the interest of my students - and this book is it! One of the most valuable traits of this book, beyond the lessons inside, is that the author allows the reader to make his/he own images with minimal information. What a gift to students who live in a world that loves to give them masses amd masses of visual stimuli! The minute my students try to imagine this gray world full of rigid rules and strange customs, they are creating their own images. And that's what sucks them in! One student went from a passive reader to a jumping jack, full of thoughts and ideas to share. This is my NO.1 book for middle schoolers."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read the Giver because it was my kids were assigned to read it in school. I am so happy I did. While it was written in 1994, it's message that becomes more true by the day. Sixteen years later we have more people on anti-depressants than ever, as if we can't handle our emotions. Will we reach a point where we'll do anything to keep from feeling bad? Trouble is, if we reach that point, we also won't feel anything good.Jonas, the twelve year old hero of the story is shown all the memories that his society has buried in able to bring peace to his world. He also discovers what happens to the less than perfect children. Armed with the truth, Jonas can make his own decision about his society and he does.I believe this book is as important as 1984, Brave New World, and any other book that shows us where the road we're currently on is going to take us. Thank goodness for brilliant authors like Lois Lowry who have the talent, skills and courage to bring these things to our attention. I hope this book remains on the must-read list for students for many years go come.[...]"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is targeted to a \\"young adult\\" reader (junior high and upwards). But at my age (considerably over 21 years old) I found it original, thought-provoking and to be a bit honest, a bit scary!I totally agree with the editors' reviews when they say that it's possible to get seduced into the quiet, orderly, apparently problem-free world presented here -- until we begin to see that all this order and apparent \\"peace\\" has some flaws -- and on further examination, the flaws become serious. Jonas, the main character, begins to wonder even on his own, and when his community chooses him to be the \\"Rceiver of Memories,\\" his uneasiness becomes even greater, and he begins to wonder if the tranquility and order of his community comes with a price that he doesn't want to pay.There are many reviews here that give a summary of the book probably better than I could. But I would like to add that Lois Lowry does a superb job of showing the problems that can come up in any society and she also shows that it's possible for dedicated truth-seeking individuals -- including young teens -- can make a difference.This book points out some of the problems that we encounter in George Orwell's book 1984 and the book BRAVE NEW WORLD, but on a level appropriate for young people to read as well as and \\"older kid\\" senior citizen like myself. I am impressed with the respect that Lois Lowry has for young people, because they most certainly CAN understand societal issues when presented in a form that they can relate to.I don't think I'll be spoiling it for you to say that this theme is continued in Lois Lowry's next two books in the series -- GATHERING BLUE and THE MESSENGER."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book recently for school, and I loved it! It shows us that life should not be perfect, and that faults and problems make life fun! I reccomend this book to anybody!! :)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I loved The Giver! The plot was well organized, and if you don't understand what happens at the end, read the two other books and it will explain everything. It had its moments when the plot was a tiny bit disturbing, but overall, I would definitely recommend this for 5-8th graders. Lois Lowry makes her readers think and imagine what it would be like if you lived in a community where every thing was perfect, politeness was a way of life, and choices were made for you. She writes in an easy to understand, descriptive way that I think all future authors should model their writing after. I think that most people 10-14 would like to read this, would understand the plot and read between the lines, and would be mature enough to read The Giver. (I would warn people about some of the transferred memories, though, some are a bit disturbing, such as war and poaching.Those aren't until later in the book, however.)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is the best book I have ever read.

It describesa world where everyone gives up, and decides that they can't live with emotions, to name one of the many things they gave up. Jonas, the lead character, was not given the chance to decide if he wanted to live in a society so black and white. He was born there, and nearly conformed to the rigid ways of the community. But he changed, and decided to leave to the community. The only way he did this, however, was with the help of teh Giver. I find this book realistic, yet full of hope. I applaude Ms. Lowry for having the foresight to write it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The giver is an absorbing novel by Lois Lowry which transports yo to a worls where everything is seen in black and white terms.

When he is picked to be the giver, a honored but mysterious and frightning position, things change even more.After he becomes the giver Jonas learns that his society kills non-productive members, Jonas decides to flee to a community lying &quot;outside&quot;, which is similar to our own.

One good thing about the book is that it is theoretically possible for that setting to occur in a nearby epoch.

And the part where I learned About &quot;release&quot; made me so angry that they were doing that to innocent people and I felt wonderful when Jonas and Gabriel found Elsewhere.The book was so touching and that's why I gave it Five Stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really enjoyed this story because the author, Lois Lowry stepped outside of &quot;life as we know it&quot; and brought new, never-before thought of concepts to the reader's mind. After reading, The Giver, I am very happy to live in such a wonderful world filled with colors, emotions and feeling. It was terrible to think of the world without these precious neccessities which we usually take for granted. I am glad it had a happy ending, where society was restored to how it should always have been!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Read at my wife's suggestion knowing that I am a fan of dystopia novels. Cleary an indictment of socialist societies where individualism is anathema and the state is the culture (as opposed to fascistic societies where the culture becomes the state). I do not fault the author for using the literary device of exaggeration to make her point, nor do I fault her for logical errors in her effort to create art, but what I found disturbing is the sub-textual moral of the story: that perhaps this present world we live in, rife w/ war, disease, poverty and injustice, is the best of all possible worlds, and that any attempt to engineer or manufacture a better, fairer or more just society, free of war, poverty and injustice, is at it's best, vain, and at it's worst, evil. In this regard the novel ceases to be a cautionary tale and instead stands as yet another literary validation of the virtues of the bourgeois existence. I suspect that in years to come, the same morons who seek to ban this book from classrooms on specious pretense will come to hale it as a literary masterpiece exemplifying the necessity of unfettered, free market capitalism, the superiority of the \\"traditional\\" family unit, the supremacy of individualism and the unqualified sanctity of all human life (without regard for the deaths of the innocents which daily occur in the perpetuation of that myth). I predict that Ms. Lowry will one day become the Ayn Rand of a new generation. My sympathies are extended in advance."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It is not hard to understand why the content, though seemingly complex, is in fact shallow. It is written for mentally careless or untrained people, especially children, that can be easily led astray if the content does not bring attention to unresolvable problems.

Considering I would like my children to develop a love of reading, this book doesn't seem to fit the bill, though they did say it was thankfully quite short."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Throughout this particular story, I was enthralled by the lack of writing talent. The only use for this book was for a coaster. Also, when I was cold, I made a fire. Lois Lowry is a disturbing author whom I think belongs behind bars. This selection would have been rated less, however (just like the Giver) there is a lack of choices for negative stars. The beginning was completely understandable, however as the book continued, I became more disgusted with the thoroughly perceivable message. Read the book, I dare you!

They're quite entertaining in thebeginning, but after awhile, the plot gets dull and eventually loses its flavor. The idea of having a perfect society is a good idea for a story, but dragging out the idea that the characters have no emotions gets a tad bit annoying. I get the idea that the characters have no emotions, but Lois Lowery has to tell the reader every other sentence. She acts like the reader is going to forget or something. I admit, the beginning of the story is good; how Lowery tells you about the society's rules, and the Giver's job, but after all that is said, she says the same thing over again. And the ending was the worst ever in the history of literature. This is a horrible book.

The beginning was terrible but the middle and most of the end was interesting at times. At the end of each chapter something happened that made you want to read more. I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone who likes lots of action and thrills, because The Giver hardly had any. Also, if you don't like to think a lot while reading, this book is not for you. There are also a few deaths, so if you get upset easily don't read this."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It sucks. First off it's exactly like the movie Pleasantville which really blew. Second off read the ending, He climbs up a snowy hill, the end. That's really cheesy and boring. Peace out my G-Unit homy. This book is whacked up, know what I'm sayin'."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I read this book I was in sixth grade. First of all I had a horrible time figureing out what was going on in some parts of its twisted plot. This was certainly the most depressing book I have ever read. When I sit down to read I want to be enjoying myself and this book really did not do that. Finally it is long. It seemed like it took forever to get through this relatively short book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas never knew that there was more out there. In the book The Giver by Lois Lowry, the main character Jonas lives in a totally controlled society, it is so controlled they can't even see color. In this story, the government controls everything. I do not like this book because it is written in a very formal style. Besides that, I think others might like this book because it is an interesting idea for a story.This book is about a boy named Jonas whose life is totally changed when he turns thirteen. He gets a very special job. Because of his job, he gets emotional. He can see colors and he can know the pain of the past. This job is unique because only one person is chosen for it. After a couple of months working he realizes what a terrible world he lives in and decides to go elsewhere to change his life.This book is written in a formal way that middle school kids might not understand. All the characters talk in a really stiff way. For instance, when Asher speaks angrily to Jonas, he then says \\"I apologize for not paying you the respect you deserve.\\" The language is hard to read, and this makes the book it confusing. There are common terms, like \\"released\\", that seem unfamiliar because they are used in a different way than I am used to. The type of dialogue the author uses makes the book hard to read.I would recommend this book for people who do not like action. This book is very slow. After I had read four two weeks, nothing had happened. I prefer book that are exiting like when you get into something right away. The story however had an interesting. Them that might interest some people.I seriously did not like this book. The dialog was confusing and it was incredibly slow. If there was a bit more action, I might have liked it. However just because I did not like this book, does not mean you will not."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In a world without feelings Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory. That means he alone has to keep all the memories of the past. Gradually he recognizes that the community he lives in isn't that perfect as it's supposed to be. Together with the Giver of Memory he makes a plan to bring the memories like colors and real feelings back to the members of community...I didn't enjoy the book very much. It's just one more book of those that \\"inconspicuously\\" wants to call attention to the grievances of the world."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is a very opinionated book. Different people will think different things about the book and I think there are too many choices to make at the end of the story. In The Giver, a child named Jonas is getting his new 'assignment' for his life and he just happens to get the 'Receiver of Memory'. He then must receive memories of things that other people in the community do not know.In the Giver, Lowry tried to make some sort of Utopia (Perfect World) and wanted to show that this would probably never happen and that this world might be perfect but there are still some flaws in it. The author also tries to show that our world also has flaws. I think the author tried to go too far into the future because it might be a long time until we invent or do things [are bad] as: people come and take your dishes at night, when you get hurt or have pain, they bring a pill to you and the pain just goes away.I believe this book should not be intended for children or young adults, I think it should be for people 14 years and up. This book should not have been made for everyone because it shows a kid that committing suicide will get you out of a problem or a bad situation. This book haunts me in my sleep and I am 12, I'm not scared of hardly anything but this book scared me. Just think about it, would you want your child to be reading a book where a 12 year old washes and cleans and elderly person? Would you want your child to be reading a book where somebody injects a baby in the head with some sort of liquid? Would you want your child to be reading a book where a boy dreams of bathing a girl in his sleep? If I could, I would ban this book in any library or store. Because of these reasons, I give The Giver one out of five stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a really bad book to read because when I was reading it I did not understand what the book was trying to tell me. If you're a student, I suggest not to read this book. There are many other great books you could choose that would be much more interesting.

I liked some parts of the book and some parts i did not like or did not understand.If you wold like to find out about more of my review please read on. The parts of the book that I really liked about the book were it's elaborations and how on some parts ho they made it clear and how they had great allusions and alsohow they made characters names fit the books such as Jonas,Gabriel,The Giver's name. Jonas which means (dove a symbol of peace).In the book how they showed this is when jonas found out that release meant to kill.When Jonas knew exactly what it meant he knew what he had to do and that they were going to release gabriel,he took Gabriel and took him to elsewhere and he left everything he knew and loved and left it behind just to save someones life not worring about his own."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, a book I read over the summer, was based on a young boy named Jonas who worked very hard to accomplish the goals he had ahead of him. One goal he had to achieve was the goal The Giver assigned to him. This goal was called the reciever of memorie. At first, Jonas thought he would never be the receiver of memorie. After all, it does seem like a hard job. Although he thought that it was hard, he found it easy and exciting."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book The Giver was wonderfully written by a very talented writer, Lois Lowery. On a scale one to five with one as the lowest and five as the highest, I would give this particular novel a four. I would give it a four because it didn't have enough action. I'm the type of person who loves action. One thing that made the book good was the allusions dealing with character's and objects in the book.For instance, Asher. He is a happy character because Asher means happiness. He always wanted to play or joke around. Also, Jonas, which means a symbol of peace. He always wanted everything to be fair and go smoothly. Another thing was that the people in their community didn't have to worry about anything because eveything was the same. No one had anything different.What one person got everybody got the same. To make this short and sweet the novel The Giver didn't have any racism or jealousy. They all had a life picked out for them. They didn't have to worry about anything. Sometimes I wish the &quot;real world&quot;, our world could be like that."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book The Giver was a great book that I really enjoyed. If I were to express it in 1 to 2 words, I would say it was confusingly, interesting. I enjoyed the book for a lot of reasons. Read below if you would like to find out some of these reasons. The main reason that I liked this book is because the book has its own life-style. The charachters in the book sort of lived in a very individual world, never guessing that a much larger world lay outside of thier boundaries. They went practally thier whole lives not knowing what the rest of the world is like and what different charachteristics it held. Another reason I liked the book is because It held fasinatig details about each charachter. For instance my faveorite charachter, Jonas, was described as a quiet person who respected all people. He was brave and thoughtful throuout the story. Those are only two of the reasons why I liked the book. What were yours?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I enjoyed reading the novel The Giver because it had sevral excellent ideas to show how familys should learn diffrent skills to help them later in life. One great thing about the novel was the annual ceremonies of twelve. The ceremony was an important event that begin at the age of one and ended at twelve. At the age of twelve the children recied their first assignment as a reciever. I think this is a great idea so that when they get older they can decide on a career that they can handle. Also, the family had family rituals where they would share their dreams and ideas.They shared their family rituals everyday.Some children had good dreams and others had terrible dreams They shared dreams everyday so if there were a problem about a dream the family can help solve it. I think that dream sharing is a great idea. I think the novel The Giver was a very excellent novel. I had sevral good ideas."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The novel The Giver by Lois Lowry is a very good book. The reason why I think this book is so good to read is because it giveslots of good details about the main characters and the community. Next, in the beginning of the book I reed that there was a kid named Jonas that always saw unidentified aircrafts flying over their community which I didn't think was so interesting in the first chapter. I think the author should of wrote different things that would have made the first chapter sound more interesting because when I reed the first chapter i found it rather boring but then when I reed more and got to the middle of the book it got more interesting because it had more action and other stuff.Then When I got to the end of the book I wanted to read it over and over because it was so good but I didn't get a chance to. What I really want to know about this novel is if something really happened like this before."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very inspirational book.It makes you think about how things would be if we lived like Jonas and his family, and the rest of the community. I would recommend this book to you because its different and interesting. I liked the book at sometimes because there was a part when you turned the age of twelve you would be assinged jobs of different areas of the community such as the Giver, Caretaker of the old, and there were many others but I am not going to give those things away. I liked the book and I hope that you will too."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"During the Summer I read a fantastic book called, &quot;The Giver.&quot; I think this book would rate a three star, on a scale from one to five. This would be about average. If there was a movie, I would rate it a PG-13. Why I rate this book a three is because I do not think some kids understand parts. For example, when Jonas has his flashbacks they tend to get confusing. This would be one of few major setbacks. I do not think I liked any part of the book the best. The reason is because I did not think the book was really that bad. I think you should read this book because it can teach you many new things. It teaches you of love, mystery, desire, hate, fear, and many others. It can teach you how to survive some of life's tuffest rides. To conclude my review, the book was great. Louis Lowry shows strong deposition in her writing. To me, that is a must in a good writer. this is my overall review on &quot;The Giver.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read a book called The Giver this summer.It was a fantastic novel.The Giver was based on a young boy who had the assignment of the receiver of memories. When he receives all the memories, he becomes the Giver. Then when a new receiver of memories gets chosen, the Giver gives the receiver his memories. Then it goes on and on and on. My favorite character was Jonas and I also liked Gabriel. Jonas was nice , sweet, and everybody liked him. Jonas liked everybody,too. He especially liked Fiona.I like Jonas.I think the book was kinda weird when I started reading it. When I finished it I thought it was wonderful."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, by lois Lowry was an exellent book as a drama series. Although it didn't have much action, The Giver was still a good novel. I like this novel because it has a variation of elaboration. If you are a firebrand, or emotional personIdo not recomend The Giver. If you can handle sad stories you should read this book. On a scale one to ten I'd give it a seven. I'd give this novel a seven because it had such goog elaboration, that I could almost see it as a movie. I took those three points off because there was not enough action. Me, Ilove to see action. The Giver was to realistic for me to enjoy. It was okay but Iam not that type of realistic person. I beleive that you should read The Giver if you like the type of story I have just explained."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The main character Jonas isn't happy with the form of government in his community, so what do you think he will do, run away? Well that was hard to figure out. No suspense or action is to be found in this boring novel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book to a boy named Hckmoud that cant read and has no clothes no food no shelter or anything he enjoyed the book and so did I."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The messages in this book promote socialistic ideas. Suggesting that imperfect young and the imperfect old can be removed from a culture is a scary idea. The thought of a sinful society ever being able to realize a non hostile environment where all people get along is misleading. The thought that a birth mother is an improved model over the traditional family is another lie. The whole book will leave most kids confused about the real world we live in."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book in about fourth grade, and I absolutely loathed it. I decided to give it another shot, and once again, found it lacking. Definetely not reccomended."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a very a weird twisted book. I do not approve of this book because it had way to many details that it got boring and it needed a better ending. I have to admit, that at the end there was a lot of suspence. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone because it made me think. I like books that tell you what is happening, not books that make you figure that out."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Can you imagine living in a town where everything is always the same? Thats how it is for Jonas, because in his town its nothing but just that. When Jonas turns twelve everything is a disaster... at least now that he is the receiver! Before he was the reciver everything was fine; there were no problems.The community was a utopia(perfect world). Now he is chosen to be the recevier then he finds out everything from what objects are colors are to the different types of weather. This story is a weird one. I personally dont care for it. This story is suggested to geeks or people who like confusing stories with twisted ending. So read for yourself and you'll find out."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"1,000 Monkeys + 10 Typewriters + infinte time = The works of Shakespeare10 Monkeys + 5 Typewriters + 30 minutes = The GiverPossibly the worst book I have ever read. Its only purpose is to take up your time. If I want to read fiction I'll read C.S Lewis or J.R.R Tolkien. I wasted a whole day on this book! And, if the author is trying to teach me something, I sure didn't pick it up. In the process of reading this book another thought came to me. If the author really put thought into this book, where there is everything from baby killing to a person burning up, then perhaps she needs a bit of R&R.; The Giver reminds me of what I think of after a real bad day. I hope you can see what I mean."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"i want to say that the real jonas,is in real an ALBANIAN!!!!The albanian has git the idia but they havent a pen to write...just that u know."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver wasn't really my type of book. It was good in a lot of parts like the dream he had about Fiona. I am a violent kind of person and I think this book could have used a bit more violence, but over all I rate this a one. Sometimes I wonder what the ending meant."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"that is recommended for students to read! It is ghastly! It starts out by sucking you into a mystery that you just can't figure out what is going on but with the ending you are left with a \\"WHAT?\\". My children were shocked to find out one of the main characters is a baby killer. What makes this book great? The others comment about the similiarities to the movie The Village but at least that movie has some good to it and has a message that doesn't leave you hanging!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great example of good literature. It has lots of feelings present. I could really connect to the characters. I could understand how they felt about certain topics. For example, Jonas, the main character, felt that there shouldn't be sameness. There was lots of description in The Giver. I could see mental images in my mind of when Jonas sled down the hill. Lois Lowry does a superb job giving you a description. There was also interesting details. You knew every aspect about every event in the story. She depicted every memory to make sure you knew what it was like as if you were there. For example, Lowry stated, \\"The brutal slice of pain...\\"This is why The Giver is a book with good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book \\"The Giver\\" in my opinion, is good literature. Firstly, it had lots of description. When a scene in the story was told, I could almost picture it in my mind. It created a visual picture which helped me better understand the story. Secondly, it had lots of interesting detail. The author made sure to include everything so the reader wouldn't have any questions about the whole idea of the community. Everything was answered. Lastly, the ending had a surprising twist. It left the readers to finish the book on their own. \\"...he thought he heard music too. But perhaps it was only an echo.\\" That quote leaves the reader to think of their own ending. While reading the book, you think you know how its going to end but you soon find out it's a cliff hanger. In conclusion, the book, \\"The Giver\\" is good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is good literature based on my 3 main reasons. First, it was full of adventure and action. Also it was full of feelings, and finally it had lots of description. It was full of adventure and action, because for example every memory Jonas had, like the memory of death and ware far. The book was full of feelings too, because when he had stirrings and when he had the memory of love and friends by the fireplace. Lastly, it had lots of description, for example when Jonas had the memory of him cutting his leg, the author didn't just say \\"he cut his leg\\" she gave a lot of description of how he felt. One quote is, \\"but it will hurt,\\" this shows that Jonas had feelings towards something and that the book is full of description. In conclusion that is why it is good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is good literature for caring, respect and responsibility. Jonas cares about Gabriel and will not allow him to be released because he loves him and has unlimited care for him. Also, Jonas shows much respect toward the Giver whenever he is in his presence. Plus, Jonas is very responsible for following the rules of his community. \\"Thank you for my first day.\\" That is an example of Jonas being respectful toward the Giver. He tells him thank you, which is a very respectful phrase. In conclusion, this book shows respect, responsibility and caring and is good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Abundance of interesting details, descriptions and relating to the reader are the most crucial characteristics to good literature. The Giver uses all three of these characteristics making the plot interesting and enjoyable. The Giver has plenty of interesting details to keep the reader hooked. Plenty of description lets the reader picture the settings and make their own opinion on the book. In the story, Lois Lowry releases little secrets at certain times to keep the reader enjoyed. When Jonas was given the memory of love, he went home and asked his parental units if they loved him. They replied with an answer that was not pleasing for anyone to hear. They answered him saying that they enjoyed his company and they were proud of his accomplishments. If I was in Jonas's position I would feel lonely and hurt. The end of the story was unexpected. Most readers expect an ending going into detail how the characters would turn out. However, the story leaves a cliffhanger allowing the reader to make their own decision. Personally, I did not like the ending because there was not enough details and descriptions that Lowry had given throughout the story."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is good literature because it is full of adventure and action. Also, it has believable characters. It has a surprise ending. The Giver is full of action when Jonas gets the memories of sledding down a icy hill. \\" Sideways spinning, the sled hit a bump in the hill and Jonas was jarred loose and thrown violently into the air.\\" Also, the escape Jonas did was full of adventure and action. The Giver has believable characters even Jonas was believable. Asher is also a believable character because him and Jonas act like people in our world do. Finally the ending was a big surprise. It was did not think the ending would be like that. It wasn't a good ending because he finds a random sled and slides down to a hill and hears music. This is why the book is great literature. It has a surprise ending, believable characters and full of adventure and action."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an example of good literature, because it had a very surprising ending. This text is very good literature, because of the way that the novel ends was seriously unexpected. It was completely shocking and I thought the author might say something like if Jonas and Gabe made it to elsewhere or they froze to death. The mid-to end of the novel was shocking because I was not expecting Jonas to run away with Gabe. But what I found to be the most shocking was that they were going to release Gabe the next morning. I thought Jonas and Gabe would make it to elsewhere and find a community or build a shelter and live they're the rest of their lives. I was not expecting the story to just leave you hanging like that. The novel The Giver says, \\"Behind him across the vast distance of space and time, from the place he had left, he thought he hears music too. But perhaps it was just an echo.\\" The novel The Giver was a very good book everything about it how creative it is, all the detailed events everything so I feel that the novel the Giver was a good peice of lierature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is good literature because its full of feelings, shares an important message, and it's full of adventure. This book is definitely full of feelings. This book makes people feel bad for Jonas because his community has no feelings at all! Imagine going throughout life with no feelings! The Giver's message is that you need feelings in your life. Without feelings we wouldn't be able to love or hate. Also pain is how we learn and get stronger. During the middle and towards the end of The Giver, it gets full of action. When Jonas runs away to Elseware, the setting changes and his life get harder and harder. It gets tough to find food, and he gets hurt many times. \\"His ankle throbbed as he forced the pedal downward in an effort that was almost beyond him.\\" This relates to the book because he goes through pain a lot during his journey. As you can see The Giver is good literature because its full of feelings, shares an important message, and is full of adventure."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was good literature; it had lots of interesting details, lots of description, and full of feelings. It had lots of interesting details when it told about each memory that The Giver gave to Jonas. It had lots of description when it said, that the Giver was going to give Jonas a memory of the war. They give a good description of it, they talk about the blood, guns and people dying. It was full of feelings when it said that Jonas asked his parents if they loved him. One quote was, \\" Do you love me?\\" Jonas said. His parents said that love doesn't exist anymore. As a result, The Giver is a good example of good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was not an example of good literature. It was confusing, and it had to many unanswered questions. Also, it was difficult to understand. The Giver was confusing because when she had the characters speak, it was hard to follow who was speaking. Also I think that the end was confusing as well because no one knows what happens. It's one of the many unanswered questions that could easily be answered; she never cleared it up so you don't know what happens to Jonas at the end of the story. It was confusing because when the Giver speaks about Rosemary and why she applied for a release it gets confusing because you can't tell weather they are flashing back to the past, or the present. \\"One for here, one for else where.\\" Lily chanted. The quote was hard to understand because when she was talking about it, we don't know whether she meant for one of them or the twins that were being brought into the community. All in all, I think that The Giver was not good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"the main characters of book is Jonas,the reciever,and Jonas family. The title of this book is The Giver by Lois Lowry. The setting of this novel is in a small cummunity. The main conflict of this story is basically Jonas trying to get away from the community cause it's not utopia. The utopia of this book is for every thing to be safe and no critism and the dystopia is that they released you if you do something wrong.the award of this book is that it receive a newberry award. My opinion of this book is that I sereously didn't like the book . It's too dumb because you get release for not doing somthing right . Come on. There would never be a place like that ever (EVER)."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"the giver was an interesting book but pretty lame and stupid"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I recently read The Giver in class. I personally didn't enjoy it. I thought Lous Lowery didn't do a good job of sticking to her story line. In some parts of the book she would say one thing the community did then the next chapter she would say something tatally opposite making the book not flow and make sense. Ialso thought the ending was to sudden and didn't answer any questions i had."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"...I'm the most bookish member of my family, and the only professional writer (pharmacology, medicine, government regulatory horrors) in the house. As such, I've often been called upon to handle the kids' -- and now the grandkids' -- difficulties with school work. My eldest granddaughter had been tasked with a summer reading assignment centered upon Lois Lowry's novel *The Giver* (1993), and she brought it to me because she was directed to read it with an adult. Her mother and both her grandmothers decided that I'm the adult. Oh, well.To skip forward a bit, as the granddaughter is now obliged to deal with the wad of photocopied work requirements associated with this book, I've been digging through the Internet to find background on this novel, and some sort of insight into the teacherly impulses so obviously behind the pre-packaged study assignments dumped on the poor kid in June. In the process, I've discovered (to no surprise whatsoever) that there's a massive presence for this horrible thing among the ex-Education majors.Understand, please, that I'm a science fiction fan. I'm thoroughly steeped in the genre. I also get my living through research and analysis. Spotting logical inconsistencies, intellectual sloppiness, and lapses in reasoning is the habit of a lifetime. I also used to read a lot of children's and young adult literature when my children were of an age to plough through such stuff, and I found much of it well-enough written to be pretty admirable.When I began reading *The Giver* with my granddaughter (who's a bit dyslexic, and needs plenty of help to translate text-on-page into thoughts-in-mind), I kept turning from the contents to the cover, unable to believe that this thing had actually won a Newberry Award. This book was supposed to be on a par with *Maniac Magee*? Or *A Wrinkle in Time*? Or even a second-place finisher like *My Side of the Mountain*? Then I checked out the Newberry Awards list, and took note of more than a decade of Major Suckage in kids' literature (to which, I confess, I've paid not a whole lot of attention in the years between my own kids' growing-up and the rise to reading of my grandchildren).\\"Ah,\\" I realized. \\"John Taylor Gatto's *Dumbing Us Down* - with a vengeance. Of course.\\"*The Giver* falls into a speculative fiction genre commonly known as \\"the dystopia novel,\\" which includes Ayn Rand's *Anthem* (1938) as one of the earlier examples. To the limitedly literate, Orwell's *1984* is perhaps the best example of this sort of \\"if this goes on\\" procedural, drawing horrible future visions from what are supposed to be lucidly reasoned extrapolations of societal ghodawfulness either proposed or actually in train at the time of writing. There are many more examples, one of them being *An Enemy of the State* by fellow physician F. Paul Wilson, written during the galloping inflation of Jimmy Carter's idiotic presidency.As a dystopia novel, *The Giver* is an example of Extreme Major Suckage. It is fundamentally dishonest as speculative fiction, and Ms. Lowry is wonderfully fortunate in that the majority of children today - the victims of \\"dumbed-down\\" government schools - are not customarily exposed to books like Alexander Key's *The Forgotten Door* or the juvenile novels written by Robert Heinlein during his contract with Scribners' in the '50s.(At this point I recommend that the people praising *The Giver* read Heinlein's *Between Planets* [1951] or his *Citizen of the Galaxy* [1957]. Compare Don Harvey of the former book - or Thorby Baslim of the latter - to Jonas of *The Giver*, character developed against character, situation contrasted against situation, context versus context, and consider that not only were Heinlein's books written for kids of the same age as my 12-year-old granddaughter but they hit print about 40 years *before* Ms. Lowry published *The Giver*.)The plenum - the \\"world\\" - of *The Giver* is logistically untenable. That's a fancy way of saying that it's too damned fragile to survive for any appreciable time as Lowry has described it. Societal systems of such cloying control, if they were liable to a breach such as that effected by Jonas in the story, would have been ripped to shreds long before the events of this novel.This is an important defect, inasmuch as speculative fiction of both types - science fiction and fantasy - relies heavily upon sustaining the reader's willing suspension of disbelief. Even with the factitious mental retardation inculcated by government schooling, I don't see much chance that a reasonably rational child of ten or twelve years' age could ever manage to get past the \\"Sameness\\" bilge (*Induced* absolute color blindness? Gimme a break!) much less the total suppression of human ingenuity and initiative needed to preserve the sociocultural stasis depicted in this novel.To put this in context, consider that the average episode of *Spongebob Squarepants* provides a deeper insight into human nature than does *The Giver*. Besides that, the Square One lives in a fantasy plenum - Bikini Bottom and all the silliness therein - that's actually better thought-out and more tightly integrated than the community depicted in Ms. Lowry's novel.I understand why the ex-Education majors (the public school teachers) like *The Giver*. After all, it's been \\"machined\\" to death with all sorts of off-the-shelf study points and similar pap to be regurgitated by the luckless student (which means that the teachers can stick it to their victims with about as much thought and effort as an oyster expends in getting his lunch), and it's not exactly an intellectual challenge. Education majors, after all, are without doubt the dumbest damned people graduating from college (see cumulative US military Stanford-Binet scores on officer candidates according to undergraduate major subject area; the three lowest-scoring categories every year are education, home economics, and physical education).Beyond that, though, public school teachers are the most thoroughly \\"velvet fascist\\" folks in the country. Think of them as Mussolini's blackshirts with an ostensibly kinder, gentler face - and a better public relations apparatus. These clowns secretly *admire* the \\"Sameness\\" in Ms. Lowry's book, and love to drown the kiddies in noise about how wonderful Jonas' community would be if only the governing thugs weren't as much inclined to have people \\"released\\" as is the average Texas politician.Yeah, right...."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I guess I didn't realize that this was written for someone's whose brain has not gone past 12.The best children's or young adult books don't every write *for* that crowd... this one tries hard to dumb down ideas, words, vocabulary--the whole thing.Wish I could get my money back."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I liked it better the first time I read it, when it was called Anthem (by Ayn Rand)."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Let's face it.

The author, Lois Lowry, is gifted, and what others have written about her writing is true - she is good at conveying degrees of pain and pleasure, astounding at introducing a concept as if the reader has never come across it before (color, music, etc.). The problem is Lowry's agenda, maybe only one an adult could see. The deep dark secret of Jonas' community is euthanasia - unwanted or unfeasible babies and the extremely aged and fragile are injected with death-inducing drugs. This seems to be a veiled attempt to poison the impressionable reader against abortion and the right-to-die, by playing on his/her emotions - Jonas is so stunned by what he sees his \\"father\\" do to a baby that he refuses to go home, and runs away from the community.

This book has a strange hold on my emotions and has sucked me back three times. The ideas that I read about within these well-written pages circled in my head for months after I finished the last page.

Not only is the story gripping, especially after you figure out what is going on, but the questions it raises are extremely thought-provoking. This book explores some of the great issues of what it means to be human - emotion, choice, free will, pain, and many other topics. She explores questions such as \\"what does it mean to have free will?\\" and \\"what does it mean to make individual choices?\\" Also explored are ideas such as abortion, euthanasia, collectivism vs. individualism, utopia, etc. Not only a gripping novel, but an extremely timely one as well. If you haven't read this book yet, please do so; you won't regret it. It is both entertaining and challenging, and has forced me to examine many issues in a more critical way. This book may change your thinking and will definitly challenge you in many key areas."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Imagine trying to function in a world without color, love, pain, or emotion. A world without life. Imagine living in Jonas's world; the world of the Giver. Jonas did live in a world like this and because of his secretive government he thought nothing of it until he turned twelve. When each child in the sommunity turned twelve they were given a career. Jonas was given the job everyine thought they wanted, the job of Receiver of Memory. But Jonas soon found at that receiving the society's lost memories is not all fun. With every memory of color, joy, and love came a memory of war, pain, grief, and sorrow.Readers with interest in any type book would love to follow Jonas through his enlightening yet agonizing journey of discovery. I recommend this book to people of all ages, young or old."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is among the best ones I have read and I think it is especially good for young people to read.

After all, the ending could just be a dream....)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My son read this book last year in the 7th grade and suggested several times that I read it also. To get that accomplished he made it my summer reading assignment! I am very glad he pushed me to read it. It is a very compelling book and one you won't soon forget. I highly recommend it to anyone - and particularly to anyone whose son or daughter is reading it at school."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It is a seeming Utopia. The children are all well mannered. The adults are content and behave in ways that benefit society. Everyone knows their place in society and all are content. It has to be a complete fraud. This is the world The Giver inhabits. The society rewards those who emphasize how they are the same as everyone else; differences are not to be discussed. It would be rude to discuss differences, and there are few differences as it is.Jonas is eleven. He is soon to turn twelve in The Ceremony of Twelve. Each December all of the children have a Ceremony graduating them into their next year of life and education and they are granted certain privileges at each step. In a society of sameness, Jonas is somewhat different. He is one of the very few with blue eyes and every now and then he sees a flicker of...something...but it doesn't last and he doesn't understand. At the Ceremony of Twelve all of the new Twelves are appointed their new jobs which they will do for the rest of their lives. Jonas is set apart even here when he is selected to the Receiver of Memories. It is the most honored of all occupations and only one person holds the position in the entire community. It is a great honor. It is also the event that shows Jonas just how different the Sameness is.Lois Lowry won the Newbery Medal for this book, which is perhaps the highest literary honor for fiction written for children. The Giver is deserving of this award. The Giver is written simply and is easy to understand, but there is a real depth to the storytelling and the lesson that Lowry is presenting here. Lowry has written about a society which has embraced being the same so deeply that any aberrations will be punished (to a greater or lesser extent depending on the violation) and something has been done that the citizens only know a certain amount about themselves and their world. It is very limited even though everybody believes they are truly happy, and perhaps they are. But the Sameness comes at a great price: The Receiver is the only individual who truly knows all of what was given up and what the rest of the world holds. He knows the very good and the very bad that the world has to offer. It is a crushing weight. The subtle message as Jonas learns all of this is that it is differences which need to be embraced and should not be something to fear. Differences are what make life truly interesting and worthwhile. But there are some out in the world who want to eliminate some differences because it makes them uncomfortable and The Giver is something of an answer to any sort of prejudice and misunderstanding and celebrates those who go out of their comfort zones to really see what differences are.What makes The Giver so remarkable is that it is a novel that works both for adults and for children and is highly readable for both age groups. Adults can enjoy the book just as much as a child, though perhaps in a different way. Highly recommended.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really enjoyed Lois Lowry's The Giver because Lowry uses a variety of literary techniques that contribute to the overall style and meaning of the novel. Imagery, metaphors, symbolism, irony, style, and language are a few of the devices used to create this piece of science fiction literature. Science fiction novels, in general, involve some sort of technology and often pertain to the relationship between man and society. The Giver portrays these characteristics very obviously and, therefore, is placed in the science fiction genre. In this case, the technology is so far advanced, that inhabitants of the city, in The Giver, no longer have to worry about problems that are contained in the \\"memories\\" such as pain, fear, and warfare. As a downside to this, they also cannot experience all the wonderful feelings and emotions of the past, such as love, color, exuberance, or immense joy. Society has decided that \\"sameness\\" is how the city will survive and endure. If everyone is the same (personality and routine), no one will argue, and virtually there will be no major complications. This style of living became habitual for the citizens and they eventually knew no other way to live."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"THE GIVER is one of those books that are in their own category. It's a fantastic book filled with suspense, mystery and deception. THE GIVER takes you into the life of a boy named Jonas who lives in a 'perfect' society which, evidently, is anything but perfect. It starts out when Jonas is chosen for a special job. Afterwards he discovers the truth about his town and his family. Jonas expieriances different feelings for the first time and he while some he enjoy, others he hate. If you want to read a really great book that is unlike any other book you have read before, then do yourselfe a favor and read THE GIVER!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought The Giver was a great book. It was very interesting and each page I read the more I wanted to continue reading it. Some of the things that made it interesting is seeing him find out about the real truth about his community. I think it was interesting to see that because once he turned twelve years old his whole entire life changed and he learned new things from a man named The Giver.The Giver had a major affect on how Jonas, the main character, lived his life. I thought this book was filled with great details and some good metaphors. A good metaphor in the book is when the author describes Jonas' eyes as being unusual and different. I think he meant the Jonas sees things differently then everybody else as you can tell from the book and how he acts. Some of the books great details are about where he lives and the things that go on. Like when they tell about the aircraft flying over his community and the trouble his friends got into telling people they would be released from the community when they were mad and not really meaning to say it.It was also a great plot. The community they live in seems interesting and you can almost picture it in your mind if you think about it. I did enjoy this book because of the metaphors and how you can picture things through the author's details. I think a lot of people would really enjoy this book if they read it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This a book everyone has to read. Young, and Old If your looking for a good book read this one.

This book tells about a perfectly planned community. The community was planned from their jobs to their families. I also liked the one part of the story when a kid named Jonas, who became the new receiver of memory, tried to escape from the community and save a baby's life. The receiver of memories is someone who gives memories of events that happened before the community was perfect to the new receiver of memory. He also tells the Chief Elder what to do when the Chief Elder doesn't know how to settle something.

It is so shocking and surprising. I now own the book and have read it many times, and my mom has read it too. I am now in the proccess of getting my dad to read it.

He is given the job that is highly respected in his community, the Reciever of Memory. As he recieves memories from an old man, known as The Giver, he begins to realize that his community is not so perfect and everything seems to be an act. He begins to feel out of place because he doesn't agree with the rules and assignments the community gives. But he can't leave his family and friends that he has been with his whole life. Or can he? He decides he has to do something and fast. As the novel ends it gets confusing and hard to understand.

And so Jonas watches his friends Asher and Fiona be picked for a especially chosen assignment, and one by one every Tweleve. But when she get's to Jonas's number--nineteen--the Cheif Elder skips it, leaving the crowd to wonder until it is announced that he is chosen for something special, that could make him a better person, or that could make him the saddest and most thoughtful person in the town, or yet something that could turn his life to bitterness forever...."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"this book has got to be in my top 10 favorites. it is so realistic and moving...i have read it over and over and it never fails to please me. i think this book is a must read for all kids. a definate book for people who love to read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I recently wrote an essay on this book. My topic was about how there can never be a perfect society. Our society today isn't great but if we force away the bad things then the good things will go with it. Just like in the Giver.

I had the impression that my students were really fascinated by &quot;The Giver&quot;. They were always well-informed about its content and speculated eagerly about remaining open questions. I can only recommend this book to other teachers who teach English as a foreign language. With the language being easy to understand, students don't lose track of the plot. In addition to that, the book never got boring, neither to me nor to my students.

In the begining, everything in the Sameness community is perfect, there is no fighting there is no pain. But there are also no choices.

Until the day that Jonas, a twelve year old boy is selected as the new Giver.&quot;He has been selected.&quot;He is faced with the pain and true pleasurable memories that most people in his small controlled community have never felt or could ever imagine, Jonas is also faced with the choice whether to live in a world with no feelings and no choices or to leave the sheltered life he has been used to for so long and pursue a life of love and happiness that the people in his community have never experienced.The choice is his. With the small child, Gabe, who has been living at Jonas' family unit, Jonas makes his decision. He decides that the sweet child deserves a life outside the community. They make a dangerous escape and for days they discover new and exciting things they have never seen before. They have left the comfortable place where meals and supplies were delivered right to their doors, to a place where they are starving and cold. But Jonas keeps going, he knows that there is something waiting for him and Gabe at the end of the road. He would rather die than live without the true feelings of life"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Everyday we make different choices. What we wear, what we eat and how we act are just some of them. However, in The Giver that;s not the case. Jonas, a young adolescent, lives in a community where all his choices are made for him by a group of elders. In this community everyone is classified by age. When a child is twelve years old, they are given and assignment that is their job for life. Instead of an assignment, Jonas is given a rare honor that leads him to realize how different his community is and what is outside of it. Because the story is told from different points of view, it is a unique reading experience. During the first half the story is told from first person point of view. Jonas is explaining how he feels. Later on in the book an omniscient narrator is interpreting every event. Lois Lowry writes the book in a way thatmakes you feel present throughout the book, witnessing every event. It is not extremely descriptive, nor is the reader unable to get the feeling of the book. I am glad I took the time to read The Giver. I liked the nook because not only do I like Lois Lowry amd her writings, but my peers have recommended the book several times and I still hadn't read it. I wouls reccomend the book because what Lois Lowry accomplishes is showing everyone why it's beneficial that everyone's unique and what our lives would be like if we were all the same."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The novel &quot;The Giver&quot;, written by Lois Lowry was written in 1994, and in the same year it got the prestigious &quot;Newbery Medal&quot;.

But when he gets his assignment, he starts to realize the lie of his society and discovers the dark secrets of the past more and more. The book has some positive and negative aspects,for example the sentences are not too long and often easy to understand and on the other hand the vocabulary is sometimes really difficult. But all in all this book is the best book I read in school. I like the plot of this science fiction story because it is not like many other films and books with aliens and starships or something like that. Maybe this story shows us the developement of ouf society in 50 or 100 years. So we should care about the future, the future of our children, so that nobody can be manipulated in so many ways and individual life won't get lost."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book in eighth grade.

It is creative and thought provoking and definately a must read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am generally not a fan of books set in a Utopian futuristic society. Brave New World and 1984 are others that I have read, but not thoroughly enjoyed. In this novel, Jonas, a 12-year-old boy, is given his assignment as \\"The Receiver,\\" which means that he receives memories of the world from the previous Receiver, now referred to as \\"The Giver.\\" In Jonas's world, there are many rules that that the members of this society have to adhere to, words must be very carefully used, and there is no such thing as color. As Jonas receives memories from the Giver, he decides that this world he is living in is incredibly unfair and devises a plan to run away to \\"Elsewhere\\" with a child. Although I typically do not like these types of books, I found this one incredibly easy to read. The one thing that I really did not like, however, was the ending. It is very difficult to tell whether or not Jonas and Gabriel actually made it to Elsewhere, or if they died from hunger. This aspect would be great for discussion though, because I could easily see students disagreeing greatly on the ending."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Each age has its own idea of the good life - and of its opposite. Lowry has done an exceptional job with the latter. This owes a lot toBrave New World, with it peaceful people drugged into passivity, but throws in the abolition of sexuality that others, like1984, have advanced. (I have to wonder whether this book's loss of color influenced later dystopias, like that inEquilibrium.) Then, Lowry throws in aggressive feel-goodism and praise of mediocre that have become so entrenched in the current education establishment - and a core of hypocrisy and casual brutality that chill even more than overt aggression.The central character is scapegoat-in-training, the child who will become the conscience of the community - the one who feels the horror so that others don't have to. If you want a clearly happy ending, well, you're not going to love it. That's your problem. This book's value lies much deeper.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas an eleven year old, is preparing for the annual Ceremony when he will become a Twelve.In essence, he will be leaving childhood behind and beginning the road to adulthood.

He also learns the great flaws in the society into which he has been born.The author, Lois Lawry, has incorporated in this story many concepts which are cleverly presented in order to show that the world is not a perfect place and in order to obtain the kind of perfection that is purposed, all undesirables must be eliminated.I'm not sure these concepts are evident to the average young person in the age group for which the book is targeted."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My daughter was 11 when we read this, and at the time it was the most thought provoking book she had ever read. The joy of seeing her mind open to new and difficult questions about life is what makes this one of my all time favorite books. It is impossible to read this and not question your own assumptions about what is good in life. This is a masterpiece that no one should miss!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry must know something we don't. Lois Lowry's book never fail to amaze me. The Giver takes place in the future where there is a perfect world. Nothing is wrong, everything is the same. There are no wars, no fighting, no pain. Everything is simply perfect. Or so it seems. In this world there is no emotion. There is no love. You are assigned a certain job, a wife, and a family. There are no colors, no variety. Everything is the same. Jonas is not an ordinary child. He sees things others don't, feels things others don't. When the day comes to assign jobs, Jonas is assigned as The Giver. The Giver is the one who has all the memories of the past, all the feeling, everything. This is no easy job, but can Jonas do it? This book is incredible, for lack of a better word. I recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Im a big reader and i was suggested this book in 5th grade by my library teacher. I was fasinated by it and it soon became my favorite book. there is some parts that confuse me like how there can be no color but otherwise i love the book. I recommend it to any big readers or kids 11 and up."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A small, thin novel, I read it within three days (I do have a life...really...). The world of \\"The Giver\\" is simple and easy, no choices to be made, no pain to be felt, everything is the same. So much so that there's not even any color to the world so there can be no distinction between anything. Once we learn the awful, terrible truth along with Jonas, it comes as a shock and makes us realize why this isn't such a good thing.Once again, a novel which makes me think, which I love. Individuality, choices, decisions we make, it's true, they could lead to war and violence and crime. But what do we lose in the process? Is relinquishing control to people who supposedly know better really a good idea? It makes me very grateful for the world as it is now, despite its problems; I enjoy feeling happiness and love, and I enjoy making decisions for myself, even if they are the wrong ones.I will admit, one thing I wouldn't mind from that community is someone assigning me a job; I've had trouble doing that for myself and finding something I enjoy. But even then I'd feel sort of like a robot...program me for the correct job and I will make the correct motions, no questions asked. Even if part of that program is something unforgivable.Ms Lowry did a great job in creating a community of people who are all stoic and sheep-like while still making them feel realistic, like this could truly happen in the not-so-distant future. It's a little frightening. Can you imagine apologizing for every tiny little transgression? Goodness, nothing would ever get done! ;)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was assigned to my kids for summer reading. They read it, begrudgingly, but liked it. Like many books, it didn't immediately draw me into the story. I had to work for the first couple of chapters to really care and I never felt invested in the characters throughout the book (the only reason I gave it 4 stars). The plot, though, was captivating. It unfolded at a nice pace. The ending was not expected (which I love) but was very warm and gratifying. It left an impression on me that lasted for days. Well done."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"We bought this book for a summer time reading project for 8th grade. I read this book first before my daughter, and I loved it! I'm 48 years old, but this book was fantastic!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Imagine a world with no hunger, poverty, malice, competition, hatred or war. Then imagine that world with no recollection of the past, no colors, no snow, no mountains, no sunshine, and more. Sameness. Complete order. That is how one would describe Jonas' world. Proves to say that there is no such thing as a perfect world...Everything and anything that you do are dictated by a council called the Elders. There are rules even for the puny little things. You cannot ask questions that will make it awkward for the other person, you have to use specific phrases for everything, you cannot ride a bike until you turn nine, you are not to lie, cheat or get jealous. One must take a pill when you reach the time of stirring or wet dreams to suppress the urges. You have a biological mother yet you will never meet her and she will never meet you. Cruel? No because in Jonas' community, they are called Birth mother, it is their job. A world where in you get released when you get old or if a newborn did not meet the community's standard for being healthy. A world where you are given a career at the age of twelve, a career that will be your until you grow old.I would have a really strong feeling of dislike for the people living inside Jonas' community if not for their innocence? ignorance? I cannot really describe how I feel, I was so conflicted. The plot was set further into the future where in only one person have the memories of the past and he is called the Giver, Jonas was chosen to carry these memories and is now called the Receiver. It is an eerier version of Pleasantville and a world with a lot of red flags for human rights violation and a community that would sure get swamped with activists of all sorts.I LOVE IT. The strangeness, the obscurity, even if their rules were so infuriating. It is a fascinating read. Definitely a classic. Something that you'll read more than once."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is one of the required books that have to be read over the kids summer vacation. I'm the parent and found it very interesting, but the children that I've talked to; >20 have found it very dry.Have your kids read it with plenty of water"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I'll give this book two stars for the fact that the writing wasn't really heinous and its just a warning about conformity. The book really isn't terrible, just cliched. The old horse of 'they had perfect lives, but they did not love' is trotted out once again, and the entire 'supposedly utopian but secretly evil' society that the author crafts is self-indulgent and unconvincing. In short, this is \\"Look everyone! I'm writing serious material!\\" work, a dumbed-down 'Anthem'. Yes, it's nicely allegorical, but there are other books that carry off the utopian theme much better, such as '1984', 'Brave New World' or the aforementioned 'Anthem'. It's truly painful to see teenagers learning this in school and taking it as the epitome of Utopian allegory."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"With all the great literature that is available for middle schoolers, it is mind boggling that The Giver, a mediocre yet sensationalist book, keeps getting assigned for fifth graders. Suppression of puberty, commercialized breeding and other features of the story are, I hope, beyond the realm of understanding for 10 year olds. There are plenty of great dystopian novels out there to read for older students, but this is certainly not one of them. To all you teachers who are simply following the pack on this front, look into some other options and teach Orwell, Swift and the like when students are ready."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is not for everyone. My child had nightmares after reading chapter 19 which I would easily rate R for graphic detailed violence. For parents who take their responsibility of monitoring the material their children are exposed to, be sure ahead of time that your child will not be emotionally upset by the \\"how - to\\" description of the actions. In my opinion, there are no redeeming qualities to this book. My child could not evaluate anything to do with the book because she was obsessed with the murder of an innocent new-born baby. While other people may say that it's not real, the subject of euthanasia is real. I would never recommend this book, however, I would caution parents, and teachers alike to evaluate the person for whom the book is being selected and determine if he/she will be negatively affected by it ahead of time."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The plot for the book The Giver is very confusing. Their world in this book is all perfect and there is no crime or anything unusual. The beginning you really don't know what is going on because it kind of starts right in the middle of something. There world is totally black and white. The main character Jonas starts out as any normal boy would until the age of 12 when he gets the special job as the Receiver. This person receives all the memories from the people in the past. All the people in this book do not suffer any pain except the receiver. Everybody has the same exact feeling as everybody else and don't get to think for themselves.The second reason is that the plot in this book is not a very interesting topic. This book doesn't grab your attention at all. It is all perfect so there is really no adventure in this book. There also isn't any action in it which makes this book even more boring. This book's plot isn't very thought out in my opinion because it is not very interesting and it is all perfect which makes the reader think the author didn't put much time into thinking the plot through by having the book all perfect. There is what I think about the plot of the book The Giver.So now that you know that this is a very bad book! I want to make sure that you don't waste your well earned money. Thanks for reading about what I have to say about the plot of this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Pretty good! Needed It for school and ordered it used for cheap, Got sometime(s) later!

I could never imagaine a place without any emotions. Living in a place that was a very communist community. Where people are even told what to think.

I have to have to find out what happened to Jonas and Gabe."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"If you aren't interested in getting bored then don't read this book with a CD. I am ready this in my 8th grade class and yesterday we read with the CD and I got really bored. But all in all this book is a really good book for a silent read. So I definitely suggest this book who likes to read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"After looking at all the rave reviews...it must be me. But, \\"The Giver\\" fell flat for me. I really really like the beginning and I liked the world that was created, every body so polite and all. And then you find the bad things behind the curtain. In fact I liked the polite world so much that I wouldn't object to ...the bad things behind the curtain, that make the society possible.The latter book was so unsatisfying, like how could there be no sun, but stuff grows, and how could there be no color?This book has a great story idea, unfortunately it doesn't flesh out.PS I especially liked the dinner scenes where each member of the family has to politely wait for other family members to share their day and then they comfort each other! Great stuff!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I'm a mom with a family of boys. \\"The Giver\\" is a very typical dystopia book -- it slowly dawns on the hero that his well-ordered world masks horrible secrets. Human life comes cheap in every communitarian paradise, same goes for this story. The first glimmer comes when the book describes how the boy who is clumsy with words is beaten for every mistake, until he simply stops talking. Then darker revelations come into play. The questions becomes, Equality? Or Liberty?Liberty is messier, but it is always better.Ira Levin wrote almost this exact same book, called \\"This Perfect Day\\". Both are enjoyable. Also try \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" -- all three explain at a gut level to children why it is impossible implement communitarian societies. Mankind is not perfectable. Truth will get out. Socialism is evil."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I would give the book &quot;The Giver&quot; 5 stars because it was very interesting and ordinary. But there were some parts in the book that were sort of inappropriate for young adolescents, Like the part when they stuck a needle through a babies head, which was called &quot;release.&quot; There are some parts that are so heart- warming and so touching that it astounded me. I love the part when Jonas risks his life for a baby named Gabrial. This book is highly recomended. 5 stars!!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I didn't like the ending, but overall, an excellent book about society and tradition."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book The Giver by Lois Lowry is an excellent example of how folklore plays a role within a society. In most societies, a lot of the cultures and traditions that they hold today are not things that you can find in a history book. They are things that were told from generation to generation like stories and lessons, that have slowly evolved and changed the culture into what it is today. They are stories that held myths and facts of what happened in the past, and what they think the future will be. The Giver is about the same concept of handing down the history to the next generation. In the novel the inhabitants live in a Eutopian society. Everything is controlled and structured. There is no crime, no mistakes, and no passion. The people are born under controlled conditions and assigned to family units. They are brought up their entire lives to believe that their way of life is a perfect way, the only way. This is, for the most part true, however, there is one thing that they are lacking, wisdom. They have no knowledge of the past, or that things were ever any different. They do not know of war or pain, or love or even animals and color. All these thing were eliminated within their society in order to bring sameness to everyone, and eliminate any space for differences and prejudism and choices. After all, if you don't have a choice, you can't make the wrong decision. In the story there is a person within the society called a Giver, and someone called a Receiver. The Giver is the only person within the society who has any knowledge of the past. When his life is close to being over, he then relays these memories to the Receiver. This is the only way that the society has of learning from the mistakes of the past, and it is done to protect the rest of the society from the pain of the memories. In theory this sounds like it would be a good thing, but actually it is not. They do not have the pleasure of experiencing anything on their own. They do not know how to live life independently, to have their own actions, or even an emotion to themselves. Even their job is chosen for them. All the people within the society are the same, and there is no individuality. With out this element, it is almost as if they are not even human. Humans were made with the desire to love, to be free, and to discover new things and satisfy their natural curiosity. All this is lost with in this society simply because they have no knowledge of things ever being any different. That is why folklore is important. It gives people something to believe in. It gives them the knowledge of things being different and unique. It gives them the ability to be different and their own person, and at the same time helps to form what the society is as a whole."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really enjoyed this book. This book has many puzzles that you solve as you read it. It's a little scary at times, so I wouldn't recommend it for small children. One of my favorite &quot;puzzles&quot; was finding out was &quot;release&quot; was. I would read it, if I were you. It was a real eye opener. It shows you important things in weirld ways. I personally would have ended it differently, but that was Lois Lowry's choice."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

I really enjoyed this book, in the story there is a place where everything is the same. Everyones dissions are made for them. How to cut your hair, when to ride a bike, and even what job you will have. The best part of the book is towards the end when Jonas is on his way to find a differet place and things start to happen to him, such as starting to see color. It really gets exciting aroud there. The begining of the book is a little slow, which gets boring, but it soon speeds up, and unusualthings start to happen. In the book Jonas is chosen to be the reciver of memories. He is lead and tought by an old man know as the Giver. Jonas comes to realize how different the world is. He can not adjust to the new things he finds, and has a hard time serviving. This book paints pictures in your mind. I would recomend The Giver to everyone."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is one of the best books that I have ever read in my life, because of Lois Lowry's unique writing style. She leads the reader to think that things have taken a turn for the worse when unexpectedly, something good develops from the bad. This book is about a 12 year old boy named Jonas who lives in a changed world. In his world there is no crime, no pain, no cars, no color and no polution. Jonas is singled out from the other members in his community by the elders and is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory in his community. This is the most important job in the community because the Receiver of Memory is the only person in the community that experiences pain, love and other emotions and feelings. Jonas feels increased pressure because the Last Receiver of Memory unexpectedly quit and left the community. THE GIVER has recived numerous awards among which is the 1994 NEWBERY MEDAL.

Jonas set of on a journey to find the other world where feelings and color and all the other beautiful things about life exist. I personal loved this book. It made me appreciate what I have today and made me think about what it would be like living in a perfect society.

It will really make you think!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book The Giver explores ine if the views or alternatives of how it would be if we were to have a perfect society. In The Giver there is a socuety that has no differences. There is a committee called the committee of the elders who decide on which things should or shouldn't be held in the society to make it perfect. In the society there is no crime, pollution, pain, rape, murder, or curuption, all the things that make a society less than perfect. In turn for them to give up such horrors they also had to give up color, love, freedom, and the true happiness of achievement. A perfect society sounds exellent but to loose just a simple thing as color for a perfect society I would rather live in an imperfect society."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Several months ago I came across this book while browsing the Newbery Medal winners in my bookstore. I picked it up because it looked like a quick read and for some reason I was convinced the book would be about a Native American Medicine Man who takes on a young student.To my chagrin, the book turned out to be about a communist type society. To be honest, I read the first 25 pages of this book and tossed it aside. Recently, I read a handful of the reviews at amazon and realized I may have misjudged the book. I returned to it, and forced myself through what I still believe is a very slow beginning. In the end, I am glad I read this book, as it eventually demonstrates the fallacy of the communist ideology.I won't tell you what happens, but will encourage you to read this book.

One of my favorite moments is when all the people going to adult hood are being assigned what to do in order of numbers. When it is Jonas's turn they skip him and go on.

I think that it is weird how Jonas lives in a perfect world that doesn't have any wars, sickness, or hunger.Overall I think it was a good book but it had a very bad ending. It ended with Jonas ran away! I think that if a book ends like The Giver ended then there should be a sequel to the book The Giver. (7.3AR)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Set in a culture that has been genetically chosen to represent Sameness, freedom is a word that cannot be understood. A committee makes decisions regarding a person's clothing, job, spouse and even children. These people know no other way of life and so do not question it. They are unfeeling drones in a world designed to eliminate pain, embarrassment and any type of negative emotions. In doing so, the positive emotions have disappeared as well. A young boy is chose to be the successor of the one person who does have the knowledge of what life was once like. They become lockboxes of this wisdom that cannot be shared, only transferred. Through their transmissions and discussions they idealize to share both love and pain with the Community and therefore forever change them. This book brings up a lot of issues for preteens be-ginning puberty. The Community could be a metaphor for a child's life before he opens his eyes and starts to experience it for himself without being protected from anything that could go wrong.Why 4 stars?:I feel this is a wonderful piece of literature. However, I took one star off because teachers and parents must be incredibly careful when introducing this book to children. I have seen it used as young as fourth grade, but it is so intense and brings up so many issues about life as we know it (and don't know it yet), that it takes a very mature audience. It should only be used with close supervision and guidance."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think this book is a intertaning book for others who are intrested in a great book.The Giver makes you think about things you haven't tought in your life.

This took away from the development of the scenery and overall plot. I thought this because the story did not have much description about the scenery so every time there was anything about scenery it was amazing, but there was not enough detail for a person to be able to imagine what the place looked like in her mind. On the other hand the overall story was wonderful the characters were well developed and the suspense was well created. Like the memory of the poachers and the elephant and the elephant's mate. Another example would be the memory of warfare."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"&quot;The Giver&quot; was one of the most unique books I've ever read.

Since the people in the community chose not to have feelings, they gave the responsibility of carrying everyone's feelings to a chosen one such as Jonas and The Giver.The &quot;shared rememberence&quot; between Jonas and The Giver resembles a fortune teller showing someone's future or a witch implanting images or thoughts into a person's head.Over all I thought the book was great and I recommend it to everyone and not just young adults."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was an extraordinary book of a boy named Jonas and how he learned much from memories of the past.

Read about Jonas, Asher, The Giver and the rest of the community. It's a great book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an amazing book. It's about the life of a boy named Jonas and the society in which he lives. Jonas lives in a world where they choose sameness over risk. Everyone has the same amount of people in their family. Everyone can only see black and white. Everyone follows rules exactly. No one can hear music. No one has individual birthdays, instead everyone is born in the same year and all become \\"ones\\" together, then \\"twos\\" together, then \\"threes\\". There is a ceremony for each year. At the ceremony for \\"nines,\\" everyone receives the same birthday gift, a bicycle. This society does not know real death, does not know pain and does not know love. Everyone thinks the same and acts the same. They choose sameness over individuality because there are no risks. No one can get hurt. There are no problems.At the ceremony of \\"12's,\\" the kids get assigned jobs. Jonas is assigned to be the Receiver, a very honored job, but does not know what the Receiver does. As Jonas trained with the elderly Receiver, he learned that the receiver held all the people's memories of when there was pain, suffering, death and war. The Receiver also held all the memories of real love, true happiness and individuality. As the Receiver, Jonas learned of these emotions, as well as learned the existence of color and music. The Receiver kept all the memories away from the society to protect the people from suffering, but for years the Receiver had been trying to think of someway to allow society to share the memories, so the society could learn real pain and true love and get rid of sameness.Once Jonas started his training, the Receiver became the Giver and Jonas became the Receiver. Together they came up with a plan for Jonas to run away to the true world which existed outside the boundaries of the community and as he ran the memories would be released into the community and sameness would be lost forever.What is so interesting is that this story could take place in the past, present or future. Perhaps our society evolved from Jonas' society, from sameness to individuality. On the other hand, Jonas' society could exist in the present, existing as we speak. Or this society could take place in the future and we are the people from which the society of sameness evolved into individuality.I recommend this book to teens and adults. Both age groups can relate to the story and reflect deeply about life, the way we choose to live and the experiences, both good and bad, that we share. This book makes you think about what a society without pain, color, suffering, love or joy would be like would be like. Would you rather choose sameness with no risks, or a world where you can be yourself, take chances, a life with risk where people are hurt and hated, but where there is color, happiness, music and true love?You decide!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"WOW! Part of the (...) reading curriculum is to read THE GIVER. At first, I though it would be really stupid and boring. Our teacher said to start reading it and stop around the second chapter. I did something very naughty. I kept on reading. I went home and finished the book. I feel very guilty for doing that, but hey, it is a really good book and it's not my fault i can't put it down!!This book is about a boy naped Jonas. He lives in a world where there are rules for everything. There is no such thing as love. Everything is the same. People don't see colors. They don't even know what SNOW is!!When the Ceremony of Twelve takes place, he is selected to become the Receiver for Memories. He receives memories from the former receiver, The Giver. Jonas holds the memories of the pain and pleasure of life. The secrets that no one but him and The Giver know.I found sadness in this book. I found the pleasure in this book. I felt the pain from this book. I could not put this book down. I recommend it to you. Read it!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry really put the power in the pen on this oneI give her 5 stars and 2 thumbs up, it would be 3 but I only have 2 thumbs. The Giver is a classic. A good thing about the story is that everyone is safe. On the other hand, no one is able to live his or her own life, and that's what makes the story good. So treat your self and get a copy. (J.S.)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"What an incredibly well organized book! Every thought about how the futuristic society exists and operates has been meticulously figured out and recorded by the author, Lois Lowry. There is not a word out of place in this novel. When younger, I often got this book mixed up with the similarly titled, \\"The Cay\\". An unfortunate mix-up when you consider that Theodore Taylor's \\"The Cay\\" is regarded by many to be a badly written pompous book. This book, however, is lovely. An easy read, it sets up all its ideas perfectly before knocking them down. The reader is placed in a position not too different from that of Jonas, the protagonist. What Jonas learns to feel about his community, we readers learn to feel the same things at the same time. Lowry is especially skilled at the slow reveal. We do not know that the citizens of this world do not distinguish height or sunlight or snow or color until Jonas learns about each of these things in turn. And the book is especially interesting when you consider that there aren't any villains beyond the system itself. This is a laudable book and a good didactic (without being preachy) tale. This would pair well with other dystopian futures, such as \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\" (remember the world where \\"It\\" lives and the children must bounce the ball all the same way?).I disagree with those readers who feel this book is inappropriate for younger readers. While the open ended ending will probably disappoint or anger some, kids will enjoy the writing for what it is. Eloquent and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's award winning novel, \\"The Giver,\\" describes a utopian society that is far from perfect. In this society every individual is assigned a job or duty. Jonas, the main character of the novel finds out that at the age of 12 he is to become the society's receiver. As the receiver, Jonas learns about the memories that people all around him are holding. He hears memories, which are both pleasurable and painful. Jonas also becomes aware of the beauty that his society is missing out on. The beauty of color, feelings and emotions are held in Jonas' hands. Jonas is not sure what he should do with all of this information he is responsible for. He wants to give it back to his society that has forgotten the important things in life. Does Jonas give these things back to his society? Or is he \\"released\\" like the others?The best thing about Lowry's book, \\"The Giver,\\" is that it is filled with enough detail to make a very unbelievable society, believable. Lowry slowly gives the reader information about the society, so that the reader does not become overwhelmed by such a unique and unfamiliar setting. Lowry also leaves the reader questioning certain things, especially in the end. This gives the reader an opportunity to come up with their own ending, or gives a wonderful leeway to discussion. I think Lowry intended for the book to be written this way, so that it could reach out to different types of people. I think anyone could find enjoyment in this novel. In no way is this book limited to a young reader; it could very well branch out to high school and adult readers. \`I think the thought provoking book would be an excellent choice to read in a social studies classroom. It describes a society that one might hope for, before they actually know what the consequences might be. I am amazed at how realistic Lowry has made this society sound, to someone as young as 5th grade. As an adult, I found myself reminding myself that this book was still a fantasy book. I love the fact that all throughout the book there are plenty of opportunities for discussion questions."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is a wonderful story about a boy in a perfect- world community; at least he thinks it is, until he is chosen to be the \\"receiver of memory\\": the only one who knows the truth. He goes to an old man, the Giver, every day, who makes him see the horrible truth of his world.Some people say that this book is disturbing and scary, and I will not dissagree with that. But it is not right for them to ban it from libraries just because it makes them uncomfortable thinking about it. The point is to think about it, and realize what we're doing wrong in our community."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry, was a refreshing change in reality. This young adult novel is about a boy named Jonas, who lives in a \\"perfect\\" world. But soon Jonas finds out the world is not so perfect. I liked this story, it was fun and easy reading. The Giver allows a person to leap into their imagination and see the world in a different way. I recommend this book for young and old readers. The Giver is a unique and powerful novel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Twelve-year-old Jonas has lived his life in a controlled community. At first glance this community is a virtual utopia where pain, suffering, and disorder do not exist. Demanding rules run this society, leaving no room for personal growth beyond communal expectations. At his 12 ceremony, a public celebration of age, Jonas and his peers are assigned jobs. Jonas is -chosen- to be the Receiver of Memory, a job that places him under the guidance of the Giver. In receiving the memories of the Giver and of the past world Jonas comes to question his community. Though the memories come with great pain they drive an ardent longing for a life of freedom, choice, love, beauty, and wisdom. The longing leads to a plan, a plan that allows for \\"no looking back\\".The Giver is a beautiful book! It's truly complex in its simplicity. Louis Lowry manages to bring to life the community, taking a fantastic world and making it believable. His characters and their community live vividly in the mind of the reader. Lowry's simple writing style leaves the reader to struggle with the flaws of the misguided \\"utopia\\" and the difficult choice between security and freedom.The ending is vague and somewhat unsatisfying to a mind used to being given a straightforward outcome. In writing it so, Lowry offers a chance for the reader to apply his or her own thoughts and morals to the resolution, in essence giving them the freedom that his protagonist searches for. All in all, The Giver is a thought-provoking book that will stay with the reader for a long time."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I bought this book after hearing the author interviewed on NPR. I think I had read some of her books as a girl. And every now and then I will read a YA novel.I read it in one afternoon-- I'd have gotten through it sooner, but had to look up and around the room and cry from time to time. I'll never see the color red in the same way again-- now it's something precious, a gift.This book is far more than a dystopia for kids, or a simple allegory. Some of the ideas in the book-- the notion of group memory, the questioning of the \\"greater good\\"-- are very sophisticated and presented with great subtlety and art. But the power of the book lies in its story. The book takes us on a journey through a world that seems idyllic at first, and it is only gradually, and terribly, that we, with the main character, discover the sadness, the real horror, at the heart of the society. And perhaps the true horror is that the awfulness is not even understood by the people. There is no malice in this world. There is just absence-- absence of memory, absence of attachment, absence of all the complicated feelings that can lead us to love and grace.As he accepts the responsibility to become the receptacle of society's memories, the main character learns how his society really works-- how it eschews, even destroys, those who don't contribute, how it abhors individuality, how it ultimately rejects the idea of love. And he begins to see in color.This is all discovered through the eyes of a child, and told very simply. The final escape is much debated-- did he die, or find a better place? I firmly believe that he found a better place, but in the end it doesn't matter. What does matter is that once again a human being has discovered what it means to be human.This book truly deserves its awards and should be read not just by teachers and students, but by anybody who enjoys a good story. Thornton Wilder has the Narrator say in his wonderful play OUR TOWN, to Emily's question, \\"does anybody realize life while they're living it, every, every minute?\\" \\"Poets and artists, they do some.\\" After reading THE GIVER, you'll be inspired to remember to do that too. Life is precious, and its memories, even its painful ones, are an incredible gift."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In \\"The Giver\\", a 12-year-old boy, Jonas, is selected to be the new Reciever of Memory in his Community. He soon finds out that the world he lives in is not \\"perfect\\" as it is intended but full of murder, infanticide, and suicide. The people in the Community can also not see color or have feelings. Jonas decides to do something about it. If you look in the dedication section of \\"The Giver\\" It says, \\"To all the children to whom we enrust the future.\\" This made me realize that if we are not careful, the children of today could let our world become like this. They are making the history of tomorrow."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book back in seventh grade and was decidedly against the plot of the story. As a beginner in the realm of more advanced literacy, I was very unhappy with the undefined ending and did not fully appreciate the depth of the text. Rereading the novel as a senior in high school, I find myself actually drawn into the novel and find myself relating to and rooting for Jonas as he makes a choice for what he thinks is right. While the story is originally meant for children, it is one of those rare stories that change meaning as the reader grows older. When I was twelve I saw the work as complete fiction and not relevant to my life at all, but now I understand how the search for \\"utopia\\" in the novel is a reflection of our modern world and my understanding of The Giver's literary predecessors brings the message of the novel to a new level of importance. This book is truly one that can effect readers of all ages as a critical look at the state of the world's social and political landscapes and the unceasing question of what we will give up for our safety."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Have you ever wondered what the world would be like if everything was the same, and there were rarely any choices? Lois Lowry does an excellent job of exploring a society without the freedoms and the decisions most people have today. With detailed looks into the mind of one teenager growing up in a society of sameness, The Giver answers many of the questions that people have about giving people complete freedoms and choices. By not giving all of the information about the society at the beginning of the novel, Lowry keeps the readers intrigued and waiting to see what Jonas will decide to do. The Giver is the perfect book to relax with while stimulating questions of why society is the way it is and how is could be incredibly different."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"There is nothing like being stuck in society that is oppressive; recent events in the Middle East certainly typify this sentiment. The power of thought, and the risk of thought against a reluctant rule is the base of the wonderfully clever and thought provoking book, The Giver, by Lois Lowry. Lowry is compellingly able to dive into not only the mind, but the soul of a younge boy, now entering his own stages at become a man, Jonas, in a small but restrictive community, aptly named The Community. Assigned to his own perfect position, Jonas meets \\"The Receiver\\", translating to Jonas as \\"The Giver.\\" What is revealed as the two, the young and the old, wraps to cover a relationship expressed through every intergenerational experience. Moving quickly from clich&eacute;, Lowry attempts to escape all points the norm, but at times is subject to dismantling her moments of pure ecstasy and hope with often more sobering scenes of a disrupted society and human fault.This fact, tied with the stolid pace and writing style exhibited in the first few chapters, leads to a slight urge to drop the book by page 30, if not out of sheer frustration with a plot that seems to thin to become anything of interest. However one must stick out, as the themes and moments of desperation acted upon by every character begins to humanize the text, recognized by Lowry as she gains more confidence in her ability to deliver a more lively and, more importantly, emotional environment, allowing for all of her characters to thrive. The pages seem to rip by quickly once one has conquered the first 50 or so pages, and it is a sad time to close the pages, though hope remains in the air. One may find, as this reviewer did, wishing for a few more chapters, just to sink one's teeth into a story of whimsy and darkness, all combined in a harsh world of control. This psychological journey is certainly one to dive in feet first; just remember to breathe at times."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read the book two years ago, in Grade Six, for a noel study. I was fairly impressed, but when I was done I was not satisfied. It most certainly caught my attention but I didn't like the characters much. I found Jonas to be a little...annoying in the sense that he was almost emotionless. He was bland and tasteless. As the book progressed I started to like him more as he grew into a new person, challenging what he has been force fed his entire life.. The book was slightly...disturbing. For example, the baby part was awful. I was shocked that people could be so inhumane.However, it was certainly an amazing book. I was going to give it three stars but I have given it four due to the fact that the writing showed great talent and that it was original and well planned over such a short book. The only thing for me to complain of is characters which is one of the things I rank highly in a novel. I would borrow it, though, because it is eally short and nearly seven dollars ir bloody ridiculous."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"i was really interested the moment i started it.

A wide array of ages can enjoy it because it is an easy read, has a good plot and keeps the reader on their toes, guessing what will come next in the book.

She was so into this book. i havent had the chance to read it but was able to here it from her in detail, chapter by chapter. I read reviews on how some parents feel this story wasn't appropriate for their children. I think keeping an open mind, listening, interacting with your childs thoughts and a wonderful teacher to help through the book has made it a positive time with me and my daughter. We have had a difference of opinions throughout this book so now I get to read it and she gets to help me go through the story. I am glad I chose not to read the book first. With a daughter of this age and myself not being able to encourage reading (which she has started to lose interest in) this story has opened her mind and has purchased a book outside the reading outline to read.

He is called the reciever and he is taught by the old one or the Giver how to see the past present and future."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I have pondered about this book along time and I have come up with my opinion of the ending. I think he went in a circle. When he left the community all his memories stayed in the community and he came back to his old memories. The sled was where it was in his dream, It was December (ceremony time, but because of his memories ceremonies are gone) which is winter-snow, It had the lights and tree as in his dream of &quot;love&quot;. I also think he may have died.( Some think your happiest memory comes to you when you are about to die and that was Jonas's happiest memory.) There is a paragraph that says &quot;He got off and let it (his bike) drop sideways into the snow. For a moment he thought how easy it would be to drop beside it himself, to let himself and Gabriel slide into the softness of the snow, the darkness of night, the warm comfort of sleep&quot; which I think (I'm only 13 gimme a break if it sounds stupid) refers to death, that he wanted to die and when he fell to his knees he had done so and dreamed his happiest memory from there on."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I'm a 6th grader in upstate NY, and had this book recommended to me by my librarian. Thank heaven!! I think that this is a great book that any middle schooler should read.

Thank you for your time"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I'm probably the last of my generation to read this book, but I had to get to it eventually. Getting into this book proved a bit difficult and at first I suspected I wouldn't like it. As with any story, growing used to the jargon and understanding why characters behave the way they do is often a challenge. Still, this book proved to be a very emotional and vivid journey for the main character, Jonas. Other characters that stood out in particular were Asher, his best friend, Jonas's father, and, of course, the Giver.Most of the time, I'm a solid ending type of person, so I would have liked to see a more concrete resolution, especially since this story doesn't continue in a series. If it did, I probably wouldn't mind it. A lot of questions weren't answered, and that bothers me personally, but some stories you have to just assume that's the way things are. Because it was not shown how the Giver's plan worked out, I doubted that it did. I couldn't picture the community being anything other than what it was, and doubted disturbing the equilibrium would do anything to change what it had become after so many years (perhaps even centuries). But maybe that was the point--it couldn't change so the only way out was to escape and hope something better existed out there. Which, while I would like to believe so, was not confirmed.Loury's writing and storytelling reminded me a lot of Avi's work, whom I greatly admire. It definitely made me appreciate the brilliance of the outdoors and how we take the simplest things, such as color, for granted."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was assigned as homework for my son's 6th grade class.

Jonas is unsure of what assignment he will be given, and the entire community is shocked to find out that Jonas has a special task, with the Giver. The last Twelve to be assigned to the Giver had a disastrous outcome.Will Jonas be able to survive his assignment with the Giver?\\"The Giver\\" reminds me, in a way, of the movie \\"Pleasantville,\\" where the townspeople lived in a perfect society, but also a society that lacked uniqueness, real love, and color. While \\"The Giver\\" has some darker undertones, it seems that the movie may have had some inspiration from the book.\\"The Giver\\" was a quick read, a Newberry Award Winner, and a book to add to your Must-Read list, if you haven't already read it!If you lived in a utopian society, such as in the beginning of \\"The Giver\\" and \\"Pleasantville,\\" what memories would you be able to live without?What memories would you be devastated to lose, or to never experience?Thanks for reading,RebeccaLike my review?

Its a little dark and some parts are inapproaite, but its gets better towards the end."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Twelve-year-old Jonas lives in a very orderly community. Everything happens in stages. Dreams are discussed at breakfast. Emotions after dinner. At at 9 you get a bike, at 12 you start training for your career. But when Jonas starts training with \\"the giver\\" the veil on his world is pulled back and he learns the true price of his supposedly peaceful community.The Giver was the dystopian ya novel before dystopian ya novels were hip. I missed this book as a kid, but I've been hearing a lot about it lately.After reading it, I realize how big a debt Veronica Roth's Divergent owes this book and Lauren Oliver's Delirium as well.The difference with The Giver is Lowry's writing mastery. The Giver's premise is revealed in a way that makes you walk in Jonas' shoes. You see the beauty and the logic as well as the horror of the dystopia he lives in. While the more modern dystopias sometimes skimp on explanation, the world in The Giver is very fully imagined, and therefore, seems more plausible.The Giver is a bit slower in pace, and since Jonas is only 12, the perspective is more innocent than something like Divergent, but make no mistake, this is a hard-hitting dark, dystopian novel, one that really speaks to that startling time in life when you first realize that the world is not what you thought it was."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is really interesting. It was an assigned book during the course that I took in summer. I when I first start reading the book it was kid of boring, but later the events attracted me to read it.

One day I was almost miss my stop because this book made me live in its story.Especially, the part when Jonas had discovered the truth about the release, and had seen his father had released new child. However, the end is still confusing.I am thinking to read this book one or maybe two more time, for I Enjoyed reading it. I wondered why some authorities are frightened from keeping this book available for schools."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A round of applause for Ms. Lowry who has done an excellent job of showing the logical result of humanism in her book, &quot;The Giver&quot;! In order to cope with our irresistable urge to sin, she portrays a &quot;society&quot; which has finally solved all the world's problems by taking away all external stimuli which might provoke a citizen to sin. This is the 1990's parallel to &quot;1984&quot;. Like &quot;1984&quot;, everyone is kept under constant supervision and announcements are made over a loudspeaker when a rule is broken.As the main character Jonas, who has just turned 12 years old, begins experiencing true emotions, he rebells against the choices that have been denied him and has exposed his family and the people around him as creatures who have no true capacity to care about one another. The emotions his family, as well as others, do feel are only self-centered and never show a deep concern for others.People in the &quot;society&quot; who rebell are dealt with swifty. They are &quot;released&quot;, i.e., put to sleep, killed. Babies who do not gain enough weight are killed. Older people are killed. It is also acceptable to kill yourself. All, of course, for the benefit of society.I do not recommend this book be read outloud in a classroom situation for children under the age of 14. There are topics in this book that a child may not be equipped emotionally to handle. The experience of &quot;stirrings&quot;, a metaphor for sexual arousal, is also not age appropriate for children under the age of 14. To read about an 11 year old girl bathing a naked elderly man and about how an 11 year old boy bathes a naked elderly woman would be uncomfortable in any class-room setting. If you are a teacher considering reading this book to your class, please read it for yourself first!In conclusion, while Ms. Lowry shows the futility of humanism extremely well, the ending of this book is unsatisfying. There is not a happy ending to this dark story.Humanism tries to deny one has a sin nature, but deals with it by taking away a society's choices, which I believe is happening today. The real victory is in Jesus Christ, who by dying on the cross for our sins, being buried, and physically coming out of the grave gives believers the ability to overcome their sin nature daily without taking away choices, but with life-giving freedom! Yes, Christianity, and not Humanism, is the real answer to all depressing situations!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I rated this book a four star becease for me it is not perfect, but it's still really good.

He gets picked to be the most respected and honorable person in his whole Community. He soon learns that it will have pain and then he starts to doubt being the most respected and the most honored person in his Community because it will have pain. The Giver is the person who holds all memories of sadness, pain, love, and sunshine because the other people in the Community can't handle the reality of these feelings. These people would do anything for him because without The Giver, the people of The Community (yes, that's where they live) would ultimately destroy themselves because they now wouldn't have anybody to take advice from.Apparently, back in the old days of their Community, people chose their own jobs, people were homeless, and people could choose to have an actual child of their own. I don't understand why they still can't do that now.And finally, the releases. Who kills somebody to \\"release\\" them. I don't even know why the elderly would attend their friends' releases! They get killed! So do the newborns and it is completely unfair to kill the newborns just because of their weight.

The world that Jonas (an almost twelve) lives in is one without love, crime, warfare, and feeling. Sameness has taken over. Jonas's community is the only place he knows about.

Lois Lowry opens the readers' eyes to the possibilities that life may not always be as we know it now. Jonas, the main character, is an apprehensive eleven year old at the beginning of this book. He turns into a very wise, knowledgable twelve-year-old. The Giver and Jonas live in a dull community without individualism, colors or any change at all (in weather, land, people, etc.). Jonas and the Giver are the only people in their community who have feelings and hold the memories (of pain and pleasure) of the past. To see how Jonas tries to save the memories of the past, read this thought-provoking story by Lois Lowry!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"How would you like to live in a setup community? The giver is written from the point of view of Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy living in a setup society that has no pain, fear, war, and hatred. which is kind of cool because you dont worry about anything There is no prejudice, since everyone looks and acts basically the same, and there is very little competition. Everyone is polite. The society has also ended choice: at age twelve every member of the community is assigned a job based on his or her abilities and interests. Citizens can apply for and be assigned compatible spouses, and each couple is assigned exactly two children each. The children are born to Birthmothers, who never see them, and spend their first year in a Nurturing Center with other babies, or \\"newchildren,\\" born that year. When their children are grown, family units dissolve and adults live together with Childless Adults until they are too old to function in the society. Then they spend their last years being cared for in the House of the Old until they are finally \\"released\\" from the society. In the community, release is death, but it is never described that way; most people think that after release, flawed newchildren and joyful elderly people are welcomed into the vast expanse of Elsewhere that surrounds the communities. Citizens who break rules or fail to adapt properly to the society's codes of behavior are also released, though in their cases it is an occasion of great shame. Everything is planned and organized so that life is as easy and pleasant as possible. this is a very interseting book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"...Jonas's is a twelve-year-old boy living in a perfect futuristic world. There is no fighting, no pain, and no color, everything is completely organized. Everyone is assigned a role in the community at age twelve. Jonas is assigned to receive training from the giver. The giver alone holds all of the memories of the real pain and happiness of life before the governors started the community. But when training begins, things start to get tough. By putting his hands on Jonas's back, the giver can transmit memories. The memories can make Jonas actually feel the pain or live the happiness. Jonas finds out that his father has been lying to him about a baby boy, Gabe, and Jonas is forced to take action. Even in a perfect world like Jonas is in, life can be full of nasty surprises!!!I loved this book. Lois Lowry did a great job of describing all the memories, it was like I was there instead of Jonas. I also liked this book because it was a page-turner. You would be surprised how often I said to my Mom, \\"just one more chapter, pleease?\\" At the end of the chapter she always left you hanging, which I personally think is a very good technique.I'd recommend this book to more experienced readers who like science fiction books. The only reason I was a bit disappointed with it was the very last part. It was one of those endings that the author left you to decide the ending, and I don't really like those types of endings. But all in all The Giver was a splendid, fun book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry combines aspects of fantasy, science fiction, and mystery genres. While clearly a dystopian novel after the pattern of 1984 (and, I would assume, A Brave New World, but I haven't read that yet), this book also incorporates such fantasy/philosophical concepts as collective memory.Although much of what is happening is clearly explained later on, readers who like a little ambiguity will enjoy trying to interpret what Jonas means when he describes things from a worldview very different from our own.The ending leaves the reader confused and deflated, belonging more to the fantasy/philosophical parts of the book than the science fiction parts. While Jonas seems happy in the end, one cannot figure out where he is, what will happen to him, or even if he's still alive. Personally, I wanted something more concrete.However, it is a beautiful, enthralling, and tasteful tale for the fairly mature reader willing to contemplate the nature of love, sexuality (this part is mild), infanticide, suicide, history, paternalistic government, etc., without the &quot;resistance is futile&quot; hopelessness of adult dystopian novels.I loved it at 12. I love it at 18.Can anyone tell me if the legend of the sanitation worker told by the children of Jonas' community is an allusion to Anthem by Ayn Rand?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Imagine that you are in your late seventies, and - although you had a rich career as an English teacher - you have only a superficial concept of what the Newbery Medal is, probably because most of your teaching experience has involved senior high school students.Your son, himself a teacher of sixth graders, is discussing THE GIVER with you, sharing the enthusiasm of both him and his students for the novel. In order to introduce you to his world of children's literature, he orders a copy for you. Your daughter reinforces his sentiments, going so far as to lay claim that she and her family (all discriminating readers) thoroughly enjoyed the novel.Amazon downloads your Kindle copy. You are intrigued by the countless memories of a lifetime carved in the face of the old bearded man on the cover. You begin to read.Having recently joined an audio book club, you realize instantly that this is a book better appreciated through a visual absorption. Some common words are capitalized, for example, and this distinction would be lost in a narrator's presentation. Also, as language itself is extremely important in the book's community - the children always being corrected if they do not use the most accurate words possible - the typography (ellipses and italics come to mind) is crucial, and a case can be made for the value of visual as opposed to aural.It's a slow start. The unidentified aircraft seems out of place in the December sky, and it quickly loses significance as part of the necessary exposition. As the characters, and environmental, sociological, cultural, and governmental functions are revealed, you wonder when the action begins. Too many bicycles neatly placed in their designated ports, too much repetition, so many meals eaten at precise times with no mention of what is being eaten, endless references to routine and sameness, and always community, community, community. A disturbing sense of ennui skitters across your mind. Why all the accolades for THE GIVER?Continue imagining that you are committed to completing the book for the sake of respecting your children, although it does occur to you that father, children, and grandchildren are not on the same page ... or even in the same book. On and on it trudges. No chapter titles - just a red 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ...Seven, or the end of seven to be more word explicit, is where the action begins. The author suddenly jolts you into the so-called \\"rising action.\\" Finally it has begun, and - in spite of your age - you are pulled into the world of children's literature and a darned good story about an age of dystopia.You run a literary marathon and finish the rest of the book without stopping. Your son said it would be like this, and it's nice that you continue to respect his intelligence, but you're not too certain of the reliability of your own. You really didn't give Lois Lowry or her book or her talent a chance. To be fair, you should have reread the first few chapters before continuing.But something's not right. You liked the book, and were caught up in the terrible truths of the community, and were right there with Jonas and little Gabe through the final chapters. Yet a certain satisfaction is missing. You almost feel like saying, \\"So? It was good, but I've read better books.\\"Imagine then the memory of a bruised ego. You're a retired teacher, for crying out loud ... sort of a Giver yourself. To save what you can of self-respect and stave off complete humiliation (your son said, \\"Can't wait to talk about it!\\"), you do a computer search, checking out Wikipedia and a few good book review sites. And you make sure that your paucity of the Newbery Award is rectified. You even reread the opening chapters, which, of course, at this point changes your entire perception of the novel.THE GIVER deserves the Newbery, and probably more, if for no other reason than the claim that its underlying theme - the giving and receiving of love- is the key to finding true happiness in this life. Even though the book burners have managed to establish this book as inappropriate for young readers (according to the American Library Association's list of the most \\"challenged\\" books of the 1990s), THE GIVER continues to remain on countless other lists - those of middle school suggested reading titles. The book is taught even in higher level grades.Maybe it's good to stay in your own community and be happy in your own ignorance... sometimes.But just imagine if ..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in a community where everything is perfect.

It deals with: Sameness vs. Diversity. It challenges the reader to ask \\"how much freedom am I willing to give up for security?\\"--A relevant question in today's climate (2004). This Newberry Medal winner is best for young adults, but mature adults would greatly enjoy this book as well. Some children, younger than 5th grade, may find some of the subject matter \\"unsettling.\\" \\"The Giver\\" is ideal for group or classroom discussions."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a complex, beautiful book that offers a look into a futuristic dystopia in which there is no color, no aberation, no hot or cold, and no personal choices. Drugs are taken to repress sexual urges and even out temprament, and careers are chosen for children based on their aptitude. Children are raised in prearranged family units. There is no privacy and no personal choice, but is this really a bad thing if people have no concept of those things? There is no hunger, emotional pain, violence, crime, war, or sadness.Growing up in this world is Jonas, a bright 12 year old who is about to receive his career assignment. He is given the important but extremely rare job of \\"Reciever\\": the keeper of \\"memories\\" of what life was like before the creation of his utopian world. Slowly, he begins to see color, to learn what love, hate, death, and heartbreak are like. He begins to understand that some of the \\"happy\\" things around him maybe aren't so happy.The brilliance of this book is that the world unfolds gradually. Lowry does not hit us over the head with an up-front description: in fact, the place starts out sounding fairly normal if a bit Montesori. Slowly, though, the reader realizes quite how foreign this world is. Lowry is a deft writer with an excellent sense of subtlety.Ultimately, this book is about the importance of cultural memory. The idea of cultural memory is probably a new one for kids, and some of the concepts of death and destruction might be a little disturbing, so I recomend that parents read this book too so that they can discuss it with their children. This in no way means that I think that it is innapropriate for kids: I just think that it is an amazing starting point for discussion about what makes us human. Please read my review of \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" (also made today) for my thoughts on how these two books are related.This is a moving, thought-provoking book that is a great read for adults as well as kids. Adults might find it interesting that the idea of a drugged-to-make-them-\\"normal\\" population where everyone is encouraged to analyze and discuss every aspect of their lives sounds eerily familiar..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was amazing! It was about a boy named Jonas who lives in a community of Sameness. Where everything is the same and safe. Nobody has to worry about emotional pain. Everything was perfect until the Ceremony of 12. That's when everybody in his age group was assigned an assignment. When the Chief Elder skipped Jonas the crowd became uneasy. They paid attention to the rest of the assignments but were still anxious about Jonas. After the last assignment the Chief Elder announced a selection. Jonas was selected to be the reciever, the most honored job in the community. Jonas starts his training and experiences pain, joy, and even more in depth feelings. Things he's never felt before.I finished this book in 2 days. That means it was a very good book. (And it earned me an A in reading) Recently our Reading teacher read aloud Gathering Blue which, like The Giver, was set in the future. This book was much easier to tell though because of the memories, having technology, and because of the animals. Also they were alike because Lois Lowery left you hanging at the end. She wanted you to have imagination and figure out the ending on the own. And I still wonder if the boy with light eyes in Gathering Blue is Jonas or not.Overall this book was excellent!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am not usually very interested in science - fiction books, but I'd have to say this book, \\"The Giver\\", which is both science - fiction and fantasy, without a doubt, is one of the best books I've ever read. I would describe this book as very unique and unusual. \\"The Giver\\" will lead the reader to a whole new world.This utopian society that the author had created is seen through the eyes of the main character, Jonas. This society that Jonas is living in has no emotional or physical pain, crime, suffering or disease. It is where everything is perfect except for the part that there is no colour and no freedom of choice, and even \`love'. All these things were left out of the community because of the problems all these things caused in the world of the past. When Jonas turns twelve, just like everyone else, he receives a job selected by the elders but unlike the usual, Jonas is singled out and is selected to be the Receiver of Memory. He gets special training from the Giver. The Giver alone holds the memories of the truth, pain, and pleasure of life. It is his job to pass these memories to Jonas. Now it is time for Jonas to receive the truth. There is no way out.This book, \\"The Giver\\", has a very mysterious and puzzling ending that keeps the reader pondering. The ending is left to the imagination of the reader. This book will make you think. It will make you actually look at the world you are living in.If I had the chance to edit some parts of the book, I wouldn't have anything to change because this book is perfect just the way it is.It is a great book and I would rate it 4.5 out of 5. It is very inspiring and a book that you will not regret reading."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Summary:Jonas lives in a community of Sameness, where everything is perfect and setup by meticulous rules. People can't choose their jobs, they're chosen for them. If the child bearers have twins one would have to be \\"released,\\" because it is forbidden to have two of the same person in the community. At the Ceremony of Twelve in December Jonas is chosen to be the Receiver, who is in charge of holding the memories of life before the community. He works with The Giver, who transmits memories of snow, excruciating pain, love, emotions, and colors; all the things the community doesn't have anymore. With his new role comes new responsibility and new freedom. Everything is all good for Jonas until he finds out the secrets of the community. Will Jonas be able to handle the memories that unfold or will he just give up?Review:The beginning was boring but then the book started getting interesting and caught our attention. We found it interesting how there were no feelings, and how the kids weren't able to go through teenage changes. It made us wonder what it would be like not to have feelings. We were fascinated by how the community reproduced. We thought the ending could have been more detailed because we wanted to find out what happened with the community Jonas left behind and wether the community he went to was what he expected. We recommend this book to people of all ages and who are willing to think."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is absolutely, without a doubt the BEST book I have ever read. And though I may be young, I have read quite a few books, some truly atrocious ones, to tell the truth. Fortunately, for whoever is interested in knowing about this book's integrity or quality The Giver does not fit in the above category at all. I first read this book at the age of ten and I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I was one of the deluted people who tried to have it banned from class, mostly because of one particularly descriptive and unsavory passage that was far too advanced for me at that age. But ever since then, something about that book has haunted me until last year, when I picked up a copy at a used book store. It was only a matter of hours before I finished the book for the second time and felt the greatest sense of accomplishment at having finally grasped the story's universally appealing message. Let me just tell you this, if you read one book in the remainder of this summer, make sure it's this one. And definitely recommend it to your friends and be sure to have your children read it. In conclusion, this is a fantastic book that will continue to influence your opinion of all books prior to and following your reading of it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"*****Although I read this book when I was only 12, I have now graduated from college, and it is still one of my all-time favorite books.

She has set up a perfect world where everybody has a place and there is no poverty. Everybody recieves an education and health care. there is no crime nor jealousy.

He is selected to be a reciever, the keeper of knowledge and feelings for the entire past. Jonas learns from his teacher, the giver, that everything is the same without change, ever. The reader finds out the community doesn't even see color or have true feelings. Throughout the book, Jonas learns of the terrible secrets of his training and the true cost to the society. He also learns why there is a reciever and why he is so imporant.Lois Lowery has shown the flip side of utopia. If all of the bad is removed and most of the good is also removed, what is left? An empty space. This is great place to start children thinking about what they think of utopia and then explain what they think utopia is may not be what they really want.

The young boy coming of age discovers these things and tries to break away. It's a good story to get kids talking about what matters in life. What is worth fighting for. That all conflict is not bad. That passions make life worth living. Provocative."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver written by Lois Lowry is a well written book.Lois Lowry choose a simple writing style, so everyone can understand it. The book is about a boy who lives in a community where everything is the same. Jonas was selected by the comity of the elders for the most honored job of the community. Lois Lowry wants to show the reader how the way of life could be different if everything is same. I think it is a good book because she proposes the reader to think of his own life, after reading the book. It is written like a science fiction story which seams to be very unrealistically. So at the end of the book I thought that there is a parallelism between &#65533;The Matrix&#65533; and &#65533;The Giver&#65533;. There are many agreements in this two stories because of the parallelism world in &#65533;The Matrix&#65533; there are also Machines which have the control of the whole population, they look for the right way of how the people live.In &#65533;The Giver&#65533; there is near the same with the memories. So if the reader is thinking of the difference of his own way of life and of the way of life which Jonas is living it could be interesting."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really like the novel \\"The Giver\\" written by Lois Lowry. The Giver is really a children book, but I think it is also for ancient people. It is a good novel, because in this book, you can see a utopian community without death and pain and other negative properties. The writer uses a great fascinated style to describe the community. In this Community is everything the same, no differences. I think, on the one hand, that is good, because the people live peaceful, but on the other hand, the people cannot see colour and other expressions. But it is interesting to read this book, to see which effects cause when everything is not the same.This book teaches us to be grateful for the gift of choice, the gift of love, and even the gift of pain. I recommend this book for anyone."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's book \\"The Giver\\" is a good written book which shows us how our live can be in the future. The book is about a community where everything is the same. Their lifestyle is called \\"Sameness\\". The children are born by special birthmothers and not by their biologic mothers like in our world. The people also can't choose their jobs so that everybody get his proffesion by a special group of special observers. There much more differences between Jonas', the main character, and our community so that it will take too much time to list them all out. The story is not really hard too understand so that the book is a good novel to work with it in the English lessons. It shows us how important it is that we can feel pain and of course love."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lowry writes in the novel &#65533;The Giver&#65533; an interesting style about a way of life that is totally different from ours.

After he is chosen to be the new receiver, he gets memories of beautiful things. Now he sees that it is not fair that he is the only one who is able to have them.

When Jonas becomes 12 he is going to receive special training from the Giver. The Giver translates Jonas all the memories and the pleasure of life. There is no turning back for Jonas.

The shown sameness seams unbelievable to me. I can&#65533;t imagine a life like this in the novel &#65533;The Giver&#65533;. The novel motivated to think about our own life and that it is not naturally to be an individual. In contrast to the people in the community we can make our own decisions and can choose for example our own job. Furthermore we can live where or with which person we want. Finally I can say that I won&#65533;t live in a community like the one shown in the novel. But those people in the novel didn&#65533;t know anything else.

These privileges are to \\"protect\\" the people of making decisions which could be wrong,so the community tries to interrupt any feeling which might \\"destroy\\" sameness in the community, which even tells us that there is no freedom in the community.Different from the others, the R.o.M. is never observed and he is allowed to have his own feelings and memories. By showing the R.o.M.'s disagreement with the system, Lois Lowry wants to make the reader think about the community's problems.In that community there is a rule for everything and everyone, everything is manipulated and controlled by the elders but not the R.o.M.. By changing Jonas' situationLois Lowry makes the reader understand the feelings of Jonas during his training lessons with the Giver.Lois Lowry tries to show the reader her interpretation of possible consequences of observing people in a way, which is easy to understand but it is not only her opinion, it makes the reader think about what might happen if everything is influenced by a system which was made for protecting people from themselves.The way the story ends should make the reader identify with Jonas and his decision to flee, when he tries to find a way out of a system, which he do not agree with."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was a very, very good book. While it's great for 5-6th graders, I wouldn't hesitate to use it with even high school age kids. It's a very interesting commentary on human existence and what if we lived in a world with no choices, no decisions were ours to be made, a world of \\"sameness\\". While the community in the book is perhaps at the extreme end of the spectrum it does in some ways parallel the lives that some live in other parts of world. The book makes you appreciate the fact that you do have free choice and that your life is your own to do with as you like, albeit within the realm of the law. The book makes for an interesting discussion about communism, life, and the human condition. It was a very powerful book and it really made you think. I couldn't put it down! I highly recommend this book to any teacher as a read-aloud with their classes or for any middle school/high school teacher as well."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's tale of a future without choice, without pain, and without love is a cautionary tale for every generation.

By the end of the first chapter I was so interested in the book I just couldn't put it down. I specifically enjoyed the way the author transformed the reader into the world of the main character, Jonas. The readers, like Jonas are asked to question their beliefs, dreams and uncertainties.

It is an enjoyable experience that all should partake in, whether young in age or young in heart."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"i borrowed the Giver from the Library for my almost 12 yr. old son.His taste runs very close to mine: sci-fi, horror, mystery. While I waited for him to finish his current book, I picked up The Giver &amp; never put it down. This is such a great story, essentially about an &quot;awakening of the truth&quot; that a 12 year old boy is faced with. He lives in a controlled community, is happy, it seems, until he discovers the truth about the real world while under the tutelage of an old man he will eventually replace as the &quot;keeper of memories&quot;.

He cannot understand why he id different till December when his placement for a job is chosen and his job is so much different from the rest.

You Could not guess what was going to happen next. I have not read many books that are insteresting most of the way through. The book kept saying people get released and go to Elswhere so you think they go. Actually they are killed. Though in the book every thing happens the same way except for the memories,and when Jonas ran away. They had their own story line.The only part that I thought was bad was the ending. Personally I thought it was just plain dumb. They were going down a hill and Jonas heard music and it just stopped. To me you don't just stop an ending like that if you are not going to write a second book. She could at least have told whether he made it or not. Except for that, the ending was good. She described it well and left you in a lot of suspense. The end was the only part I thought was half bad.That's what I thought about The Giver.7.3EC"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was very interesting and mysterious. It was almost like you were in a different world. The people couldn't see color. They didn't know about many of the things we have, for example weather. They also thought animals were imaginary. It was amazing how much was taken away from them. Even their emotions were taken away from them. They kept trying to make a more civilized society. Though they seemed to get more cruel.For example, they didn't even care when they killed a twin of a baby just because they had a twin. They were very mysterious about all the deaths and the memories that the main character Jonas is suppose to receice. Though he thinks it is unfair to the people that they can't have the memories and feel the beautiful feeling like love. Though along with these beautiful and invigorating memories he has to recieve terrible ones of war. Though sometimes there is a price to pay for true happiness to be discovered. Overall I think this book was mysterious and also a bit sadning at parts like when the people were lost."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In my opinion I would give The Giver 3 stars,because the book was only okay.

The end of the book didn't have enough detail to attratct my attention.I think the best part about The Giver was hoe they were similar.It taught me how lucky I am to be capable of making my own decisions.

He has the ability to see beyond - see colors (the people in the Community do not see in color.) In training to be the new receiver, he experiences pain and pleasure unimaginable in the Communty, and thinks it unfair that the Community can not see these things...I think The Giver is a remarkable book and is great for all ages. Lowry's use of words really move you and that is what makes a great book even better. One scene in the story is where Jonas is receiving a memory of snow, and the crash.She describes the motion and pain so well, it feels like you're really there. I gave The Giver five stars, hands downbecause of the use of words, creative ideas, and the story itself.

The way that she used the importance of human interaction, choices, change, and other themes, helped the book flow and gave it a good lesson in the process of a great story. The whole idea of the signifigant role a young boy plays in changing a whole community just blows you away.There is, I think, a down side or two to The Giver. In the end... I meen she should have put just one more chapter in there or write a sequal, to tell us what happened to him and Gabe, if they died and what not.It was an overall good book, and I gave it a goog word for future readers of America.(children of corse). And give it two thumbs up.7.3 LRD"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book wasn't that bad. I've read it very few times and still am not moved in any way by the storyline characters or descriptions. I don't really like Lois Lowry's writing style. It is sort of boring. Don't get me wrong it was a great idea for a book. She should have thought it out more. It seemed like she wanted to write a book and she took the first idea that came to her. The main low point that I didn't like was the ending. All it says is that Jonas heard music. It ends it okay, but leaves you with no imfrmation of what could or should happen next. It doesn't even leave you in any kind of suspense. The descriptions were not as creative or mind boggling as some other books that I've read. The story line was the main high point. Given memories, nobody else knows pain or love. Very clever! The main things that bugged me were the characters. Lily was something you see in every book. I mean nearly every book. Asher was one of the guys that they could have used more throughout the book. He was a fun-loving goofball with a very small role in the story. Fiona was the one I especially liked. One that was so mysterious that Lois Lowry could have done anything with, but she chose not to. She was your average,beautiful, yet very shy girl that could have been used in some way or another to make the story more interesting. So what I'm really trying to say is that overall it was a pretty good book until it go to the ending.7.3JH"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's book, The Giver, was a really good book. I really liked the way she described the \\"Community.\\" I also liked the way she put everything in order. She didn't skip around from in the middle of one of Jonas' sessions with the Giver to school the next day. I thought the ending could've been much better though. She left us on the edge of our seats when she ended the book. She never told us how Jonas liked Elsewhere or if he and Gabe even made it to Elsewhere. THERE NEEDS TO BE A SEQUAL! Overall I think the book was really good. If Lois would've added all the parts she left out including the ending, the start of life in Elsewhere for Jonas and Gabe, how the community reacted to all the memories, what Lily's assignment was, and if Asher and Fiona were put together in a family unit, it would've been that much better! 7.3 jrm"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I liked this book because it tells you that it's good to have choices.If we didn't have color we would all be the same, and it is kind of boring being the same.If we were all the same then we would all have the same personalities. We would all have the same likes and dislikes and no one would be different.Like in the Giver everyone was the same and wore tunics and saw everyone else in the same way. Sameness is boring and we are lucky to be different and have choices. No one had a choice of what they wanted.

I tried to think about what could have happened, but Lowry gave a little sense of mystery. The Giver got me a little confused with being released because in the begining it sounded like they would put the person in another community. In the end it said they killed the released people.My opinion about The Giver is that it was very detailed and that it has a lot of mystery to it. The details were excellent because I could picture the red sled going down the snow hilland then stopping, perfectly. Also the mystery was just enough.

He's an outsider in a place where sameness is welcomed. The Giver also has good character development. You learn about Jonas even as he learns about himself. This book isn't just for young adults. Anyone of any age could read this and get something out of it. I read the book a few years back, I read it recently, and some of my opinions and thoughts about certain parts of the story have changed completely.

Jonas lives in a very unique town, that is black and white. There are also very strange and very strict rules. For example, pilots are not aloud to fly over the town. The punishment for and act as such resorts to being released. As you later find out in the book being released is being injected with a shot that kills you. Only some people know about this, because if everyone found out people would be sad and that is not aloud in this perfect community. Some more strange rules are, every family is only aloud to have one boy and one girl child. If there are any more kids, or if there are twins, they are released. In December each & every kid is \\"promoted\\" to the next age group, no madder when they were born. There is a Committee of Elders, they choose the career for the eleven year olds, who when they turn 12 receive this job The Committee of Elders choose this by watching the 11 year olds as they do their mandatory volunteer hours. Jonas is chosen a very special job, he is chosen the \\"Receiver of Memory\\" which is only chosen every ten years. He is warned he will experience real pain, although he will have the skill of \\"Capacity to See Beyond\\" Being a \\"giver\\" gives privileges such as you can ask a question and demand an answer you can also so things other members of the community are not aloud to do. On the down side you can't tell you dreams, feelings, or anything else you experience or you will be release. Although Jonas shares is memories with a baby Gabriel, who is staying with their family, thankfully he is never caught. Umfortunly Gabriel is sub post to be released, and Jonas doesn't want this to happen, so he runs away with Gabe . And has the giver tell everyone he was \\"lost in the river\\".

Lois Lowry made the book trying to make the reader think. She makes you always want to read more and ends chapters at the perfect points. The book keeps building up and gets better every chapter. In Jonas's world where everything is perfect nobody has choices or decisions. Lois Lowry is trying to get across to the reader that with pain comes pleasure,and love. That theory is what makes this book the five star book that it really is. The ending, though, was disappointing. It does not make much sense and leaves you with a lot of questions.

I was not expecting much, but I was completely surprised--It was captivating. Ms. Lowry has written a book that tackles the issues of diversity, responsibility, and honesty for all readers--young and old.The book's setting is a socially engineered village where outward uniformity, discipline, and manners are the overriding virtues. Different colors are not visible or understood to the villagers because they underscore diversity. Although there is a stated concern for precise and polite speech, euphemisms are used abundantly by the villagers and their leaders to hide the less attractive truths of the their society. Children do not celebrate individual birthdays, but each year a proscribed set of responsibilities and privileges are granted to the children of an age group in the Ceremony. In the twelfth year, children begin their training for adult jobs selected for them by the Elders. The village's surface is calm, but Jonas, the protagonist, has to decide if he should shatter the community's society by using what he has been given in his training for adulthood.I am anticipating interesting discussions at our family dinner table when my son begins to read this book for class."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had to read this book for school.Exactlly I had to read it for the subject english.

The Book is really a exciting. It is a very interesting thought of future. Furthermore the book stimulates to think about life in our world, about life in future and I thought very much about communism, beause of the sameness in the book. But I give &quot;The Giver&quot; only 4 stars because of the end. The book ends very suddenly. You get the empression that Louis Lowry wanted to end the book very fast.

That is one or the more positive of the themes contained in this book, but in addition, the author was able to through a few subtle hints as to what she thinks of the general public&#8217;s mentality. Unfortunately, the latter was negatively derived, hinting that she believes that the average follower would take away the personal edge of life in order to substitute a simpler, more stable life. While I don&#8217;t believe enough unfeeling people would ever have enough say in order to overcome the task of &#8220;Sameness,&#8221; I follow her ideas in that it isn&#8217;t scrupulous.

Jona has the most mportant job in the whole community because &quot;The Giver&quot; is the only one who sees the world as it really is.

I didn't like the open-end.It is a actuell novel which is written in a easy way."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"At first I think this book will be a funny book but it isn't. It's a very hard and sad story. You have no own opinion and you miss all the beautiful events in life. The people in the community live in a prison from which you can't escape. For me the book is very interesting - but sometimes a little bit boring. It's a different style than other books have - that's one important reason for me to read this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"What a touching book. It shows the ultamite value of the human spirit, even in the face of danger. This book is the most touching book i have ever read, and may it's message live in the hearts of all."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am an Eighth Grader in Middle School. I read this book for my reading class, in a few days. Lots of my friends had read the book before and liked it. The story is about a Utopian community and a boy, Jonas, learning more about the outside world. I did not find the story line very intriguing. In fact, I found it a little boring. I found myself just wanting to finish the book, instead of enjoying it. There weren't many surprises along the way, and it failed to keep me guessing throughout the book. My predictions were almost all correct, and book just seemed to stop. The ending was probably the worst part of the book. The chapters leading up to the ending seemed to go too fast for me. It was like Ms. Lowry just decided to end the book there. There were other things in the book that just seemed never to be explained. They just were. For example, the places in the book, like the family units, and House of the Old, were not described very well. The author never gave you a visual picture. You couldn't imagine yourself there, like in other good books. I also found it too unrealist for me. It wasn't a BAD book, just not a good one."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I enjoyed reading The Giver, the content was always moving along nicely, and was never dull. The writing was witty and had a nice touch of realism to it. The story wasn't to hard to understand but it was very bizzare: a young boy living in a controled community, the community controls everything, no colors, no lanscapes, no animal, no nothing, they don't have this stuff because those type of thoughts could mess up the peacefulness of the community. This boy has ben given the task to have the memories of the outside world. He will get these memories by a man that already has the memories who transfers the memories to him. The only problem I have with this book, is that it rushes into everything too quickly, and seems to not talk to detailful about what is going on. All in all though, it is a great book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I rated The Giver a 4 star because I like fiction books and The Giver kinda has a fairy tale twist to it. I didn't like the extra star that I didn't vote for is because I thought it was more of a young aldult book. The main subject in the book is when Jonas' family takes care of a little boy named Gabriel and then Jonas runs away with him. Then him and Gabriel run away to this village."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am doing my report on The Giver by Lois Lowry. The Giver is a fantasy/science fiction book.The Giver is about a boy name Jonas' journey to find a world without sameness. The community that Jonas lives in is a perfectly balanced community in which each family has a mother, father, male child, and female child. For children that have differences, like not sleeping through the night, and members of the community who have done wrong three times there is a penalty called release. In Jonas' family unit they are caring for a boy who is different and they are trying to help him. Once the children of the community become twelve, they are assigned a job. When it is Jonas' turn he is given the job of Receiver of Memory. The person with this job holds the memories of the world before it was the same. The old Receiver gives the memories to Jonas and later Jonas finds out what a release actually is and after the child the family cares for is sentenced to be released do to not sleeping through the night, Jonas takes his memories and the boy to try to find this \\"real world\\".The Giver is a very good book that shows what the world would be like if it was the same. This book is best suited for people ages thirteen and up for the reader to understand the message of the book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver CD was a nice addition to my reading class. The speaker on the CD is easy to understand. However, I was disappointed because the chapters were not marked. You had to search for the chapter each day. If the publisher had been smart, he would have marked the chapters like songs are marked on CD's."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Emotionally charged and relevant politically today. Simple, powerful book both young and old will love. A world we all lived in, but grew out of. Why? How? Add it to your childs book list, treat yourself and talk about it. Great subject matter for the dinner table. Are we in there? The ending is inspirational."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had herd a lot of good things about this book and when I finally read it, it turned out to be an awesome book. It was one of those books that I could not stop reading.In the perfect world that Jonas was born into, everything was planned. Each person was matched with another that they would start a family with and have a life. Each couple was to have two children, one boy and one girl. And if that child did not mature on schedule with all of the other babies, it would be released (killed). All of the old folks lived in a home that they would also be released at a certain date. Each December the children would move up a year. And when you reach the twelfth year, you would get assigned a role in the community. Jonas was a twelfth year, and was ready to receive a role. But when the ceremony came, all the other kids got a role, except Jonas. At the end of the ceremony Jonas was called up to receive one of the most prestigious roles assigned. Jonas was to receive the position of \\"Receiver of Memory\\" this meant Jonas was to learn all of the history behind this perfect world. Why the people did not decide anything, or why they had such strict rules. This news frightened him. An the book goes on about how he deals with receiving all the truth behind this so called \\"Perfect\\" world.I recommend this book to anyone that like a good suspense, kind of mysterious book. I had a great time reading it and enjoyed the things the author did to make it such an interesting book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas, the main character of The Giver, lives in a strange, \\"utopian\\" community of the future. Here, no one makes their own decisions - the Committee of Elders chooses everything from jobs to family members for the people, and the rule book sets forth how all of the people must live their lives. Everything in the community is clean, organized, orderly, safe, and well-planned. There is no crime, no poverty, no competition, and no rudeness. However, this perfect existence comes at a cost. Lois Lowry has written an interesting, exciting, and thought-provoking novel. Although it is categorized in the science fiction genre, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a suspenseful story.When the story opens, Jonas is a careful, compliant young man, who is anxiously awaiting the Ceremony of Twelve, at which he will receive his Assignment - the career which will be chosen for him by the Committee of Elders. He lives in a dwelling with the other members of his family unit (a mother, a father, and a younger sister). They have been selected and assigned to each other by the Committee of Elders.Life in this community is very structured. Sameness and Climate Control ensure that each day is well-planned and that there are no surprises. People, including children, who do not fit in are released and sent Elsewhere. Trained Nurturers are responsible for the care and nurturing of the newchildren for the first year of their lives. Trained personnel of the community also care for the elderly members of the community. When their usefulness to the community is over, they, too, are also released and sent Elsewhere.At the Ceremony of Twelve, Jonas is selected for a great honor - he is to be the new Receiver of Memory for the community. He will be trained by the current Receiver, who tells Jonas to call him The Giver. As part of the training, The Giver will transfer to Jonas all of the memories he is now bearing for the whole community. \\"Memories are forever,\\" The Giver tells Jonas. The Committee of Elders will occasionally seek the advice of The Receiver. He must rely on the memories and experiences to guide the Elders when unexpected things happen in the community.As the new Receiver-in-training, Jonas learns about many things that existed before Sameness and Climate Control. He learns about many feelings, which only The Giver has experienced. He learns of war and hunger - things which are also unknown to the community.It does not take Jonas a long time to he realize that his life will never be ordinary again. He realizes that the great honor he has received is also a great burden. The memories and new experiences cause him to feel frustrated and angry at times with his friends and family. He is upset that they are satisfied with their programmed lives. Jonas tries to make them understand some of the things he has experienced, but he is unsuccessful. Without the memories, they cannot understand. The Giver tells Jonas, \\"The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It's the loneliness of it. Memories need to be shared.\\"After almost a year of training, Jonas and The Giver develop a plan to return the memories to the community. In order for the plan to succeed, Jonas will need all of the memories of strength and courage that the Giver can transfer to him. However, something that Jonas never expected happens which affects Gabriel, a newchild who has been living with Jonas' family unit for the past year. Jonas is forced to alter the plan and improvise a new, much riskier one, without The Giver's help.Read The Giver, and you, too, can discover the price that Jonas' community paid to live in a \\"perfect\\" world, and whether it was worth it. Then, decide for yourself what you would be willing to give up to live in a \\"perfect\\" world."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowery is a medium level book that is good for kids. It is a story about a boy named Jonas who lives in a community. The community is one of many that have chosen to live in Sameness. Citizens in the communty must follow a set of rules given to them by the Town Elders. When you come of age at [...]you get assigned a job. The citizens get assigned a wife if you are a man, or a husband if you are a woman and children. There is no happiness, no fear, and no anger. Jonas didn't know what job he was going to be assigned when his name was called. He was given the job of receiver. The receiver gets trained to receive all of the memories and all the feelings of the other citizens. He learns about colors, true pain and happiness. The Giver gives these gifts. After Jonas learns about these things, he wants to share the feelings with the community. He is left with a decision to make - run away from the place where he grew up or destroy the community by sharing the memories."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very intelllectual book,it really makes you think. After reading it I realized how much I take for granted. Simple things like deciding what I want to wear or what I eat for lunch. The Giver gives a good idea about what \\"the perfect world\\" would be like. No pain, no bad memories to haunt you, a place where everybody is equal."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very ordinary book which is not to detailed nor to boring. It shows how life in a eutopia has advantages and disadvantages. It passes time once you really get into it. I liked this book and would recommend it"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When i read the book The Giver it made me think about different thing. For instance, how would i feel about living in a utopia?, what would i do if didn't live with my bilogical parents?, and How would i feel if i didn't have the ability to love anyone? As i read this book all theses things went though my mind. And after i was done reading it i finally was able to answer them. And my answer was simple:i feel as though i was trap and couldn't get out. And for what i would do i would eventually run away, just like jonas. I really liked this book, especially the ending. But even the ending made you wonder if they were going to make to Elsewhere or not. And that is , in my opinion, the perfect way to end a book, to have your readers wanting to know more. So that they want to be able to buy and read the sequel. And that is exactly how felt after i read the end. If had to rate the book it would get 4 stars.Alberta Smith,13"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, by Lois Lowery, is about a boy named Jonas that is living an average life in a perfect town. He has a mom, a dad, a sister named Lily, and a best friend named Asher. His life was fine until he starts seeing unusual things. In his town when you reach a certain age, you get or earn the right to do something. At the age of 8 you start learning new jobs such as being a planter, birth mother, and doctor. The boards of elders choose a job for you at the age of 12. You have to apply for a wife or husband. If you are able to get one they choose it for you. You have to apply for children just like getting a wife or husband. When he was 12 he was chosen as the receiver of memory. This is a very rare and is also a very big accomplishment. Ten years before, he was selected to be the receiver. A girl had been selected before him but she was a failure. She was released from the town and her name was to be never spoken of again. That is the worst thing that can ever happen to a person from their town. Jonas went to work and when he got there, there was an old looking man sitting in a chair. The man said that he is older looking then he actually is. He said he wanted to be called the giver. He explained what the job is like and said that it would be hard and painful, but it was very important. The giver told him to lie down and to take off his shirt, so Jonas did so. Then the giver put his hands on Jonas's back and Jonas felt a cold feeling. The Giver was transferring memory to Jonas of him riding a sled down a hill in the snow. In his town there was no such thing as snow or hills At first it made him mad that his town choose to not to have snow or hills, but the giver told him why they didn't have them and then Jonas under stood. A few days later he told he giver about the strange things he had been seeing. The giver told him he had started seeing in color. There was also no such thing as color in his town only back white and gray. Jonas was mad again at why his town did that and the giver told him why they did. The giver would transfer memories of color to Jonas. Jonas liked that a lot. I don't want to tell you the whole story because I want you to find out for yourself if Jonas can fulfill his job as the receiver and find out if he will get marred. I recommend this book because it is like an alternate world. It is neat to see what it is like. Lois Lowry is very descriptive in the giver and you will never know what will happen next. I want to read more books from Lois Lowry because of this book"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My own personal grudge against the book comes from the extent of the writing profession, and how it beared so scary and remarkable a resemblence to one of my unpublished ramblings into the SF genre. I had plans of doing a novel where all emotion is stripped away, set in a world much like THE GIVER. Then when I read it, I was somewhat concerned for my own work.Anyway, this is often comparted to a children's 1984. Yes, while it does bear resemblance to 1984, this book is wonderful on its own terms. The story is the world has been taken down into a utopia, a place with no crime and no feeling, no true feeling. The family establishment is essentially nil with no sexuality at all (this resembles the dominant theme in my own work). Birth Mothers are the source of the population, though it does not give the identity of the fathers. Work and family comes about by selection. Jonas, the hero, has been selected to be the Reciever of Memory. It is here he realises how shockingly sterile and devoid of beauty his world truly is. The ending, somewhat vague, rewards the reader by not giving away to much detail.For those readers who will be travelling on to Orwell after this, go to ANIMAL FARM, my own personal favorite, and then 1984 for when they're older.Like all good children's literature, this book deserves to be read by both adults and children alike. Bravo Lowry!Other significant works by Lowry: Number the Stars.Mike London"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book several years ago and have been rereading it ever since. Only recently did I learn that it was, at one point, banned because of &quot;explicit sexual content.&quot; I had to laugh at this because the only thing sexual that happened in the story was something very natural to a young person's development. (Please remember that the protagonist is an adolescent.) It was also crucial to the story as it showed how the community attempted to stifle sexual and romantic feelings (this includes love) in its members.I have to admit that there are parts of the book that are too heavy for younger readers. Aside from the above-mentioned situation, there is euthanasia and infanticide. Yet these things are necessary for the reader to really understand what the characters' lives are like. They are a community without feelings, without history, without the ability to cope with anything that is out of the ordinary. Only two people in the story, a young boy named Jonas and an old man known as the Giver, have feelings, emotions and true awareness. Only they can see colors and hear music and experience joy, anger, sadness and other feelings. In the end, Jonas is smart enough to use all the knowledge and information that he has received to do some good. Instead of letting the community continue to hide, he and the Giver carry out a plan that saves everyone. (At least, that is what the plan was supposed to do. The story ends without clearing up what happened to the community.)The book teaches the necessity of sharing emotions--be they happy ones or sad ones. It teaches the importance of history and the richness of variety. Its ultimate moral lesson is that people cannot hide from the darker aspects of life, because in doing so they hide from all of life and ultimately from love as well. Then the darker aspects (euthanasia and infanticide, among other things) win anyway. We can't kill them by hiding from them: we have to take them head-on."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Why this book is pigeonholed as Children's Literature is a mystery to me, perhaps merely because the protagonist is a twelve-year old, perhaps owing to the author's past works--I'm just glad to have found it. \\"The Giver\\" treats the most profound issues in a manner that speaks of deep understanding; the book will ring you like a bell, the ideas resonate and can not be forgotten. For this reason I call this the rarest of books; once read it will immediately and forever be a part of the reader--in a sense, our author becomes her own creation, she becomes the Giver of memory and her reader a Receiver.It is a spare presentation of a dystopic future world where the \\"problems\\" of humanity have all been neatly resolved; everyone is polite, happy with their job, unthreatened by pain, sickness, conflict and even death. Though it becomes quickly evident that what the author really gives us is a rather convincing rationalization for the fact that evil, pain and suffering are necessary. Foes of religious belief often claim that the idea of pain and suffering is inconsistent with a loving God; but, even for the secular among us, Ms. Lowry shows how suffering and joy are linked. \\"The Giver\\" argues that granting unlimited license to those who would sacrifice individual choice in their attempts to achieve relief from war, famine and economic inequality could very well eliminate that which makes life worth living. \\"The Giver\\" says much about the danger of placing the interests of the community above the interests of individuals.To say much about the story risks spoiling the slow exposition of the underlying flaws in the utopia, which was exceptionally well paced. At first the \\"community\\" seems vaguely creepy, by the end of the book it is horrifying. \\"The Giver\\" is a novel of ideas that begs to be discussed and argued over as the part of any moral education. It is powerful beyond my ability to express and like any truth, it offers something of value to any reader at any level.Highest Recommendation."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is one of the most amazing books that I have ever read. When Jonas felt pain, I too felt pain. Lois Lowry describes in such great detail that the reader feels as if they are the character. It's no wonder this won the Newberry! If you haven't already read it, DO SO NOW!!! It is appropriate for anyone over the age of about 10. if you're a fan of the Shadow Children or Left Behind: the Kids series' (as I am of both) then I promise you will LOVE this book! It's definitely one of the best I've ever read. If this review was helpful to you, PLEASE SAY YES! Please help me in raising my position on Amazon's site. Thank you!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is the Story of a boy coming of age that has been singled out at the time he is supposed to get his job assignment. Jonas, the boy was a seemingly normal boy until he got his job assignment. He was given a job that one person may succeed at and another may not. He has been chosen as his community's next keeper of memories. The community is free from pain and despair except for the keeper of memories was the only one to know of them. He has been given the duty to keep all the good and bad memories of the old time. Once he gets some of his special training by the Giver, the former keeper of memories, he decides that the people need the good and bad memories so that they do not live a controlled life without meaning. While he is trying to give the memories back, he finds another boy that would have been released (which means he would have been killed), if he had not been saved. The story has a great moral. We should not lose our feeling and passion to have a life where there is peace everywhere, but no freedom, a controlled life, where one does not choose to do things. This book was an easy read and it teaches a lot. It teaches that you should have both good and bad. By getting rid of the bad the good is gone. All that is left is things that are not good or bad. The book had a good plot but it did not explain itself enough. It receives a 4 out of five from me."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In my opinion, \\"The Giver\\" was an excellent book. It dealt with a future that is both frightening in its reality and illuminating in the way their society is run. Dealing with the story of a growing boy who is about to face his life's job for the first time, Jonas is chosen for the most respected job. He is the Receiver of Memories, who remembers everything of the history of the race so that the general public doesn't have to. They live in a world without color, emotion, or choice of any kind - they are even given pills to prevent sexual urges. Lois Lowry combines the idea of communism to the extreme with the idea that even a twelve-year-old child can change society if he so chooses in a story that makes you appreciate how horrible a life like that could be in comparison to all of the choices we make today."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"At first glance, The Giver, a mere 180 pages easily readable in a single sitting, seems to be the average teenage novel. The plot and characters are fairly easy to comprehend and you don't have to be in an honors class to understand and appreciate this book. When I first read it in 6th grade, I thought The Giver was pretty cool. It's basically the story of how Jonas, a young boy, struggles with his totally concrolled life and eventually begins to break loose. He learns that while his society may be safe, having no choices and no freedom is not really living. Now, 5 years later, I read it again and am totally awestruck at the depth contained within this small novel. Moving beyond the plot and characters, I began seeing the social commentary and warnings that Lois Lowry had set in place. It honestly made me think about the world, and in fact, the thought of a life such as Jonas' is deeply disturbing. Imagine a world without color, without music, without love. A very scary notion, which makes for a truly awesome book. I highly reccomend it for readers of all ages. Grown-ups and middle schoolers alike with both enjoy this wonderful novel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Felt like the first half of a longer book. I might have liked it if it weren't for the childish writing style. It reminded me of a the way a 10-year-old tells you about his day-- \\"First this happened. And then this happened. And then this. And then this.\\"Just not really good overall. As some of the other reviewers suggest, read 1984 or Brave New World, or countless others instead. One might argue that this book has more of a metaphysical leaning but those concepts weren't really given the proper treatment. The lofty ending might not have been as bad if the first 90 percent of the book weren't so matter-of-fact."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Eleven-year-old Jonas lives in a \\"perfect\\" society: there is no war, no poverty, no hunger, no sickness. Everyone has equality and there is Sameness exists. Everyone is given a job when they turn twelve, and Jonas is quickly approaching this important age. Jonas is selected by the Community to be the very honorable \\"Receiver of Memories,\\" in which he spends time with The Giver and learns all of the memories of things past. The Giver is the only one who knows the truth of what went on before Sameness, and now it is time for Jonas to begin the process of taking those memories from him.I've been wanting to read this book for a really long time. I have no idea why I waited so long! I inhaled it. It is absolutely incredible. Ms. Lowry did an amazing job creating a society that is free of worry, free of pain, free of anything troublesome. Everything is, well, just lovely. At least I thought it was, because Jonas thought it was.......until I realized something HUGE about the way Jonas sees things. I mean, about the way he *literally* sees things with his eyes! Wow! Jonas only realizes that he and the rest of the people in his community are being completely deceived in their perception of things when he spends time with The Giver and receives some memories that are very confusing to him.As Jonas begins to take on the memories of the truth of the past before Sameness, he realizes that along with things like warfare, poverty, pain, hunger, there was also the warmth of sunshine, the beauty of color, the chill of snow, and the delight of rain. He realizes that he has a choice: to let the rest of the community continue to live as they are...without knowing any of the good and the bad of the past and also without the ability to choose anything for themselves, or he can make them aware of all that they are missing. What they don't know can't hurt them, right?Jonas and The Giver make a plan to carry out their decision...and then their plan A turns to a plan B...and things get a bit crazy and chaotic. My heart was thumping almost out of my chest! Even though Gathering Blue and The Messenger (Lowry's sequel books) are not part of the challenges, I will absolutely read them in the not too distant future...I would love it if everyone I knew read this book right now. It was that good! I will recommend it to everybody. I can't believe it has been in existence for so long and I am just now getting to it. But thank goodness I did! I finished it several days ago and cannot stop thinking about it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I find it hard to believe that this book is \\"bad literature.\\" Don't believe the low-star reviews by kids who will not understand the deeper meaning, advanced ideas and vocaulary, or grammar. Of course it will be boring to younger kids because there is no \\"BOOM! CRASH!\\" action like The Hunger Games. Everyone I knew who has read it enjoyed it very much because it made them think about lots of things. And, yes, it's disturbing and dark. Why wouldn't it be? It's a DYSTOPIAN NOVEL. Not a utopian novel. And boring? Well, it depends. If you wanted to see Jonas and the Giver go all out and battle people, it's not going to happen. The reason why Jonas decided to just leave was to 1) save Gabe and 2) have the people begin to remember the memories and deal with them. And no, parents, Jonas doesn't commit suicide. He's suffering from hypothermia with various other afflictions. Perhaps some are talking about Rosemary, but the fact is is that she wasn't strong enough to bear centuries worth of pain and suffering. And, yes, the \\"release\\" was really sickening and horrifying. It was supposed to, and the kids I know were looking pretty ill, too. Parents have the right to read and judge for themselves whether it will be an appropriate book for kids, but it's a good, thought-provoking book for young adults."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought The Giver was a very strange book. I thought it was strange because their community had so many rules. For example, they become adults when they are 12, and the men have to apply for a wives and children. I enjoyed reading The Giver. I thought it was interesting seeing a whole different culture. Lois Lowry did a wonderful job making a whole different world and culture. I think people should read The Giver because it is a well written book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"As I read through the first few pages I felt kind of confused because what I thought the book was going to be about it wasn't really about that at all. Then as I hit the mid pages I liked and understood it. I think that the book was exciting and you were always wondering what was going to happen next. It wasn't such a fighting war type of book, but it also wasn't such a mellow, comfy type of book. I like how the author wrote each chapter. He used very clever and interesting words to describe what each character was feeling emotionally, physically, and mentally. Over all I think I liked and enjoyed the book because I didn't understand everything right when it happened, but by the end it all had woven together."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is one of the best books i've ever read, Lowry's imagination is incredible. this is a book like no other, it's set in a totally different world, probably the future as Lowry sees it. This is a very unique book, there aren't many like it, or as good. It's a story about a boy who lives in a strange, utopian (rather wanna-be-utopian) society and is faced with many problems. Even though his problems are totally different than ours, you can really realate to him, it makes you think of our world from a different perspective.I STRONGLY RECOMEND THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The first time I read this book I was in fourth grade, and most of of its meaning was lost on me. I have reread this book and a lot of connections were made that I simply was not mature enough to see before. At the ripe old age of nine, I simply did not understand the ideas of freedom and the ability to make choices. Now at 18, I see many of the ideas that went through Jonas' mind paralleled my own as I matured. The sense of individuality and freedom, which I now take for granted, were completely removed from the society Jonas was raised in, yet he found the ideas buried within him. It shows that the breaking away of a maturing child is archetypal in nature.

It seemed to me that it was another story of pure imagination and little reason if any.After a while, I started to realize the message that Lois Lowry was trying to convey. She was stating the dangers of pure conformity and tradition. They had left individuality, and even justice, to distort it to fit their conformist beliefs.In that society's beliefs, killing the old or handicapped was not only normal, but right. Only the Giver understood the pain of loss, the value of human life and individuality, and everything that had been left behind by society.The Giver contained a lot of imagination, but now that I look back on it, I see the reasoning."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A psychologically terrifying book by Lois Lowry. I was addicted to this book and was never able to put it down for more than ten seconds. I read it in one day. It's about a community where there are no feelings, no color, no pain. Jonas, a young boy preparing for the Ceremony of Twelves. He is \\"apprehensive\\", as he puts it. He is given the task of being the Receiver of Memory, to be trained by an old man known only as the Giver. It also features a variety of secondary characters: Asher, Jonas' best friend and a confused malaprop: Fiona, a red-haired girl whom Jonas has a crush on; and Lily, Jonas' precocious little sister."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It is thought to be a society of perfection, peace and comfort at first glance, but this so believed utopia of the culture cannot be bear by Jonas who is appointed to be the new receiver of the town. Until he learns the truth of this society, evilness and suffering cannot match those of joys. Pain and sorrow triumphs society when little freedom of choice is neglected from the people. Before, he was never capable of understanding the truth of &quot;releasing&quot;, now that he knows the truth he is determined to rebel and escape from the evilness of this society.This book is a must read for all age over 12. If you enjoy reading this book, also consider reading &quot;Anthem by Ayn Rand&quot;.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In the world where fear is not a factor, crime is not an option, and happiness is required, Jonas, a twelve year old, changes this world drastically. The community Jonas lives in is one hundred percent controlled but the government and as people reach a certain age, they are given a privilege to receive something from the government. When Jonas is assigned a job as a receiver on his twelfth birthday, people in his community only see him as a caring, smart, never to do anything wrong young adult. As Jonas is opened up to a world only a few get to see in his society, he is astonished and appalled by the troubling activities that take place to make his world, a \\"safe\\" place. The Giver, person who gives Jonas the memories, changes Jonas and changes his way of life by opening Jonas up to pain, fear, and doubt. As Jonas tries to live his life, he realizes that his family as well as his community is controlled as if they were robots. The government has made strict rules and if some \\"forbidden\\" rules are broken, \\"the government\\" makes the person who broke the rule just disappear. This is what drives people to do as they are told. Jonas gets to a breaking point and he decides that people need to know about what is going on in his community. His first step was giving his received memories to a baby that was temporarily living at his house. The baby did not meet the \\"requirements\\" due to crying all the time, and was scheduled to be put to death. Fearing that the government would find out and knowing what happened to the previous receiver, he takes an unpredictable step. This book is truly an amazing piece of writing and it should be a requirement for schools throughout the country."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry, is a suspenseful book for readers of all ages. In \\"The Giver\\" the main character, Jonas, is living in a futuristic utopian society free of all crime, sickness, and even death. It seems like the perfect world where everyone is safe and nothing can go wrong. Until Jonas turns twelve and is given his assignment when he realizes that his way of life is not perfect and that things must change if he and his community are ever going to be free. Lois Lowry uses vague descriptions and excellent foreshadowing to keep the reader guessing throughout the book. \\"The Giver\\" is a great science fiction novel for anyone who enjoys mystery and suspense."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an amazing book. It starts with a boy, Jonas, that is living in a so called \\"perfect\\" community, with no pain, poverty, warfare, love, or color. A community void of any emotion. At first, as you read, you see that the character is oblivious of what really goes on in the community. He doesn't know what \\"really\\" happens when people get a \\"release\\", or that some people lie daily. It's a world were there's just trust, yet, as I said, no emotion. But then when the Ceromony of the Twelve comes around, Jonas is chosen to be Reciever of Memory, a job that is highly honored in the community. And soon after, Jonas meets the Giver, the previous Reciever of Memory, who helps explain to Jonas that the community, the world, was not always part of \\"Sameness\\", or not always the same. He tells Jonas that the world used to have animals, (which are in the community considered imaginary), love, pain, and many other things. So the Giver everyday shows Jonas good, bad, happy, and even awful memories from the past, the memories that are only given to the Giver so the rest of the community won't have to suffer. But soon Jonas wants to share the memories, wants the people to know these things, feel these things. So the Giver and Jonas devise a plan so that the community will be forced to bear the memories, all the memories. And so the adventure begins...There are many other things in the story that I left out, so you'll have to read the story to see what, but it's an amazing story so I think you'll enjoy reading it as I did. :) :)Peace out---> ^___^"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"MINY INTERMEDIATE BOOK CLUBThe Giver by Lois Lowry is an eerie yet interesting story and very original. Lowry digs into the deeper meaning in the society we live in today. The story is about a boy named Jonas who is selected to be the next Receiver of Memory by the Giver. This is the most honored job in the community. Only the Receiver of Memory remembers pain and grief, but he is also the only one to remember love and pleasure, music and color. After finding out the truth about his society, he and the Giver devise a plan to give the memories to the community, but the plan must change. Lois Lowry leaves the reader with a cliffhanger ending.The ideas presented in the book made us think about how our future could be: What if this happens to us? What if things get so bad we decide to take pills to avoid strong feelings, be locked up, tell lies, never know love, have no privacy, prevent diversity? Are some of these things beginning to happen today? The book shows the controlling power of people who take over everything and use it for no good just to be safe.A few of us had read The Giver when we were younger, but this time we enjoyed it even more. We are glad we decided to read it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Thats what i told my teacher after the first two chapters when my team was assigned this book in school. well the first two chapters were really hard to understand for me but i got it after talking with groups in class. then i slowly started to like it. When i got to chapters 8-10 i couldnt put this book down! it was simply amazing and unpredictable. Fighting Ruben Wolf used to be my favorite book, but now The Giver is. I cant wait for tommorrow(monday) cause im going strait to the libary and picking up The Messenger. and i hate books. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book should be a \\"must read\\" for every young person particularly those whose life, thus far, is focused on the material \\"rewards\\" of life. The Giver can be humbling, uplifting plus a treatise on what our lives are really all about. Adults will find \\"sage\\" philosophies as wee."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is much like other futuristic Utopian society novels. In fact, there are some parallels to 1984. What 1984 lacks (more love, more positive emotion), however, The Giver more than possesses. In a way, I suppose this could be 1984 from a child's myopic perspective.Jonas is a young boy who can't wait for his next birthday, the day he gets to find out about his future occupation. All children are told what they will do for their occupation. It's a society in which there are nearly no choices, no fear, no love, no feelings. Along with that, unfortunately, is the fact that other simple pleasures and common knowledge is lost on the majority of society. It will be Jonas' job to remember everything that the others do not have to remember, that which they can't even comprehend.The book reads quickly with very few lulls. It's definitely a \\"can't put down\\" book. In the end the reader is allowed to make a choice, to decide how the purposefully ambiguous ending is supposed to conclude. It is up to each reader to determine whether or not the tale is sad and gloomy, or happy and optimistic.The Giver is a wonderful story for nearly all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. Lowry really makes you be careful what you wish for. This is a book about a future where anything inefficient is nonexistent. Hills were harder to drive through; they were flattened. Snow slowed shipping; they got rid of that to. Difference between humans caused fighting; individuality? What's that? color is part of individuality;that's history too.This is a story about a boy who lives in this \\"perfect\\" landscape. When he comes of age, he is given the rare job of the giver. The giver is the person who holds all the \\"memories\\" of the past before this so-called perfection. In his training, he is taught of hills, snow, and individuality. And he discovers color. He comes to hate this colorless, dull society, where his parents don't even love him. And so he and the previous giver plan a way to get rid of the perfection. A great book by all means."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My 13 year old Godson read The Giver and he was so interested, I decided to read it too. It took about an hour, it was so compelling. However, the ending really disappointed me!! WAAAAY too many unanswered questions! I am not talking about tidy resolutions, but it seems like the author got tired, and just stopped!!I teach lit, and also read avidly, so have a lot to compare it to.Do read it, though. It's worth it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In this day and age, disappointment and unhappiness is rampant in our society. Every once in a while, someone has to wonder, \\"Why can't everyone just be happy?\\" Well, The Giver shows a world where everyone is. There is no pain, no war, no hunger, and no divorce. Everything is perfect. Or is it? Lois Lowry gives readers a look into a world of the not-so-distant future, where every aspect of life is regulated so that everyone can be happy. Twelve-year-old Jonas discovers the faults in this system all too soon, as he embarks on his journey into adulthood and into the community. He soon discovers the web of lies, ignorance, and shallow feelings that will shape mankind forever... unless he does something about it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"...With an awesome plot but it was one of those books that leaves you sort of hollow and with a new look of what the world may become. You know your so engrossed in thinking it over in your head you walk into walks and can't talk for about an hour. A world without color, love and choices, is a scary thought. It took me only a day to read this mostly because it was too good to put down but also because I'm a very fast reader. Even if it is a very good book and thought provoking, I don't think younger kids should read it. It may not make a lot of sense to them and that ruins a story when you have to come back and read it later after a failed attempt. By now your probably wondering why I gave it only four stars. The reason is no matter how many times I read the ending I still wonder: What the hell happened?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The story of Jonah and the Giver is one to be handed down through the generations. Reading this young people is a great way to realize that they have not been completely brainwashed by MTV and cable television. Teens delight in the suprises and discoveries that are revealed while reading The Giver. A wonderful book that will last throughout the ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book about a year ago and I thought it was good. I thought it was very interesting to see what the author thought the future could be like (for instance how the married couples are assigned to each other by their interests instead of falling in love). I liked the small twist at the end and would recomend this book for people who like science ficton as well as anyone who enjoys an easy-to-read and interesting book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Personally I think this book is fantastic. Instead of focusing on a personality-free world, as one of the other readers might have thought, it actually shows that we need a bit of everything to keep the world going. We need war, and we need rebels. We need conflict and we need pain. We will always need change, and, like the book says, we will always need love, no matter how corny that sounds.This really is a great book, so I strongly suggest that you should read it and/or reread it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"this book really makes you think about our world. Compared to Jonas', everything is \\"better\\". They are not allowed to be unique. Their community must be filled with \\"sameness\\",but when Jonas is chosed to be the new Reciever of Memory he discovers color,hapiness, and love. He then realizes how nobody else knows about emotions.But when he finds out about all the good things he also learns about hate,war,coldness and death. He and the Giver then decide that Jonas must run away and give the community all their emotions and memory back to them so they can actually feel feelings, feel love,weather, like snow, sunlight and rain, pain but also warmth and excitement. HE also finds out when people of the communtiy are \\"released\\". Jonas cannot let this happen to baby Gabriel ( a baby who had been taken care of by Jonas and his assigned \\"family\\" unit). so he then takes Gabriel out of the community , releasing everybodys emotions and memory back to them. He goes off to a journey far away from the community until they reach a familiar place that Jonas had been given a memory of by The Giver.I really enjoyed this book and if someboady reads it im sure they will like it too. What i liked most about it was that it was not for a second boring. Each chapter it gives new details and new imformation that really makes you stop and think."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I was assigned to read this book in my literature class, I was very skeptical. My teacher kept saying, \\"It's kind of a sci-fi story, but it' not.\\" So not only did I not want to read the book, I thought my teacher was a bit loony. But, for my education's sake, I forced myelf to start reading it. I had it finished 2 months ahead of when the class was scheduled to finish. It is a very good and well-written book. I enjoyed it a lot and it definitely keeps your interest, because you never know what will happen next."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book in 8 grade, now I am going to go to the high-school! Anyway, I think that everyone should read this book, it actually makes you think. If you like reading books that suprise you, then you won't be dissapointed in this one. It's very suprising!The only thing that I didn't like was about this book was the ending, it's very confusing and sad (I think). All in all, this is a GREAT book, and you should read it!That's all, I hope this review helped you."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"You can't improve upon perfection, and that is what Lowry has created in The Giver. This is one of the most universal novels I have ever read (and reread). Each time I read it, and as I get older, I find new meaning in the novel. This is not just a book for the young, as I believe it is recomended for, because the deeper meaning and some of the adult themes cannot be truly appreciated by a younger audiance. However, I for one read it when I was 10 for the first time and that is when I first fell in love with it. I continue to read it every couple of year, at least.--Some have addressed the fact that the story is simple and \\"scifiish\\". well, frankly, it is science fiction and it is a simple story. The language is simple, that is why the reading level is so low. And the facets that offend some adult readers will mostly pass by a child reader. And if not, they are not concepts that are not prevalent in life. This book won an award for a reason, because it is sound literature that proves many points about the society we live in. So in conclusion, I supose this book is not going to impress the conservative crowd, or those who think children need to be protechted from books.I for one am still in awe."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When you think of life , be happy you have someone who loves you or when you love someone.When you think of life,be glad that you have someone to take care of you, a shoulder to cry on.

All through this book I discovered things as if I was Jonas trying to piece things togther. It was written well with depth and understanding. It isn't just a book about a boy in a strange society; It's a book connecting to our daily lives and controversies happening right now. This is a very good book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry takes place in a &quot;perfect world.&quot; For kids of every age, something happens to them. At age 9, they can ride a bike. At age 10, their hair gets cut. There is a naming ceremony for newborn children. Every person has a role in this town. There is a house for the old, and if they get too old or are not the kind of person that should live in this town, they are sent away. This goes along with babies, too. This year, someone will be selected from the 12 year olds to work with &quot;The Giver&quot; who gives him facts and images from the past. But who will it be and what will he/she do with it, and how will he/she react? This book is a great novel. The story flowed easily and at the end of the story, you are left in suspense to what happens next. The only thing that I didn't like was that the story was fiction, this kind of community would not exist ever, or maybe it would sometime in the future. I recommend this book for anyone who likes suspense, because this book will have you hooked on it until you finish it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's &quot;The Giver&quot; is set in a time and place where almost all times and places are set. The characters wrapped up in this gripping novel live in a utopian-like society. Everything is planned. Certain rules must always be followed. Love does not exist to anyone but one solitary person, who still remembers. Every one has a role in the community. One person will be selected to receive the knowledge of the past. But what will the giver of the information do with it? I think that &quot;The Giver&quot; was an excellent novel. The plot was well-developed and flowed easily. However, the story did contain some suspense as to what would happen next. This made it very interesting to read. The characters in &quot;The Giver&quot; are characterized well and are easy for the reader to relate to, as well as the situations. However, the story is entirely fiction and completely imaginary...at least at this point in time. This gives the reader room for his or her own thoughts on every topic discussed. This is one novel that will keep a reader going, turning page after page, and not wanting to stop until they reach the back cover."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book attempted to provide a narrative through a hypothetical future society( somewhat like Russian Commumism ) where many fundamental human modes of perception are abandoned in order to maintain &quot;sameness&quot; and alleviation of life's emotional and physical pain. This future society hinges on the &quot;recievers&quot; who bear the burden of humanities past and provide eithical consult to the societies crafters to maintain equilibrium. The main character is elected at age 12 to become the communities new &quot;reciever&quot;, and in turn learns the horrible truths of man's raw existence. Although well written despite the intended audience, the book was enlightening and a good read. A rather annoying aspect was the littering of feminist thought that seemed rather artificial and contradictory to the other ideas presented. For instance the main characters father is a &quot;nurturer&quot;, or someone whos job it is to care for infants( note here that instead of breastmilk, the babies are fed *formula* ). The mother, however, maintains a lucrative job at the &quot;ministry of justice and law&quot;. Also a obnioxiously repeated theme is the &quot;high dishonor&quot; that birthmothers are given in this society( the babies are disowned from the mother after birth and reassigned to the community &quot;pairs&quot; ). I feel like these things were stuck into an otherwise interesting book as part of the authors more personal agenda. Reccomended to all people with a stomach for 60s feminism."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a phenomenal book about finding your place in the world. Jonas, the main character, is living in a futuristic society and is unlike anyone else in his community. Many rules have changed since present day and the people of Jonas' community don't own as much control over their lives as we do. One of the major changes is that Elders choose your occupation when you become a &quot;twelve.&quot; Since Jonas is not outstanding in any of his day to day tasks, he finds himself being placed in a job that is very remote from his society, yet is highly honored. This job allows Jonas to view and experience what our world today was like and even before today's world. These &quot;memories&quot; are transformed to Jonas through the Giver. This is the occupation that Jonas will someday fulfill. However the memories come in many different attitudes from sad, mad, hurtful, happy, fun and many other moods. These have a major effect on Jonas' way of thinking of and seeing his society. This makes Jonas very isolated from everyone in his community. As Jonas sets out to change the world he also finds and changes himself!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"After reading a few of the other reviews for this book, I realize how great this book really is because of the lessons it implies, but mostly because of the audience the book has the power to touch. Written for children, this Newberry award winner is a truly wonderful story. Similar to the classic &quot;Brave New World,&quot; the story idea is quite original, but the themes are what make the book so important. A ten year old reader commented that the book is confusing, and although I do not agree, I would say that the short book packs a powerful punch! This would be a wonderful book for family discussion, class assigned reading, or even a bible study. Recommended to audiences of all ages and of my favorites!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this novel very quickly(about 2 hours), but it has stayed with me for a long time. It reminds me of a shooting star. A gorgeous sight that comes along once in a blue moon and is not to be missed. And when it does come it holds an impact that with last forever. A beautiful story about a boy who tries to break away from something so right, but later very wrong. This novel reminds me of a poem by Pink Floyd:Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves The echo of a distant tide Comes willowing across the sand And everything is green and submarine And no one showed us to the land And no one knows the wheres or whys But something stirs and Something tries And starts to climb towards the light Strangers passing in the street By chance two separate glances meet And I am you and what I see is me And do I take you by the hand And lead you through the land And help me understand the best I can And no one calls us to the land And no one crosses there alive And no one speaks And no one tries And no one flies around the sun And now this is the day you fall Upon my waking eyes Inviting and inciting me to rise And through the window in the wall Comes streamin in on sunlight wings A million bright ambassadors of morning And no one sings me lullabies And no one makes me close my eyes So I throw the windows wide And call to you across the sky."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The giver is a book that will stay with you forever, it is full of an impact that will amaze you.

The giver gives him special gifts."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I found this book to be one of the most thought-provoking books I have ever read. I could understand the rationale behind the utopian design, and I could even see its merits. Conversely, I found myself yearning for Jonas to choose the emotion-filled free-will life. Already an optimist, after reading The Giver, I saw our world as an even more wonderful place."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"At the end of this school year, our last novel we read was The Giver. We had to read it for our 'Futuristic' or 'Science Fiction' unit. As our teacher explained it, we all dreaded reading this. The first few chapters made us ALL more interested. Just reading about a 'Perfect' world made Jonas' lifestyle desirable by all of us. Yet, as the book progresses, we just slightly find out more about his life. Jonas lives a pretty normal life..in his world until his 12th Year Ceremony. He gets selected...as the NEXT Giver! As of that moment he is in training...and his whole life will change. There is no violence, love, pain, and other things. Not to give away too much, the book gives the definition of Perfection in Life. Something we will probably never accomplish. Read it, and journey through Jonas' life and community. Keep it in mind that it his world is PERFECT, and most of the time perfect isnt that good..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed reading this book. It caused me to think about issues that I do not normally think about. It also provided an entirely different viewpoint than any that are available in the world today.The book showed benefits and flaws to a controlled system, one that many people think could work, given a chance. Some of the issues presented in the book, had not even crossed my mind as being a problem or a solution, such as the formation of the family unit and the generalization of age by having one day on which people advance in age.The Giver also showed what it would be like to experience certain concepts and emotions for the first time, something I enjoyed tremendously. Love, anger, hate, suffering; all of these things were discussed in this book with a kind of clarity that no one who had grown up with them could possess.This book is a must-read for anyone who enjoys being provoked into thought. It is easy to read, with moderate vocabulary, but is incredibly well-written."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver I thought was a very good book. It provides us with a glimpse of the good and bad of a utopian society. I would suggest to everyone that you read this book. At first you may not be interested, but it only gets better along the way. The Giver opens up your eyes, and you begin to feel for the main character Jonas, as well as the Giver. You will also begin to have your own feelings about the society Jonas lives in and being released. Therefore, the Giver is an exciting book that everyone will enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I definitely enjoyed the storyline of this book very much. You are presented in the beginning of the book with Jonas, a boy about to turn twelve. You meet his family and see that there is much emphasis on job titles in the community, as well as much emphasis on what is called Sameness. Jonas' story of being selected as the next Receiver of Memory is definitely riveting. You encounter his trials and tribulations as he learns about the world and begins to feel and see things for what they really are.This book most definitely had touches of Communism, in that everything is the same and everyone has an important role in the community. Everyone has the same things, and everyone (mainly the Committee of Elders) is the government. Jonas begins to see through this as he learns more about his job, and begins to feel things such as love for the very first time.This story is powerful. It has so much inner meaning behind it, such as in the end. The symbolism in the book is amazing, as is the storyline. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone of all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In a futuristic society where individuality is suppressed to be virtually non-existent, a young boy tests the limits of conformity. \\"Selected\\" to be the new Receiver of the community, Jonas begins to understand the hypocrisy and deceit his entire life has been based on, and the realization that maybe the \\"perfect\\" community was lacking some things that were essential to life. Jonas' story is a defiant struggle of the self versus the masses, in which one young boy will strive to maintain that which he holds dear. The Giver is an excellent story of a Utopian society that is perhaps not all its cracked up to be. Although based on a middle school reading level, the story contains ideas that can be re-examined over and over again. The Giver is a truly brilliant and insightful work about the evils of conformity."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was, in my opinion, a very good book. It was easy to read and easy to understand. The story is about a boy named Jonas, and he lives in a community that is perfect- that is, there is no pain and no memory of any negative experiences. It is essentially a \\"Sameness\\" area where nothing changes. However, when Jonas turns twelve he is given a job in the community. That job involves the memory of all past events- good and bad. Jonas's life changes because he learns the truth about everything, whether he wants to or not.I would highly recommend this book to anyone. I found that I had a hard time putting it down...I had to know how it ended!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I absolutely love this book. It not only provokes thoughts and ideas, it touches the people reading it. Utopias are interesting subjects to read about. Imagine a world without any pain, hardship, or public death. However, there is also no love. The main character, Jonas, realizes this as he receives memories. I can't describe what some parts of this book make you feel. I would recommend The Giver to anyone over the age of 12."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book. It's not too hard material but it's a little complicated. I would suggest that kids 9-14 should read it. It's a good book for any project since it's very unique."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very interesting book. Lois Lowry does an excellent job in creating an utopian world that takes place in the distant future. However, as Jonas the protagonist learns, this world isn't perfect. The communities are hiding a secret, even from themselves!With an intriguing plot, setting, and characters, I was able to read the book in two sittings, unable to notice the passing of time. When a book is able to do that, we all know it's good."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Before I read The Giver one of my first wishes would have been to have a perfect life. Then when I read the book my veiw of a perfect life changed. It took me into a different world where a boy named Jonas lived in a perfect community without feelings. Then when he receives the assignment of a Receiver of Memory, his life style changes. He finds he has the power to change his world, and he shows me that the perfect picture is not so perfect after all.The Giver, also reminds me of another book of Lois Lowry's called Gathering Blue. This story also shows me that one person has the power to change their world. I have recommended The Giver to many of my friends, and now I am recommending this book to you. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is about a young boy named Jonas who lives in a much different society than our own. When Jonas come of age, he is trained for what he is going to do for the rest of his life.

The Giver is a person who holds all the memories of \\"the old ways\\" such as color, snow and twin babies. When Jonas sees how life used to be, he tries to escape to life in a more democrative society.I felt this was an outstanding book. I thought the plot was very suspenseful and it is so well written that you would never have guessed how it turns out to be. It also had a profound effect on me becuase it made me see the point of view of another society and what it is like to live in another than my own.Please Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Imagine living in a Utopean Society that is rotten at the core. For Jonas, a 12-year-old boy, just that happens. His exists in a community with the strongest sense of conformity. There philosophy is in the idea of sameness. They believe in this so strongly that they have removed memory, emotion, pain, and even color from their society. Jonas is chosen to become the Receiver of Memories. Everyone is so proud and confident in him, but Jonas will soon realize the corrupted community that is being controlled by. Jonas learns about emotion and freedom through an old man known as The Giver. He transfers his memories to Jonas, allowing him to experience love, pain, and joy first hand.This book is a great and easy read for the science fiction fan inside of us all. If you like the myth or folklore, it will be especially exciting. Every turn of the page hold a new twist that will leave you guessing for more. Although, if your a big fan of solid endings, don't be upset if this book leaves you with unanswered questions. I give this book a very solid 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Although written on a 5th grade level, \\"The Giver\\" is a book for all ages. It illistrates the importance of having and sharing memories with one another. Jonas, the Giver, and the community learn a great deal about learning what it means to trully live, love, feel, and see. The story proves that without pain there is no passion, and without hate there is no love. I trully enjoyed the book and I recomend it for everyone to read. After reading the book make sure to sit down with a family member and share an intimate memory. The Giver recieves two thumbs up and five golden stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I would not say it was the worst book I have ever read about a utopia,but it wasn't the best either. The idea of a place where there is no pain is good; alot of fiction books use that idea. There's something wrong and Jonas the leadcharacter breaks most of the rules to get a child out of the colony while the government usesall its resources to get him back. He escapes from the only end in that place: death.The ending, I think, doesn't make sense. Lois Lowry just chose an easyway to end it. Even so, it is a classic and I rate it 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a well written book. It will keep you reading for a long time.

The community is controlled by a group of elders who believe they are protecting the people of their community. The people in the community experience a life without pain and little emotion and no memories of the past. This is seemingly a wonderful life except it is a life controlled by a committee.There is however, one individual the Giver, who carries the burden of all memory, emotions and suffering for the community. He is like Jesus who died on the cross and took all of our sins with Him except the Giver is not perfect. Therefore, every number of years a new child is picked by the committee to be the receiver of all the pain, memories and emotion. The current giver passes this on to the new giver and so the community continues until one receiver no longer plays by the rules of the community.The burden of being the reciever is great and they bare much pain during this time. I like how Jonas became the receiver and took up all the memories and realized all that is wrong about the community. I dislike that there is no lovingness between the members of the community. They have no pain but the also lack any real passion or love. It made me appreciate that although life can be difficult (there is real good and real bad), these two conflicting emotions are what bring vitality to life."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think that \\"THE GIVER\\" was a sad story, but I also think that this book could be better.

I thought the part about having houses for women to \\"produce\\" babies was interesting. I liked the idea about sharing your feelings of the day and any unorthadox dreams.

It's easy to read and the characters make you want to root for them. It's hard to put down. I have just one complaint.WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. It should be a Kindle single. It only takes 3 hours or so to read in entirety. So then you download the second of the quartet (which is a whole different sort of reality, but characters are just as wonderful and the tale just as compelling) and that's another $7.51 or something. The last of the quartet is almost $10 because it's new. All four of them together can easily be read in a week even for slower readers, and it costs about $35.00.So I'm a little upset because I started 2 days ago with the first book and am 77% through the second already and really shouldn't spend so much money to finish the series, which I will surely do anyway within the next few days.

Loved It!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I got an email that Lois Lowry had written a fourth novel for \\"the Giver\\" series, I decided to re-read from the beginning. I read \\"The Giver\\" first in my early 20s and enjoyed it. This time, I was enthralled and amazed. Lowry draws the reader into the story with characters you like and relate to, and she describes a world that seems comfortable and relaxing and wonderful - enough so that you (like her characters) settle in and accept the oddities of this utopian world.We are drawn right along with the protagonist as he begins to learn about what he has never known - how things used to be, both the good and the bad. Our emotions intensify along with Jonas'. In the end, we are left with questions not just about the story (what happens ultimately is far from clear) but also about what the \\"right\\" thing to do would be. I have been thinking about this book since I finished it a couple of weeks ago, which incidentally had me sitting in Panera litterally crying into my latte.The writing is skillful and beautiful, the themes are big and important, and the whole thing is easy enough to read that I'll hand it to my 9-year-old next. No wonder this got the Newbury medal. One of the \\"best\\" children's books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a fantastic book to read. It had so much meaning and was a very powerful book. I really liked the concept of the book which was a society that was all black and white. In other words you couldn\`t see any color. You couldn\`t even feel a breeze. You were assigned a job by the elders like birth mother, Assistant Director of Recreation, Doctor, Law and Justice. The boy, Jonas was assigned The Giver. An old man came and would give him a sort of dream, an image. Jonas could see color and feel in these images.He later found out things; secrets that many people in the community didn\`t know. When Joans learned these things he was confused with emotions and decided to do something about these things. Another reason I enjoyed this book is because it\`s hard to imagine a world perfect, untouchable, and so protected but dosen\`t know that life as they know it dosen\`t have to be that way. That there is more to life than what they have."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Maybe it's just me. Because some people loved this book. I missed the Christ allegory, apparently, and I guess I was wrong about the point of the story. I wanted to know more about how the communities worked; I was properly spooked by the assignment of jobs to twelve-year-olds with the line, &quot;Thank you for your childhood,&quot; but I wanted to know what happened later on. The story seemed to end without ending, and the big secret revelation was obvious to me from the start. Unpleasant, to be sure, but hardly surprising."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, a story focusing on a controlled world, with young Jonas being the major character, keeps the reader turning the pages. However, I wonder how much more or less eager I would have been to keep those pages turning had I not seen &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot;, or &quot;Pleasantville.&quot; If you are considering reading this book and have seen those three movies, imagine a world that combines all of those movies. A world that to most is seen in black and white(Pleasantville), a world where pills are taken to maintain the present state of awareness(Matrix), and a world where all seem horribly unaware of an entirely different world outside the one in which they live(Truman). Having seen those movies made me aware in advance what otherwise might have been great surprises in the story. From minor hints and foreshadowing, I could pretty much guess what was going to happen next..there were no real surprises. Of course, I am not saying that this book is a rip-off of the big screen, the book predates each of the afore-mentioned shows. The story ended in a manner which begs a sequel, leaving more questions than answers. Some have criticized the book for some vivid descriptions concerning infanticide, but I've read far more gruesome details in my daily newspaper. Overall, my main thought the entire time reading the book was that I've heard this story before..but that is in no way any fault of the author."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a book that makes you think.

It is a suspensful book which you won't want to miss. The main character of the book, Jonas, lives in a community where EVERYTHING is controlled by the government. THere is an endless list of rules which every citizen of the community has to follow every second of the day. There is one rule in which every child that bocomes twelve is given a job for the community. Every adult was assigned one when they were twelve. There were jobs like the Nurturer of Babies, THe speaker, and so on. When Jonas is assigned his job, you will not believe what it is. His job (like all jobs) needs special training. His training is painful at some times, and joyful at others. Then, Jonas accidently gives something that can be harmful to a baby, Gabriel. Then, Jonas, and the person Jonas receives training from for his job, plan an escape that breaks tons of the community rules. What is Jonas's job? What is the plan? Read this wonderful book to find out."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A wonderful story about aspects of life most people take for granted. I can't bear to give away any of the storyline, because you have to read it for yourself, but this book definitely shows a new perspective on life, and appreciating the freedoms we enjoy. The tone is mysterious yet not confusing; a beckoning call to read on and discover more about the strange world in which Jonas, the main character, lives. Lowry brings the message across smoothly and clearly, yet never dangles it in your face. I can only say that you have to read this book for yourself to appreciate it: no review can put across the feeling &quot;The Giver&quot; manifests in its story."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lorry does not give us perfect society. She gives us a society of every day people who are very lazy. I read this book in eight grade and I really didn't understand it, but now that I have read it again I totally understand it. The book is about a perfect world. Everyone is happy. There are no feelings of any kind. No one has a name they have numbers. Lois Lowry has a strange imagination. I know I would have never thought of something of this sort. I think that this book will please a lot of people. I also like how the mood would change from happy, to sad, to exciting. I really liked when Jonas gets his memory about snow, and how he had so much fun. I also liked how he wanted everyone to have those memories that he had received. I thought that it was neat that they didn't have birth mothers. They didn't get their bikes till they were age 8. It was neat in the way that one person had all the memories and no one ever knew what happened in the past. However the end was really different. I never would have thought that The Giver would have ended like it did. I would give this book three stars, because it's good."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read The Giver in 5th grade, and have reread it many times since. The plot line that the back cover gives is nowhere near as complex as the actual book is. There are many questions that arise as the book goes on, questions of morality. You have to totally letyourself into the characters mind. This book intrigued me because you have to really think to comprehend the&quot;big picture&quot; and not just the &quot;scene&quot; that goes on inside it. I strongly recommend this book to children and adults alike. It is a moving novel that will stick with you forever."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"&quot;The Giver&quot; deals with information about the twelve year old boy Jonas who lives in a future society. In my opinion the book wasn't as exciting as other books i read. Although the story was very fascinating and interesting in the second part, the first part of the book is written very boring. Nothing interesting happens there. When the ceremony is over and Jonas starts his training and receives the memories, &quot;The Giver&quot; becomes more and more fascinating. So coming to a conclusion I would say that it's a average written book with a well thought story"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"the giver is a good book because their is no war and everybodygrts treated the same. It is a perfect comunty their is no pain. Youwill find no animals in this perfect comunty. Parents don't have names they just call them mom and dad you have to applie for a marage and you can only have two children one male and one female. At 12 you go to training for your job."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first stated to read this book because my school requierd me to.But once I started I could not put it down.Every chapter has somthing new and suprising in it.It was such a touching book that makes you relize even though are world may be some what of a mess at least we still have freedom and feelings. Imagine if you had no emotions and could not expereance simple joys such as love,snow,sunshine,individuallaty,dreams(goals) pain, fear or lonlieness.A boy Jonas lives in a eutopia where every thing is equal and &quot;perfect&quot;allthough it is relly not.He is sellected to be the reciver of all the memories of the past the good and the bad.All of a sudden the once verry strickt rules of his comuity no longer apply to him and he relizes what he has been missing out on.After a year of training Jonas is filled with almost all of the memories you and me know of and can no longer relate to his family and friends who have no recalection of any memories or almost any emotions.This book is one of my all time favorates and is recemmended to every body."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The whole idea of The Giver is something you would never even consider thinking about in real life. In a world with no emotions, or color, there isn't really much left in the word \\"life\\". A young boy lives with a family that was chosen for him, and for each other. The community he lives in decides who will get married, who will be a doctor, and even what a person will do when they are too old to work. This book makes you realize that life is supposed to be a roller coaster, and if it wasn't, life would be pretty bland. I liked the idea the author had in mind when she wrote the book-life is for love. The young boy gets a taste of what life really is, outside of his community, and sees how much more he is missing. There is love, but there is hate. And sometimes it's hard to deal with it when you're all alone."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great science fiction book for young adults to read because it deals with tales and stories of human society from the past and tries to enlighten them in the present and future. The main characters were Jonas, who was a boy of twelve, has been selected to be the Receiver of Memory and The Giver, who once used to be the receiver and now has to give his power to Jonas. Jonas doesn't think it's fair that he has to suffer the pain of remembering so many secrets of the past while everyone else isn't. In their world, there were no colors, no pain, no love, and there's barely any choice to do what you want. After holding so much power of remembrance Jonas doesn't think that the world he lives in is a perfect world after all. So in the end Jonas and the The Giver makes a plan to escape the utopian world to find freedom and true life."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I truly felt this book is one of the best i have ever read. I am a 15 year old female and have read it three times total. One in 4ht grade for fun, another in 7th for class, and again this year to just sort-of remember what it was all about. It made me think about how lucky we are in life to have our different styles,possesions,and feelings/emotions. - LOVED THE BOOK! ~~~jillian :))))))):):):):P :D :D:D:D:D;p"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was one of the best books I had ever read, until the ending. In fact, if there hadn't been anymore pages left in the book, I wouldn't have know it had ended. I loved it up until that point. The in depth detail and description of the memory transfers made me feel like I was there, receiving them. The whole subplot with Gabe was really fun to. I makes you stop and think about how wonderful it is to be able to make our own choices. All in all, a very good book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonus lives in the perfect society, no war, no sickness, and no color. When Jonus turns twelve, he receives his job assignment: the Receiver. All of the sudden none of the rules apply to Jonus, he can do and say whatever he wants. His training is the most physically and mentally demanding job of the entire town, and is assigned every six to seven decades. He receives memories from the past from the Giver, in order to counsel the Elders. The memories he receives are both pleasant and painful, beautiful and horrific. None of the people in the town have these memories because how would a perfect society react to their not so perfect ancestors. Many have failed at becoming the Giver. Jonus is faced with many tough decisions that will affect the entire community, the future is entirely up to him."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I loved this book! It is about a boy who lives in a &quot;community&quot; where there is no poverty, no pain, no hunger. Every year there is a ceremony for children who turn different ages. This year is the last ceremony for Jonas (the &quot;boy&quot;)and a very important one. It is the year when Jonas gets a job picked for him. He gets picked the reciever of memories. He starts to see colors and learns about hate and war. I'm not going to give out the end so read it for yourself. Note: gifted children handle this book better than others."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Much like the themes of Brave New World and The Handmaiden's Tale, The Giver presents the flaws of a &quot;perfect world&quot; where everything is controlled. And similar to other futuristic tales, this one has its &quot;hero,&quot; but in this story that hero is Jonas, a twelve-year-old boy. Like most children, Jonas is filled with questions. Once he is labeled as a &quot;receiver,&quot; the separation between himself and the well-tuned world he was born into begins. Jonas is forced to feel and see things that his community has worked so hard to deny and make disappear. The main theme that stood out in my mind is: If things have always been done this way, why change? How can we change? This is a riveting read. I could not put this book down until Jonas's journey was finished, at least among my pages. The book leaves the reader with thoughts to ponder, possibilities to imagine, and questions to debate. Read it, pass it on, and make an impact in the world. Change is sometimes needed...but we have to &quot;see&quot; the need first."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an amazing book. Not only is the plot incredibly original, but it almost seems believable. The characters are not the same as the people in real life, but it almost seems that you can relate to them. Lowry does a great job of creating mood and thickening the plot. Jonas still had a lot to learn as the Receiver, and I think that others can relate to that, too, for the fact that learning never stops. Learning continues no matter the age. The ending lacked a few qualties, as in a total solution to the problem. You are kind of left hanging at the end. The concept of the society may be a little harder for younger children to understand, I would recommend this book for children over 12. I thought that this was a great book, and everyone should have the chance to read it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is a realy wonderfull one. Jonas's world is very beliveable and the characters are great. When Jonas's world falls apart, he and his friend the Giver put it back together. I read this book a few months before reading 1984 and it certianly was very similar. I foud that many of my fellow 12 year olds enjoy this book as much as I did, and the end was great. I would sugest this book to anyone who loves a good story and great writing stile. I think this I Lowry's best book yet!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I dident really like it becuse it was really weird. And it was nothing like you think it whould be. And the reson i give it a 2star is becuse i like exsiting books and it isent really exciting. but if you like books that are not what you think this is one for you.

But we do not like the ending because we excepted a different one..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"&quot;The Giver&quot; deals with a very strange world where people have to follow a lot of rules to build a painless society! I can't decide if this novel is mainly written for children or adults. I suppose, it's very interesting to compare our today's world with the Givers's society but the story is a little bit boring. I think, the philosophical aspects (e.g. talking about love) are mainly adults' topics while the story is written in such a simple style that even young children may understand and that doesn't really satisfy me. Coming to conclusion, &quot;The Giver&quot; has a lot of interesting aspects of social and philosophical topics but the story is too simple to be exciting."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver written by Lois Lowry is a very well thought out book.I gave this book five stars because its suspenceful threw the entire book and makes you want to keep reading. I have read this book sevral times and it has never gottin to the point where I was bored with it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book will give you a good look at how a community communicates with one another. Jonas is able to feel the feeling the Giver is telling him."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an excellent book. This book is filled with happiness, sadness, joyful tmes, and hard times. Jona is the main character in the book. He is a young boy turning into a twelve and recieves a special assignment of the Keeper of Memories. He starts his training and soon his teacher dies. Now, he is the official Keeper of the Memories. Jona has his parents, a sister, and a new baby brother. The only thing in the book is his new baby brother isn't developing right. So they have to give him one year to see if he will develop. If not, he will be sent back and they will receive a new baby. This is a sad part of the book. When I read that I thought about how people do that. These people live in a world where there is not any pain, fear, or war. the people work together and never fight. They watch over each other. The book is very interesting. The way the people live is amazing. The kids are called by things likes eight's, or twelve's. This is like there age. They can do certain things once they turn a certain age. Like Jona's sister Lily turned into an eight and you can start to volunteer at places. Lily would like to volunteer at the nursery in the book. Her mom says only volunteer work. You aren't respected as much if that is your assignment once your get older. For Jona since he is turning into a tweleve they receive an assignment to do for the rest of his life. The world the people live in here is different, neat, and also so caring. There world is very different from ours. The world is peaceful. The people work on the assignments they are given; and they also watch and love their families very much. the Giver is an excellent book to read, and it is a good recommendation."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book surpasses words. As a 12 year old from New Jersey, I thought that this book left just enough to the imagination to keep one thinking about it for the next few years. I read this book just months before I read 1984, and the settings matched almost perfeclty. If anyone isn't convinced, it is a great book to introduce before a novel like 1984. It puts the reader in a mind-frame that isn't to harsh and just mature enough."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois really gets you thinking about what life would be like if we were all the same.

I read quite a few of the reviews, and was appaled! To think that someone could say that one should save their money and read a classic is HORRIFIC(how silly are they? ;). This book by some is considered a classic. This book leaves a lasting and godly impression. This book was an insight to another culture, real or not, and that is very very very very valuable. I am in 10th grade and just read &quot;The Giver&quot; for the second time. I could probaly read this book fifty times and still discover new things(which makes it if possible--even better ;), as I probably will."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book left me with complete awe. It pulled me in so deep I might as well have been the main character, Jonas. I have purchased this book 3 times now, because each copy became so worn down from me reading it so much and having all my friends read it. I finally purchased the hardcover edition, and I intend to keep it in good condition so that my kids may enjoy this book someday. I've read this book over 10 times now and I enjoy it every time, if you buy this book, you are sure to love it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In a world of sameness, everything is well-organized and it seems like nothing will go wrong. That's what Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy, thinks so far of his community. When he turns twelve, his life changes and he views the world with different eyes. His role in the community is to become &quot;Receiver of Memory,&quot; a job that involves taking in more than what's seen with the naked eye. Jonas experiences pains and pleasures of all kind, gaining more knowledge from it all. But there is one thing he cannot not stand: to not be able to share the feelings with everyone else. Only he and \\"The Giver\\" can hold the memories and feelings; Jonas wants that to change. He wants the whole Community to be able to feel what he's feeling, what the other Receivers had felt &quot;back and back and back.\\" To make things change, Jonas has to take action...I think this book is very well-written with many thoughts expressed through a boy who has to keep his thoughts and feelings (in this case, when he has them) to himself. This book will make you realize that it is very fortunate in the world for everyone to be &quot;Receivers of Memory.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book as a child and the substance really stuck with me, so much so that for years, though I couldn't remember the name or author, I kept vaguely looking for it because I needed to be able to refer to it with the conscious part of my mind. Reading it again was a joy, and I highly recommend it. It's a book which lays a foundation -- it encourages both child and adult to look at the world they live in with more careful eyes, and question the structures and common practices we all take for granted. While describing a fictional world in child friendly language it grapples with relevant issues; from what it means to take a pill, to the simplicity of choosing comfort and numbness over a more painful awareness and the real cost that choice entails. It amazes me how much the books we read as children shape the way we think and process our experiences. For all those who want a world filled with sensitive, compassionate, and truly aware people, Lowry has given us a great gift to share with our children."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas's community is perfect. Everyone knows what to do and how to help the community. Only one person can suffer from the knowledge of the past. That one and only person is the Giver. He has memories of the past containing true love and all the pleasures of life. But with this responsibility comes memories and of true pain and death. What will happen when Jonas is selected to receive the true knowledge of pleasure and pain? It was a good book, but it was hard to read. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read The Giver by Lois Lowery. It was a good book, but very confusing. It you are a person who likes to read difficult books and like science fiction this is a book for you. The main character is a twelve year old boy named Jonas. He lives in a town that is basically perfect where there is no pain and no color. Jonas gets to become Reciever of Memory where he receives memory of snow, war, the ocean, ect. He is getting memories of the world before it turned perfect. It is a very compelling story. I think it was a very good book. You might need to read it a second time to fully get it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"As a book of fiction The Giver is great. I find that because it shows you to be careful what you wish for. In The Giver the characters can't see any color or are unable to hear music. They have no freedom of choice in their world. All because some one made a wish and it came true. The part that effected me the most is reading about Jonas because he was the receiver of everyone's memories. He ends up receiving all their pain, but at the same time he also receives their beautiful memories at the same time. At the time the character Jonas is twelve years old so he's pretty young. In the end the decision that Jonas makes is important about himself but to find out about that you have to read the book. I think that if it left me feeling what if this really happened in our world, I think that you would wonder to."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Really makes you think. It makes you think about how grateful you should be for what you have and how bad some things really are but because we are used to it we think nothing of it. For example I play this 3rd shooter game, after I read the book, I realized how bad the concept was, just killing someone else, because we are used to it, we just think its nothing, but it really is horrible, especially war in real life. You have to read it to understand."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Solid start and middle, but it gets pretty weak at the end. A very quick read. People looking for a good sci-fi / political commentary should read Starship Troopers by Heinlein (ignore the horrible movie on it -- it really has nothing in common with the book)."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In The Giver twelve year old Jonas has to become the Giver. The Giver alone holds the true memories of the true pain and pleasure of life. The giver was written by Lois Lowry. It also won the Newberry award in 1994. Jonas lives in a community. He has many friends including his best friend Asher. He has two sisters named, Lily and Gaberiele and his two parents. His life is just perfect. Now that he turns twelve he has to become the Giver. In the beginning he dosn't want to be the Giver. Towads he dosn't mind because he enjoys seeing the memories although some are painful. I would give this book three out of five stars because there are hard words and it is hard to understand. I don't reccomend this book to you because it is hard to understand. Some other books by this award winning author are &quot;A Summer to Die and Number the Stars.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book has an amazing storyline. It touches your heart too. This was a wonderful book to read. I can read it over and over. A great book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an amazing story. I would recommend it to all ages, both young and old. I myself have read it twice now, it was read to me when I was in eighth grade and I reread it as a college freshman. Both times that I read The Giver I was intrigued by Lowry's vision of the future. As a reader I could easily visualize Jonas's utopian world, as it was decscribed to me through Lowry's eyes. Lowry deservingly won the Newberry Award for this book. Her creativity and talent astound me!The Giver is an easy reader. Lowry uses text that can be understood by all groups. Although the wording is simple the book still encourages the reader to ponder what the world might be like in the future. For myself it was the question of whether or not equality is truly attainable and if it would be a worthwhile change in society. If equality can only be gained by the loss of emotion, color, animals, sunshine etc., is it really what society should be striving to acheive?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was awsome! I loved the whole thing. It really drew me in and i couldn't put it down! I definetly recomend it to both children and adults. The only thing is that it had a terrible cover that didn't suit the book well. When I saw the cover, I didn't think I'd like it, but i did. Don't judge this great book by it's cover!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"After having read this book 3 times, I get more out of thisbook every time. I have learned a lot of things such as how importantchoice is, how boring life would be with everything the same and how much I enjoy making mistakes. Instead of reading this book for plesure I read it to learn about life and to study a life where chocies are made for you and nothing bad ever happens. I liked this book a lot!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think that The Giver, by Lois Lowry, is a fantastic book about a supposedly &quot;Perfect&quot; world which in most cases isn't always so Perfect. Some people think that with ignorance comes no pain, but the author proves how this is completely untrue.The author shows the life of an eleven year old boy--properly called an 'Eleven' who is soon to become a 'Twelve' and find out what he is to become or&quot;What is to become of him&quot; He is chosen to become the Receiver of Memory, the most important and honorable role in the Community. He is to learn all secrets and memories of life including ones that are most enjoyable, and some that give the most excruciating pain.The author describes the upside and downside of this world. The upside is that no one can make a mistake,for example; someone may choose a job they don't like,or the wrong spouse, and people may have alot of children then there would not be enough food. But you see,that doesn't happen in this world, in this world everything is chosen, or set out for you and you can't make a simple decision like: What color shirt should I wear today? Namely: the Downside.This book is great because it made me feel the pain of ignorance, the joy of learning, and the love between a teacher and a student. This is a WONDERFUL book and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys wonderfully written books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I just finished reading the best book that I have read in the6th grade. It is entitled &quot;The Giver&quot; and was wonderfullywritten by Lois lowery. This amazing book was about a boy named Jonas and the difficulties that he faces while in training to become the Receiver of Memory. I am going to inform you about the great and horrible obstacles that happen in this book. I think that it was a wonderful sensation when The Giver gave Jonas the good memories because now Jonas knows what love and hapiness are. I also thought that the author did a wonderful job making it heart-warming when The Giver talked about Rose-Mary because that is when he (The Giver) felt love. He talked about that because Jonas asked many questions about her. It was aslo wonderful that Jonas could feel and understand the Giver because no one else could. My eyes were glued to the book ... To find out what happens with Jonas, The Giver and Gabe read The Giver and maybe you will agree with me that a sequel is needed or maybe just a little more information at the end of the book because the author is not very specific."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was a wonderful story of the future when we have tchnologie to control everything and is one of the best plot that i have read this year. The giver is the perfect book for mid age teens. Louis Lowry does agreat and good job of writing this plot and the setting is so awesome i think that is a cool setting. The future in the story is very sellf explanitory and same with the plot. I Wwould just like to say this is a great book that my middle school class has read this year."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book gave me a lot of feeling, and understandment.

This book has such a great plot for midage children. The plot and setting and whole book is so wonderful for mid age children. The giver is really so wonderful the plot is so awesome and the setting is so far into the future it is awesome too!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In The Giver, Jonas, a twelve-year-old boy, discovers the real truth about his utopian-like community. We don't exactly know where this community's setting is, but we do know it has a different environment than ours. It is not like an ordinary living environment like yours and mine. Why? Because Jonas' community has no color, feelings, music, love, or even changes in the weather. In this isolated town, the citizens also do something that is called release, which is when the community kills a person. All is not negative though. For example, one thing the characters get from being a part of this society is not ever having to starve because their food is delivered to the people's homes everyday. This book is about Jonas who learns the truth about his community and wants to break free from it when he sees his father doing something that is not the right thing to do. Then, Jonas realizes that his life is not what he really wants, so he makes a decision that will affect him and the community. One thing you have to think about when you are one of the citizens in this society is. . . Is it worth it to give up things that you might want in your life for things that you need? I, for one, don't think it is worth it to be in this community because there are too many things I would have to give up, and I couldn't handle that. The problem with leaving the community is to separate yourself from this society which is a hard thing to do. Jonas leaves behind friends, and most importantly, the Giver. The Giver is the most important citizen because he is the one who takes away all the memories of the society to make the community perfect. In the end, Jonas gets what he has been waiting for all his life: a life with choices and love, an imperfect society, but basically, a better life. After reading this book, I feel the message is to live the life of your choice as much as you can. This book isn't my favorite kind of book because I like more actions and mystery, but it is well thought out and written, so I give it four stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought it was the worst book in the whole wide world, but after I caught on I started to like it. After my teacher finished reading it he said to give it a grade 1-6 (1 being the worst) I gave it a six!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I loved this book! It kept me hooked for hours! Once I picked this book up I could not put it down. This book is fascinating with its different point of view and completely surreal content with its mixture of light and darkness with color. This story is in a black and white setting with one boy that is given images of color and memories. There are different twists and turns that surprised me and some parts made me upset, but I could not put this book down! I had to see how the book ended and how it all worked out. I highly recommend this book to people who want to read a strange but great book. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book &quot;The Giver&quot; takes place in a futuristic and perfect world. The author, Lois Lowry gets an award, the Newbery Medal for the most distinguished contibution to American literature for children, but it might be interesting for adults too. Jonas, the main character, lives in a far future. In this future, the people do not live in cities, no, they live in communities. Jonas goes to school and does his volunteer hours, the rules say it so. These rules can be compared with our law. If you break one of the rules for the third time, you will be released, which means you have to leave the community. One day, at the &quot;Ceremony of Twelve&quot; (a kind of birthday celebrity), Jonas is chosen to be the new &quot;Receiver of the Memory&quot;. This means hard training for him and one day, during the training, Jonas finds out about the dark side of this, his &quot;perfect world&quot;. First he has to accept these things, but finnaly, Jonas decides something, that will change his life forever. When you read the book, you will notice that Lois Lowry uses words you have never heard before or have a new meaning. This makes it very interesting to read the book, you must first understand the system and then you can understand this mysteries world. First the book contains an introduction, which is (imho) not so interesting, but then it builds up an undescribable thrill, which forces you to read on and on. Except of the introducing part, the book has no weaknesses. One of the positive aspects is, that this book was written for children, but it can also be read by adults who feel young inside or occasional readers. I can only advise you to read it.

It left out too many details (didn't explain how it all came to be, for example). I'm finding that just because books make the best seller list, doesn't mean they're very good."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"How did I not read this book years ago? I only just recently discovered 'The Giver' and the biggest surprise for me was that it was written so long ago (1993). After reading a synopsis and a few reviews I figured it was a much more recent book.The political theme these days seems to me to be one of making sure everyone gets their 'fair share', of redistributing the wealth, of making sure that life treats everyone equally. This is pure hogwash. Life isn't fair. Crap happens. And no amount of federal money or social engineering will accomplish what our government seems hell-bent on trying to buy for the population.That's why I was so surprised to find this book written in the 90s. It's amazing to me Lois Lowry wrote about a utopian society so many years ago that certain members of our government now would be thrilled to make a reality - the non-scifi aspects at least.In 'The Giver' everyone's choices are made for them so that no one makes a wrong choice. There's no chance for the members of the community to choose the wrong vocation or spouse (they are assigned jobs and spouses). No one has more or less than another. No one goes hungry. No one feels pain. All the discomforts of normal life are regulated away. And should someone choose to disobey the rules they are severely punished until they fall into line or they are 'released' (a euphemism for the death penalty). Memories of the collective past are held by a single individual so that no one is burdened by the unpleasantness of past horrors or mistakes.It all sounds lovely on the surface, but the reality is much different. Without the ability to make choices, learn from mistakes, and grow in understanding these people become automatons who commit atrocities without knowing what they are truly doing.Not sure I would say I enjoyed this book, since the subject matter is so heavy, but it did give me pause for thought and cement some feelings I've had about the way I see our country heading. The more effort we make in trying to protect others from poor choices (or simple bad luck) the closer we get to the society portrayed where we will no longer have choice.And we will have done it to ourselves. We will have given up our ability to choose for the comfort of safety and equality."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"i cant afford to get the book i got the sample its pretty good guess ok bye people it had agood setting and theme"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A watered down version of Huxley's Brave New World about a dystopian society.

Imagine what it would feel like to have no control over decisions that are made in your life; you can choose your spouse,occupation, or a specific religion to follow. Life as far as you know it is a puppet that is pulled by the strings of a higher authority. This is what life seems to be for an adolescent named Jona,his family, and other members of the society that they live in. Jona and others have been given a false perception that the life chosen for them is the perfect life, simply because every decision has been made for them effectively by a group of elders so that they will make no mistakes. Children ranging from the ages of 4-12 have been given a premature rights of passage, meaning that they are assuming the roles of adults before they can fully understand them. Jona, due to his intellectual ability and strong personal characteristics assumes a role given by the elders as a receiver. Jona is responsible for disregarding all of the negative memories consumed by the people in his society in order to keep their world in perfect operating condition. In meeting the demands of this position, Jona is left to wonder about his own personal sanity and the people who are colse to him. The Giver is an unique tale of a struggle between individuality and direct supremacy. It gives the reader a precise look at the effects of a society that strives to mainstream life experiences into one category. Lowry provides in-depth look at an alternative lifestyle that many people in America and some other countries across the world are accustom to living."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is a great read for my 9 year old boys, my 11 year old daughter, and me!

People feel no pain, everyone gets along, uniformity is celebrated, and everyone is happy to follow the society's norms. However, Jonas is nearing a huge milestone in his life, which will shake his view of the world around him.As children in the society reach the age of twelve, they are assigned to the careers they will work in until they grow old. Jonas's task, which is chosen by the community's Elders, is a very important and honorable position. This task will send Jonas on a path that leads to self-discovery, self-awareness, and forces him challenge everything he has ever known. Jonas sees his family, his friends, and his whole community differently. He begins to question the Elders, the ways of the society, and what is right and wrong. Events in the society leave Jonas with the biggest decision of his life, and he must choose to do what he believes is best for himself and the society.Lois Lowry depicts the dystopian society in great detail. The work is written for teens, and Lowry definitely plays to that audience. As a high school social studies teacher I think The Giver would be a great book to use in a sociology class. It could be part of a more broad culture unit, and used to discuss social norms, variations from one culture to the next, and could also spark discussions about some controversial topics written in the book. Lois Lowry's The Giver is an extremely well written and thought provoking work. I would highly recommend this book to any teen or adult. I cannot wait to read the rest of The Giver series."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Strong beginning. A lot of thought went into the world creation.

Don't listen to it; read it instead. First off, they used cheesy music on and off throughout the book, probably to make it dramatic or suspenseful but all it did was detract from the seriousness of the book. Also, the reader did not say the chapter numbers so moving back and forth between the audio and print book was very difficult. I think the chapter breaks were identified by the cheesy music. The reader was OK but not great. All this put together did not make for an enjoyable listening experience. The book is easy to read and rather predictable for a well-read adult, but this did not detract from the story and my ability to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Assassin","review":"As usual Shuan depicts his masterpieces with such skill, excitement, imagery in words that transcends other authors.

Over the past 6 months, I have read 10 books on programming with Visual C++ (including MFC, ATL, COM, database). This book would have been more useful if the author had concentrated simply on OLEDB programming for Visual C++. The intro material on database basics is insufficient to help the absolute beginner, but is too elementary for the majority of people who have an interest in database development. The same statement can be made about the author's discussion of COM. However, the most disconcerting fact is that the cornerstone chapter (Chap. 6, &quot;An OLE DB Consumer Example&quot;) is based on a SQL Server database. If this book is geared towards the mass market of beginning database programmers, why wouldn't the author use a mass market database as was used in the other chapters(Microsoft Access)? What novice database programmer is going to have free access to SQL Server? Wrox Press editors should have realized this and at least provided the sample database in this chapter in both SQL Server format and Access format. Other than these comments, it is a useful book for the absolute beginner if you are willing to transpose SQL Server data into Access."},{"Title":"Visual C++ 6 Database Programming Tutorial","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that it is just a basic overview of the subject and if the wanted to cover SQL Server there should have also been a version for Access. In fact I think Wrox should provide an Access version on their web site.Also, who ever edited the book needs to go back to English 101. It has way too many grammatical errors making me believe no one read the book before it was published.As with all books I did however get bits and pieces of useful information on OLE DB consumer templates but since I am writing this review I have to comment on how many books are published that contain the same basic information. Why don't publishers get authors that write books with real world example. I am tried of looking at book after book that shows you how to draw a line. In terms of this book, if the author could have talked about and showed how to use the various data bound controls that come with VC 6, that would have been useful. Basically you have to get VB books if you want information on that topic."},{"Title":"Visual C++ 6 Database Programming Tutorial","review":"This book does not help beginners.

The books loses focus and forgets who its audience is over and over. There are discussions about the mandatory features that need to be implemented when writing a database driver, Visual Source Safe, and many other topics that don't have any thing to with writing a C++ database application.To make matter worse the book is also riddled with typos - both grammar and code. The book spends more time discussing MFC than it does implementing the database code. The coding style displayed in this book is that of a beginner. If you are an beginner programmer this is an example of how NOT to program. The code is very inconsistent and poorly laid out. Functions for common pieces of code are never created and instead copied each time that it is needed - sometimes 3 or 4 times in one tiny example application).This isn't the typical book that you would expect from Wrox.

In actuality, it is a lightly re-worded collection of information readily available for free in Microsoft white papers and doco included with the Visual C++ CD set.This book would be more aptly titled &quot;Visual C++ Database Programming for Morons&quot;, and more aptly priced at $20. Even in the inflated world of programming books, $50is WAY too much money for such fluff. For that kind of money, I expect a book written by an experienced programmer who has done real homework and has something of value to relate. Not regurgitation of Microsoft documentation and code samples generated by the Visual C++ AppWizard.I can't believe the author actually put in code samples which were copied directly from running the database AppWizards! The code is trivial, and adds nothing to what is already available.

Security is a difficult subject, but this book makes it easy. I learned something on every page."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"\\"Beyond Fear\\" contains the five-step analysis you see in many of the reviews. This framework is valuable, but Schneier adds little wisdom beyond it. When Schneier applies the five steps to actual security decisions, the results do not inspire confidence. Granted, security is often complicated, and no protection is fail-proof. But these observations alone do nothing to take us \\"Beyond Fear,\\" in fact they increase fear and paralysis. Overcoming this muddle is the evident challenge in writing about security, a challenge the author runs away from, on every page. Instead, he talks about biology, warfare and dozens of other subjects. These fun facts do nothing to clarify security decisions.Schneier's rather self-important tone amplifies my disappointment. Example: the book jacket draws us in by asking, \\"Will arming pilots make flying safer?\\" and hinting that Schneier proves the negative. He doesn't even answer the question! He runs past it about three times in the text, and the closest thing to an answer is roughly, \\"maybe, but we ought to think about it first.\\" Well Duh!Altogether, this book reminds me of William Gibbs Macadoo's description of the speeches of President Warren Harding: \\"An army of pompous phrases marching over the landscape in search of an idea.\\"I have worked in the information security field for eleven years. I don't claim authority, just familiarity with the concepts and success in communicating them."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"I never thought I'd find a security book that made me laugh.

Steer clear of this book's misuse of the words \\"threat\\" and \\"risk.\\" While I appreciate Schneier's overall discussion of security issues, I expect a book aimed at the layman to be more accurate.Schneier introduces the term \\"threat\\" on p. 20 with this example: \\"Most people don't give any thought to securing their lunch in the company refrigerator. Even though there's a threat of theft, its not a significant risk because attacks are rare and the potential loss just isn't a big deal. A rampant lunch thief in the company changes the equation; the threat remains the same, but the risk of theft increases.\\" That's wrong; let's start with definitions (mine, based on intel experience -- not the author's).A threat is a party with the capabilities and intentions to exploit a vulnerability in an asset. A vulnerability is a weakness in an asset which could lead to exploitation. Risk is the possibility of suffering harm or loss. It's a measure of danger. All of these terms were defined years ago by military intel and law enforcement types, especially those doing counter-terrorism.In the lunchroom example, nobody initially \\"secures\\" their lunch, even though their \\"assets\\" are held in a \\"vulnerable\\" (unlocked, unguarded) refrigerator. Why? There's no \\"threat\\" -- people have the capability to steal lunches but nobody has evil intentions. \\"Risk\\" of losing one's lunch is close to zero. Now, add the \\"rampant lunch thief.\\" The threat is NOT \\"the same\\"; a threat now exists for the first time. The risk equation changes -- risk of loss is much higher. (Countermeasures like a guard can reduce the vulnerability and bring risk of loss closer to the original low level.)Another example of fuzzy thinking appears on p. 50. \\"Just because your home hasn't been broken into in decades doesn't mean that it's secure.\\" Says who? If the threat the entire time was zero, the house was always perfectly secure. Vulnerabilities are but one part of the risk equation, which is Risk = Threat X Vulnerability X Cost of Asset. If any factor is zero, risk is zero.One quick final example appears on p. 238: \\"The problem lies in the fact that the threat -- the potential damage -- is enormous.\\" Wrong! A threat is an agent, or party, who wants to and can inflict damage. \\"Threat\\" in this sentence should be \\"cost,\\" meaning the replacement value of the assets at risk.A hint to the source of these errors appears on p. 82: \\"examining an asset and trying to imagine all the possible threats against that asset is sometimes called 'threat analysis' or 'risk analysis.' (The terms are not well defined in the security business, and they tend to be used interchangeably.)\\" Which security business? Counter-terrorism and intel folks know threat analysis is performed against groups with capabilities and intentions to harm American assets. Risk analysis calculates the potential for loss given a certain threat, an asset's vulnerabilities, and the value of that asset. It's the digital security community that's obscuring the definitions.I loved \\"Secrets and Lies,\\" and every time I see the author speak I learn something new. Am I off base with this review? You be the judge. I still gave it 4 stars, since the book's vignettes are informative and its scope impressive. Given the large number of reviewers I expected someone to challenge the author's terminology. Yes, this is semantics, but shouldn't a book by an expert set the record straight? I don't think my expectations are unrealistic, either; Schneier is a previously published \\"thought leader,\\" and he deserves to be held to the highest possible standards."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"The author comes across as very knowledgeable and does a good job of discussing security in a non-technical manner.

My guess is that, next year, he'll use another slightly different angle and try to sell you the same basic information.What I find truly onerous about his books is the condescending tone that Schneier adopts when addressing the reader.Recently I spoke with a PhD, from Brown, who performed decades of research in number theory. He recommended \\"Cryptography in C and C++,\\" by Michael Welschenbach. He also said \\"I don't know why people think Applied Cryptography is such a good book. He [Schneier] doesn't seem to understand the mathematics very well.\\" Pick up Applied Cryptography sometime and compare it side-by-side with Welschenbach's book. You'll see what that PhD was talking about."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"I thought this book would tell me something I didn't know. It didn't. I thought it would be interesting enough to keep me awake and wanting to read it. It wasn't. I thought Bruce Schnier was a big thinker and agressive. He isn't; he's overly cautious and careful with his words out of his own &quot;fear&quot; of insulting somebody. I thought he would take a stand on the issues. He didn't. I thought he understood security in the post-9/11 world. He doesn't. In fact, this book was written like 9/11 never happened and as if our terrorist enemies are mindless idiots.If you want a good overview of the strategic issues facing cyber security and homeland security, read Dan Verton's Black Ice. That offers a far better understanding and overview of what's going right and what's going wrong in homeland security and cyber security, because Verton isn't afraid. Scnhier hasn't found a way to go beyond his own fear."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"I first read about Bruce Schneier in an eye-opening article by Charles Mann in the September, 2002 issue of The Atlantic Monthly. It seems that you don't have to make the false choice everyone is agonizing over between security and liberty. You can have both.Schneier's book expands on the ideas in the article. Although Schneier is a technology fan and it is his livelihood, he realizes that sometimes a live security guard can provide better security than cutting-edge (but still fallible) face-recognition scanners, for instance. He explains why national ID cards are not a good idea, and how iris-scanners can be fooled.These are ideas for security on a large scale, for airports, nuclear and other power plants, and government websites. For security on an individual or small business scale, try Art of the Steal by Frank Abagnale. But even if you don't run a government, Beyond Fear is a fascinating read about how your government is making choices (and how they SHOULD be making choices about your security and about your rights."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"Bruce's greatest strength is in the role of Evangelist -- he translates the complex aspects of security into a vocabulary suitable for common consumption. If you're a sociologist, a risk management officer, or a cultural psychologist, you'll be familiar with a lot of the upstream references from which Bruce draws his examples. Conversely, if you're working in an office where \\"solving that security problem\\" is one of your many tasks, you won't have the time or inclination to dig out the esoteric sources. Consider this book as an alternative, far less onerous choice.The book is easy reading -- it flows quickly and keeps returning to a common set of themes. These are set against many contexts so you're sure to find something familiar. You won't find any math or greek notation in here, to the disappointment of \\"Applied Cryptography\\" die-hards but the relief of everyone else.The underlying message, seeing beyond the Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) propagated by mass media and the government, is a key one to understanding why it's OK to question this hyper-security-conscious world we find ourselves in. Airline security is an arena familiar to most business travelers, and we as passengers are expected not only to accept increasingly invasive measures, but welcome them without hesitation. Bruce teaches us how to evaluate the efficacy of these schemes both individually and in the aggregate. The results will surprise all but the most cynical among you.That said, this is not the textbook of a conspiracy theorist. Bruce willingly admits that improving security correctly is a worthwhile pursuit, and even teaches us how to do it. You won't find the rantings of an ill-informed libertarian crackpot.If your interests lead you to ask questions and be curious about the changes to your world in recent years, you will find this an entertaining and informative volume.

This book is really a discussion about what actions have been taken post 9/11, and in parts it's a criticism of the overreaction that there has been.However, its not overtly political, and gives dozens (perhaps a 100) practical worked examples of good &amp; bad, effective &amp; ineffective, responses to security issues, whether it be physical, electronic etc.There is a 5-step process which I found useful to apply to everyday situations; and (in highly abbreviated form) these are : what are you trying to protect; what are the risks; risk mitigation; risks caused by the solution; trade-offsThe core message is : &quot;as both individuals and a society, we can make choices about our security&quot;, and this book helps you understand how to make those informed decisions."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"This book is very informative, interesting, and entertaining. I've recommended it to people both within and outside the CS and IT communities w/o reservation.Rather than reiterating things said in the many positive reviews, I'd like to take issue with one reviewer who says Schneier misuses the term \\"threat.\\" In particular, this reviewer says \\"A threat is a party with the capabilities and intentions to exploit a vulnerability in an asset.\\" This definition is both counter to standard English usage and counter to standard usage within the computer security field. Every book on my shelf has roughly the same definition of threat: \\"Threat: a potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability\\" -- Stallings, Network Security Essentials, p. 5. So a threat is condition or event, not a party. The reviewer seems to confuse threat with potential adversary.Schneier's terminology is the standard terminology, and he uses it correctly."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"The title of the book refers to the steps to take after fear is sensed. To move beyond fear is to understand it, how it affects you and why, and what you can do about it. And that is what the book addresses - what things do we need to secure, from our personal interests, to national interests.Schneier addresses this in the framework of a five questions to ask about security. Although the process seems crude, it does touch the heart of security issue - what are we trying to protect, why, and what happens if we don't protect it?I particularly like his idea of brittle versus flexible security. When a brittle security system fails, you asset is screwed. A (poor) example would be burying your money in your back yard. If this is compromised (someone finds it), then you loose all your money, and that's the end of it. Compare this to a baking account. If someone robs the bank, or fraudulently takes your money, the bank is obliged to get you your money back. (So maybe you should bury your bank account number and password in yuor back yard!)Although much of the discussion is on the level of national security, he also has gems of wisdom like suggesting that you leave the bathroom light on while you're away to deter burglars. And he points out yuor identity is more likely to be stolen from your discarded papers than from someone stealing your info on the internet.I really appreciate the last part of the book where he lists the most-likely causes of death among Americans. What I got from that was not that I should avoid international airports, or dig a fallout shelter, but simply that I should make sure that I and my family are securely buckled up when we drive. Now that's putting 9/11 into perspective."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"Executive summary: Timely and well written. Buy it.Bruce has a great ability to &quot;keep it real&quot; - which is why his books are so readable and down to earth. With a background in cryptography, Bruce has broadened his scope to become one of the broadest-thinkers in security today - no mean feat by any measure.One of the reasons I tell my corporate consulting clients to &quot;Read Bruce's books&quot; is because he's able to put things into the overall context in a way that is uplifting rather than depressing or overwhelming. For example, I consider &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot; (and now &quot;Beyond Fear&quot;) to be essential bookshelf material for anyone who has to deal with security. When people are starting in security and ask me where to begin, it's with these books. Absorbing them, and the concepts behind them, is a good way of avoiding the pitfalls in this complex field.For the non-security-professional, this book is also a terrific read. Read it more like it's a spy novel, sit back, and enjoy it. Movie script-writers? If you're going to write a script that touches on computer security: read this book.mjr."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"I have read a number of the Pro and Con reviews. I think it is important to take a good look at the title of the book, and use that as a guide to a buying decision. This book is not an in-depth cookbook of technical approaches to combat hackers, but rather a sensible way of looking at the issues that contribute to an aura of security, the appearance of security, and actually being secure. I really liked the whole premise, because we are such an image conscience, and sound-bite oriented society that it can become quite difficult to deliver a thought-provoking treatise on a topic that many think they know so much about.My only negative comment would be that it got a little slow at the end, for me. Maybe I was just tired that night or something.He cites a few excellent examples of places or instances where someone did something that they honestly felt would contribute to increased security, when the actual effect turned out to be the opposite. If I may draw a crude comparison: if you appreciated some of the observations, and perhaps even the writing style and presentation in Hammer and Champy's &quot;Reengineering the Corporation&quot;, then you will like and appreciate this volume. The way Mr. Schneier presents information, and the way he introduces you to perceived vs. actual may strike you as being similar. (No offense meant to either author - I enjoyed both)Happy trails."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"Bruce Schneier's latest book is a departure from his previous work, leaving the technical realm largely behind as it looks at the concept of security in the whole. He brings a clear and witty expertise to the subject, balancing the real concerns with concepts that enable us to evaluate and act on our individual security situation.Security is a timely but complex issue, and Bruce has always been great at taking complex issues and breaking them down for the reader so that all the concepts seem clear and understandable, while at the same time building concept on concept until you have a clear and deep understanding of a various difficult situation. He provides a five step process that allows you to evaluate your risk and security solutions, identifying those which are ineffective and increasing security in each individual's life.Bruce uses a variety of interesting examples, which all by themselves are worth the read. He writes witty, engaging prose throughout. The book is, simply, a great read.This is an important book. It covers one of the most critical concerns of our time in a clear and accessible way, while at the same time discussing and clarifying the complexity and nuances of the subject. It provides the reader with a really good read, and with tools to use to make them truly more secure and to understand and evaluate what our governments are doing on our behalf in the security arena."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"&quot;Anyone who tries to entice you with promises of absolute security or safety is pandering to your fears&quot; (pg 277).This whole book is filled with common-sense and not-so-common-sense thinking. I had the opportunity to see Schneier speak at Toorcon 2003 in San Diego and I can tell you this guy not only knows as much as anyone about security, he also talks *like a normal person*. He's not arrogant, he doesn't throw in gratuitous latin terms, he just makes a very clear point with extremely strong logic to back it up.That's what this book is: a handbook on how to logically sift through all the garbage that's trickling down to us via the US media and our govt. Does the FBI need expanded snooping powers? Not according to Schneier, who backs that up with facts regarding 9-11 that tell us the right govt agencies *had* the info, they just couldn't analyze it all. So giving up a bunch of our privacy for the FBI to get more info doesn't make much sense in combating terrorism.This is just one example in dozens. You may not even agree (I've met a few FBI people and they ALWAYS say they need more power/info), but reading this book allows you to pull the emotion out of security-based decisions, whether they are about home alarm systems or airport security lines.For people who aren't familiar with Schneier, he is basically a semi-legend in the information security field for his cryptography, writing and speaking. His last book, &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot;, broadened the scope of his writing from crypto to general infosec. Now he has broadened his focus even further to include the physical world (beyond the server room). To be honest he doesn't really even bring up computers directly that often, and when he does he usually tells us that they aren't nearly as good at making security decisions as people. Seasoned infosec people won't be surprised by any of the logic or conclusions in this book, but it's still worth a read because Schneier has obviously spent a lot of his brain's cycles thinking about security in general and we can all benefit from his conclusions.Schneier has won my respect with this book. It proves that not only does he get the security details (the crypto), he gets the &quot;big picture&quot;, even when the big picture has nothing to do with computing (eg muggings). It is rare to find this in one company, let alone one person."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"Beyond Fear is a must read for anyone who wants to figure out what's really going on when security issues hit the news. Reading Schneier's clear explanation about how security decisions usually get made helped me understand why so few of the ones we hear about seem to make any sense! In addition to his insightful analysis and handy five-step rule for making security decisions, the book is filled with fascinating anecdotes and stories that make for an entertaining and interesting read. Every member of our government needs to read this book - and you should too."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"\\"Beyond Fear\\" should be required reading for EVERY SINGLE ONE of our legislators. Well... this book and the constitution. Knowledge of both of these tomes would go a long way towards stemming the tide of ridiculous, pandering, appear-to-be-doing-something-ANYTHING laws that seem to flood out of State and Federal government houses each month.Combining relevant examples with 5 comprehensive steps that should be evaluated as part of any important security assessment, Bruce pragmatically walks the line between impractically crippling defensive measures and vulnerably insecure systems that must be used by myriad folks on a daily basis. He emphasizes our natural tendency to overestimate certain kinds of (ultimately irrelevant) risks while we casually accept on a daily basis risks that are of far greater likelihood and, ultimately, consequence than those we emotionally invest ourselves in.While Bruce does not say this explicitly, the examples and figures in his book support the statement that I have heard made that \\"If you read about it in the newspaper, it's not something you need to worry about.\\" (BTW, this can apply to positive things too, like reading about someone winning the lottery). The only reason it's being reported is because it's unusual or spectacular. That's why the handful of deaths airplane crashes (631 in the U.S.A each year) receive so much publicity but the thousands of people dying in car accidents (41,700 in the U.S.A. each year) receive only the vaguest of coverage.Perhaps my favorite quote in the book on this topic is that \\"More people are killed every year by pigs than by sharks.\\". To contrast with the numbers above, about 0.6 people are killed in the U.S.A. each year by sharks. That's five orders of magnitude less than the automobile figure. Yet how many people do you know are fearful of going swimming, yet have no problem driving to the corner store for some milk?Anyway, there are great examples given of computer issues, financial issues, terrorist issues and even beekeeper issues. You will not want for examples that you can relate to.Definitely a starting point for a reasoned, rational discussion on how to make the best possible trade-offs for the most useful and unencumbering risk reduction in a world of finite resources."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"The content of this book slightly overlap the content of the author previous bookSecrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked Worldbut presents the material with a different angle. An angle with the perspective of a security expert that witness security measures taken by governments in reaction of the 9/11 terrorism attack and wants people to understand the absurdity of some of these measures.It is not technical at all and does not necessitate any particular background to understand and enjoy. The author explains clearly how to make a risk assessment of something that you want to make more secure and then evaluate the cost of the security measures. Only when you have that data, you can evaluate if the added security is worth it.These explanations are backed up with concrete examples such as evaluating the risk to make purchase with a credit card over the internet. Other examples include the absurdity of securing a lunch in a company refrigerator because the potential loss if having a lunch stolen does not justify securing it. The author also explains that even with technologies that looks very accurate such as facial recognition with an error rate of, let's say, 0.0001 % are totally ineffective when they have to control a huge number of persons like a stadium crowd because even with this accuracy, they would create an unmanageable amount of false positive alerts.The author also elaborate about why you should question the motivation of a security provider when it is a third party and link this with how people fears can be exploited to introduce invasive, excessively expensive and inefficient security measures. I think that the goal of the author was to make people more critics about security questions and my opinion is that his goal has been successfully achieved."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"An eye-opening and thought-provoking read.

To me, it feels like a three chapters were spun out into an entire book by repeating the same points and same examples over and over again.I still think this book is worth buying. The first 3-4 chapters alone are worthwhile. Spending some time thinking about the security the way Bruce thinks about it -- always from a cost/benefit standpoint -- is worthwhile.

A cryptographer by trade, in the last decade, he has focused on more practical impediments to security. In Beyond Fear, he focuses on practical security measures, largely in the context of air travel in a post-9/11 world. With simple, concrete, and logical examples (and indeed an complete security process), he explains how security tradeoffs are driven by specific agendas, and that increased security in one area usually leads to overlooked or weakened security in another area. He lays out well-considered arguments for the need for what he calls \\"security theatre\\" (the APPEARANCE of good security vs. ACTUAL good security), and how we make our own security tradeoffs every day, based on our understanding of risks - which may be completely flawed based on statistics.At its core, though, Beyond Fear explains how a system can never be 100% safe, and our desire to have a system that is impervious to attack is often driven by an emotional need, and not based on logic, fact, and rational analysis - and is often at odds with our desire for personal freedoms, which is often what we're seeking to secure. It offers hope, however, that by understanding the real risks we face, we're able to make smart, individual tradeoffs about our personal safety and security - preserving both our liberty and personal safety.It's a fantastic book, if you have any interest in security or the security-freedom tradeoff. It's well-written, simple to understand, engaging, and direct. At points, Schneier gets a little preachy about personal freedom, but his agenda will likely resound with most readers. His personal commentary is short-lived, however, and for the vast majority of the book, it's a well-balanced, rational analysis of our system's strengths and weaknesses, and our individual roles in it."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"Beyond Fear is a well-written book on the fundamental concepts and applications of security theory.

What are the risks to those assets?3. How well does the security solution mitigate the risks?4. What other risks does the security solution cause?5. What costs and trade-offs does the security solution impose?He spends the rest of the book discussing various aspects of security, and talking about various implementations of security both historical and modern. He finished writing this book in 2003, so there are many references to the 9-11 incidents and the security activities implemented because of them."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"Bruce Schneier is a genius at making complex ideas sound sane and simple.There is no melodrama in this book, just good old fashion wisdom.Bruce is a much welcome voice in a crazy world."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"Some pedants may decry Bruce's many semantic flaws, but these same people have neglected to realize that their biggest mistake was to buy the book to begin with.BZZZT.

I kid you not, I literally stood in an airport gift shop, in my civies, and read this book while waiting for a flight back to base. The book is riddled with filler material, which was probably necessary to pad the book to 250+ pages.

Many of these changes have directly impacted our civil liberties or freedoms as United States citizens. Our elected officials and government organizations push these sweeping changes with a \\"sky is falling\\" mantra and claims that only by limiting freedoms and expanding the authority of law enforcement and government agencies can security be assured.Bruce Schneier's book- Beyond Fear- helps those citizens understand how these trade-offs really work and to see that freedom and security are not necessarily opposite sides of the coin. Schneier uses language that anyone can understand and excellent examples to illustrate how to assess the risks and determine whether a given security measure will help- or possibly even do more harm than good.One of my favorite chapters is Chapter 2- Security Trade-Offs Are Subjective. He gives example after example of how what seems like a risk to one person is no risk at all to another person and how, often, one's fear of that risk is not supported by logic. For example, he states \\"commercial airplanes are perceived as riskier than automobiles, because the controls are in someone else's hands- even though they're much safer per passenger mile.\\"In this post 9/11 era there have been many changes in the name of security. People need to read this book to understand just what sort of security they are trading their freedom for.(...)"},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"In a world where we are constantly bombarded with information about how to be safer, what things are dangerous, what to do in case of X, it is pleasant and surprising to see a book that tells you how to make decisions like these yourself.Pleasantly apolitical, Schneier presents a concrete way to evaluate various decisions about security. Should you install an alarm system in your home? Should airline pilots be armed? While different in scope, the process of answering these questions is the same and presented in easy-to-understand language. This is not a book for \\"security experts\\" it is a book for all of us.When you are finished reading the book, you are armed with the tools to make decisions about your own security and to evaluate the ideas presented by policy-makers. More importantly, you have the tools to rationally describe why potential policies would make things less secure rather than more secure.This book is a valuable, perhaps necessary, resource for everyone. If you've ever worried about a particular threat and wondered what you could do, read this book."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"Hello Richard,in your review you wrote:&quot;A threat is a party with the capabilities and intentions to exploit a vulnerability in an asset&quot;&quot;All of these terms were defined years ago by military intel and law enforcement types&quot; and&quot; It's the digital security community that's obscuring the definitions&quot;I disagree. Information security just has slightly different jargon. That's not an uncommon source of confusion in different, but related, professional fields, and there's a particular reason why we're really not interested in the military definition of &quot;threat&quot;.In the information security field, &quot;risk&quot; and &quot;vulnerability&quot; have roughly the same meanings that you use. However, &quot;threat&quot; means something more like &quot;a method of exploiting a vulnerability or combination of vulnerabilities to cause a loss&quot;, while what you call a &quot;threat&quot; is an abstraction called an opponent or adversary. When we talk about &quot;threat analysis&quot;, we mean examining ways vulnerabilities can be combined and exploited and what kinds of losses they can cause; these analyses may then be used as inputs to a risk analysis model. In the lunch room example you cited, the threat is &quot;casually saunter up to the fridge, glance around, take a lunch, scurry away&quot;, and would be characterised as &quot;low cost, low skill, low risk of discovery&quot;. The threat is indeed the same whether or not there is an opponent to exploit it. Opponents, in turn, are fairly abstractly characterised, something like:C &quot;local hobo who notices the smokers propping open the lunch room door&quot;B &quot;hungry intern on low wage&quot;A &quot;corporate saboteur spiking the CFO's salad at the AGM&quot;What your intel and law enforcement types call a &quot;threat analysis&quot; simply isn't terribly relevant in the IT security field; we are mostly civilian corporate employees, with neither the right nor capability to compile dossiers on *specific* &quot;opponents&quot;. We do compile information about what kind of attacks have actually been occuring; we call that the &quot;CERT Summary&quot;!It is true, as Schneier says, that &quot;threat analysis&quot; and &quot;risk analysis&quot; are often confused in IT security - due in large part to the non-IT security world merging both concepts into their risk analyses. But in our field it is much better to keep them separate. A threat analysis is a more abstract (and hence generally applicable) study, while a risk analysis depends on a particular business model. For example, if we store Almas caviar in the fridge instead of salami, the threat analysis is the same, but the risk analysis will be considerably different; all the wierdo threats that were low risk before (e.g. masked men with shotguns storming the fridge) become realistic. This separation is useful when identical reusable software components may be employed by thousands of very different businesses.So, I while I found your comments very interesting, I think the semantic difference is just a difference, not an error."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"This is an excellent, entertaining, and informative read. It's a breeze to get through, and the central points are clear and easily understood. With many examples, mixing generalized and anecdotal, Schneier presents a simple methodology for analyzing risk, and explaining how to determine what security is useful, worthwile, and what's a total waste of time and money. As the author states, &quot;Security is all about trade-offs,&quot; and in my opinion, spending a day reading through Beyond Fear is a totally worthwhile trade-off for developing a better mindset about security and risk."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"The central message of _Beyond Fear_ is that we need to change the way we, the average reader, think about security. The media, the government, and the people around us send so much information our way about things that will make us safer, about dangers that threaten us, and about actions we should take. Schneier, in a consistently readable and entertaining fashion, provides a way to analyze such information, and reinforced with interesting and often quite entertaining examples. He draws from politics, history, crime, biology, and sports (to name a few fields) in teaching the reader a mode of thinking, yet allowing the reader to come to his or her own conclusions for any given subject.At the beginning of the book, the author lays out the stakes: 9/11. Thinking about security has always been important, as this book makes clear. Yet in recent years so much of our national debate has focused around questions of safety and security, and this book better equips us to comprehend the many sides of this debate and draw a more informed conclusion. After showing the reader how this process works, Schneier then confronts various important issues of the day and offers his analysis, all of which I found very revealing.This book is also a great deal of fun to read. The examples are clever and often surprising, and described in an engaging fashion. A great read; an important book."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"Having already read \\"Secrets and Lies\\", I often felt like I had already read this book.Even if this is your first Schneier, however, I completely agree with other reviewers that there is a lot of padding going on, and the contents of the book could have been presented much more succinctly.I think quality (as opposed to quantity) of the contents is what's saving this title. The author gives a professional and detached opinion about security in general, focussing often on post-9/11 security countermeasures.Today (2009) parts of this book are obviously outdated, but sadly, much of its rational analyses are still valid. It's clearly not been a favourite read among post-9/11 politicians."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"_Beyond Fear_ is a good book, and I'd put it into the &quot;should read&quot; but not &quot;must read&quot; category for people working in security (as opposed to _Secrets and Lies_, which I put into the &quot;must read&quot; category). There's little new or profound in the book, which is essentially an elaboration with examples on the five-step process of analyzing and evaluating security systems given on pp. 14-15 of the book:1. What assets are you trying to protect?2. What are the risks to these assets?3. How well does the security system mitigate those risks?4. What other risks does the security system cause?5. What costs and trade-offs does the security solution impose?In the process, Schneier provides many interesting examples. This is an excellent book on security for the layman. But it is definitely a book targeted at a popular audience. There are no footnotes or references, and Schneier occasionally tosses off remarks or asides that are questionable, if not false.There are two significant flaws in the book:1. It exaggerates the subjectivity of a security evaluation. On p. 17, chapter two is titled &quot;Security Trade-offs are Subjective.&quot; But it's not the trade-off itself that is subjective. It's not the risk assessment that is subjective. It is people's non-instrumental desires (basic desires) orvalues that are subjective.Schneier writes (p. 17) that &quot;Different people have different senses of what constitutes a threat&quot;--but some are right and some are wrong. His distinction between perceived and actual risk shows that the important one is actual risk, not perceived risk. Actual risk is objective, not subjective. Schneier continues &quot;or what level of risk is acceptable.&quot; That can certainly have a subjective component, but even subjective components can conflict with each other and be internally inconsistent, indicating a problem in the evaluation.The final sentence of the chapter contradicts the chapter title: &quot;Because we do not understand the risks, we make bad security trade-offs.&quot; (p. 31) If the trade-offs were subjective, there would be no such thing as a bad trade-off, only a trade-off perceived to be bad by someone.Later in the book Schneier contradicts the strong subjectivity claim (e.g., p. 249: &quot;Massive surveillance systems are *never* worth it.&quot; (emphasis added)) I don't think he seriously meant to make the strong claim--I think it's just careless/imprecise writing. p. 259 seems to get it pretty much right, but he should really have found a philosopher to review this book--that a problem is intractable doesn't mean that the answer is subjective, nor does the fact that subjective interests enter into the picture mean that the answer, given those interests, is subjective.2. The book argues for an exaggerated egalitarianism--that anybody, regardless of background, training, or intelligence, can do security analysis. At the same time, the book touches on some of the evidence that ordinary judgments are inaccurate, and that people are notoriously bad at estimating and comparing risks due to the natural use of heuristics like vividness, recency, etc. (the classic Kahnemann and Tversy book, _Judgment Under Uncertainty_, summarizes some of this evidence).It would be grossly mistaken to think that Joe Schmoe off the street is going to be capable of designing (or evaluating) the effectiveness of a complex security system, versus people with appropriate training and experience--just as mistaken as hiring people with no computer knowledge to build and maintain your IT infrastructure.Again, like in point 1, Schneier says things which contradict the strong hypothesis he seems to argue for, for example when he writes that wealthy people want doctors who treat others, not just standing by on 24/7 on-call for those wealthy people, because they want doctors who are experienced.And I think this is a good comparison--the position Schneier *should* be arguing for is that we should take responsibility for our own security in the same way that we should take responsibility for our own health. We still need to rely on experts, but we should take an active role in consulting with them and evaluating what they tell us, especially since (just as in health care and medicine) there are people who know what they are talking about and those who are snake oil salesmen."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"As a healthcare fraud consultant, I found this book very helpful. Healthcare insurers and plans are often at a loss when it comes to securing their systems. Here are three of the things I thought were particularly helpful:1) Security is only as strong as the weakest link. If a crook can enroll as a provider without providing any credentials and can bill using a list of patients stolen from another provider, then all the computer network security in the world is not going to help you.2) Class breaks allow a perpetrator to attack several systems with the same ease as he can attack one system. The standardization required under HIPAA is going to make it easier for us to use fraud fighting algorithms developed for one plan to find fraud in another plan, but it will also make it easier for criminals to use the same exact scam in multiple places.3) Automation allows attackers to make a huge number of attacks with about the same effort as one attack. The payoff for each attack can be very low, since the cost is low.

His insights into anti-terrorism efforts are enlightening."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"What's been written is simply the best general level explanation of what security is and should be that I've ever come across. The author methodically, clearly, and concisely describes the elements of security, and how to evaluate them.Not just computer security either -- physical real-world security is also discussed and analyzed in language that really is so simple that even an administrator could understand it.Not only that, but in what I consider one of the book's strongest strengths, the reader walks away able to explain security to others, and to evaluate security based on reasonable criteria and tools instead of just gut instinct.I really think that this book ought to be required reading for anyone who has anything to do with security in any way, whether it be recommending it, designing it, implementing it, or using it.

We are all rubes from the past, trying to cope with the present day.\\" (Page 29.)\\"Beyond Fear\\" explains how experts think about security and the new challenges posed both by modern technology and the medieval mindset of suicide bombers. Everyone knows that security has costs: money, time, and perhaps restrictions on civil liberties. But experts know that security measures, even if well thought-out, often create entirely new problems. Amatuerish attempts to increase security often decrease security instead.In \\"Beyond Fear,\\" Schneier introduces five simple questions to ask about any security measure to determine if the measure is useful or useless. He uses examples ranging from satelllite technology to antics of deep-sea squids to illustrate his points. And, as anyone in the sciences knows, \\"There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch.\\" Any real-life situation will require a complex series of tradeoffs between conflicting requirements and costs.Written for the intelligent layperson, this book is required reading for any person who wants to understand how to approach security on a personal, national, and international level."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"A lot of the security discussion now uses fear, uncertainty, and doubt to sell its point of view. Schneier's book is a refreshing change: while it can be scary, because these are scary times, it doesn't depend on scaring you to convince you. Instead, he depends on clear (and sometimes funny) explanation, good sense (\\"common\\" sense isn't, at least not in the security field), and reason. The best part is the solid reasoning behind why civil liberties are important to security, not a detriment."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"Mr. Schneier's conversational tones and clear examples help bring to light the best ways to consider the security issues we must face each day. It is rare when a book is as entertaining as it is useful. This is such a book."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"After discussing various security problems and proposed solutions, this book gives examples of how those methods have worked in the real world. Or how and why they failed to achieve the desired result.Informative and entertaining."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"This is the one, single book on security you want to read.Where other books on the subject feed on the paranoia or give you cookie-cutter 'solutions' that have little bearing on reality, Schneier's BEYOND FEAR gives you the tools and the knowledge you need to make critical security decisions on your own. Schneier skewers the myths, the hidden agendas, and the outright poor decisions made in the name of \\"security,\\" using real life examples to show us how to effectively evaluate a situation. Schneier's credentials as a security guru are impeccable; at the same time, he has the unique (and far too rare) gift of being able to write to a general audience. His writing style is as entertaining as it is informative. This is a book you'll enjoy reading; more importantly, it's a book you SHOULD read -- because it will arm you with the knowledge you need in today's world."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"I was pretty excited to read Bruce Schneier's Beyond Fear, I have enjoyed hearning him speak and like his blog. I will say that the book could have said what it says with a lot less pages, possibly even an essay. However, there are lots of great stories and a fantastic word picture called \\"Security Theater\\". His illustration is that after 9/11 no one knew what to do to combat air terrorism, so they gave the appearance of action by doing things like confiscating nail files. Oh do I agree that much of what we see is security theater!Bruce has a five step process he tries to illustrate, especially in the second half of the book:* What assets are you trying to protect?* What are the risks to these assets? ( I think threats is a more correct word than risks )* How well does the security solution mitigate those risks?* What other risks does the security solution cause?* What trade-offs does the security solution require?This is a nice implementation of threat vector analysis and he tells great stories. I am not sure the book teaches that much, but it might be a valuable awareness tool for executives."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"This new book of Bruce's covers a lot of practical aspects to security that is particularly relevant in a security-obsessed society. It's important to make sure when you do something that's supposed to increase security that it actually work. This is the most important, really. If it's not going to work, why bother. Discussing security in general terms explains why some counter-intuitive measures are good security. It also shows why security measures that are broadly based but weak can be better than ones that are targeted but strong."},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"Since 9/11, security has become political. This book cuts through the rhetoric and explains how security work and how to be safer. I feel like my eyes have been opened, and I see the security around me in a new light. I'm giving this book to all of my friends for a Christmas present!"},{"Title":"Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World","review":"Lots of great instructive and thought-provoking stuff: For example, the story that begins on page 133 describes how an alert and intuitive US customs agent stopped Ahmed Ressam from carrying out his 1999 plan to bomb LAX. It is more than worth the price of admission. It's vintage Bruce because we see his inexorable, irrefutable logic machine at work, but new and different because now his topic is, in effect... everything about security. In fact the book takes on the task of showing us how to think about security. Who but Bruce would have the nerve and brilliance to do this?"},{"Title":"Dendritic Cells: Biology and Clinical Applications","review":"Dendritic cells by Lotze &amp; Thompson is well-researched book for academics and students interested in Medical Research.

It's like I was never gone; her comic style intertwines effortlessly with the truly sympathetic in this collection of short fiction. There are lots of voices here, all of women grappling with changes in their lives that have brought chaos, rather than order. The pieces were written across a span of years and the author's propensity to drop topical references to our disposable culture can be a little distracting when moving from one story to another, as you inevitably pause to recall just when &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; or &quot;The New Newlyweds Game&quot; was hot. But that's just a little itch, and it doesn't date the material."},{"Title":"Crash Diet","review":"I usually don't read short stories, but I read a review of this book and decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did. Ms. McCorkle does a wonderful job of portraying various types of women. It is perfect bedside reading."},{"Title":"Crash Diet","review":"I found &quot;Crash Diet&quot; in a pile of books and was intrigued by the title. It was a collection of short stories by a southern writer. Usually, with a collection of stories - there is sure to be a couple that you don't care for - but not with this collection.Each female protagonist was her own charachter. I felt as though I knew each one of them through Ms. McCorkle's description and characterization. Some funny, some sad - all uniquely interesting.I highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Crash Diet","review":"I loved the many stories in this book. The protagonists are all female, but they are of different ages, situations and dilemmas. Jill McCorkle shows a lot of humor and wisdom in telling their stories."},{"Title":"Crash Diet","review":"What a great read. Exceptional, interesting....really beautiful short stories. Loved the way all the stories were different yet obviously written by the same person- great style. I look forward to reading more from Jill."},{"Title":"Crash Diet","review":"What a great writer Jill McCorkle is. I started on the short story collection to see if I liked her work, and now I'm looking forward to reading Ferris Beach and some of her novels. Crash Diet's stories have a southern flavor, but they aren't overdone caricatures. A wonderful collection of stories by a very talented author."},{"Title":"Crash Diet","review":"The women featured in these short stories are wonderfully strong, deep, resonant characters. I was impressed with the author's range--she is masterful and moving with everyone from confused teenage girls to lonely elderly widows. Each of these stories is a gem. I loved this book and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"I personally don't think there's any greater childrens' book series than Dr. Seuss, and the Sleep Book is quintessential Seuss. It is hands-down my 4-year old's favorite book (and our favorite to read with him), at bedtime or any time. We've read it hundreds of times, and he still giggles uncontrollably at Foona Lagoona Baboona, and sure enough, by the end of the book, he is indeed yawning and laying down to go to sleep effortlessly. Clever and captivating, a must-have for any family."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"I've always love this book. After having a baby, it was the 1st book I purchased for her.

Oh, how I loved this book. The line (and the attendant, very silly illustration) that really set me off was: \\"The Collapsible Frink just collapsed in a heap!\\" I just about collapsed in a heap myself.

Not only has it been helping get children to sleep for generations, it is does not have the tongue-twisting rhymes that make some of his books a challenge to read aloud.

But no, these aren't the normal people you'd expect. We're talking about Seuss creations like the Biffer-Baum Bird. There are the world champ sleep talkers and the various sleep walkers. And you can't forget about the Chippendale Mupp who sets his alarm by biting his incredibly long tail.As you can see, this is a book filled with Dr. Seuss's imagination and that's always lots of fun. Couple that with his great illustrations, and you've got a classic combination.This isn't an easy reader as many of the words will be tricky for adults if you aren't careful. And watch out for the occasional tongue twisting page or two.Still, this is a great read aloud as our kid is in bed waiting to go to sleep. I enjoyed it as a kid, and my niece loves it now."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"The book was bought for my two boys for bedtime reading. It is a sturdy book and they enjoy listening to it. I actually yawn reading this book.

I had never heard of it before. The first time I read it to my son, it seemed incredibly long, but after a couple of readings, I loved the book as much as my son does. Now I'm thrilled when I see that he has picked this book for his bedtime story. I never tire of reading about how sleepers are counted and the sleep-walking Crandalls and the salesmen with their Zizzer-Zoof seeds. And the illustrations are wonderful! The page near the end which shows a multitude of creatures asleep for the night is a favorite -- my son can look at and talk about that page for 10 minutes! I am sorry I missed out on this book growing up, but at least my son hasn't!"},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"This is possibly the best of Dr. Seuss. It was my favorite as a child, and it is my favorite today.Many of Seuss' books focus on characters and stories (Cat in the Hat), or on his delightful wordplay (Green Eggs and Ham, One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish). The Sleep Book focuses instead on almost pure imagination.Because of this, it may not have quite the marketing potential of his other books. There is no mascot, no catch-phrase. You won't find a Sleep Book t-shirt or plush toy.What you will find here are lavish illustrations - huge surreal landscapes with impossible creatures sleeping in every available nook and cranny. You will find an exploration of an entire world of creatures as each prepares for the night in its own unique way.You will also find creatures who are not quite perfect little sleepers. If your child is a sleepwalker, a sleeptalker, or a snorer, they will find creatures who do this every night as a sport. With this simple elegant device, Dr. Seuss manages to comfort children who may have these difficulties in his delightfully subtle fashion.I know of no other book that is quite so good at putting a noisy mind to rest. Maybe Goodnight Moon. Maybe.Every creature that sleeps should own this book."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"Shake myself awake again to tell my sleepy view... of Dr. Seuss's \\"Sleep Book,\\" a childhood favorite that has survived all the insomniac years of growing up and turning a bit more vintage. So many of my childhood books have vanished somewhere along that winding time-route... somewhere on those many travels and address changes, moved from one previous life to another former life to another life begun today. Lost, but for this one. And when a family pet took a toothy chomp along the binding, no matter, I had to buy another. Children's book? Ah, for the child in all of us! For we all sleep, and we all dream. The first stretchy yawn is as delicious as the final one, and the overall feel of this Seussian masterpiece is cozy, and warm, and comforting. I remember well my fascination with the unique characters as a child, with all their quirky sleep routines. I found them fully as endearing when reading the book, over and over again, to my own children. With anticipation of grandchildren looming somewhere within the next decade... I look forward to sharing these cozy yawns with yet another generation. The book is a timeless classic."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"This book is the next best thing to a ride in the car to help your youngster get to sleep. Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book will also provide lots of relaxing evening reads . . . that will leave you in a good mood for a restful night, as well.Many people report having trouble getting to sleep throughout their entire lives. Sleep experts advise creating new behaviors that enourage drowsiness. Avoid caffeine. Put the lights on low. Have some quiet music. Avoid activities in bed other than sleeping (I've always wondered about that one, too, for the parents). Keep a regular schedule. Have some hot milk.So Dr. Seuss right away changes the rules. &quot;This Book is to be Read in Bed.&quot;You will immediately meet a &quot;very small bug . . . Van Vleckis yawning so wideyou can look down his neck.&quot;Now a yawn is catching. In fact, I'm yawning as I type this section.Before I knew about this book, one of my favorite methods of helping our youngsters settle down was to go into their room to read a story while yawning uncontrollably. They could seldom resist yawning themselves for longer than two minutes. Pretty soon the eye lids were heavy. Dr. Seuss gives you some additional hypnotic suggestions to help with this process, so you'll soon be a sleep-inducing magician.&quot;The yawn of that one little bug is still spreading!&quot;&quot;And people are gradually starting to say,'I feel rather drowsy. I've had quite a day.'&quot;&quot;Creatures are starting to think about rest.Two Biffer-Baum Birds are now building their nest.&quot;&quot;Sleepy thoughts are spreading throughout the whole land.&quot;What follows are lots of references to brushing your teeth before bedtime, turning the lights out, more yawns, and getting into bed.&quot;The number of sleepers is steadily growing.&quot;These include stilt-walkers, the Hinkle-Horn Honking Club, the collapsible Frink, some who are talking in their sleep, Joe and Mo Redd-Zoff are sleep walking, the Hoop-Soup-Snoop Group, the Curious Crandalls, Chippendale Mupp bites his tail, Mr. and Mrs. J. Carmichael Krox, Zwiebach Motel guests, snorers who make music, Jedd, two Offts, a dreaming moose and goose, the Bumble-Tub Club sleeping afloat, and the salesmen in the Vale of Va-Vode sleeping all over the road (and everywhere else).Pretty soon,&quot;Ninety-nine zillion,Nine trillion and twoCreatures are sleeping!So . . . How about you?&quot;&quot;Good night.&quot;Obviously, the key to this book is to create an ever more . . . drowsy mood. Unlike the usual Dr. Seuss story, you want to s - l - o - w d - o - w - n a - s y - o - u g - o .The book is rather long, so the cadence has a chance to create a rhythmic sense of relaxation. Reading the book can become one of those regular habits that is sleep inducing in this way.The only book that compares with this one for relaxing your child into sleep is Good Night Moon, which is surely a staple in your repertoire by now. Older children do tire of that (which is great for wee ones), so they can graduate later to this book. Naturally, when your child starts to read this book to you, you should encourage putting yawns and snores in at the right places . . . while avoiding lethargy disturbing giggles and laughter.Now I hope you feel like you're as snug as a bug in a rug, and the pillow is ever so soft. Take a large yawn, try two, and then go on to three. Pass along these soporofic hints, and you'll enjoy the land of nod, too.As you can see, this book is great for creating a mood. You can enhance any experience by establishing the proper mood.

First, I have trouble not laughing. (OK, I admit it, I laugh on every page while reading to my 3-1/2 year old. He starts laughing and the whole bedtime story thing degenerates.)

My daughter enjoys looking at the pictures and the larger size helps hold her attention longer since she scans all the pages."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"Not just a bedtime book, although it is one of the best around. I have used this book when tutoring dyslexic children. The alliterative rhymes on every pair of facing pages provides ample opportunity for young readers to practice their skills. In addition, each pair of facing pages is like a short, short story itself. This highly imaginative work is hilarious for the adult as well, making reading this book aloud a joy(the only way to really get the rhyme and humor), even when a child wants the book read over and over numerous times. Excellent book for children age five through adulthood!"},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"I have at least 3 yawns in the first two pages and my little one is normally out before the middle of the book."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"I've been reading this to my daughter every night for the past few nights, and she's always asleep by the end of it.

Another great Seuss classic!"},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"I am amazed that more people do not know this classic book by Dr. Seuss.I will mention this title and frequently I am met by blank stares.Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book is a wonderful book that allows adults to yawn repeatedly throughout the reading and it will cause youngsters to become sleepy. Of course, one side effect is that the adult will also become sleepy from yawning while reading it.The creatures are wonderfully strange and humorous in the classic Dr. Seuss style.I. Love. This. Book.I frequently give it as a gift to friends with small children."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a child, and now I'm buying it for a friend's young one. I had to read it one more time before I gave it away, and it was as wonderful as I remembered."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"This book is easily the best one he ever wrote. The rhymes and rhythms are bouncy and fun, and they gently slow down as you go, so that by the time you're near the end, your heart beat has slowed and so has your breathing. It's designed to get kids ready to fall asleep, even if they start out filled with energy- but it's still got all the silly and zany imagination of all his other works. Some of my favorite of his creations are in this- the goose juice and moose juice, and several others that are hard to spell but easy to pronounce.Hold your kid as you read this and good dreams will follow close behind!"},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"This was my favorite book as a kid.

I read his books to my kids and now my grandkids! Love him!"},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"\\"This book is to be read in bed\\" are the words you will find in the beginning of this book. It starts off with a little bug that yawns and then rhymes along with random silliness about going to sleep. I read this to my son for bedtime last night, and as with all Dr Seuss books, he laughed at me reading it. Words that are made up, as well as creatures, it's a great bedtime book.My son asked me a couple times \\"What's that?\\" when I said the name of a critter in the book and then we took time to make up our own life story of certain creatures. One of which my son decided only ate cream cheese....but it weighted minus one pound. *sigh* If only that were true. ;)This book can be just a bedtime story, or a fun activity before bed. you decide. It's a little long so it may not keep a really young child's interest, but it's still worth trying."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"If you haven't read this book - u should. My grandson just loves it! One of his favorites to pick for me to read to him."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"I don't remember having this one as a kid, but it's great! We read it to baby before bed time and when she is up and won't sleep. I can't get past the first page without yawning :) The story is cute and all the yawning characters will surely induce narcolepsy in you. The baby still gets sleepy only if she wants to, so I can't say it's a cure all for her, but she enjoys listening to it and it gives me something fun to do with her while up at odd hours on baby time."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"My son and I have loved this book for years. It's a really fun book to read, like all Dr. Seuss. There's even one page that makes me yawn every single time I read it, and I can't explain why."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"Amazing that the Dr. Suess's books aren't more dated than they are.My grandson,2 years,absolutely adores them. He is already memorizing the words.One caution- some of the books contain some stereotypes that were acceptable in the 50's but make us cringe now - so be sure to read before you choose."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"Great bedtime book. My favorite part of the book is when the contagious yawns start spreading. The book provides a news update as everyone begins to fall asleep. As the books continues the count of sleeping creatures grows. I love this because often children don't want to go to sleep because they fear they are missing out on all the fun. The book informs the reader that everyone else is pretty much asleep, so they might as well join in. Charming, book. However, I would recommend it for children who are maybe 3 and up. My daughter is 2 and I struggled to keep her attention. She does better with 4-6 words per page (Go Dog Go or Ear Book).Update: To help with the attention span I only read the first two lines of each page. She LOVES it. She calls it the YAWN book. :) As we read it, she starts yawning. By the end she jumps into bed and says \\"Good night.\\" I caught her \\"reading\\" it during her nap today. :)"},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"Started reading this with my 2 year old and she loved it. It's my all-time favorite gift for baby showers. Moms definitely appreciate it in time. :)"},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"I was never exposed to Dr Seuss as a child, so I want to start a collection with my one year old girl. I ran across The Sleep Book in the library. I usually have to read her at least 3 \\"sleep\\" books (among other rituals) before she even begins to feel drowsy. I only need to read halfway through the Sleep Book before she's out for the count. Even though she doesn't understand the words, she understands the rhythm that is so sleep inducing. I like to help the process by starting slow and quiet until I'm whispering as the characters are all asleep. I had to return the book so I desperately need to buy one to keep... ASAP!"},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"This delightful book is a must for all young children and parents.Filled with wonderful characters and wonderful stories, starting with the news that \`Has just come in from the County of KeckThat a very small bug by the name of Van VleckIs yawning so wide you can look down his neck'It deals with a castle half way between Reno and Rome, Two very nice Foona Lagoona Baboona, and the folly of a goose and moose drinking each other's juice. It will take the little ones minds off to faraway dreamy and tranquil destinations before easing them off to sleep. It was certainly one of my childhood favourites, and one of the first books I remember."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"This book is awesome-- a classic! My all-time favorite Dr. Seuss book. All I have to say is, (yawn)......"},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"Dr Seuss' Sleep Book is amazing. I picked up a copy when my oldest child was about two years old, and it has always held her attention until she drifted off to sleep. My daughter is six now and, along with her two younger siblings, still loves this book.Our favorite character is Snorter McPhail. The kids say he reminds them of their father... while I agree that he does bear a resemblance to my husband, I think I just like the concept of Snorter wearing a large bucket on his head, conducting a snoring orchestra - the \\"snore-a-snort band\\" - in a cave way out of town, all while he is asleep.This book has some kind of weird voodoo magic that really does put kids (and sometimes grownups) to sleep. In the years that I've been reading the story to my children, they have almost never made it through the entire book before drifting off, and the few times they have made it through awake, they're extremely drowsy by the end. Dr. Seuss' Sleep Book has been read so often that the binding is starting to come loose, but we'll just keep reading it until it falls apart, then buy another copy."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"I have not read all the Seuss books yet, but this book is a huge classic for me.Each page is another world to enter into and dream about.There is almost no plot, just one crazy, engrossing scene after another.Not a great read-to book because your kid misses the visuals - but an amazing read-with book.I have just read the copy from my youth, 30+ yrs ago, alongside my 3 and 5 yr old girls (in bed, as the book tells us to do) and they did not fidget once.'Sleep' reminds me of the excellent 'Starbright' books that put images and scenes into the child's imagination. Those books are word only, this is basically pictures."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"My two year old son loves Dr. Suess. We were having trouble getting him to wind down and get to sleep on his own at night (and naps). First, I started reading it to him before he went to bed. After about a week I started putting him in bed and read it to him and before I knew it he was falling asleep while listening to the story! Yeah! No more tramatic scenes before bed. This way is peaceful for both of us. Now he always asks for his \\"sleep book\\" when he gets in bed!"},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"I read this for my 6 month infant and the first time, she fell asleep. I like the Dr. Seus rhymes...They're very soothing and as another review I read before mentions, very easy to read to a young baby..Even for parents who feel awkward reading. I would recommend the book for young children."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"I purchased Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book to read to my grandchildren, ages 3 and 5. It's just perfect for bedtime when we are all 3 in the big bed and Nana just keeps yawning as she reads. They love it. And what's not to love about it? The characters are charming and the illustrations delightful. We all love it."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"Dr. Seuss' Sleep Book is an all-time classic in my opinion. While, as a kid, I was the only person I knew with a copy, it was most certainly my favorite and I asked for it to be read over and over again. I kept the household copy (older sister and brother loved it, too) and now that I have a daughter of my own, I have a copy of her own to enjoy (I'm keeping my own!!) and have been reading it to her since before she was born. It definitely makes me sleepy and despite having heard it, I'm sure, thousands of times, I still love it! A must-have for kids of all ages!"},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"I'm in eighth grade, and my English teacher had us all read a Dr. Seuss book for his 101st birthday. I picked up Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book, wondering if it would help me, a restless dreamer, sleep at night. My hunch was right. The first page started me yawning instantly, as if the book had begun to cast a hypnotic sleep spell! By the time I reached the Mcphail band in the middle, when I had to stop at the end of class, I was yawning like a hippo! I was still drowsy when I got to gym class, almost an hour later! I curled up in a loose ball on my spot on the gym floor and VERY sleepily mumbled to myself, \\"Can I take a nap now?\\" I'm certain that if I'd finished, it woulda put me to sleep! I'm still yawning as I write this! *yawn* I'm going to get this book so I can sleep at night.

It puts me to sleep before I can even get halfway through it (so I guess it's effective). Way too long in my opinion!"},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"Honest, I love Dr. Seuss. However, I was very disappointed with this particular book. I was searching for a good rythmic book to read to my newborn. This one was suggested because it was supposed to be good from day one on through the ages. The truth of it is, I was bored with it before I ever finished and the pictures weren't as stimulating as some of the other Seuss works. If I wasn't stimulated, I can't really imagine that either a baby or a 5-year old will be either. I actually returned the book."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"This is such a great bedtime read for kids of any age. Before long both adult and child are yawning their heads off and preparing for sleep. The wonderful rhymes soothe you into slumber and each time you read it the fantastic Suess pictures never fail to offer you something you hadn't noticed in them before.Brilliant."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"My mom reminds me that my brother and I would request this book most often out of all of Dr. Seuss's when bedtime rolled around. It may have been because we loved our bedtime stories and didn't want them to end. This is the longest and most expansive of Dr. Seuss's books. Reading it again at twenty-eight, I still don't want it to end. It is a deliciously meandering story, guaranteed to have grown-ups and kids alike snuggled up tight, and saying good-night!"},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"I should write this review under an alias so I can keep getting credit for helping grownups who can't get to sleep ... all my other clever professional tactics aside, this book is the clincher. I get sleepy just taking it off the shelf, and I have to turn my head away as folks leaf through the pages. If you're lucky enough to have a youngster as your excuse for buying this book, bravo -- and if not, well, put it by your bedside anyway. You won't be awake long enough to regret it. Sweet dreams ...."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"My 2.5 year old son doesn't usually sleep for books--in fact; before reading this book, he didn't sleep for any books at all.

To this day I can still recite most of it! \\"The news just came in from the County of Keck..\\" and by the time I get to the last few lines... I'm always ready to sleep!

It is still as enjoyable to me now as when I was a little one!"},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"This is THE book to get the kids to sleep. The author generates what I call &quot;the sleep spell&quot; as from the start he tells the story of each character in the book getting prepared to go to sleep. It begins with a yawn and like a chain reaction, every creature in the book wants to go to bed and have a good night sleep. With such a plot, coupled with corresponding illustrations, the book works on your child's mind to fall asleep as well. However, my word of caution is that it might not work on babies because the text on each page is pretty long. Thus, their attention might get weary and become distress,wanting you to sing a lullaby instead of reading a long, winding text."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book is a guaranteed way to get your child to sleep. It is a very long book, and the secret to reading it is that you can look at your child's drowsy eyelids and skip a bit here and there. On a wound-up night when your little one isn't winding down quite so easily, you can go through the whole thing in about 20 minutes...and that's where the power of suggestion kicks in.You see, the idea behind The Sleep Book is that every single page is telling your child about all the other imaginary creatures that are going to bed, right now. It slips in the suggestion on every page, using words that we all seem to find suggestive. For example, the word yawn is a very powerful word. I just typed it and now you're thinking about yawning. Even if you fight it, eventually the impulse to yawn will get the better of you! Dr. Seuss uses 'yawn' again, and again, and again--along with 'bed', 'night-time', and more.The other secret to reading this book is not to make it exciting. Read to your child in a calm, relaxed manner and you can be sure that each page winds them down just a little more. I used this book on my daughter for years, and she always ended up going willingly to bed.Regardless of what you choose, read to your child. Read to them and you will always see a benefit. Spend time with them and make reading a part of that."},{"Title":"Dr Seusss Sleep Book","review":"Hi all, I got this book for my baby boy, 3 months old now.

He hurts everyone who gets in his path to get what he wants. In the end, Pam, Hillary, Cutter and Patricia show him where his evil, self-centered ways have gotten him.Each character was developed very well. By the middle of the book, I felt I knew each of them in a personal way. Each had their strong points and their weak points; except for John. I never did find anything good about him unless one wants to count drive and ambition as an asset.

His jealous rage made him victimize his half-sister Pam--who was everyone's darling, &amp; her lover Cutter Reid--the 'nobody' whom his father was so proud of. But a person can only take so much before wanting revenge...and doing something to make it happen.In all fairness, the story had its moments 'cuz it made me cry--I really felt for Pam's predicament. While the histories that went into each major character were very detailed, there wasn't much specific info on tourmaline, mining, or the jewelry-making industry, except for some vague generalizations. Elizabeth Lowell's &quot;Lover in the Rough&quot; provided a lot more insights &amp; depth of feeling.A word of caution: 'This ain't no fairy-tale.'

I will definitely read more of Barbara Delinsky's books."},{"Title":"Facets","review":"Like the gems that make up the business that lies at the heart of this story, the facets that comprise each stone also represent the various characters who form the dynamics of this tale of hunger, ambition, power, and revenge; the story may be a familiar one, but at the same time, it unfolds in new and intriguing ways.Facetsportrays the secrets, the betrayals, and depicts the long and winding trail that ultimately leads to freedom. It begins in a mining town in Maine, but sweeps across the landscape to cities like Boston and New York. It spans three decades and is as much a family drama as a tale of ambition, greed, and achievement.When the head of the mining company, Eugene St. George, dies tragically, his son John takes over control of the company and the lives of his stepmother Patricia and his minor half-sister Pamela. As he exerts his power over those who are defenseless to act against him, he sets in motion a chain of events that will take decades to unleash.Characters like Hillary Cox and Cutter Reid are pitted against John St. George, who has controlled \\"Facets,\\" the empire, for so long that he truly believes nothing can touch him. His younger half-sister Pam fears the power he has over her life, and dreams of finally escaping his control. His bullying and manipulation have finally taken their toll on his victims, so whatever happens next could be poetic justice.What will Pam St. George do to finally wrest free of her powerful and tyrannical half-brother? Will she finally win the love of her life before it is too late? And how will John react to the carefully wrought plans of his enemies? Will Hillary's obsession and love/hate relationship with John be her undoing, or will the actions of the others finally release her?Throughout the story, I believed in the characters and their strengths; they were that real. I sometimes felt frustration with Hillary and her obsession with John, but considering her history, it was understandable. I most empathized with Pam, whose very existence depended upon the maneuverings and whims of a man who apparently had no conscience. But at other times, the author showed various other facets to these characters, making them true-to-life, with good as well as bad qualities.I liked the way the story opened in the \\"present,\\" which in this book was 1990, but then swept backward in time. As it moved backward and forward, new layers were revealed, adding depth to the story and the characters.In some ways, the story seemed to meander along a bit, which is why I chose four stars. I still would recommend it for anyone who loves a good family/business saga."},{"Title":"Facets","review":"I liked this book but it is not up to Barbara's usual high standards.I continue to read her stories as she has become a supreme story teller and I always learn something in each book."},{"Title":"Facets","review":"Definitely not a typical romance novel. All the characters seemed very real and human most of all. I wasn't sure if I was going to like it when I first started to read it but I was completely engrossed after a couple chapters.

I still can't believe she loved John despite of everything."},{"Title":"Facets","review":"What else can I say. I have never been disappointed with a BarbaraDelinsky book. Enjoyable!

If you're looking for info, some of the web references are the wrong addresses, the book is about 220 pages (double spaced) with about 100 pages that are reprints of \\"checklists\\" - i.e., does your child prefer to be warm or cool when studying? There are references to other people's work (admittedly there's not a lot out there) but it seems only anecdotal original work, most of which is repeated numerous times and is generally the same girl identical twins. For those of you out there looking for answers, they're not in this book."},{"Title":"Global Sex Workers: Rights, Resistance, and Redefinition","review":"Global Sex Workers is a series of pieces by a variety of authors on sex worker issues around the globe. The term &quot;sex workers&quot; has been used deliberately by the editors and contributors, as it emphaises the work in sex work and to some extent avoids the stigmatization associated with the term &quot;prostitute&quot;. The editors and contributors' perspective on sex work is radical in its opposition to traditional ways of approaching the question. Rather than advocating abolition of prostitution because prostitution always violates women's rights, the contributors take a more nuanced approach, acknowledging that some sex work takes place in conditions of oppression and indeed slavery, but that much does not. Furthermore, crimialization of sex workers, their clients and those associated with sex work (eg pimps and madams) hamrs the women involved in sex work, although such laws are often said to be for the benefit of sex workers.The book exmines a variety of issues in the area of sex work - theoretical approaches to sex work; migration of women for sex work; sex tourism; sex workers' organizations; and issues of AIDS prevention and sex workers' empowerment. The chief virtues of the book are twofold: first, its global perspective is refreshing, in a debate that has so often centered on the experiences of sex workers in the west; and second, the focus on sex workers' organizations themselves. Much that is written about prostitution ignores the voices of women involved in sex work, and it is good to see that trend being countered in this book.Countires discussed in the book include Japan, Cote d'Iviore, Cuba, the Caribbean countries, Thailand, Ecuador, South Africa, Mexico, India and Malaysia, to name some. The book will be of interest to anyone interested in sex work, though it is probably of most use to academics and activists."},{"Title":"Global Sex Workers: Rights, Resistance, and Redefinition","review":"if you want to learn a little about how prostitution is done in the world, what types of prostitutes are desirable in each part of the world, what conflicts and problems prostitutes faced whether cultural or international, and how prostitutes live, this is the book for you. i gained a lot of knowledge from this book, especially about prostitution in south america. highly recommended"},{"Title":"Global Sex Workers: Rights, Resistance, and Redefinition","review":"This book claims to want to show the 'nuance' of the sex trade, so therefore it must use complicated words such as 'debt bondage' to in fact describe what is an inhuman situation where people are threatened with death and beaten and raped in order to be forced to sell thier bodies to pay off a non-existent death. Essay after essay encouraged prostitution as 'sex work' and claims that if only all prostitution were legal there would be no sex-slave trade in young girls and no forced prostitution. This is strange becuase in the Netherlands, where prostitution is legal, it turns out there is just as much sex-slavery and beatings and rape. This book also tries to claim all the talk against prostitution and the sex slave trade is 'racist'. But how it is racist when Thai girls are sent to 'work' in Japan and Russian girls sent to Saudi Arabia and Columbian girls to Spain is not clear. It is racist in the sense that rich Europeans, Arabs and Japanese are the buyers, but that is not what the authors wrote.As typical of anything that is examined by academia this text has to dry all things down so nothing is ever what it seems. A woman who is raped at the age of 11 by wealthy 'clients' and kept chained to a bed for five years until she gets AIDS, this is called 'western sensationalism' and in addition is described as 'sex work' and 'debt bondage'.It is too bad that none of the authors of any of the essays experienced sex work first hand as one of trafficked people.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"The Deep Six","review":"The Atlantis crew is classed as mostly scum and the story makes me wonder if Dibner did serve with such a gang. The first part of the story focuses on internal strains that widen into serious cracks in morale and behavior. Long, grueling patrols at sea will do that. The captain himself has not yet been tested in battle and the reader wonders how he will function when his moment comes. When the ship actually engages the Japanese cruisers, flaws and heroes come flying into light of scrutiny. It's quite an epic, from beginning to end.All the Drowning Seas: The Nicholas Everard World War II Saga Book 3"},{"Title":"The Deep Six","review":"I had never heard of Martin Dibner and as usual, picked up this unknown 50's era paperback with some fear of it being a typical shallow WWII action book. Not to worry. The Deep Six, alhtough easy to read, was quite fulfilling as a great WWII war-at-sea piece. Excellent character studies, with plenty of flies in the ointment. I served several years of sea duty (in Cold War submarines), and it's obvious that so did the author (in the WWII environment, obviously).Briefly, this is about an aged heavy cruiser serving in WWII North Pacific. A hazardous mission, an untested captain, and a rather cast-off crew. I dare say that I found this novel to stand near the stature of Wouk's, The Caine Mutiny, or Monsarrat's, The Cruel Sea.Easy to recommend as a great WWII maritime read.

Assessing his situation, he once again takes notice of the spectacular show presented by the comet Saracen in the night sky.Corvino doesn't know it yet, but his life is about to get very complicated. First, the operation goes awry, resulting in the deaths of his entire team. Later, he's shot dead by a traitorous colleague, only to rise again as a zombie due to the strange radiation generated by Saracen. He wakes up in a world where humanity is on the verge of extinction due to the presence of sentient zombies who, enjoying near invulnerability, are rounding up those not affected for food. Corvino, one of the \\"lucky\\" zombies who can think for themselves, struggles with a gnawing hunger for human flesh even as he seeks vengeance against those who betrayed him. His vendetta against his ex-colleagues propels him towards a meeting with the book's other lead character, Washington DC policeman Nick Packard, an encounter sure to resonate with readers long after they finish the book.It's always reassuring to find that a book you enjoyed many years ago still holds up upon a subsequent rereading, which I'm pleased to report is the case with Wet Work, Philip Nutman's accomplished 1993 debut novel. Written in homage to Richard Matheson's masterpiece I am Legend, the novel is still, as my friends from New England might say, a \\"wicked good\\" read--one of the more readable, well crafted and innovative splatterpunk novels of the era, its plentiful action and \\"pedal to the metal\\" approach to gore and violence would make it memorable even if you didn't care about its cast so much. My only problem with this whole project is that it raises the question, what's Nutman been doing for thirteen years that's kept him from delivering other novels? Yes, he's written some comics, and he's been involved in various film projects, but it's a shame he never got around to publishing another novel--it certainly would have been interesting to see what he did next. Hopefully, this welcome reissue will spur some activity in this area."},{"Title":"Wet Work - The Definitive Edition","review":"A special ops team in Panama, who are on assignment against a cocaine cartel, have their mission go terribly wrong and many of them die. Corvino, the leader of the team is shot and killed by a shiftless team member. The situation seems bad, but then it gets worse.Corvino doesn't stay dead, due to the radiation form a comet called Saracen, he is becomes the walking dead. While world soon gets over populated with these Ravenous and unstoppable meat eaters. Corvino is a rare type of walking dead that can think, so he battles his natural \\"zombie\\" instincts while seeking revenge.Philip Nutman is not afraid to tell this story in raw and gory detail. This book is not the usual horror or tired old Zombie novel. He holds nothing back. His readers are witnesses to uncensored sexuality and intense scenes of violence, written in such graphic detail that they may actually wince at some of the things you \\"see\\". It is like looking at a terrible accident, you can't stand to look but you can't turn away.Philip really knows how to write a suspenseful scene. I have read many horror novels and seen hundreds of horror movies but this is the first book I have ever read, that had my heart beating in suspense and pulled me so deeply into the story. I was physically scared, of what was going to happen to a character at times, while I was reading it.I have not found many \\"horror\\" novels out there anymore than do more than just engage me in a good read. This one is one of the best I have read in more than a decade. His scene and character detail, paint such a realistic picture that you get absorbed into the story, sometimes you forget you are reading a book.His book will pull you in, and keep you on the edge of your seat while reading. There is enough action for adventure fans and enough suspense and gore to keep any hard core horror reader satisfied."},{"Title":"Wet Work - The Definitive Edition","review":"Expecting another great zombie book, and to my surprise is was much more. Not only did it have zombies(including weapons of all kinds, graphic death, and suspense)but it also had covert military action, great character development, intrigue, and several twists. My second review of a book. The first one was terrible, this one I was very happy with. Thank you Mr. Nutman."},{"Title":"Wet Work - The Definitive Edition","review":"Wet Work has a stately, elegiac grace to it. There is such deep, soulful writing, on the order of indeed the songs of Billy Holiday, as Nutman includes in the tapestry, festooned in this place. With gore and blood given a kind of beauty.The bitter fruit is had by us all really, as we have the need to cling to somebody who will get us out of this mess, and that would be Corvino, the walking dead who can think, is still a vestige of a person. It's fascinating to read the resurrection of the zombie mind, how it rebuilds itself and stops deconstructing in certain places and holds still.I think we have always wondered what happened if we could not age or could not die, if the body said wait, the pineal gland said no, and the body repelled the radical elements to destroy it. But what if this happened after you're dead and you can't help but be brought to life again. What would that be like? Nutman goes a long way in telling us. \`I think, above the great storytelling, the almost nostalgic splatterpunk passages, the bravura descriptions and characters, and that ability to tread the line between life and death in an almost Matheson/Romero like way, but in the author's own style, own world, is cause for celebration.There is a melancholy conscience here. It's not a violence for violence sake novel. Some of it is funny. All of it is gripping. But it has this late Saturday afternoon feel to it, like in Autumn, the sun going down early on, in the field of dead grass through which a child runs fast to home.With that thought in his head, maybe, home is not there any longer, but dead, and he only left alive. But that's wrong, Wet Work said the child running home is dead too. It is one of the most profoundly moving novels I have ever had. You think, somehow, the writer will pull us out of this.But it can not happen. It's too late. I think it is a story of deep thoughts and tears. And because we need to come to grips with all of this, we can only if we accept their cannibalism. And we do. Because of the things in this country that have happened, as they have, we now see proof positive, that he's right.We will eventually sooner or later accept with zombie non-thought, anything about somebody if we depend on them in some way, no matter how stupid and cruel they turned out to be, who justify anything and in that high executive office, cannibalism is church doctrine, for after a while, you forget, you get used to, and you are them.There is early on tender lovemaking, and then in gradations, the brutality beyond words. We're tied inside our bodies. The brain sits there like a huge gray wad of wrinkled chewing gum. In this ugly looking thing, is the greatest creation possibly there is, and it blithely lets itself be leisurely destroyed while figuring out constellations.This is a novel of the ultimate terror. Ourselves. The language is lovely and places seem so real so touchable. And we think, as this novel slides us into an apocalyptic snake pit, we still have the ability to conjure and to dream, dragged down to the vestiges of the lowest of the geek sideshow. As the cities of people are wrapped in the shrouds of everyone in the world as we face that final shadow where we close our eyes forever, and then eyes open, wake up.So here still and not us any longer. So many writers of horror traffic in degradation and extreme violence and don't understand that this is a living thing gone dead and come back in a mockery, a monstrous meat puppet Punch and Judy show, and leave it at that.But some writers are eloquent and see so much, I can't imagine reading this novel without thinking how vulnerable, and how subject to anything in any moment now horrible, we are, that it makes you want to hold everybody in the world because you know what is ahead for them, and try not to think what is ahead for you and the persons you love. And now back to the show."},{"Title":"The Wrong Mr. Wright (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"As a rule, I usually like Regency novels by Patricia Bray because of the care she takes to develop the both the primary and secondary characters in her novels, the budding romance/relationship between the hero and the heroine, and because she almost never reverts to 21st century language colloquialisms. True, her plots are usually a rather straightforward read, with very few twists in plot-lines. However, her books are also so well written, that this small lack is seldom really felt by the reader. &quot;The Wrong Mr. Wright&quot; falls into the usual mold of a Patricia Bray Regency romance; and it is a well written, engrossing (when it deals with the relationship between Diana and Stephen) and enjoyable read. However, I was surprised to find that Bray had Diana behaving in a manner, in the latter half of the book anyway, that was not at all consistent with her character!Stephen Wright, Viscount of Endicott, is beginning to enjoy the peace and quiet of life without his troublesome younger half-brother, George, when he receives some rather unwelcome news. It seems that just before George left England, he had found time to seriously compromise a young lady, who has since left London in disgrace. Stephen is appalled. He has spent much of his adulthood pulling George out of scrapes and paying his bills and debts. But this latest stunt beats all. Being an honourable man, Stephen immediately makes for the young lady's home in Kent in order to offer her his hand in marriage. He is quite surprised then when Diana Somerville (the young lady in question) refuses his offer of marriage. Diana has no desire to be married at this point, and certainly not to the brother of the man who had so seriously compromised her reputation. However, both Stephen and her parents convince her to agree to a sham engagement, if only to restore her reputation (and that of her family's), with the stipulation that Diana be allowed to cry off the engagement after a suitable period of time. And so in no time at all, Diana finds herself back in London, this time as the fiance of the Viscount of Endicott. And while she never expected to find herself engaged to so cautious and reserved a gentleman as Stephen Wright, Diana begins to appreciate his many sterling qualities -- his dependability and his honour in particular. And then George returns to London. Will George's return mean trouble for Stephen and Diana? Stephen cannot help but worry about what George's next move will be even as he faces the fact that he has fallen in love with the spirited Diana and would like very much to make their sham betrothal real.And all in all, &quot;The Wrong Mr. Wright&quot; was a really enjoyable read -- especially when it the novel was dwelling on the developing relationship between Stephen and Diana. Bray does a really good job of allowing us to see that these two are meant for each other, and bringing their 'real' characters to the fore. The thing I didn't get however, was why after having presented Diana as an extremely intelligent and astute young woman, Patricia Bray would make her heroine suddenly susceptible to George's machinations? It is difficult to be more explicit in my criticism without giving too much of the plot away. However, take my word for it, Diana's decision to listen to George would not at all be keeping with her character, esp given what she had previously suffered at his hands earlier in the book. And this incongruity niggled at me so much that it quite distracted me from totally enjoying the novel. Which was a shame, because incongruity aside, this was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Wrong Mr. Wright (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Interesting storyline but the contact and conversation between the two brothers was more interesting than the romance.Stephen, Lord Endicott is faced with righting another of his brother's scandals. George Wright (Stephen's half-brother) has ruined an innocent lady, Diana Somerville all on a dare. We find out later the attempted rape is not completed, but I felt that was glossed over. Stephen feels compelled to ask for Diana's hand since George has fled the country. Diana is an interesting character - not really concerned over her lost reputation but living in a fantasy world where she will set out to become a world traveler and adventuress when she reaches her majority.Diana's family and Lord Endicott come up with a scheme to have a sham engagement. It will restore Diana's reputation (how?)and will be over at the end of the season. Of course in true Regency style both fall in love and begin to wish the betrothal is a reality.The problem with the story is that I felt no real affection between Stephen and Diana. Oh some of the correct words are spoken but nothing that made my heart swell. Another problem is that Diana meets George (the bad brother) later and experiences none of the outrage or fear I think a normal woman would feel towards the man who attempted to rape her. Also there is no resolution to the trouble created by Stephen's stepmother and half-brother. Diana never really finds out what Stephen's real feelings about them are.A nice note is that Stephen (though browbeaten to do it) takes Diana on a few adventures, teaching her to drive a rig, talking about taking her on a boat, bringing her to lectures about the Amazon and ascending with her in a hot air balloon. All of these \\"adventures\\" lead her to decide risking life and limb was not all that enjoyable after all.An ok read but other \\"brother stand-in\\" Regencies (which is a rather common theme) have been handled better."},{"Title":"Embryology","review":"The BRS for Embryology was a supplemental text that I found incredibly helpful.

Desperate to escape an arranged marriage, she flees to North Carolina to find her real father--and is shattered to learn he was killed in the Civil War. All that remains is his rundown farm, but Kerry is determined to rebuild her life. Then handsome, mysterious Slade Dillon arrives, staking his claim on her land...and her heart.Though Slade's right to the land is irrefutable, the two are ordered by a judge into a rebellious coexistence made all the more stormy by an undeinable attraction that turns days into a class of wills--and nights into sleepless hours of unfulfilled longing. But when Kerry hires freed slaves and incurs the wrath of local vigilantes, Slade fears for her safety. Now, an unfolding drama of secrets and danger draw him closer to the inescapable truth--and the knowledge that he will risk his heart and his life to claim a love as powerful as it is undeniable...And my review:The very reason why another reviewer liked this book is the same reason why I didn't like it. I didn't feel that this was a romance. This was historical fiction with a romance tacked on. The author spent the better part of the book with the hero and heroine apart, and unaware of each other's existence. She spent so much time setting the stage for the characters, I started to despair of her ever actually beginning the romance. I read romance to watch the sparks fly. That's pretty difficult when they aren't even on the same continent! Or even know of each other's existence!Whether or not you like this book depends on just how much romance you expect from a romance novel. If you don't mind historical fiction that has a little romance thrown in for extra spice, then you might like this. If you are like me, and want the main focus of the novel to be on the developing relationship between the hero and the heroine, you're going to be disappointed. Don't let the cover fool you. The romance aspect of this novel takes forever to get going."},{"Title":"Professional Development of Exercise Physiology (Studies in Health and Human Services)","review":"This book revolutionized my thinking about my field, Exercise Physiology.

In this concise book, Norman aims to acquaint readers with the essential features of important moral philosophers, provide a critical evaluation of these ideas, lead readers through the process of critically evaluating ideas, and sketching an outline of what would constitute an acceptable moral theory. The last is an aim that is well beyond the confines of most textbooks and is quite interesting. The book falls into 3 parts; the work of the Ancients - Plato and Aristotle; the now classic moderns - Hume, Kant, Mill, and Hegel (seen largely through the lens of his British disciple Bradley); and 20th century work, mainly the Anglo-American tradition. There is a chapter on Nietsche, which serves as a reminder of other possible perspectives. Norman's explications of the Ancients and 20th century work is particularly good. I find the sections on Hume and Kant less satisfactory. The quality of explanation is not as good as the other chapters. This is the one section of the book where Norman's aims of providing a critique of ideas and outlining the characteristics of an acceptable moral theory tend to overpower the strictly explanatory aim. This is not a major flaw. I think Norman also makes some small but significant errors. In his discussion of Hume's views on property, he ignores the fact that historians suggest that property had a somewhat different meaning in the 18th century, including not just possessions but also aspects of character, reputation, and even rights. I think as well that Norman is incorrect in some of his statements about the important contemporary philosopher John Rawls. Norman wants his readers to be actively engaged in thinking about this issues and his goal of outlining the grounds for an acceptable moral theory is a challenge to readers. This is an unusual but effective teaching method."},{"Title":"The Moral Philosophers: An Introduction to Ethics","review":"Richard Norman is an interesting moral philosopher in his own right. His work on just war theory in this nuclear age is of note. This book, which purports to be an introductory ethics primer, is written at a rather sophisticated level - really, at one step beyond some of the more popular introductory texts - However, the thicker prose does not obviate its value.The book focuses on the major moral theorists (which is where, I believe, the focus ought to be in an introductory course) and gives a brief - but reasonably sufficient history of the development of moral theory. While Norman does not ignore metaethical (moral epistemic and psychological) issues, he does not delve too deeply, and he barely touches on specific applications of theory (applied ethics).I personally, much prefer his work on the Moderns and compared with the Ancients. The chapters on Hume and Mill, where the development of utilitarianism is discussed are first rate. Also, an unsual bonus, and rather prescient on the writer's part, is the inclusion of a full chapter discussing Hegel's moral theory, rarely found in such general history of ethics approaches. Norman presents a cogent and important argument for such an inclusion. The last two chapters on contemporary ethics provide a solid and useful, if clipped and, at points, somewhat superficial, quick overview of issues in moral theory in the twentieth century.When all is said and done, one can find better introductions to the moral theories of the Greeks and Kant, but the readings on the Utilitarians, Utilitarianism, and their contemporary crtics, make the book more than worth reading, and a useful classroom text for more advanced students."},{"Title":"Rub-a-Dub, Pooh","review":"My two and a half year old loves this book so much that she memorized it and loves to &quot;read&quot; it to us.

In addition, they focus mainly on theoretical concepts and do not provide adequate worked examples. Haberman's text is immensely useful both in bridging the gap between elementary and advanced books as well as in providing many, many completely worked problems. Indeed once you have had a basic course in PDEs you could use this text to teach yourself graduate-level topics such as Green's functions.I do not try to convey the impression that this is a mere cookbook - \\"here's a problem, let's look up the solution\\". To the contrary. Haberman provides the motivation for each kind of mathematical treatment and interprets his results, pointing out their important consequences. His presentation of Gibbs' phenomenon is the most clear and comprehensive I have yet come across.I heartily recommend this book especially to Math and Physics seniors who hope to continue on to graduate school in either of these subjects. In either case, it is expected of you to be adept at Green's functions and Haberman's book lays the groundwork for this topic."},{"Title":"Applied Partial Differential Equations","review":"I have taught a graduate level \\"mathematical methods for engineers\\" course (or any of the similar name permutations) for many years. My course is essentially a two-semester course in PDEs with associated topics thrown in: it is truly a combination of PDEs with engineering physics problems. I have struggled to find a satisfactory text and have tried many different ones in the process. I find Haberman is ultimately the best choice. Perusing the reviews, I am not surprised to see the criticisms there. This subject matter is sometimes to obscure for engineering/physics students but too superficial (e.g. lacking in proofs and formalism) for purists in mathematics. It's a tough line to walk and nothing is perfect out there. My opinion is that Haberman does a very nice job balancing the physics with an appropriate amount of mathematical detail. Are there topics I'd like to see that aren't? Sure, but that's always going to be true. The all-inclusive text would be multiple volumes and a thousand pages and probably still some would complain important topics are left out.The closest other text is the PDE text by Nakhle Asmar (I've used that too for a couple of years). It spends more time on special functions and is nice in that regard. However, it definitely falls short in important categories, most notable the whole topic of Greens functions is not introduced.Update Fall 2012: First, it was pointed out that the new version of Asmar does include some Greens function content. Second, in the course I teach I have now incorporated spherical harmonics as a significant module. Haberman doesn't cover this at all whereas Asmar does a nice job. If this topic is important to you take note of this limitation."},{"Title":"Applied Partial Differential Equations","review":"This book succeeds at making PDEs accessible to a wide audience. As the title applies, it is extremely applied in flavour. Mathematics and mathematical physics students, given the choice, should look elsewhere.An overarching feature of the book is its mathematical simplicity - very much in the vein of modern introductory calculus texts. This book neglects to introduce any tools of mathematical analyis. As a result, it is accessible to students unfamiliar with analysis. Consequently, most theorems can only be stated, not proven. Now, the theory of Fourier series is advanced and its neglect is understandable. However, this text neglects to define even basic types of convergence (uniform, mean). As a result, Chapter 3, on Fourier series, is basically the presentation of a cookbook set of rules regarding operating on Fourier series. Chapter 5, on Sturm-Liouville theory, becomes a set of statements of the various theorems, with practical applications such as proving the positivity of eigenvalues of the heat equation and \\"showing\\" completeness of the eigenfunctions (though this isn't proved, just stated).Although the authors note their intent to show the connection of PDEs to physics, this book doesn't make a very good \\"mathematical physics\\" textbook, for several reasons. Among these is the above-mentioned neglect of discussions of convergence. The book is also neglects discussion of orthogonal polynomials or functions (Bessel and Legendre functions appear in Ch. 7, on higher-dimensional PDEs, but the treatment is cursory and not unified in a general discussion of orthogonal functions). Also, in many cases the book limits itself to real-valued functions, and uses awkward notation for complex conjugation, Hermitian conjugate, etc., in the rare cases these appear. There is negligible discussion of the use of contour integration or conformal mapping in the solution of PDEs - contour integrals are briefly introduced in Chapter 13 in the context of inverting the Laplace transform.Serious math and physics students will also be irritated by the exposition in this text. A chapter typically begins by considering a PDE, then introducing tools (solution of boundary value problems, Fourier series, orthogonality relationships) in an ad hoc manner. Personally, I found this somewhat irritating: it lacks brevity, elegance, and good organization. However, it does explain how to solve a given problem.On the other hand, the book does cover an interesting variety of topics, including Green's functions, Laplace transforms, and dispersive waves and nonlinear PDEs. These are of course introductory glances at these subjects.There is a brief chapter on numerical methods. I didn't look at this carefully, but it seems like a very sketch of how to solve PDEs numerically which would need to be supplemented. A brief section is devoted to the finite element method. The Crank-Nicholson scheme, so important in physics, receives a paragraph.Ultimately, I would recommend this book for those who need to learn about basic applied PDEs. Those with some background in analysis, or who need a deeper understanding of the subject, should seek a more rigorous and detailed exposition."},{"Title":"Applied Partial Differential Equations","review":"A good text to begin learning PDE with- I looked at two other books and preferred learning from this one over the others. The notation is clear, the worked examples are enough to get you started without baby-stepping through everything. Challenging hw problems, and the lessons are well laid out."},{"Title":"Applied Partial Differential Equations","review":"I used a very very large part of this book in my first year of graduate school and I haven't meet such a CLEARLY written book on the topic of applied partial differential equations (PDEs). The author develops various methods of solving problems of PDEs in a highly pedagogical and reasonable manner. Sometimes there may be a few (only!)\\"dark points\\" in the development of the subject, but with some effort on the side of the reader every step seems ultimately reasonable (especially if the reader goes through those special points more than once). The background of an undergraduate physics student is more or less enough for a thorough study of Haberman's book (besides that, things that may seem unfamiliar to the reader are touched in separate supplements dispersed all over the book). There are also plenteous unsolved exercises throughout the book, some of them accompanied by an answer. The reader may notice that there are not many examples given by the author, but this is highly mitigated by the smoothness and clearness of the presentation of the related theory or method - in other words, even if sometimes there is not any solved example ... I can safely re-assure that you will be able to implement the stuff you learned and go directly to the unsolved problems (this is something that happens only with very few books out there!). Concluding I need to say that this book will probably not satisfy mathematicians since it lacks what is usually defined as \\"mathematical rigor\\" - the main purpose of the book is to teach a whole array of methods for tackling PDEs as well as present the underlying idea behind each and every method, starting with simple ideas/methods in the beginning and going towards more and more sophisticated methods at a later stage. Highly recommended for those who want to learn the technical part of PDEs!"},{"Title":"Applied Partial Differential Equations","review":"Decent textbook.

If this book could include some of those worked examples, it would be much better.The book also uses slightly different notation from that of many other books."},{"Title":"Applied Partial Differential Equations","review":"I used this book for my class in second semester Engineering Math and then liking this book so much i decided to read the other half of the book that my class didn't cover so I'm compelled to write this review as I've pretty much (gladly) covered everything this book has to offer.The first 8 Chapters of this book (my class used) i'll probably summarize as 'Heat and Wave equation' since though going through many different methods, the analysis goes back to those equations. The other half of the book is a bit more interesting but may not be as detailed as the previous chapters. Here i will summarize each chapterCh 1: Heat EquationStraight forward discussion of physical phenomenon of the diffusion equation in up to 3 dimensions and use of Laplacian in spherical coordinates.Ch 2: Method of Separation of VariablesThe main point of the book in my opinion. Treatment of more physical phenomenon. Laplace's equation with rectangular, circular boundary values.Ch 3: Fourier SeriesBasic treatment of Fourier Series. Light treatment of eigenfunction expansion using Fourier series. Sine/Cosine series.Ch 4: Wave EquationPhysical derivation of vertically vibrating string. Vibrating membrane, Snell's Law and Total internal reflection treatment.Ch 5: Sturm-Liouville Eigenvalue ProblemsSL Eigenvalue problems, Review of boundary conditions with first, second, third and periodicity conditions applied to the Heat and Wave equation. Rayleigh quotient (minimization principle) and Green's formula. Simple matrix eigenvalue problems. Self-Adjoint Operators. SL Asymptotic behavior. Parseval's inequalityCh 6: Finite Difference Numerical Methods for PDEsSkipped in my course and i can see why due to time constraints, perfect for dwelling into numerical PDE schemes in computing programs. A decent treatment of numerical partial differential equations and stability considerations. Richardson, Crank-Nicholson schemes. Jacobi iteration method and S-O-R method for small error approximation. Small treatment of Finite Element method.Ch 7: Higher Dimensional PDEsThe more general treatment and my favorite though it is mostly a repetition of previous methods in higher dimensions and more geometries like cylinder. Bessel's differential equation and asymptotic properties. Spherical problems and Legendre functions.Ch 8: Nonhomogenous ProblemsPreviously stated general methods, but nonhomogenous. Probably the more interesting point of this book.At this point i started self-teaching from the book myself and the class ended. The derivations of some proofs became more scarce as the book progressed which mainly made me spend more time trying to derive equations or searching derivations in other books or the internet.Ch 9: Green's Functions for Time-Independent ProblemsA very example based way of treating Green's functions at first. Variation of parameters. Method of images for Electromagnetics. Small section on perturbed eigenvalue problems. Good examples, though i learned more qualitative information in 2 pages of Bender's Mathematical Methods book than i did in an entire chapter of examples in this one.Ch 10: Infinite Domain Problems: Fourier Transform Solutions of PDEsVarious Fourier transform properties in PDEs. As stated, infinite domain variants on the problems. Small section on Scattering phenomenon.Ch 11: Green's Functions for Wave and Heat equationsReciprocity. General solution using Green's formula (probably the more important point for Green's functions). Adjoint nature of operators.Ch 12: The Method of Characteristics for Linear and Quasilinear Wave EquationsAn exampled based treatment of characteristics method. A sketching technique an initial value wave equation. Decent treatment of Traffic Flow differential equations. First order nonlinear equation characteristic solutions.Ch 13: Laplace Transform Solution of PDEsLaplace Transform properties in PDEs. Not much different from the Fourier Transform if you only want to know one of the two transform method to solve equations. Cauchy's residue theorem examples. Small section on complex variables for Wave Equation using Laplace Transform.Ch 14: Dispersive Waves: Slow Variations, Stability, Nonlinearity, and Perturbation MethodsOne of the few reasons i kept reading this book. Of course due to the length of such topics it is unlikely to find rigorous treatments of these subjects in a small amount of space so a lot of these subjects are treated using examples. Certain theorems for stability are simply stated without proof which is nice for a memory jog but not good if you expect any sort of derivation. Covers Korteweg-de Vries equation with small section on group velocity and Water waves. Wave guides and mode propagation treatment with some application to Fiber Optics. Method of stationary phase. Slowly varying dispersive waves with some analysis on Caustics. Nonlinear Dispersive waves and Schrodinger equation. Stability considerations using sets of rules for types of bifurcation points with some analysis into Hopf bifurcation of Complex Ginzburg Landau equation. Multiple scale perturbation method using examples. Boundary layer method treatment.The solution's manual for this book has some very non rigorous solutions and are sometimes very hard to follow especially for Ch 8 and 9 though i did not check much for the rest of the book since the treatments were very simple, but otherwise provide good ways to check yourself. I did a lot of checking through other books and problems when i took this class mostly due to the applied nature of this book it was not always easy to get the understanding of a general treatment but as the title says, it is an applied book. So even though the generality is minor, there are many examples to balance that and many interesting applications to follow if you read thoroughly. I started reading this book to get more methods and treatments to solve PDEs in quantum mechanics and various PDEs in General Physics and Engineering and i have to say this book was a very fine read. If you do the problems, you can safely advance to some more advanced topics such as Green's functions and Stability. I love the cover of this book as well as it stands out glossy and polished compared to my other books and the page quality is also very nice. I'm happy to have this book on my shelf and i would definitely recommend it for anyone wanting an applied treatment of PDEs, though for highly rigorous treatments i would definitely look elsewhere, this book's title says it clearly."},{"Title":"Applied Partial Differential Equations","review":"Took two semesters of PDE's and this was used for the 2nd semester course.

It gets into the nitty gritty of addiction: the beginning, peak, end, the highs, the lows, and the recovery. I was really skeptical about this book; it being written by Crowley (a well known occultist), but this story doesn't really touch upon the occult, it sticks to the subject matter and the nature of human will. A good book overall, I Highly recommend to anymore dealing with substance abuse or knows someone dealing with substance abuse"},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"This novel by Aleister Crowley deals with drug use, abuse and addiction. Two people go on a heroin and cocaine binge. Most potential readers of this book who use drugs are not intelligient enough to read this, so it found its place amongst occultists. Crowley was a drug user and an icon amongst other users. I've seen several detractors from Crowley who cite that he was a junkie. To blow him off as a junkie is nonsense as Crowley is the most important person in modern magickal theory due to sheer size and quality of his work.

I'm also interested in the occult and Aleister Crowley's ideas. This book has appeal to those beyond the occult standpoint. Every druggie kid would love this book. I've recommended it to friends of mine into drugs. Basicly, it's about these people who go on a heroin and cocaine binge. They call heroin H. and cocaine C. Crowley had a masterful understanding of the English language and the subject matter. Years of drug abuse made him bloated in his later years. This book is one of the best from the Master Therion. If you do drugs, get this book, it's that simple."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"Crowley&#65533;s fictionalized account of two druggies who go on a dope spree throughout Europe. When the two run out of money and dope, the fun ends. But then they meet &#65533;King Lamus&#65533; who shows them Thelemic magic, and all is well. The thing is, this is INDEED a work of fiction, and if you try the things mentioned in the book, you will wind up a junkie and a burnout, instead of just an occult geek.Crowley practiced an amalgam religion of all sorts of occult hogwash. His main inspiration came from ancient novel titled &#65533;Gargantua&#65533; by a rebel monk named Rabelais from the 15th century or so. In the novel, the monks only had one commandment: DO WHAT THOU WILL. Years later, Crowley would claim his &#65533;guardian angel&#65533; told him to start a religion called &#65533;Thelema&#65533; (the same name as the abbey in Gargantua) with the same commandment. Obviously the whole story about the &#65533;Preternatural&#65533; being that gave Crowley Liber Al Vel Legis...and thus all of Thelema...is a hoax. Crowley was a nut case that claimed to be a Scottish laird, an M.D., and many other ridiculous lies. Even though his followers know he lied about everything imaginable, they nonetheless pour over his gobbledygook trying to unlock the secrets of the &#65533;Aeon of Horus&#65533; and such. I knew a girl who was heavily into Wicca and Crowley. She thought she could develop her will to where she could take drugs and not get addicted, just like in Crowley&#65533;s writings. She died from a drug overdose (after going in and out of rehab) at age 26 and left a husband and 2 kids behind. The thing is, Crowley could never do it himself. He died a penniless drug addict in a flophouse. Learn from this example. &#65533;...success is your proof...&#65533; Liber Al Vel Legis Buy the book for a laugh anyway."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"Diary of a Drug Fiend is a brilliant novel based on the life of Alister Crowley himself and was one of the best documented books on addiction that I have ever read. Set in the 1920's, when drug addiction wasnt really talked about. Peter and Lou, get married, travel across Europe on a cocaine and heroin bender experiment in the hopes of setting their genious free. Much like Nietzche, Crowley talks about the darkness to which we are born and he has some very insightful and thought provoking ideas on this topic. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is questioning their own existence."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"A Beautiful book, useful for any man women or child interested in the esoteric or wanting to explore the mind of the addict.

I'm reading it now for the second time. Crowley is a fascinating writer, and this book would be great for most people to read. It has some nice insights into human behavior, and would probably be quite helpful for anyone trying to understand addiction. It would also be good for someone who is just looking for an entertaining book."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"Aleister Crowley is best known for his books and essays on magick (it was he who coined that spelling), but he also wrote several works of fiction. Diary of a Drug Fiend may be his best novel, even though it is in many ways more a platform for his ideas and techniques than a conventional novel.The novel takes place in Europe, mainly England, around the 1920s. This was apparently the time when drugs such as cocaine and heroin were just becoming illegal and socially unacceptable. The story concerns a young couple, Peter and Lou, who fall in love, both with each other and with cocaine and heroin. Crowley, who had considerable experience with drugs himself, is very effective at describing the euphoria of people experiencing drugs for the first time. Their lives are utterly transformed in an almost mystical way. Of course, the body quickly develops an increasing appetite for these powerful substances, and soon more and more is needed. Soon after that comes the inevitable crash, when the addict must take huge quantities just to feel normal and goes through hellish withdrawal when drugs are not available.In addition to the physical addiction, Diary of a Drug Fiend shows how the addict's overall judgment is clouded. Peter easily falls victim to a con man, and soon the couple are facing a shortage of money. They are only rescued by the intervention of a mysterious man called King Lamus, who is a thinly disguised version of Crowley. What makes this book interesting, and different from other books that deal with addiction, is that the real point is to show the power of the will to overcome any problem. According to this view, which adherents of modern 12 step programs will not take kindly to, there is nothing special about addiction. It's simply one way people can lose sight of their \\"true will,\\" to put it in Crowley's terminology. \\"Do What Thou Wilt Shall Be the Whole of the Law\\" was one of Crowley's favorite sayings, and it is repeated often in this book. The meaning, as is made clear, is not to simply do what you want or to follow your whims. That is how the couple in this novel end up addicted to cocaine and heroin. It means, rather, to follow your Will, which means living up to your highest potential, fulfilling your destiny or becoming one with your Higher Self, to put it in other terms.Diary of a Drug Fiend is an enjoyable, if not a great novel; in some ways it's rather didactic, especially towards the end. Still, even someone who is not particularly interested in Crowley or magick could find the descriptions of the couple's descent into addiction and madness compelling. Crowley says in the introduction that the events depicted are all true. How true they are we may never know, but it is a fact that Crowley set up a kind of community in the Mediterranean called The Abbey of Thelema. The last few chapters of the novel depict a kind of idyllic life where people discover and live according to King Lamus' magical instructions. What Crowley did here, both in the novel and real life, is to try to set up a kind of laboratory of the spirit where people are led to reach their highest potential. At various times, other spiritual teachers, such as Gurdjieff and Rajneesh (both as controversial as Crowley in their own ways) established communities of their own. Whether Crowley succeeded or not is still hotly debated, but Diary of a Drug Fiend gives a compelling summary of many of his ideas. It is also an entertaining read with a style more accessible than Crowley's nonfiction books."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"i first heard about aleister crowley in the led zeppelin bio,Hammer of the Gods,i think it was, and Jimmy Page's literal fascination with this guy.being a big Page and Zep fan i had to see what all the fuss was about.this,my first experience with crowley,turned out to be WELL worth the price i paid for this book.some times i have a hard time getting through a novel,but had no problems what-so-ever with this.it's a 1920's book about Crowley's fascination with his wife-to-be,heroin and cocaine and magik.never before had i read such a detailed account of these subjects before.it's a shame that Crowley hasn't gotten the recognition for his writing that he deserves.if not for Jimmy Page i might never had heard of him.hats off to jimmy!"},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"This is one of the great English language novels of the 20th century. The sheer beauty of language in this book raises it to the level of poetry.

With still all the recreational drug problems ,of another young generation of people,this book remains largely and sadly forgotten.It should be required high school reading,for health class, english class or sociology class."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"Although the style is a little dated the message and story are fresh as only Uncle can make them.

It probably could have been edited down a bit. It might take some time to get into but it's definitely worth it, especially if you have an interest in Crowley & pharmacology.This is not necessarily a \\"Just Say No\\" book. Crowley most definitely describes how good drugs can feel. But then he describes how addiction can control and ruin a person. He honestly describes the celestial highs & infernal lows.This is a \\"Just Have Will Power\\" book--\\"Do What Thou Wilt Shall Be the Whole of the Law.\\" Rather than telling you never to use drugs, he describes what can happen if they are misused.Crowley describes a brilliant method of overcoming addiction: distancing yourself from your desire, dissociating with it. Crowley advises the addict to be aware of drug cravings and to laugh at them, to simply analyse your craving and marvel at it, rather than immediately giving in to temptation. \\"Hmm, how strange that I my body should want this drug so badly. Interesting.\\" In this way the Higher Will dissociates from the addicted flesh. Withdrawal symptoms are analysed and dissected as the spasms of a sick body, while the Will acts to carry the body into freedom from substances.From what I recall, I am not sure that Crowley was able to take his own advice; I think he struggled with heroin and tobacco abuse for the rest of his life, after writing this book. I may be wrong though, do your own research.All in all, this was a great book with a unique viewpoint on overcoming addictions in order to attain freedom."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"Drug use and abuse is a common enough theme in today's society. Yet Crowley's novel is still compelling for its detailed description of the effects of various drugs on the body and mind over time.The storyline is interesting, and anyone knowing anything of Crowley's life will have fun trying to put real names to the characters (I think Crowley wrote himself into the novel in at least two of the main characters). The cure of addiction is of great importance to many, and Crowley's ideas on the subject are worth considering. The novel also serves as a good introduction to some of the main ideas of Thelema.I think the novel is a brilliant case study of both the psychology leading to addiction, and the recovery process required to achieve a cure."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend is not just any work of fiction - it is a novel created by legendary scholar and chronicler of Magick Aleister Crowley. Drawing upon Crowley's own life experience, including his involvement with drugs, The Diary of a Drug Fiend tells of the lovers Peter Pendragon and Louise Laleham, who travel through Europe binging on cocaine and heroin. Their drug use brings them visions and prophecies, but it also turns to excruciation once their supply runs dry and the brutal grip of their addiction threatens to consume their lives utterly. With the aid of King Lamus, a master adept, they apply practical Magick as a means to transcend their drug addiction. Originally published in 1922, The Diary of a Drug Fiend was once denounced as \\"a book for burning\\"; now, it remains a profound testimony and insight to the forces that inspired, drove, and challenged its legendary author. A choice pick for metaphysical and Magickal studies shelves."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"Of all the things that A.C. wrote, this was the one thing that i actually found a place for amongst my private thoughts. It told a story of addiction and how life intersected this by-way of pleasure and pain, and it had a real appeal to it. You could tell that the story was one that dipped into the life of the writer in a very deep way, and it told a story that really had meaning. Unlike many of the other questionable writings that the Great Beast put to paper, this one didn't seem to have some hidden agenda wrapped inside of it. It didn't have a place where some sort of ritualistic taboos were hidden away, and it didn't have some pathway leading toward the Abbey that people have now turned into a shrine. It reached beyond all of that and spoke from somewhere that might have been silenced if the writer hadn't experienced, but the writer had tocuh and felt and many of the things here were painful harbingers of truth.Had I not been given this book by someone else, I probably wouldn't have read it. I hate saying that, too, but the truth of the matter is that I have read many of the other books put out by the same person and the things behind it really didn't do anything for me. They were too smeared nad beaten, too broken and flooded with controversy that became that for the sake of being controversial, and I know that might turn away others as well. If that is a fear that one has or it is something that a person dreads because of the stance the author has taken on many subjects, it isn't one to concern yourself with. As the name of the book implies, it is a diary of someone that really needed help and told about the avenues that lead there.I recommend this book simply because of the honest to it and because it was written by someone who had been there. Much like a private war, it had to be written by a soldier and not a journalist, and I thought that was one of the reasons it was so good. It merits a lot of praise because of this and more, and a lot of things about the writer have to be overlooked just ot see that picture clearly. Regardless of how you feel about the person behind the mask, read the wording here and you'll see that it has meaning. Basically, if the title speaks to you, then the book will do so as well."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"Aleister Crowley's Diary of a Drug Fiend is an excellent account of two cocaine addicts progression from innocence into addiction's deepest hells, and salvation through the will. A true story, you are taken along each step of the way by one of two narrators, Peter or Lou Pendragon, from their meeting, to their \\"cocaine honeymoon,\\" to their heroin addiction, and, at last, their defying the medical beliefs of a post Victorian Europe by breaking addiction without the help of a medical facility.I strongly recommend this book to anyone suffering from addiction of any sort, as well as people open minded enough to truly appreciate what Crowley has to say. I would also recommend it to students of the occult, as it serves as an excellent introduction to the Doctrine of Thelema."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"This book is fantastic. It's written in a clear, unassuming style that perfectly suites the novel's racy, drug crazed ambience. It's obvious the author knew his subject intimately, as the descriptions of the drug experience are both vivid and personal. And unlike Crowley's other novel, Moonchild, the author never looses sight of his plot and character development here by sidetracking his readers with arrogant lectures.The last section of the novel, where the addicts are cured of their drug habit via Magick and True Will, does spoil things a bit. It left me with the impression that Crowley used the novel merely as a way of conveying his spiritual beliefs. But this section in itself is fascinating and in no way interferes with the overall thrust of the novel. Great stuff."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"I read this book when I was 15, without purpose, but later on when I was involved with drugs I could remember this book,and the lessons involved.

King Lamus offers to help them whenever they are ready for it. I have mixed feelings about his ideas on rehab. I disagree with the back cover's claim that magick is involved, but that's just my personal view.There is some interesting poetry scattered throughout the story. Most is pretty good and very strange at times.I don't think I can say much more that the other reviewers haven't already said.I originally got this book because a girl I admired suggested it when we met for lunch.

A good book if your interested in the Occult and/or Magic and you have experienced the effects of Cocaine Hydrochride in your brain until you went insane! If you never used drugs I doubt you'll really understand this book; but I think that you should read it anyway to become more educated on the effects of drugs (if you've never used them).

There is a reason that Crowley is not amongst the giants of the English language. He was certainly brilliant and his control of the English language was as perfect as one could imagine it to be. But something is lacking in this otherwise compelling story. Something isn't quite there. That something is hard to pinpoint. It seems to be a work incomplete. Or rather, it was completed but the completion followed the flawed and incorrect path.The first two books are works of artistic genius. They are books that truly demonstrate the ecstasy and insanity of drug-use (all of it is true to my more or less limited experience). The experience is a perfectly vicarious experience into a strange world of drug addiction and drug joy. But the journey does not end at the nostril. It also paints a picture of a radically different time. The places are all familiar, but an imprint of the 1920s is engraved at the foreground.The story is one of an independently wealthy man and his newfound wife embarking on a tumultuous journey catalyzed by the combined engines of heroin and cocaine. Lou and Peter (the dazed couple) dive into a colorful world of transcendental bliss and super-human emotion. They dive into this world until it consumes them from both the outside and the inside.The addiction ceases to be exciting and enjoyable, but rather becomes a force of habit and it is up to a brusque magician to break the horrid spell of addiction, but not of causal use. The message at the end of the day is to use drugs but not to abuse drugs.Certainly the book is an experience to read,until the third section, titled Purgatorio, where Crowley's ideas of the True Will become revealed. It is not that the ideas are impeding the artistic merit of the work, but rather that the final section of the book suffers from being far less interesting and exciting than the first two sections. It becomes somewhat impotent, bringing up canonical law of Thelema, rather than vivid and edifying imagery.All in all, the book is worth a read, but if you were to stop reading 50 pages from the finish then I would not say that you would have missed any moments of true genius or interest."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"The unrepentant Mage Aleister Crowley has here writ besides the FIRST self-help book on Heroin &amp; Cocaine addiction, also the BEST! The Master-Therion does nothing less than psychologically maneuver the reader into a defenseless position and throw needles at them! Entirely correct that to the intellectually-minded and philosophically-disposed person, there is NOTHING like HEROIN addiction to brutally test the limits and bounds of their mind's total capacity! Crowley has 35 years of experience under his witch hat when it comes to what he called the three kings-&quot;smo, drin, &amp; fuc&quot;- and an education at Cambridge and Trinity to back him up. If you doubt his erudition for any reason simply consult his 900-plus page autohagiography. The 370 page novel was dictated by the Occult Master to the Scarlet Woman, Leah Hirsig in just 27 days, 12 &amp; 3/4 hrs. beginning on June 4th, 1922. It is dedicated in part to his youngest daughter, ASTARTE, which points to his sincerity in writing what is essentially autobiographical enough to consider part of his Confessions. Crowley had the gall &amp; wit to take as his example Dante's 'Divine Comedy', partitioned off in three parts of the same triptych: PARADISO, INFERNO, &amp; PURGATORIO, which affords him to delineate all these aspects of what it is to be a drug fiend. The novel is really two journals---the first by 'Sir Peter Pendragon' (an inside literary referenced joke) who's modelled on Cecil Maitland (Lover of Mary Butts, the brilliant English writer of the 1920 &amp; 30's, as well as the first editor of 'Magick In Theory &amp; Practice' while both were in residence at the infamous &quot;Abbey&quot;), was briefly a pupil &amp; friend of Crowleys', and is writ in a straightforward if lyrical narrative; the second, by 'Unlimited Lou', is modelled on an imagined adult persona, a &quot;wish-phantasm&quot; of Crowley's eldest daughter, Lola Zaza, and is episodic and revolves around a brilliant poem composed by The Beast, who's called 'King Lamus' and occupies the real-life 'Abbey Of THELEMA' in Cefalu, Italy between the years 1920-23. Such a manner of attack, from three differing pov's: a young man's, a young womans', (both in love) and a final treatise expounding the doctrines of a graduated master, allows maximum coverage. The degree to which Crowley has imposed his own persona upon all three characters is masterful; two in the form of himself: Sir Peter Pendragon being the younger enthusiastic decadent,(via Huysmans') and King Lamus as the aged, experienced Mage; while also speaking in the guise of the lady Unlimited (Crowley openly admitted he always wanted to be a hermaphrodite)being as well various assemblages all greatly affected by Crowley over the course of his first 47 years. Such is this reader's humble opinion anyway, with much gathered evidence besides he might add. Unrepentant, furiously poetic, psychologically unforgiving, he has human nature pegged down to a crucifixated &quot;T&quot;!(so to speak) Crowley associates the stages of addiction (now accepted among the establishment but back then unacknowledged, if not balked at and ridiculed) with the ritual initiation rites of ceremonial Magick, which affords him an almost spiritual-psychologocal tool for conducting his various surgeries on the human soul...which modern-day medicine remains ignorant of while refuting its importance; for some strange reason people and learn-ed doctors as well persist to assume/conclude that if you stop ingesting drugs physically it means you will immediately start getting better psychologically (or spiritually) as well?!?! Such a scholar's bane is the occultist's reward in allowing wordly experience to take precedence over scholastic doctrine! Speaking strictly from a veteran's well-won distance in reviewing the benefits awarded to all by the saints, in light of his many years in the service of the-HERO-INside-of-us-all,(private anagram) Crowley ascertains under the guise of Unlimited Lou: &quot;I had no idea that those people had got so much sense. I've always thought of them as tangled up with religious ideas. I understand now. Yes, it's the life of holiness, if you have go to the trouble of putting it in terms of morality, as I suppose you (English) people have to...I was one of the chief sinners in my time...Human life or Heroin life? I've tried them both; and I don't regret having chosen as I did.&quot;In summation, The Diary Of A Drug Fiend( taken in title after the exemplar of Russian Satire: Gogol's story in yet another literary reference, which abounds in ALL of Crowley's many masterpieces) is a classic must-read among lovers and aspirants of Literature, cultural scholars and historians in the field of drug addiction and psychology, in which it is of no less import or interest than Schreber's &quot;memoirs&quot;; Crowley admirers, as well as Thelemites (another literary allusion of great import in Occultism in gerneral= to Rabelais' 'Gargantua &amp; Pantagruel'-ian ideal utopian society) and of course to fans of the genre of autobiographical drug-related works. I have never heard of anybody in all these fields ever being let down from the veritable hysteria produced by both the book nor the authors dark reputation, which besides being fostered &amp; deserved, was also earned!

The masterful use of the English language; alone, makes it worth the price."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"Aleister Crowley's first published novel was &quot;Diary of a Drug Fiend.&quot; The book was originally published in London in 1922. Although written over seventy-five years ago, the book is still relevant for today's readers. The book paints a vivid picture of the mind of drug users. The drug user's highs, lows, and sometimes strange thought patterns are described in great detail in this interesting book.The infamous Aleister Crowley invokes a reaction with some people. Some say he was strange and went off the deep-end with his involvement in Magick, the practice of using various techniques to exert control over the forces of nature. If one is too close-minded to read this book because of the author's reputation, he or she would be missing a great read.This story is supposedly based on truth. False names were used to conceal the identities of the people in the book. For instance, Aleister Crowley is called Peter Pendragon in the book. Peter went to a pub and was socializing with some people he knew when he saw the woman that would change his life, Lou.&quot;Across the moaning body of the blackmailer, I was looking at the face of a girl that I had never seen before. And I said to myself, &quot;Well, that's all right, I've known you all my life.&quot; And when I said to myself &quot;my life,&quot; I didn't in the least mean my life as Peter Pendragon, I didn't even mean a life extending through the centuries, I meant a different kind of life --something with which centuries have nothing whatever to do (Crowley 11).&quot;This truly eloquent description of Peter's first glimpse of Lou reveals that Crowley was truly a master of language. The book is written in such a clever way that the reader continues to want more.Basically, the story is of Peter falling madly in love with a woman named Lou. They run off to Paris and travel throughout Europe. Lou introduces Peter to cocaine and heroin and they quickly become dependent on the narcotics. When their supply of drugs runs out, the withdrawal troubles begin. Lou's father, King Lamus, helps the two overcome their addiction by the application of practical Magick. Both Peter and Lou find their true purpose in life and live happily ever after.&quot;Diary of a Drug Fiend&quot; would be a beneficial source of information for professionals involved with the psychology of addiction. Doctors, lawyers, police, and the average person would gain insight into the thought patterns of a drug addict from the first high, to the constant effort to regain the effects of the first high. The craving for the drug, and how it is the only thing the user thinks about when he or she does not have the drug for a period of time is covered thoroughly. How selfish and careless one becomes when he or she needs a fix is also mentioned in the book. Peter lost his love for Lou because he could only think of the drugs. He quickly knew this was wrong and constantly tried to regain his love for Lou.If people are open-minded and enjoy challenging their beliefs, then &quot;Diary of a Drug Fiend&quot; may be the book to read. At the time of reading this book, I found many useful insights that could dramatically change one's life contained within its pages. Overall, this book by Aleister Crowley is fantastic."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"Aleister Crowley is one of the great unheralded masters of the Enlgish language. Many aspects of his spiritual and philosophical views may leave some people in the dust, however. The mysticism can be perplexing to the average reader. Diary Of A Drug Fiend is successful because it is very easy to understand. The use of language is masterful. It is not a pretty story, to be sure, and many will disagree with the seemingly pro drug message but it is a great tale. Peter Pendragon and Unlimited Lou are presented as both sympathetic and contemptible characters. One feels empahty but it is tainted by the knowledge that they have created their own problems. They are weak. King Lamus almost seems to be like a zen master who patiently guides his pupils to higher heights. I can not say that I agree entirely with the philosophy espoused by King Lamus but it is exhilarating to follow this tale as it unfolds. I am sure many will be offended by Crowleys portrayal of King Lamus as a master who can use and not use drugs with ease. I do not suggest that mastery over heroin or cocaine is easy or even possible but this is just a work of fiction. It should not be taken literally. I do not know if this is meant as a self defense for Crowleys own drug use. It is irrelevent to me. Many great artists were alcoholics or drug addicts. It does not deter my admiration for this spectacularly well written book. Aleister Crowley could have been one of the great novelists had he chosen to pursue that path. This was one of the best reads I had in years."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"Diary Of A Drug Fiend appealed to me because I knew someone that was caught up in drug addiction and wanted to know more about it. I wanted to know what it felt like and how the drug user felt. This book totally met my expectations and more, it showed me exactly what I was looking for. In the first instance I began to dislike the book because it seems to glorify drugs but then I suppose that is what it feels like when you are using the drugs. Read a bit further on and it will tell you the real horrors of drugs in the cold light of day. It is obvious that the author knows what he is talking about, but you have to remember that the characters in the book were using the purest form of drugs and so the effects I suppose you could say seem somewhat dramatised, but then someone once said (forgive me for not remembering) that the effects of drugs depend on your state of mind when you are taking them, so each individual user will experience something different. Overall, I would reccomend this book to anyone that has any link whatsoever with drugs or anyone that is thinking of it. It will show you the real horrors by an experienced author!"},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"Begins with the age old tale: boy gets wired on coke, boy meets girl, boy marries girl and goes off travelling with her through europe doing copious amounts of C. and H. Eventually boy and girl end up more or less in the gutter, ready to commit suicide. Enter King Lamus: Master Adept/Zen Master/Mentor/Father Figure to rescue them both by helping them to discover their True Will, thereby curing them entirely of their addictions. It is King Lamus' considered opinion that drugs are tools, to be used wisely and with a specific purpose in mind, going on to make the analogy that the best way to avoid drowning is to learn to swim-- not to avoid bodies of water. An intriguing-- though possibly specious-- theory. Fun and entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"I would have to rate this book among the best written in the English language. It is captivating, riveting, and deftly portrays two seperate worlds (the world of the occult and the world of drug addiction) with which the greater public is unfamiliar.Diary of a Drug Fiend is, as is stated very succinctly in the preface, &quot;a true story. It has been rewritten only so far as was necessary to conceal personalities.&quot;I, being a RECOVERED alcohol and cigarette addict, can attest to the workability of this esoteric/exoteric approch to addictions. It is possible to completely reverse an addiction and responsibly handle the substance. I know becouse I tested the theory.The proposed approch to the problem is a combination of Zen and Taoist meditative techniques, and a thorough recording of your progress in a diary. The individual is encouraged to work with their own body rhythms, and discouraged from ever feeling any guilt. The addiction is the symptom not the actual problem.Diary of a Drug Fiend takes a very unorthodox approch to a frightening problem."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"Diary of a Drug Fiend is one of those books you can't part with, even after having read it. It's the ying and yang of who we are at the height of our own spiritual, as well as physical, battles. Beautifully written, genius, in fact. I still can't believe anyone being capable of writing such a piece of work, but Aleister did. I feel I've gained an inner understanding of drug addiction, as well as an understanding of many other personal struggles any &quot;being&quot; could possibly encounter throughout life."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"Anyone who thinks Diary of a Drug Fiend is purely about drugs is wrong. Yes, that is the subject matter of at least 2/3 of the book, but the choice of drugs as the subject matter is immaterial. The author required a highly difficult human condition in order to explain his theories of applying the Will to life. It is interesting to read about underground drug culture in 1922, as such a thing was brand new, the anti-drug laws having been passed just before. But what stands out the most is King Lamus' character, who presents a truly Western method for living, the polar opposite of Eastern philosophy. The back of the book cover speaks about practical magick, but what it must be understood that &quot;magick&quot; refers mainly to psychological control of one's self, rather than anything supernatural."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"A fearlessly introspective plunge into the depths of the despair, misery and impotence of personal failure and an enlightening journey along the painful, yet rewarding, path of liberation and self-mastery."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"It's not quite as much fun to write a review when it seems everyone is basically in agreement. Crowley was not as evil as folklore suggests, and he was a lot more intellectually accomplished than his detractors would care to admit.What struck me about this book were the resounding themes in the final chapters. (I don't think this is a suspense-driven book, so I don't see myself as \\"spoiling\\" the ending here.) \\"Do What Thou Wilt\\" may seem archaic or sinister, but it ultimately means nothing more than finding your ultimate purpose, your deepest will. Once you find that, your other problems will fall by the wayside. Put in those terms, perhaps the theme sounds too pedestrian. But the way Crowley presents it here in terms of overcoming a heroin and \\"snow\\" addiction is marvelous. In many respects this book, particularly toward the end, reminded me of Ayn Rand's writings, where man's ultimate potentials are examined and exalted. Crowley's King Lamus is not far from the John Galt and Howard Roarke idealisms. I walked away from this book refreshed and inspired. Thank you, Mr. Crowley.Yes, if you have any interest in narcotics addiction this is a MUST-READ. Seriously, if you are a cop, or a lawyer, or a judge, this is a fundamental source of information that will really expand your comprehension of the subject of narcotics addiction. Thank goodness here in California the emphaisis is on REHABILITATION for users and simple possession. And, thank goodness, here in California if you are a dealer that clank you just heard is the prison door, scum bag.Yes, for those with interests in the arcane, the esoteric, the occult or the erotic, your time will be well rewarded by the book. There is bizarre imagery and mystical references throughout. You'll have a blast with this one. Please note that these Crowley books become astronomical in price when they go out of print, even the paperbacks, so you may want to snag one of these even if you can't read it right now.One sign of a good book for me is that when I'm done with it, the book is all marked up with pencil marks indicating points which I want to read again some day. Just about every page of this book is marked. Yes, it truly is classic."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Drug Fiend","review":"OK I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO POINT OUT THIS IS A NOVAL, NOT A RITUAL BOOK. BUT THIS IS A VERY GREAT BOOK. IT IS CERTAINTLY ONE OF CROWLEY'S BEST WORKS. IT'S ABOUT HOW DRUGS CAN BE USED AND THEN THEY USE YOU. I THINK ANYONE WHO LOVES CROWLEY, DRUGS, OR LOVE STORIES WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Pro Scalable .NET 2.0 Application Designs (Expert's Voice in .NET)","review":"The book sets some ambitious goals for itself, to teach anyone involved with the technical process what they need to know about .NET development. The book does indeed cover a wide range of .NET topics organized from the outside starting with coverage of complete application architecture including EAI with other systems, and them moving in towards the operating system, the web server, the development architecture and SQL. All of these topics are covered at a white paper level. In fact, the whole book reads and feels like one large white paper.So, on the up side it's a very good high level introduction to all of the concepts involved with .NET development of web applications. It's well written, although it could use some editing, and the concepts are explained well.One the down side, the book really does feel like an extended white paper. The topics aren't covered with enough depth to satisfy engineers so this book is probably best for architects and managers who want a high-level introduction to .NET. It's pretty buzzword heavy, for example in chapter four the coverage of workarounds around limitations in the operating system is called 'best practices'. Don't expect any coverage of systems other than Microsoft or comparisons to alternative systems.The interesting chapters:Chapter one covers EAI, content management systems and UML, which is an interesting place to start. The coverage is brief but well done.Chapter two covers the various windows services. This is a good introduction to the topic.Chapter three covers windows clustering and is one of the best chapters in the book, clean, concise and well written.Chapter five is the heart of the book. It's a super long chapter that covers everything about web application architecture in .NET including design patterns and coding standards. Both the design patterns and coding standards section could have been in appendices. I'm not sure the design patterns was worth covering at the depth that it was.Chapter six is about web services and it's a fine chapter that runs a bit long. Still, it's one of the best chapters in the book.Chapters seven, about IIS, and eight, about SQL, would have been better a little longer and more detailed. The SQL chapter could have mentioned some use of alternative database servers.Chapter nine, which covers and example application, probably should have been in the beginning with the rest of the book covering the example in greater depth."},{"Title":"Pro Scalable .NET 2.0 Application Designs (Expert's Voice in .NET)","review":"This is a very good overview on how to design scalable .net enterprise applications.The book covers most aspects concerned.

We further get input on how to choose the right cluster architecture, database and storage design, application design (including a thorough overview of web services design).The fact that Sten Sundblad has written the foreword witnesses the quality and importance of this book.The first 8 chapters are dedicated to theory. In the ninth (and last) chapter we also get to follow some use cases from UML modeling to finished code. In between we get info about how to set up the application environment and choosing storage design.

It covers lots of things in .net: objects, Enterprise Library, COM+, SOA, SQL Server, IIS, Clustering and NLB, W2000 and W2003 server... At the beginning of the chapters it introduces a little theory about the content, and later it goes to develop in .net.The language chosen for the examples and not going too deeply in some issues, like SOA, is just what i can say bad about it. And perhaps it shouldn't have been titled as 2.0. I miss that they haven't talk about some 2.0 features and develop in a 1.1 way.I should definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Pro Scalable .NET 2.0 Application Designs (Expert's Voice in .NET)","review":"Pro Scalable .NET 2.0 Application Designs (PSNAD), by Rickard Redler and Joachim Rossberg, is an insider's book. It assumes that you already know almost everything you might want to know about Microsoft products. For example, page 37 namedrops \\"MSMQ\\" while page 451 tells you a little about it, if you didn't already know and you do persist that far.Although PSNAD topics are mostly serious, the tone is chatty. A large number of sentences start with \\"Don Box says.\\" Most of the readers who want to know what Don Box says will have bought one of his books; Amazon sells at least four of them. Chapter 1 of PSNAD is puffed out with an apparently obligatory introduction to diagramming, but the rest of the book mercifully downplays diagrams in favor of information.What this reader wanted to know was when to use Web services and when to use other techniques for distributed applications. Chapter 6 of PSNAD gives clear answers to this question in a page and a half, something no other current book provides.

I wasn't really interested at that time, so I put it away and forgot about it. Over time, I realized how frustrated my son was in a world of plastic toys that broke easily, or didn't stay together to begin with. He was much more content to collect leaves in the park than to play with an action hero. When I became pregnant with my second son, I re-discovered this book and really looked at it. It seemed to validate much of what I was feeling, and I could see that my son had naturally gravitated to this lifestyle as well. This book helped us come up with other ways to make our lives more natural.This book is not strictly Waldorf type. For example, Legos are suggested as a good open-ended toy in the book, where in a Waldorf setting, tree-blocks might be used instead because the Legos have a cold, sterile feel.

Ms. Cather was at her worst when she wrote in imitation of earlier lady novelists such as Edith Wharton or Henry James, and the entire first half of this novel concerns the intrigues of a Midwest Brahmin family. During this part there is absolutely no plot, just tedious description and some of the most stilted dialogue ever written. The cardboard characters include the good-natured protagonist, Professor St. James, and his two daughters, one sweet (Cordelia?) and one rapacious (Goneril?). The bad daughter is lolling in luxury due to the avaricious machinations of her husband, who, naturally, is a Jew - a stereotypical Jew, the worst kind.If that weren't bad enough, when a plot is finally introduced it concerns a preposterous device (or substance) called \\"the Outland vacuum\\" which is said to concern bulkheads and be a boon to aviation. It seems as though the novel will now hinge on the moral issue of who is entitled to the rewards for this great discovery (the Outland vacuum may also be a gas), but I suspect that at this point Ms. Cather realized that she had gone in over her head, and the novel comes to a sudden halt. The next page begins a second novel, about as bad as the first but which takes place among cowboys out West who discover a lost Indian city.Alas, this likewise amounts to little, and we eventually return to the warmhearted professor who comes to the good-ol' American conclusion that being rich and famous is not all it's cracked up to be, and real happiness is found among the plain folk.Y'know, people, just because something is old and ostensibly literature doesn't mean it's really great. My only worry is that schoolkids will be forced to read this - under the theory that classic fiction is \\"good\\" for them - and they will thus be alienated from reading books because they're so dull."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"I read My Antonia and loved it so much that I consider it one of my favorite books. And, that's why I really really really wanted to like this book. But after giving it a chance for about 218 pages, I couldn't bear it any longer.The problems I have with this book are as follows:1) I understand the book's plot of the professor trying to find meaning in his life. That's the book I was looking for. The problem is that the Tom Outland character does not get you there and most of the text of the book is on this character.2) Which brings me to my biggest gripe about this book, and Cather in particular. Cather cannot, to save her life, write a believable male character. Tom Outland is supposed to be an orphaned boy turned cowboy around the turn of the century, but Cather managed to make him out to be so unbelievably feminine that I found myself in wonder at how little she knows about men. She holds Outland out to be the hero of the story, the inspiration behind the Professor's motivation. That's fine, but if I'm supposed to conclude the Professor part of the story, then I have to buy Outland's character and it's just not possible. Here are some examples of Cather not being believable:a) When she describes Tom Outland's hands through the professor's eyes, she describes them as beautiful and delicate. Worse still, she bothers to describe them in detail. Men don't do that.b) Around page 218 when she begins Outland's tirade against Blake she makes Outland sound off like a nagging wife about how Blake shouldn't have sold the pottery etc. Men don't argue this way with friends; they don't have hissy fits - they stay quiet!c) After the argument in (b) above, as Blake leaves the scene, she describes Outland wishing to run after him and hold him in his arms. Men just don't think like that.d) When Outland is in Washington D.C. trying to get people to take interest in the pottery he discovered, he lets himself get ignored, disrespected, and he waits by tolerantly while being stepped on by people in positions of power. That's not a description of a turn of the century orphaned cowboy; that's a description of a turn of the century well-to-do woman of society - the only world Cather appears to know.e) Whenever Tom Outland meets other men in his life as a cowboy, they are always really \\"nice and pleasant\\". Indeed they are overly accommodating. Huh? I could see cowboys being really respectful and accommodating to a beautiful woman of society (like Cather) but an orphaned cowboy? She just puts too much of herself in this character. I couldn't buy it.3) Now before reviewers think my gripes are based on some sort of homophobia, let me just say that if it had been a story about men in love with each other, I would have accepted that as at least being believable. But that's not Cather's intention. Outland ends up marrying the professor's daughter. Is Cather trying to send out a bisexual message of some kind? Was the professor gay? The text just does not support any kind of homosexual message either explicitly or implicitly.4) Cather plays out Outland to be this super human being. Indeed he is the inspiration to the Professor and all the other characters in the book. But if that's the case, why is he on the wrong side of the moral debate on the Dreyfus affair? Cather wrote this book in 1925; twenty five years after all the facts had already come out on that case and yet Cather has Outland take the side of bigots?5) In Outland's tirade against Blake, Outland chews him out for selling ancient pottery belonging to native Indian tribes. Earlier in the book it's concluded that the tribe was decimated by outsiders. In chastising Blake, Outland declares that Blake was wrong to sell the pottery because it was not his. He says that the pottery belongs to his country, to the State etc. That's the best our hero can do? Wouldn't the right thing to do be to leave the ruins to themselves and not dig up the belongings of the decimated people - i.e. let them rest in peace?Anyway, I was sorely disappointed. I gave The Professor's House one star more than it deserves only because My Antonia deserves six."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"Cather can be difficult: read slowly and savor! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"I am a huge Willa Cather fan and have been reading her novels in the order she wrote them. I started \\"The Professor's House\\" in eager anticipation, because I just LOVED \\"A Lost Lady,\\" the book that preceded it.\\"The Professor's House\\" has many, many good elements, but ultimately I was disappointed. The last part of the book was unworthy of what had gone before. In the end, I felt as though I'd invested a lot in the Professor and that that investment had not paid off. I'm glad I read it, but think it's nowhere close to one of Cather's best.I thought the first two section of the book were excellent. I believed almost everything about the Professor's life and his relationships. My only criticism of the beginning portion of the novel was Cather's superficial and, yes, bigoted attitude toward the Jewish son-in-law, Louie Marsellus. I didn't have a problem accepting Louie as a real person. But Cather could only see him and comment on him as \\"the other.\\" One of Cather's great strengths is her understanding of how the world looks to the different characters in her novels. She may not agree with who they are and how they act, but she is usually deeply empathetic. Not so with Louie. The fact that he is a Jew is somehow taken as an explanation for everything. Even in 1925, I expect better of a writer of Cather's insight and talent. Interestingly, Louie is ultimately one of the most sympathetic and generous characters in the novel. But Cather writes as though she'd never had a close Jewish friend, or never applied her prodigious imagination to contemplate Louie's psychology and point of view.Still, even with the problem with Louie, I thought the first book was very good. It was filled with the wonderful writing and the psychological, sociological and philosophical depth that I so admire in Cather.I also enjoyed the second book, Tom Outland's story. I agree with an earlier reviewer that the section set in Washington, D.C. was particularly good. I was raised in Washington, and my mother's family has lived there since the 1840's. Cather just NAILED the town.But it all came to a crashing halt in the final section, when we return to the Professor's story. Did Cather lose interest? Did she not know where to go with the Professor? This section was too short and undeveloped. The first two parts of the book deserved a more thorough and satisfying conclusion. I particularly objected to the section about how the Professor had gotten back in touch with the unthinking boy he'd been back in Kansas. Hogwash. Not credible. This guy's an intellectual. He might come to see the limits of what many academics pretentiously call \\"the life of the mind.\\" But jettison it entirely for some romantic, unreal Tom Sawyer fantasy? I don't think so.My advice: do read \\"The Professor's House,\\" but don't make it your first Cather book."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"This was the first Willa Cather book I've read, and only because I got it at a yard sale for 50 cents. She has written it with an economy of words, but no less vivid than more grandious writers. The imagery of the main setting (near Chicago) is bleak, and offset wonderfully by the tales by Outland of the desert southwest. His world is like sunshine on the soul.The key to the entire book is Outland, the professor's favorite student. From first hearing of him, the reader wants to know more. Which I'm sure was the intended effect Cather had in mind. He is described perfectly - mysterious yet incredibly open and sincere. Its very clever, because people in this life who touch you deeply are like him. The main character, the professor, and the elusive Outland, plus the addition of the wife, housekeeper/seamstress and two daughters are all wonderful. I will now buy more Cather books - at any price!!!"},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"This was a wonderful book. Her writing and insight are intoxicating.

There are no chapter headings, weird paragraphs, symbols replacing foreign letters, and grammar and punctuation errors all over. I regret getting this edition."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"The Professor's House is a very good novel but not one of the five novels by Cather that I would rate 5 stars. The novel is a critical look at higher education in one way. The college in America was once a fountain of basic knowledge in the humanities arts and basic sciences. The college education at the undergraduate level was not about job training but developing intellect. The liberal arts and basic sciences were at the center of a college or university.Cather critiques the change into a job training center and the change in attitude from being motivated by a search for knowledge to being motivated by money. Even the professors are affected and it shows most clearly when the title character talks to a close faculty friend whose anger at ebeing denied money from a discovery of one of his students stuns the professor becausehe thought his friend was a physicist to learn the secrets of the universe not make money fro mpractical applications of discoveries.The whole novel is a critique of the American emphasis on money and possessions. The professor rejects his nicer and brand new house because it has no soul .The main reason he consented to buy it was his wifes desire to be upscale and the financial success of his books enable that but the professor didd research out of love of knowledge which is why he so loved and admired the other main character Tom Outland who after he dies has his research as a student turned into something practical and wealth creating by oo professors son in law or one of them . He and his wife represent greed while the other daughter and son inlaw represent osmething more noble but they too are affected by a love of money they just dont have much. Only Outland the Professor ST.Peter put love of knowledge for money. The book is quite good but the middle section on Tom Outland in New Mexico so I RATE IT 4 STARS"},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"Cather's A PROFESSOR'S HOUSE is very different from the spirit-of-the-prairie book she's often so immediately associated with. Like O PIONEERS! and MY ANTONIA, however, this novel exhibits cather's great fascination with the American landscape, and with he posiibility of dreams left both fulfilled and unfulfilled. The experiences of Tom Outland in the Cliff City have made this book a recent favorite with Americanist scholars, but no less compelling is her portrait of a suddenly wealthy Midwestern academic family in the Twenties whose recent good fortune has begun to tear them apart despite their general good will and kind tempers."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"I needed this for a class and thought I'd save myself a few bucks by getting this edition; I was pleasantly surprised by how cheap it was, but you get what you pay for. It is loaded with typos and editing and formatting errors. The straw that broke the camel's back came when I encountered-- without explanation-- a several-page section of the book printed twice in a row. This leads me to fear that some parts may have actually been left out! Not sure what the deal is, or why this is so carelessly printed. I imagine that the copyright expired and the publishers payed some undergraduate to transcribe an older version into a Microsoft Word document which they printed in cheap paperback without going over it beforehand. If you're considering buying it, don't. The inconvenience and unreliability is not worth saving several dollars.

The edition from this publisher was a disgrace to the world of publishing. All diacritics (accent grave, tildas, etc.) were replaced with random ASCII characters. The numbered chapters from earlier printed versions were omitted. At one point, 10 pages were just repeated. I read this for my book club and based on the conversations in that group, and comparisons with other editions, I'm not even sure that all of the original text was present. I will never knowingly buy anything else from this publisher. And as a Virginian, I'm embarrassed that they make their home in my state. Caveat emptor!"},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"I wanted to read something I hadn't read before and didn't already know as a fan of Willa Cather's writing. Call it the intellectual stretch. The Professor's House (1925) is a short book with only three chapters. Now that I read the book I recognize it as three pieces written separate and apart from one another.The second chapter, \\"Tom Outland's Story,\\" stood alone for many years as an unfinished work. Today it would stand alone as a captivating short story about the Southwest during the frontier days. Thirty six pages long, this voice is Willa Cather at her storytelling best. It's the story of two young men and their archeological discovery on a mesa. A man's story: friendship, adventure, betrayal and loss. It's a masterpiece of description for a time and a place; the reader is dropped into the middle of the frontier prairie landscape and its human scenery.The first and third chapters are wraparounds. Seventy pages of narration about the professor and his family and circumstances related to Tom Outland's premature death build up to the revelation in Chapter Two. The third chapter is only thirteen pages long and yet it's where all the plot lines pull together.The narrative premise pulling these three pieces, written at different times, is that a professor doesn't like the direction his life has taken. Due to circumstances, Professor Godfrey St. Peter has come into more comfortable circumstances as a result of his daughter's inheritance from Tom Outland, her fianc&eacute;e, and his own writing and publishing success as a scholar. His wife, Lillian, also receives a small inheritance check every month from her family and has sustained all appearances of class for his insignificant income as a college professor.The professor and his wife Lillian have two daughters; and now two son-in-laws. His own position with regards to his own family as he faces his 50s is at stake. His wife moves into their new house, but he decides to keep his old study in the rackety-trap attic in the old house. He's stuck. He's stuck because of what transpired with Tom Outland. There is mention of a patent and his invention as a student there in the college; the professor and his family had taken Tom in as an unschooled youth and he proved a scientific genius. The exact financials are kept rather discretely; implications are that it makes the professor quite uncomfortable.The professor won't accompany his family on their trip to Europe for the summer. He spends it in the old house in his study doing as he pleases for the first time since his youth. Seeing Lillian fall in fondness with their sons-in-law, he recognizes he has long ago fallen out of love with his wife.He finds in the seamstress a confidante over all the years they shared the attic for their \\"work.\\" She is never sexualized, but throughout the first and third chapters she is the female heroine to the professor. Augusta is St. Peter's rock.In the third and final chapter, the Professor finally falls prey to the dangers of his woodstove and the weather in his attic. He collapsed into a sleeping stupor in the midst of a rain storm after spending the afternoon and evening contemplating the meaningless of his family relations and career; carbon monoxide filled the room. He welcomed the easy escape, before Augusta rescues him just in time for his family to arrive home from Europe.Perhaps this felt like a cob job because I bought a crappy paperback edition. The corrupted fonts resulted in a variety of typos and pages 68-72 were duplicated passages. Something tipped me off that the narrative flow was more than a little contrived. It isn't Cather's best novel. Novella is even a stretch. Triptych maybe.I take some solace in seeing one of my heroines trying to make a living wage from her work. Like many writers, pieces and fragments of our best work lie outside that which is easily marketable. This shows she tried to take one of her gems and work it into a fine piece of jewelry; didn't quite work, but the gem is apart from its setting. And you see how the stone is distinct from the steel. As a reader and a writer I liked looking at more of her writing and career as I see how hard it remains to make a living at this craft of writing."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"While Cather's novel does live up to the reviews posted here, I must complain about this edition. Not only are there frequent OCR problems--Santa F', for example, instead of Santa F&eacute;--but there's one six page section which is simply printed twice. I hope that it's just my copy that's bad, as Cather is an important enough author that her work deserves to be printed in good editions!"},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"Willa Cather is one of the top five American writers. She gets little notice, it seems, today. I find that very strange, given the feminist movement in America. I've read three of her other books and this is the oddest, and most wonderful, or perhaps I forget how O Pioneers, Death Comes for the Archbishop and My Antonia affected me so greatly.Nothing seems to happens in her books and yet they blow me away and I remember them always. I do not exaggerate that they haunt me. I know that sounds dramatic, but that is what a good book does.I struggled with this book. I'd read twenty pages, put it down for weeks, come back and read twenty more pages and then, finally I said I was going to finish it. As I was starting to read the last sixty pages -- it is a short book -- I was thinking to myself: 'I'm sorry I ever started to read this.' I was merely finishing it as a sense of duty. But then, the last thirty-five pages had me by my heart and it 'explained' all that I had plodded through previously.I don't know if I can recommend this book. I'd fear that it would bore to tears any friend who would read it. But for me, it's effect is monumental --- and it has been a while that I can say that about most books I've read. I suspect that this book does not move younger readers as it does older readers, as it is a summing up of a man's life and how he has lived it. I'm not sure that a person who has not put many years into living would understand Miss Cather's brilliance in how she does this through --ironically--a quite ordinary professor's life."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"Our book group, consisting of women in their 30s and 40s, enjoyed getting reacquainted with Cather through this evocative novel.

First of all I never was aware that Rosamunds husband was a jew, I thought he was french. I thought he was most generous, but not the least upset by using the money earned by his wifes ex fiancee. I did not see a stress on money, more of a class distinction created by the professors wife, and the elder daughter, who was also not upset about spending her former fiancees money.The professor became quite introspective once his family left him alone, which is what he wanted in the first place. He seemed to have felt deeply about Tom Outland, and enjoyed his company and his intellect. There could have been more stress on the fact that Tom was sorry about the way he treated Roddy, and I wished he could have found the well intentioned man and apologized to him and used the money toward his education. The professor did not seem to have a strong influence on his wife and daughter, and they were equally disinterested in him and his private thoughts. He did feel lucky he had married as well as he had, and didn't really feel life had disapointed him, although I think if he had given his life a little more thought, he would have ended up in a different place. descriptions were good. I liked My Antonia better."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"Willa Cather is a fine author. This edition is not. Duplicated pages, symbols and signs for letters make for clunky reading. I would recommend the story but get a different edition for smoother reading."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"Willa Cather (1873-1947) has been familiar to me my entire adult life as a very good American author, but I never read any of her works until now. I think that one of the English classes in my high school was reading \\"My Antonia,\\" while my class was being introduced to \\"Tale of Two Cities.\\" So, reading her novel \\"The Professor's House\\" was a new experience for me, and I'm sorry it took me so many years before I discovered this truly wonderful writer.Cather writes about the America she knows, the Midwest. The protagonist in \\"The Professor's House,\\" which is set in 1920 in the Midwest, is a totally admirable American who is a model of virtue and traditional American values. But, as he reaches age 52, he experiences a very modern mid-life crisis and questions the value of his life, finding a lack of meaning in what he has become. In modern psycho-babble, we would say he's depressed. Although the plot has several interesting subplots, how the professor resolves his existential angst is the central theme of the book. Cather's prose is straight forward and, in its simplicity, elegant. The middle third of the book involves the exploration and exploitation of Indian ruins in New Mexico, and it describes areas with which I'm familiar and love. This aspect of the book was a very pleasant surprise.\\"The Professor's House\\" is an easy book to read, is very enjoyable and meaningful, and demonstrates that good literature can illuminate and explain life. It is a rare combination of being a good story, and, providing the reader with a lot to ponder, if the reader chooses to go down that path with Willa Cather as the guide. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"I am an undying Willa Cather fan. Her collection of stories was the first e-book that I bought on my Kindle (at least this electronic version will not lose it's cover or binding like my other Cather books that I may have loved a bit too hard). Of course, every writer has their slips and that's what I think The Professor's House is. Even though it is listed in the 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die, I don't think it even holds a candle to O! Pioneers or My Antonia. Still, it has some redeeming qualities that a Cather enthusiast will surely enjoy.The short novel is divided into three sections the first of which focuses on the professor's family. It is clear that the professor feels at odds with most of his family for while he values education and knowledge, his wife and one of his daughters are materialistic. When they plan to move into a newly built house, the family does not understand the professor's reluctance to leave their old house behind. The second section focuses on the professor's former student, Tom Outland. In fact, the whole section is written by Outland and describes his life and connection to the ancient civilizations in America's southwest. The final section gives greater insight into the professor and his admiration for his late student, Outland.As one can see, this novel is character driven as opposed to plot driven. However, the characters are not that interesting and seem a bit convoluted. Therefore, the story becomes bogged down. Cather clearly wants to send a message about the dangers of materialism. However, these characters do not seem to be the best vehicle for this message. Additionally, the fragmented storyline is a bit confusing which distracts from Cather's theme.Overall, this is not one of Cather's finest but Cather fans will certain see its redeeming qualities and perhaps a different side of Cather herself."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"I've read a number of Willa Cather's books, but this novel had escaped me until now. Particularly for being one of her earliest works, written when she was quite young, the novel shows a mastery of the craft and an unusual maturity.Cather starts out slowly, building scene and character, with her signature sparse and interesting descriptions and phrases--always thought-provoking. The Professor is a particularly sympathetic character, wise and kindly. But the end of the book puts this work into a special category. The writing transforms, mirroring the transformation which occurs within the Professor at that point in his life. He rereads the diary of Tom Outland, an exceptional former student and colleague (the choice of name had to be deliberate.) In Outland's diary of his days in the Southwest, the book attains truly poetic prose and is very moving. This is followed by a remarkably deep understanding on the part of Cather of a usually later-life (if attained at all) state which the Professor undergoes. I've reread this last section several times.Needless to say, I highly recommend this book. As to this edition, there are a few typos. Those shouldn't be too distracting, at the price."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"This is a great book with lots of hidden meaning.

Lit. class I was anything but excited at the prospect. A further contribution to my misguided dread was born from the rather poor synopsis of the book on the back cover which fails miserably in &quot;selling&quot; the great story hidden within its pages. Yet another example of why one shouldn't judge a book by its cover. It is far more than just another story of inward rebellion and emotional &quot;renewal&quot;; it is instead, a story about the American dream, the family, higher education, friendship, nature, and the elusiveness of American history. The way that Cather blends this varied subject matter is a testament to her great talent as a writer, but more impressively, this book bears witness to her keen insight into the deepest recesses of the American psyche. The story centers around an aging professor(St. Peter) , and his close and yet mysterious friend Tom Outland. Complicating this is the professor's strained relationship with his own family,(his two daughter's and their husbands and his wife). Cather's nonlinear narrative of their interactions and the various relationships that result works to pull the reader ever deeper into a work that soon spirals out of the professor's small study into a world of arid mesas, mysterious strangers, ancient skeletons and forgotten yesterdays. In the end, this story could be seen as an exposition on the American dream, one that probes deep below the surfaces of what that dream entails, and what is lost to acheive it."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"If you are interested in Willa Cather read &quot;My Antonia&quot; first and then read everything else, including &quot;The Professor's House&quot;.

It is so beautifully written that one could feel as though they have been gently placed within the walls of the professor's house.

Eventually, she moves, he stays put. He is a very depressed man, partly because of the untimely death of Tom Overland, his favorite student. He even contemplates suicide, but is saved by his daughter. This is a sad, pessimistic book, but compelling and very well written--one of Cather's best."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"Cather writes another insightful and incisive piece of literature with this book. She focuses on several themes in the book quite specifically, and with good effect.The prevailing themes are the basic anti-semetism of the time (copyright 1925, which Cather finds inappropriate; the manner in which people \\"Masquerade\\" as something that is very different from who they are; the meaning of human life; and why that meaning is so elusive.With the unavoidable use of the name GODfrey St. Peter as her protaganist, the relationship to spiritual and heavenly things is immediately illustrated. Many of her sentences therefore start as such; \\"St. Peter thought ...\\" This device allows her to immediately integrate religious consideration at any point within the narrative.While some of the descriptive information is a bit long winded, it also must be taken into consideraton that this was 1925, and most people had never seen the types of things she is describing in her book, from a geographic and geological perspective.The story is recommended for all people who like tales of the plains and the West. In addition, it is recommended for all readers who wish to see how an author can create the thoughts and use them effectively of her characters in her story."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"Somewhere I read that Cather will eventually top Hemingway as America's finest and most esteemed writer. This book floated Cather above Hemingway in my estimation and this was only the fourth book of hers that I have read. A wonderful, timeless story set in the early twenties (could very well be today!). A remarkable tale of how the appearance of a young man in the lives of one family can have such impact. Cather develops each character around their reaction to the man, Outland. Outland, a perfect name for a character that sweeps in, lives intensely, whose intellectual capabilities create wonder and who gives it all away.The main character, the Professor, begins by tutoring Outland, even as Outland tutors the Professor's own daughters. Outland betrothes the eldest who benefits from Outland's creations with enormous riches. The youngest daughter languishes in the shadow of her older daughter's consumerism, which the mother encourages, much to the disinterest and dissatisfaction of the Professor.The middle and last sections of this three-part book are wondrous and provide the ultimate redemption and &quot;tutoring&quot; for the Professor who is &quot;saved&quot; by the life which Outland has lived.The setting for this book moves from the attic-office of the Professor in a small college town set on Lake Michigan to the mesas of the southwest. Each setting is beautifully described, in economical and lovely language.This novel is a wonder! Perfect, and the best that I have read in a very, very long time."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"This Cather novel can best be compared to a small symphony in a minor key. It is a gentle, bittersweet portrait of a successful scholar who finds himself emotionally isolated from his family in a transitional time in the family's development. A move from their familiar, too-small home to a newer, larger home highlights tensions and jealousies between his newly married daughters and the distance between himself and his wife. The first portion of the novel focuses on the professor's disappointing relationships with his family and colleagues, relationships he observes with poignancy and sadness. A smaller but equally important portion of the novel tells the story of Tom Outland, a young man whose life and death provide a backdrop for the professor's story. Cather's prose is lean and unadorned, giving every word meaning. This lends itself particularly well to her treatment of the southwest. Her portrait of the professor as ineffectual and alienated is consistent with Cather's general treatment of males and reflects her distrust of marriage. It is nevertheless a poignant and realistic portrayal of a man confronting the disappointments of an otherwise successful life. It is a must read."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"As much as I loved reading this novel, I can't stand this edition.

There are also a large amount of accented letters ( like \\"&eacute;\\") that ended up being something like \\"\\" which makes reading words as simple as \\"Op&eacute;ra\\" very difficult as it now reads \\"Opra\\". The publisher didn't even bother to put in the standard chapters that other editions have, which leaves you reading approximately 89 pages without any place to rest the eyes.

Her novel \\"The Professor's House\\" is much less familiar, but it is Cather at her best.The book tells the story of Professor Godfrey St. Peter. When we meet St. Peter, he is a respected academic and scholar, age 52, who has written an eight volume history called \\"Spanish Explorers\\" dealing with the Spanish in Mexico and the American Southwest. He has persevered in his writing and received awards. As a result, St. Peter and his family are able to build a new house and move away from the ramshakle rented quarters in which the Professor and his wife have lived and raised their family.The family consists of two daughters who, when we meet them, have married and gone their own ways. The younger daughter is married to a struggling news reporter who has impressed his bosses by his ability to turn out hack prose-poems for the paper on a daily basis.The older daughter was at one time engaged to a man named Tom Outland who is, perhaps the real hero of the book. Outland invented an important scientific device and willed it to her upon his death in WW I. She then marries an engineer and entrepreneur who develops and markets Outland's invention. The couple build a large home and name in \\"Outland\\".The book tells a story of change, frustration and acceptance. The Professor is unhappy with the new home and refuses to leave his old study. His relationship with his wife and daughters has cooled. He is unhappy with the modernization of the university and of academic learning with its emphasis on technology and business rather than study and reflection. Most importantly, he is dissatisfied with his honors, his leisure, and his comforts. He thinks of his youth of promise and study, of his life of solitude, and yearns for adventure and meaning.The first part of the book tells the story of the Professor and his family. The second, shorter, part is a flash-back and tells the story of Tom Outland who Professor St. Peter befriended many years before and who grew up in mysterious circumstances in New Mexico. We learn in the second part of the book of Outland's life on the railroad and on the range. We see his somewhat ambiguous friendship with an older man and their discovery of an ancient Indian village on the mesas. There is a wonderfully drawn picture of Washington D.C. as Tom tries, without success, to interest officials in his discovery.In the third part of the book, the Professor reflects on Tom and on his own life. It seems to me that Tom's life mirrors the theme of the Professor's lenghty studies in \\"Spanish Explorers\\" It is the kind of life in its rawness, closeness to nature, and independence that the Professor thinks he would have liked to lead rather than settling for a middle-class life of conformity, comfort, and boredom. We see how the Professor tries to struggle on.There is a frustration built into life when we learn we are not the persons we dreamed of becoming. This is a poignant, beautifully-written story of American life and of how and why people fall short of themselves.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"Objectively speaking, this book as a whole is perhaps not quite as excellent as some of her other books like DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP, but this nonetheless is one of my three favorites of her novels. The book consists of three parts, not all of them of equal strength (the only real criticism of the book in the end is that the sections are not sufficiently integrated with one another and that they do not quite balance one another), but a couple of them containing some of her most powerful writing. A very, very good book. Anyone who enjoyed DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP would in particular like it."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"The Professor's House is a novel that I read and re-read, in the same way that one turns again and again to a good friend, for solace. Middle age is a time of change and this novel's main character is going through the Change of Life (as surely as if he were a woman...)After reading this novel about 4 years ago, I went on to devour almost every other published work by this author. If you are Canadian, like me, I urge you to read Shadows on the Rock. This is a Cather novel set in 18th century Quebec City. A real gem.But back to The Professor's House: Cather draws us in with the singularity of her main character. The professor is set apart from his wife and one of his daughters, disconnected from them by a lifetime of having to listen to and observe their pettiness. Connected to Tom Outland and to his youngest daughter, the professor flourishes. Aren't we all like this? There are kindred spirits and there are those who are not kindred spirits.Because I love the landscape of New Mexico, I was thrilled with the descriptions of the ruins. Cather's love of this part of the world is reflected in much of her work. She is able to capture the emptiness and beauty of this stark landscape in her writing.I have found some of Cather's work to be a bit ponderous. The Professor's House is one of her best novels. It has stood the test of time, which is what makes it literature. I'm also thrilled that a woman writer can be so successful at creating male characters. This is an art that many writers do not have."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"Lately, I've turned away from fiction, because I haven't been able to find works that keep me turning those pages. When I stumbled across The Professor's House, I was delighted to find myself swept away and completely absorbed by Willa Cather's tender and disturbing tale of an ordinary man's confrontation with his feelings about place, family, and ageing. The professor's realization that he might have to forfeit the passion and vivacity he experienced in his youth and compromise with a &quot;life without joy&quot; was very poignant and provoking. Cather's prose is intelligent, but fluid and concise. I think it will go on my list of a dozen or more most memorable novels."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"This review is about the edition, not the book.I made the mistake of ordering this edition for my class, thinking to save them money. Now I have no idea how I'm going to keep them on the same page (and I mean that quite literally). The Wilder edition is full of misprints and errors. An entire chapter is repeated twice! The editing is so incompetent that it makes the book painful to read.The novel itself is wonderful, but please give your money to a more responsible publisher."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"When I was younger I thought \\"My Antonia\\" was Cather's best novel. But the editions you find in bookstores now have gone back to the original, more bloated, and definitely inferior introduction to that book--Cather, had she been alive, would never have stood for it--and, maybe more importantly, I've gotten older. Older, I say, but by no means old, maybe just old enough that, like the professor of Cather's novel, I spend more time looking back--at nothing, to be sure, nothing--than I do looking ahead. Maybe that's why I now think \\"The Professor's House\\" is Cather at her finest.And since nobody else seems to have done so, I'd just like to mention that \\"The Professor's House\\" is also very witty, at times downright comic."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"I read this book in four or so hours straight. It was thefirst book I'd read by Willa Cather, but it definitely placed hersolidly in my top five greatest authors list. She's got a beautiful way with words. She's really romantic but manages to completely avert any cheesey-ness. I remember looking up after reading the last page of the novel; I felt totally displaced from my life. For that moment I was still utterly invested in the life of the family in _The Professor's House_. Read this one if you love Willa Cather, or if you've never read her before."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"I had a hard time deciding how to review The Professor's House. The plot itself is very straightforward and easy to describe. The characters are vivid and well-defined which adds to the realism of the novel. But it seems to me that the meat of this novel is in the themes and nuances.I have read some of Cather's short stories many years ago and only have vague memories of them other than a memory that she had exquisite attention to detail. As I read this book I found that memory to be true. The writing vibrantly presents minute details to the reader...from the shape and texture of a hand to the nature of a dress or necklace to the depiction of setting both in and out of doors.Her characters are likewise detailed. We are held at a close third person so we don't actually get into the characters' heads, but the detailed account of appearance and action allows the reader to feel very intimate with the characters.The layout of the book is interesting in that it consists of three \\"books.\\" The first book is entitled \\"The Family\\" and follows the Professor as he works to finish his own writing while teaching and balancing the various dramas unfolding in his life and the lives of his family members. The second book is \\"Tom Outland's Story\\" and is the first person narrative of Tom, an old student of the Professor and friend of the family who is now dead (from WWI) but left behind an invention and legacy that resulted in great wealth for one of the Professor's daughters. The final book is entitled \\"The Professor\\" and is a very short wrap up of the novel which focusses on thoughts, emotions and actions of the professor after he reads and ponders Outland's story.The overarching plot of the book is interesting if not terribly engaging. There were moments of drama and emotion that drew me in, but there were other segments that were almost boring with the mundane interactions.As I mentioned initially, the meat of the novel though isn't the plot itself, but the themes and emotions it instills.Looking to these themes, part of this book seems to be an exploration of emotional displacement and emotional paralysis or release. The Professor is very attached to his old house and his work and doesn't want to move into the new house with his family. Outland is almost a portrayal of a return to the past for the professor and in the end, Outland's story provides an almost existential release to the professor. The claustrophobia of the old house and the room in which the professor works serve as a metaphorical trap that is holding the professor hostage in his current/past life/behavior and causing emotional turmoil and angst from which he can't see a clear escape.At a higher, more sociological level, the novel portrays some interesting counterpoints on society. The Professor is doing well enough off teaching at the university and does even better once he receives an award for his writing. His two daughters are well enough off as well though one is moving into the \\"upper class\\" while the other is sitting fairly \\"middle.\\" The family interactions and conversations give interesting insight into the class reactions of the era and some of the internal and external results of class mobility. As the professor's daughter and son-in-law gain their wealth and rise to a higher social status, there are jealousies and even some resentment and anger both within and outside of the family.Looking at the writing, it is clear that there are MANY levels at work in this novel. Cather's frequent use of color helps categorize different themes or values. Her descriptions of the houses, rooms and other settings set the balance between the different classes or social situations. To further illustrate that NOTHING appears to be arbitrary in this book, it was pointed out to me that there is particular significance in the name of the ship that Outland takes to the war, the name of the ship that the Professor's family returns home on, and even the book that Outland uses to study latin.So, even though the book's plot isn't terribly engaging, I can see this work as having a lot of valuable insight into the social and mental ideas of the 1920s, many of which have relevance today especially given the almost parallel economic situation around us.While it's not likely something I'd read over and over, it is something I can recommend to those interested in human behavior, the 1920s, or life in general. Cather paints a vivid and beautiful picture of a family...not a perfectly adjusted and blissfully happy family, but a realistic, flawed and interesting family."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"I came to the works of Willa Cather by way of my father, who was a deep admirer of her books, especially after he read The Song of the Lark. I knew that Cather wrote about the immigrant experience, but after having finished The Professor's House, I realized that her talent in capturing the nuances of the human experience was not solely limited to the immigrant life. It was just one slice of the pie that she happened to address. There is so much more to her books than I had judged, and admittedly, The Professor's House set me straight.In life there are pitch-perfect moments, and when they arise, they are sometimes just so good you don't ever want to let them go. They are that euphoric bubble of bliss where everything is just right, not blemished nor off kilter. And those moments are few and far between. Yet, when they happen, we thirst for them. However, what happens when that bubble bursts? For many, the typical pattern is to become isolated and cope the best way possible. We try to accept and conform to what has been dealt even though we may not like it. Others flat-out rebel until their heads are through the wall, unyielding and defiant to the bitter end.Now meet Godfrey St. Peter, husband, father, academic and writer; for the most part, he is an affable and compromising fellow. But in some regards he is not. He has his loyalty to his old study, what for him is his security blanket. It represents his life and how he came to be who he was. His study is simple and not overly adorned, but the things in there represent the tangible moments of his life and successes. And that is a comforting sense of fulfillment that he has rightfully earned. As the novel progresses, Professor St. Peter is forced to face an unpleasant onslaught of challenges in which he is looped into. His way of life is gradually being yanked away from him by the enemies of materialism, loneliness, new vs. old generation values, to simply being an old man. What is particularly moving is that all these battles are coming from within the family context. They are moving forward, but in so doing, they are leaving the past absolutely behind, not giving it an iota of concern or appreciation. When collected, it is all so dense and overwhelming St. Peter just wants an out, even if it goes contradictory to what his name represents: \\"Rock\\". He's tired of reflecting upon his family woes, the memory of Tom Outland (who gets the story off the ground), of missed opportunities... They all pile atop each other and thus causes St. Peter to be apathetic towards his own life: \\"When St. Peter at last awoke, the room was pitch-black and full of gas. He was cold and numb, felt sick and rather dazed. The long anticipated coincidence had happened, he realized. The storm had blown the stove out and the window shut. The thing to do was to get up and open the window. But suppose he did not get up--? How far was a man required to exert himself against accident? How would such a case be decided under English law? He hadn't lifted his hand against himself--was he required to lift it for himself?\\" Pages 251-252.Ultimately, perseverance does prevail, but there is a lot of residual that needs to be sorted out. Whether young or old, all people have conflicts that bombard and oppress them. Professor Godfrey St. Peter is a survivor. Even though (to me) he is a very heroic figure, I personally don't think he wants to be one. But he copes: \\"...he could face with fortitudd...the future.\\" Page 258. Overall, The Professor's House was a great read with many worthwhile lessons to be gleaned."},{"Title":"The professor's house","review":"This is one of the most extraordinary novels I have ever read.

In _Android at Arms_, the Mengians, heirs of the Psychocrats, have snatched about a dozen VIPs from their homeworlds over a period of years, always on the brink of momentous events - e.g. important trade negotiations, designations of heirs. Each victim was replaced by a ringer - an android duplicate. Now a gigantic electrical storm has disabled the security of the prison where they've been held (in some cases, for many years). None remember their capture or imprisonment, having been held in suspended animation and subjected to hypnocasters.Or have they?Which are the androids, and which are the originals? How can you tell, when the androids were crafted to be *perfect* duplicates?We follow Andas, heir presumptive to the throne of Inyanga, a world settled many centuries ago during one of the first &quot;outspreads&quot; from Earth. By chance, Inyanga is closer to the prison planet than any other captive's homeworld, so the escapees head for sanctuary - only to find that even more time has passed than they thought, and that captivity hasn't united them.Andas, having formed a friendship with Yolyos, a Salariki fellow prisoner, takes Yolyos into the secret ways of Inyanga's Triple Towers, the sprawling palace complex from which the Emperor rules a world - a city within a city. They venture even into the Flower Courts of the women - where death 'stalks more ruthlessly than the Emperor's dungeons.'Inyanga's culture is drawn from African elements, rather than the more usual European-based fantasy. Exploring the culture and the political problems faced by Andas will keep you entertained as the prisoners try to cope with the Mengians' riddle - what is the nature of a man?If you can't tell which is the android and which is the man - does the difference really matter?"},{"Title":"Android at arms","review":"Android At Arms is a singleton novel set in the Psychocrat universe, a subset of the primary future history. Lightning strikes a building on an otherwise uninhabited world and the residents are stunned senseless. Awaking, they find themselves in unfamiliar surroundings and company. All the power is off and the robots found within the building are standing immobile.In discussing their situation, they conclude that they have been under the influence of an inhibitor, which muddles the mind. As they exchange information, the last date remembered by each of the residents differs over a range of decades. Moreover, each was involved in some time-sensitive activity. Then one of them tells of a rumor he has heard of a service that, for a suitable fee, offers to replace selected persons with programmed androids. Since each of the residents remembers being a person of consequence, they wonder if they are the originals or the androids.In this novel, Imperial Prince Andas of Inyanga awakes in a gray box with very simple furniture and dressed in a coarse one-piece coverall. He assumes that the building must be a prison, but the door is standing half-open. He finds other residents, including the aliens Demizonda Elys of Posedonia and Lord Yolyos of Sargol as well as Arch Chief Tsiwon of Naul, Veep Turpyn of the Guild, and Chief Councilor Grasty of Thrisk. Together, these six crowd into an automated supply ship and divert it to Inyanga. However, the Guild Veep has a trick up his sleeve.In this story, Andas eventually returns to Inyanga, but finds that many years have passed since his own time. Another Andas sits on the throne as Emperor and his men hunt Andas and Yolyos. Though they escape the hunters, another power haunts Andas' dreams and draws him through a opening between timelines into a strange Inyanga where his counterpart is also hunted, but by the followers of the Old Woman.This novel is obviously related to other books by the author, including the Psychocrat connection with Ice Crown. The similarities with the Solar Queen series include the Salariki of Plague Ship as well as the cultural parallels with the African settlers of Voodoo Planet. The mentions of Zacathans, the Guild and Jacks tie in with most other works in the future history.This story is typical of the author's quest plotlines, with a strong destiny component. The author foreshadows most of the twists, but some seem a bit contrived. Overall, however, this novel is a good, if not great, adventure story with an interesting puzzle at its heart.Highly recommended for Norton fans and for anyone else who enjoys mystery quest tales with a young determined protagonist.-Arthur W.

It helps put Jeffeson in his place as a being in the 19th century rather than the 21st. Does it condone his attitudes? No. It puts them into perspective, a great talen of Dr. Freehling's. I know the title is the Founding Fathers and slavery, but this little work (13 pages)is mainly one founding father's objections to and support of slavery. If you want something that details the positions of Madison, Jay, Hamilton, Washington and all the others that can be placed under this heading, look elsewhere. That is not to say anyone with a little interest in the subject will not be educated and entertained, but don't expect a broad spectrum. Expect instead detail on one father and an overview of the influence of the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance. If you have trouble locating this article you may contact me. I don't sell it but I can advise how to get a copy. If you know Bill's work, this will not surprise you. If you don't, you are in for a happy introduction. Thank you William W. Freehling.--Barrie W.

Both are geared more towards the advanced screenwriter and those who've had essays of structure and characterization up to the gills and are now ready to write something good.One caution here: If you are looking to teach you zen, forget about it. Go buy a book on zen. If you are looking for more advanced thoughts and exploration on screenwriting, this book is it. William Froug is a wonderful teacher with much wisdom and experience to share.Similar to another book of his, &quot;Screenwriters on Screenwriting&quot;, you see writing through the eyes of the accomplished screenwriter, which can be very helpful for the aspiring writer to pace their careers, goals, dreams and life accordingly.

All others are obsolete and should be dispensed of at once. Screenwriting is an artform born of individual expression and intuion, not a technique. Great writing comes only from the heart!This wonderful book of insight and interviews will help the reader abandon conventionality and follow thier own unique intuition.

The main characters are the down-and-outers and no-hopers born into the cruel urban world where survival of the fittest is the law of the land: Apollo the male prostitute, Casio -- the injured bouncer, Baby Pop -- the streetwise kid with big dreams and no way to realize them. Minor characters are those who exploit this class directly and live by a set of laws that is far from civil and often more malicious than those they consider themselves above: Mrs. Huxton -- the wealthy widow who makes big money from porn, Tina -- the drag queen who has managed to get ahead by running bars and after-hours clubs, as well as the several pushers, johns, and denizens who populate this world. This book works at times like a documentary and at others it is nothing but great story-telling. It gives us a look into the minds of society's cast-offs and brings us to examine our own views and our relations to these people. It reminded me many times of &quot;Querelle&quot; by Genet because of its simple exposition and matter-of-factness. And the scope put me to mind of certain works by Dickens where we see many levels of society and their inter-workings.

This is a story of a Times Square that doesn't exist anymore, and has been driven more underground.Bruce Benderson is an important American writer. He tells the story of Apollo, heroin user and hustler, and his long descent into his private hell. Apollo's story is both tragic and tender. We care about what happens to him. Benderson brings us into his real life.The fragmented narrative which switches point of view from character to character: from third person to first and to a stream of collective consciousnessthat forms a mosaic that both outlines &quot;being on drugs&quot; and creates a realism of urban strength.Apollo gets in a fight with Casio, a bouncer, and that sends Casio to the hospital. This makes Casio's son, Baby Pop, want to seek revenge on Apollo. Baby Pop is Benderson's very original and moving creation, who lives in the bus terminal at Port Authority. He studies math and dreams of going to college.Apollo is on the run, spiraling down deeper into the bowels of Times Square and Port Authority. This book has strength and is rich in deatil, written directly, and with great heart and compassion, recalling the better days of that other underworld figure and prisoner, Jean Genet.Bruce Benderson definitelt shows us the frontiers in a wolrd where people only pretend to be hard. This is also a farewell song to old Times Square that has been captured in such movies as Taxi Driver. That sleazy urban cesspool has been bought up by Disney and turned into a mall.

And they express exquisite pain.The book will cure anyone who still thinks that NATO bombing of Kosovo was good.I'm especially struck by the raw treatment the Roma people suffered at the hands of their Muslim countrymen and British NATO troops, alike. One of the sharpest poems here is \\"Three Days of Freedom.\\" The Roma narrator explains that the war ended on June 12, and he celebrated for three days with his compatriots--until NATO troops came with Albanians. Then came renewed warfare, directed specifically at the Roma. Their homes were sacked and burned. They suffered...hand grenade attacks,/kidnappings, killings.The Albanians, moreover, lied to NATO, that the Roma \\"were war criminals\\" and had \\"collaborated with the Serbs.\\" Albanians captured lone Roma men and threw them alive into wells, where the falls of the lucky ones were cushioned by their Roma brethren, whom Albanians had dispatched before them. Their former neighbors, whose babies they'd delivered,threatened/to cut our throats if we did/not leave their country.Their country, though Roma had been there for nearly 700 years, brought by Muslims as slaves. The three days the Roma got of freedom, says the narrator, was all they ever knew.The Albanian KLA even took over the Mother Theresa relief agency, from which they funneled donations to theformer fatigue-dressed/terrorists financed by the Albanian drug/cartels in Rome, Paris and Geneva.The Albanians wouldn't even let the Roma bury their dead on their own land.Meanwhile, the British troops withheld fire trucks from burning Roma homes, since Albanian interpreters said the Roma had burnt their own houses so the troops would build them new ones.Albanian murders of Roma, the NATO troops dismissed, \\"until I showed them the bodies;\\" descriptions of the Albanian killers, the troops did not record. They merely sent surviving victims home.All the Roma kidnapped in Prishtina--yes, kidnapped, even two months after the NATO forces arrived--were left rotting in the woods and garbage dump near Gllogoc.As for assurances that mines had been cleared, the British said, \\"You can't hide/ anything from the Gypos.\\" To British medics, wounded Roma children were only \\"buffaloes.\\"Why should any democratic government recognize Kosovo?--Alyssa A.

We used it in Geology (specifically, geomorphology- the study of landforms) but it also has applications in geography, conservation, forestry, and surveying.The best part of the book is its organization by type of landform: wind action (dunes), ground water (Karst topography), mass movements (landslides, slumping, and flows), glaciers, effects of glaciation (U-shaped valleys, moraines, kettles, drumlines, cirques, etc.), lakes, marshes, and abondoned shorelines, desert land forms, marine coastlines, stream deposits (meanders, oxbow lakes, braided channels, and deltas), stream erosion and erosion cycles, volcanic features, and meteor crators. There is also a section on lithology (descriminating of rock types.) In addition there are sections on vegitation types, soils, and cultural features and urban areas. All of these subject areas are illustrated by multiple examples.You will of course need a stereoscope to use this book, but the inexpensive student model will work just fine. In fact, the vertical exageration really makes the features \\"pop\\" out- even to the untrained eye. You will be able to spot most types of landforms from the air after studying this book, as well as, outcrops of strata and structures. This is a big help in preliminary mapping- and prospecting- surveys."},{"Title":"Aerial Stereo Photographs","review":"Brilent book for geomorphology study that allows you to see land scapes in 3d look by using stereoscope, great seller.. Thanx"},{"Title":"Your Future: a Guide To Modern Astrology","review":"I learned about Sidney K. Bennett by reading the works of Carl Payne Tobey, and was happy to find a book by him on the web, being as unheard of as he is. The book, though I couldn't find the original date on the copyright information, was apparently written in 1930, and as a result does not have any information on the new-at-the-time celestial body known as Pluto, which was slightly disappointing, but is not the main problem with the book.After learning the teachings of Carl Payne Tobey, I found Mr. Bennett's use of the Placidus system and Aries/Counterclockwise count to the zodiac distracting, and while those are the default of almost every astrology book out there, I expected better from one of Carl Payne Tobey's associates. This was apparently prior to his association with Mr. Tobey. The description of the houses must therefore be taken with a grain of salt, and focus should be directed less toward corresponding signs, and more toward actual independent observations, of which there are many in this book.One of the most confusing, but later intriguing parts of this book was Mr. Bennett's very distinctive style of chart interpretation, which is difficult to describe without quoting from the book. Suffice to say, it's partially based on counting the natural house placements of planets in each sign, never mind the houses set by the natives Ascendant. For example, the Moon is in it's first-house sign in Cancer, it's second-house sign in Leo, third-house Virgo, and so on. What he's talking about when he describes them this way is their reaction to each sign, and which one's they're more comfortable in compared to others. It's dignities and debilities to the extreme. I've never seen it done that way before, and after I wrapped my head around it, it became very interesting, however it's difficult for a beginner like myself to utilize.To illustrate his style of interpretation, I quote this paragraph from his bit on Max Schmeling, a boxer: \\"His ruler is Jupiter, because the sign on the Ascendant is Sagittarius, and Jupiter is the ruling planet of this sign; we see it angular and in Gemini, the sign of the hands and the clever, lower mind. Mars is rising in the Ascendant, showing he can fight, for Mars is the fighters' planet. Mars here is in Sagittarius, its second-house sign, indicates money that he can gather by his scrapping abilities; while the entertaining Venus both disposes of his Sun (rules the sign occupied by his Sun) and rules his occupation (tenth house). Venus in Virgo at the cusp of the ninth is not only in its own fifth-house sign, but it actually rules his mundane fifth, hence his success as both a fighter and entertainer of the public. Saturn, ruling his second (money), is located in its own second-house sign at the cusp of the third, the hands and clever mind again.\\"You'll notice the bold generalizations he sometimes uses, like by referring to the second house simply as the house of money. Sometimes he will brush over a certain placement with vague generalizations, and active thought is sometimes necessary to fully understand his conclusions, so I recommend that you don't read this book while tired or distracted. After sufficient contemplation this book will reveal a lot of information that you didn't notice the first time over. I haven't yet gone through the entire book a second time, yet, but I have read and re-read many of the sections and discovered new things in them. We must remember that Mr. Bennett was much more accustomed to his way of thinking than we are, and every astrologer has a different way of examining a chart. They all take getting used to.Mr. Bennett was apparently an odd person, and I know this because of the strange characteristics suggested by his writing. He obviously thought very highly of what he had said in this book, but apparently had very low self-esteem as a person. His intimate writing style was unusual, and somewhat distracting, but came off honestly, and as more of a deficiency with writing than with personality. In the book he is subject to self-righteous rants about at-the-time modern society and the information being fed to the coming generations. He seemed to be very passionate about his work.I recommend this book to people who are interested in a different perspective on astrology. It includes very interesting interpretations on the effects of the distant planets (Jupiter through Neptune) in the houses, the meaning of the Elements in us as people, and a compelling look at the case of Ruth Snyder and many other people. It also has a guide on erecting your own horoscope just in case you only browse the web on your phone and you can't use the online chart generators.\\"Your Future: A Guide to Modern Astrology\\" is an interesting second read."},{"Title":"Open Gate","review":"David Adam, Vicar of the Holy Isles, has two special ministries.

I also loved Jenny as the homeless woman that their lives touched on their journey to a happy tomorrow for them all."},{"Title":"Swept Away (Arabesque)","review":"This is the first book I've read by Gwynne Forster and I have to say I can't wait to get my hands on all the others. Mrs. Forster wasn't dubbed a romance icon for nothing. This book was in a word, &quot;Magnificant&quot;. I enjoyed her cut to the chase writing style. There's no beating around the bush with this novel.OOH! The chemistry between Veronica and Schyler was just &quot;all that&quot;. Love poured off the two of them from the moment they met.I use romance novels as and escape from the real world every now and then. I thank you, Mrs. Forster, for the respite."},{"Title":"Swept Away (Arabesque)","review":"Veronica &amp; Schyler were meant to be together. I thought it was really funny that before Veronica's mother Ester died, she told her to find her father and that she was sorry. Because of Veronica's resources, she found him. When she went to confront him, she got the surprise of her life. Schyler opened her father's front door. This was the beginning of alot of confusion for her.Schyler was also a person that liked helping people. He was driven to make sure childrent that were in foster care were treated with care from those foster parents. He felted blessed to be Richard Henderson's son. He didn't think in a million years that Richard's long lost daughter was Veronica Overton (the woman he couldn't get out of his head).I loved all the characters in this book. I especially liked Jenny the homeless woman that was actually the Seamtress Extraordinare.Ms. Forester always brings books to us that not only are senuous, but have wonderful meanings about family, trust and love."},{"Title":"Swept Away (Arabesque)","review":"Veronica Overton cannot believe she has come under the spell of the man who has almost destroyed her professional integrity. When Schuyler Henderson of Advocates for the Child , who is also an engineer, takes her to court because a young girl Veronica's agency has placed goes astray, she is determined to clear her name and the reputation of the Agency. But when they look into each other's eyes, time stands still. Again, Ms. Forster has created a tale enveloping romantic chemistry, compelling secondary characters, and twist and turns in a plot that intrigues. A definite pleaser."},{"Title":"Swept Away (Arabesque)","review":"If you have ever been impacted by family secrets during your adulthood, then this is a book you will want to read. This was such an interesting book done so well by this author giving you nothing but a memorable story about Veronica Overton and Schyler Henderson. The book offers the reader both major and minor plots that binding them together makes such an enjoyable book to read. When you get to that last page you should be in a position to say it was well worth the read. Gwynne mostly deals with issues that may be experienced by a more mature audience but even if you're younger there are some interesting life lessons present in her books. If you enjoy this one and have not read some of her other published books check out these: Beyond Desire, Fools Rush In, Obsession, Naked Soul, Against The Wind, Against All Odds, Ecstasy and Sealed With A Kiss."},{"Title":"Swept Away (Arabesque)","review":"This was the most HORRIBLE story! The way the characters spoke and the phrases the author chose were cliche and overly sappy. I felt like the parts the author should have fleshed out we're vague and for people in their thirtys who are so honest the way they dealt with one another was ridiculous. I especially couldn't stand how Veronica related to her bio dad. A man you've never known and you call him father right off the bat??? Um no. I would not recommend this book to anyone! Ever!"},{"Title":"Swept Away (Arabesque)","review":"Gwynne Forster is a hit or miss author. This book was definitely a miss. I couldn't believe it took the whole book before she asked for the truth. It had ok moments but overall boring."},{"Title":"Swept Away (Arabesque)","review":"This is a re-read for me, originally read 11/2010.It was really painful to read. Although the attraction was written on the pages between Schyler and Veronica I just couldn't feel the chemistry when reading it. I also think the characters were written way beyond their years. Veronica was only 32, and Schyler 36 and he said things like:\\"I'm a man who believes in making people live up to their notices, and I've got a fistful of yours. You with me?\\"and\\"I go for a woman who has a hearty appetite and doesn't pick over the food. It doubles my pleasure in her company\\"I know this book was originally published in 2000, but I don't think women would go for these lines then or now. Veronica had some awful punchlines as well. The 2nd time around I tried really hard, but just couldn't force myself to finish this one. Too bad though, because the story had a lot of potential to be a really good love story."},{"Title":"Longarm and the Ungrateful Gun (Longarm, No. 327)","review":"Like I've said in some of my other reviews,there's no telling what a Longarm series episode is going to be like. This one is about the weirdest written story I've come across yet. I got the impression that they had a bunch of material that had been rounded up,then appointed a committee of about 6 to somehow churn out an episode from it all.The story line is simple enough,where Longarm goes to pick up a prisoner and return him to Denver. The prisoner escapes and the rest of the novel chases after him and ends with his demise. The story drifts all over the place explaining how many things in the Old West worked. Actually, these bits of scattered history and explanations were good reading and informative. I wish I'd kept track of all the people and events that are brought into the story, as I am sure there were a bundle.There had to be about 40 or 50 names mentioned.This along with at least 25 characters Longarm meets and deals with in the story. Explanations run rampant throughout the book covering numerous things such as; retirement,King Ranch,guns sorbet,horse apples,dry dusters,Arbunkle coffee,Land Managment Office,all kinds of explanations on names such as Singer Wells,Tweety Bird,Rom the Tinker,times for various modes of travel,a bit of poetry,bartering on buying a horse,a Yellowboy,refrigeration and ice making;and much,much more.There are a string of characters and a bevy of beauties developed and scattered throughout the story.Too bad we don't get illustrations,as they seemed very interesting.Oh yeah,what about the story and catching up with the ecaped prisoner.This is where the \\"6 person committee\\" came into play. After most of the book was taken up with all this other stuff,they decided to wrap the story up in the end with a convoluted explanation similar to a mystery \\"who dunnit\\"Just goes to show you what you get when you gather up a bunch of stuff, then turn it over to a committee and have it churn out a book.I don't know if that was really the case;but that is the impression I was left with."},{"Title":"Wicked Fix: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"In Eastport, Maine Jacobia &quot;Jake&quot; Tiptree has earned the life she wanted for herself and her son and is contented with her current situation. Jake can even deal with her former husband Victor although she occasionally wishes it were from the other side of the continent rather than in Eastport.Jacobia, Wade (her significant other), her friend Ellie, Victor, and a few other people go to a restaurant where they run into the town's bad boy, Reuben Tate. Surprisingly, Victor and Tate exchange heated words. Even more shocking is when Jake and Ellie find the murdered corpse of Reuben in the town cemetery. His throat is slit open. The weapon is a surgeon's scalpel traced to Victor,s medical paraphernalia collection. The police arrest the obvious suspect forcing the loyal and responsible Jacobia accompanied by Ellie, to make inquires. They quickly learn that Reuben has no friends but a plethora of enemies elated to hear that the man is finally dead. There are so many suspects Jake begins to doubt she will ever find the real perpetrator but she keeps on searching because she believes that Victor is not a murderer.Sarah Graves captures the essence of small town Maine with an uncanny insight that turns WICKED FIX into a fun, page-turning read. The cast consists of a horde of eccentric characters that are indigenous to the region. The protagonist is a strong, down-to-earth person who the audience will identify with but they will also wonder why she goes to such extraordinary lengths to clear Victor of the charges against him. The who-done-it is an enjoyable regional cozy that succeeds because Ms. Graves makes the inhabitants of Eastport seem so genuine and alive.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wicked Fix: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":". . .you'll know that something wicked this way comes, when you pick up this delicious book! Third in the Mainely Murder Mysteries, Sarah Graves just swoops you right into her world of Eastport Maine and doesn't let you go until she's good and ready.Wicked here is personified by Reuben Tate, a native Eastporter who's come back to visit for the annual Salmon Festival. Or, maybe just to make trouble, at which he specializes with a capital S and a capital T, as well. Actually, he doesn't really need an excuse; he just likes to stir things up. And does he ever!Jacobia Tiptree is the kind of clever, capable woman most other women would like to have as a friend, and when she hurts, you hurt, also. It doesn't take long in this book for Jacobia to be hurting in a big way. Used to standing on her own two feet, it never dawns on her that her best friend Ellie Carpenter is exactly the same kind of woman as Jake is herself, and the two of them together are formidable, indeed.Except, of course, when Reuben's evil ways have been passed along to one of his disciples, who enlarges on them in his own unique fashion. Jake and her new love Wade, her son Sam, her former husband Victor, her friends Ellie and George, plus many of the townsfolk appear in this book, and by the end, they'll all be your good friends, too. Or you'll wish they were, just because they're such wonderful people. Even Victor has some saving graces.This is not a cozy novel, however, and if you prefer non-violent, non-graphic wickedness, then maybe you won't care for it as much as I do. But then, I don't usually like those elements either. These books succeed on every level, however, the writing is purely superb; lyrical and expressive, while the characters are so strong they breathe! You'll be able to smell the sea, it's so much a part of the setting, not to mention the lobster and the salmon and the . . . just another reason for that 'delicious' in the first sentence of this book. I think I've recommended these books to everyone I know. My only grumble is that I can read the book faster than the author can write it. I tried to slow down, but I just couldn't--I HAD to know the who and the how and the why. And I had to know it, now."},{"Title":"Wicked Fix: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"I enjoyed this book. It is the first one in this series that I have read. I plan to read the 2 previous books now as well.I enjoyed the characters. Jacobia is a smart amateur sleuth. She and Ellie are a great team for investigating. She is a newcomer to the area but was knowledgeable about the area and with Ellie's help got the locals to talk to her.Her exhusband is an unlikeable fellow and I was glad he wasn't too involved in the story.I would like to see a little more interaction with her son Sam and her boyfriend Wade.I felt this story was very good. I did have an inkling as to who did it before it ended, but I wasn't sure.I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Wicked Fix: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"I live in the area that is described in the Eastport mysteries -work in Lubec, sing in Eastport, travel the roads, frequent the restaurants, and sometimes think I recognize elements of Grave's characters in my neighbors. This is a great but disturbing read. Great, because this author writes a good mystery with relevant characters and she is a skilled story teller. Disturbing because of the reality that the themes in this book have for me as a counselor in this area.What is disturbing about this mystery for me is the number of characters who die, the violence of their deaths, and the chilling denouement. These are all appropriate to the subject matter, however, and if you view fiction as an allegory for real life, a form that is both entertaining and informative, the very intensity and scope of the violence in this work of fiction are indicative of the harm that sustained child abuse can create both in the individual psyche and in the culture at large.I prefer to have only one murder victim in a mystery; too many murders seem gratuitous and detract from the plotline (for me). As a pacifist, one of the things I like about murder mysteries is the symbolic way we can vanquish the enemy without actually harming anyone. To feel OK about enjoying a story in which people are killed, however, I need to feel a character's death is \\"justified.\\" That wasn't always the case here.Throughout this book I kept wondering why a superfluous character in a bar was killed ... he didn't seem to fit. Though he appeared to be a loser and a bum, I have known many men like him who have come up hard, have lived hard, and who have no where to go. While I find it impossible to like them, I do feel compassion for them. Where is the possibility of redemption if we kill such weak and ineffectual characters off?I was also offended, a first with this author, by the description of a character as physically unattractive and hairy and ape like. Harping on physical characteristics that one has no control over seemed prejudicial and it was a jarring note in this author's otherwise wise and compassionate approach to characterization. The venomous description was out of character for the author and I wondered why this hadn't been edited out. These are minor points, however. It was the subject matter itself that left me pondering for days ...The ending was disturbing in that a child was involved in such violence; where will this lead her? I see the results of this violence in developing children. I feel uneasy about murder mysteries that involve children, though the scene with the rag doll at the town celebration was chillingly real, as were the instances of child bullying, if not the actual child murder. Also, the crime of omission, the preacher not protecting a child who desperately needed relief from ongoing abuse, this was also close enough to reality to have a tinge of despair set in.But perhaps this isn't bad. Good fiction can inform us about social problems as well as entertain. We need to wake up to child abuse and its life long effects. We need to have the courage to take a stand against violence, even when it may make us more vulnerable, or we may lose status, or friendships, or family we love.Not all things are sad in this story. Wade is a rock; there are actually fishermen (and other men) in Maine like him. Men of few words and great integrity. Wouldn't that be something nice to clone! The women are strong and resourceful and the kids are realistic, so like the kids I know and work with. Not bad, not good, but people in the making, youth in need of guidance and positive role models. The cop is a nice, fair guy, and he loves and respects his attorney wife - no macho testrionics there. In fact strong women abound in these books, and not at the expense of the male characters, who remain true to life, fully fledged, feeling, conflicted, and often noble human beings.We actually do not have many murders in Maine - it's one of the safest states to live in. But we do have all the problems that plague the rest of the country; we are, perhaps, more aware of them because there are so few of us in any one place. The victims of abuse are people we know, intimately, as are the perpetrators. This was a brave book. It's easy to write flighty stories about things that don't really matter. I commend this author for taking on a difficult topic and still making a good, readable story while forcing us to look more honestly at ourselves, and to motivate us to find a way to change."},{"Title":"Wicked Fix: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"Jacobia Tiptree gives up Wall Street to move to a small Maine town in order to remove her teenaged son from the less-than-desirable influences. She buys a fixer-it-upper that never seems to be fixed up. When a vicious ex-resident returns, the townspeople are none too happy about it. When he is found dead, the evidence seems to point to Jacobia's ex-husband. While she doesn't exactly wish him well, she knows that he's not capable of cold-blooded murder. In order to prove that, she has to discover who the murderer really is. This series gets better with each outing.

New readers will want all three books but they can be read in any order."},{"Title":"Wicked Fix: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"Sarah Graves writes with humor and wit. Her charachters are a little offbeat and unforgetable. With a page turning plot she captures the feel of Downeast Maine (described as a world apart) to a tee. She will not only leave you begging for more adventures of Eastport's Jacobia Tiptree and friends, but will also instill a longing in you to visit this seacoast town and perhaps have a bite to eat at the Waco Diner."},{"Title":"Wicked Fix: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"While I didn't find this book to be as interesting as Triple Witch, I just wanted to comment on the much-improved writing by the author. I'd complained before about the distracting overuse of commas in Graves' other two books; I'm pleased to see that this book flowed nicely.Despite my not enjoying Wicked Fix as much as Triple Witch, I would read Graves again. She gives her characters a good amount of depth and her dialogue and narrative is very witty."},{"Title":"Wicked Fix: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"I am in the process of reading the fifth in Sarah Graves Home Repair Mysteries. I just enjoy the way she describes the characters, especially her ex-husband and the town of Eastport, Maine. In this book, there are a series of &#34;happenings&#34; that finally lead to the town's bully/psycho, who enjoyed making his target terrified of him while he was blackmailing the target, getting killed himself.

This entry is a good read, but not as good as Dead Cat Bounce or Triple Witch. The reason for the first two murders is plausible, but the other actions of the murderer are a bit \\"out there\\", even for this series.Then there is Victor. I think its a good idea that Graves toned him down on this entry, but this new personality is really not in line with what we know of him from other books. Here he is described as being so caring and concerned with what the town people think of him. But this is the exact opposite of what we have learned before. Victor has been described previously as nothing short of a psychopath. This is the guy that medicated himself into a heart attack when Jake filed for divorce, sent his mother a dead animal when he found out she was still sending Jake birthday cards after the divorce and has terrorized Jake and Sam for years. Sure, he used to be a great surgeon and seems to care for his patients, but outside of his work he is a viscious bully.I really found it hard to believe that Jake was funding Victor's medical center. Yes, it will be a good thing for the community and for Victor, but it would be totally in keeping with Victor's past actions to refuse to return her money, no matter how much money he makes. And, he was a high raking surgeon for goodness sakes, how come Jake has to keep bailing him out financially when he should be as wealthy as she, if not more?Bottom line on Victor for me - less is more. I'm hoping that Jake soon makes a complete break with him emotionally and stops acting like his wife/mother. Like at the end of this book when Victor is going through the items on her dresser. Instead of telling him to back off Jake gets furious and says NOTHING. Ellie and Wade have to put him in his place.I did enjoy the way Wade showed Victor that he and Jake are a couple. But, Jake is going to have to do the same, limiting the amount of influence she allows Victor to have on her life. I wouldn't mind Victor making brief appearances in future books, but only brief ones."},{"Title":"Wicked Fix: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"I have either read or listened to the audio version of all the books in this series.

Just as the doors were a mystery until the advent of the Sugerman book.If any one is interested in the music scene, primarily in los angeles during the late sixties, this is the book!I had a similar background to the author, except I'm from the working class with lower expectations, unlike the author who was from the middle class. I had a state scholarship to the university, because of my low income family. Back then in los angeles a lot was expected from drummers -- \\"play wipe out kid!\\". Anyway, I think \\"Love\\" is the most underrated group ever. Remember that the summer of love was just two years after the historic watts riot in los angeles. I too am guilty of not noticing arthur lee's greatness until seeing him perform on DVD in London in 2003, subsequent to rhino's release of the \\"love story\\" CD. All I remember of love from the analog days is \\"little red book\\" (vaguely) and of course \\"7 & 7.\\" Also, \\"da capo\\" as the #1 album playing during a party. Speaking of drummers in los angeles, the Keith moon book is still rather expensive --- I haven't yet been able to find a used one on Amazon reasonably priced. I think I actually saw moon in a movie theatre (one screen back then) in Tujunga (los angeles county). This would be the early seventies. A young guy a few years older than I came into the theatre dressed as Hitler, even wearing a uniform!Who else but moon? (I read he liked to go around wearing a Hitler costume). If moon had appeared like that on Fairfax ave (Hollywood), he would have ended up in the hospital! In conclusion and getting back to the subject (\\"Love\\"), you cannot escape the forever changes!"},{"Title":"Love: Behind the Scenes: On the Pegasus Carousel with the Legendary Rock Group Love","review":"This book is an interesting first person perspective on the great band Love durings its heyday in the mid-60s. The author joined the group in time to play on Da Capo and Forever Changes, two of the greatest albums ever recorded. You get the highs and the lows, the ups and the downs of a band that refused to tour to support its music, and when it did tour, usually wound up late for gigs or without one member of the band on stage. The picture of Arthur Lee that emerges is most probably accurate, but not pretty. No one can question his musical ability as a singer and a songwriter, but as a bandleader, he clearly needed some direction. Drugs played an inevitable part in the demise of the band, as it did with so many others. The theme that runs through the book is whether or not Love was Arthur Lee or the combination of musicians who worked together to make such wonderful music. In the end, the answer is probably \\"yes\\", Arthur Lee was Love. Certainly, with his passing, the band has ceased to exist. I enjoyed the book and the first hand accounts of the life and times of one of my favorite rock combos. Be prepared for the all too well known sad ending, although Michael Stuart-Ware seems to have made a good life for himself after music."},{"Title":"Love: Behind the Scenes: On the Pegasus Carousel with the Legendary Rock Group Love","review":"An excellent bookBe forewarned tho - theres not much on the music. Stuart joined the game late (during da capo) and wasn't one of the principal songwriters. You won't get much info on what the songs meanHowever, he was there during the peak of Love (Forever Changes) so his story is invaluable. He talks about the members of the band, and you get a real feel as to who these people were. He lived with Snoopy, then Echols. It does not appear he ever lived at the famous Castle (\\"sitting on a hillside, watching all the people die\\" as it were) but he was there and he saw what was going onThe main reason the band broke up is: drugs. Which this book makes painfully clear. Mike left the music biz after auditioning for Neil Diamond (!) and gave up on Love after touring (briefly) with Arthur in the late 60s with the Four Sail guys (along with Echols - who hocked his instrument)Which, basically, explains the title (Pegasus Carousel - the band wouldn't have gone anywhere, would have just gone round and round if Stuart had stayed with Arthur and Love)Now Stuart is one of the few members of Love to survive. Its not clear if hes still playing (the book is a few years old, and a revised edition would be nice). I understand Snoopy has just done a solo cd (his song is one of the dvd extras on the recent release on the band, Love StoryEchols is still playing (still working on Gethesemene, the follow up to FChanges). But Arthur passed in 2006, Bryan passed in 1998, and Kenny & Tjay are long gone as well.

It is a \\"must\\" addition to your rock library."},{"Title":"Love: Behind the Scenes: On the Pegasus Carousel with the Legendary Rock Group Love","review":"There isn't much I can say about this fabulous book that hasn't already been said by other reviewers here. Stuart-Ware is an exceptional storyteller, and though as one reader noted, his work lacks the polish of a professional writer's, I would read an exceptionally engrossing tale such as this one over a well-written doorstopper any day. And yes, I wish he had discussed the recording of *Forever Changes* in much greater detail, but what might be cited as a flaw in this instance points to a much greater overall virtue: this book leaves you wanting more, not because it isn't satisfying, but precisely because it is. As I see it, he could have written a book twice this long and, assuming it was as engrossing as what we see in *Pegasus Carousel*, it wouldn't take any longer to read because it would be that enthralling.One hardly need be a Love fan to enjoy this memoir. Of course it helps, but on a much larger level, this book is for anyone who loves rock music and is fascinated by both the creativity of great musicians and their tendency toward dissipation. Likewise it's for anyone who appreciates modern American popular culture, because it gives a street-level view of a seminal time and place in the creation of that culture: the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles during the halcyon years 1965-68.And if one should only discover *Forever Changes*, and Love's music in general, after reading this book, then not only is a great reward in store--I think FC is a very serious contender for the title \\"greatest rock album of all time\\"--but so is a great shock. To read Stuart-Ware's book is like looking into the kitchen of a five-star restaurant and seeing the piles of grease-laden dishes, the cook with a cigarette dangling from his mouth as he stands over the stove, the rats gnawing around the trash can out back--and then, when you enter the dining room, everything is all polish and pressed linen. In other words, to hear the breathtaking brilliance that is *Forever Changes,* and then to contrast that with the atmosphere of infighting, jealousy, laziness, and dangerous drug use that Stuart-Ware portrays, is to experience cognitive dissonance of a high order. And yet ultimately, of course, these revelations of self-undermining behavior only make the achievement that was FC all the more impressive.With a book like this--especially given the great number of famous names that make cameos here, and the many extraordinary stories--there's always somebody who is going to question its veracity. Yet Stuart-Ware's account has an unmistakable ring of truth, and not just because of the extraordinarily evocative details it contains. Of greater importance is the author's attitude--his humility and his clear-headed perspective. He does not seek to make himself seem more important than he was, he has no axe to grind, and he's not reliving some mythical past that the rest of his life never equaled. In fact, as he makes clear in the preface, the really important things in his life are the ones that happened after his brief stint in the limelight. As for his portrayal of Arthur Lee, I think Stuart-Ware shows an impressive command over the age-old writers' dictum, \\"Show, don't tell\\": he never tells you what to think about this extremely troubled, enigmatic genius, but the portrait is clear enough anyway.All in all, an extraordinary and enormously entertaining book whose greatest flaw is that it had to have an end."},{"Title":"Love: Behind the Scenes: On the Pegasus Carousel with the Legendary Rock Group Love","review":"Imagine that you are an ardent Love fan, and one night you step into a bar and sitting next to you is some guy and it turns out that he was the drummer for Love and played on Da Capo and Forever Changes. All you would want is to do is sit there all night and ask: &quot;what was it like?!&quot; -- Well, the answer would be this book. I couldn't put it down, and basically read it straight through in two sittings. Two nights of hearing Michael Stuart tell what it was like. The chapters are short and accessible. It almost feels like he is just talking straight to you. What he describes is anecdote after anecdote, story after story, and various moments in the 1906's LA scene. There's Kim Fowley grooving out at some UCLA gig. There's Arthur yelling at Jim Morrison for skinny dipping in his pool. Laurel Canyon, the Sunset Strip, Bido Lito's....from the silly to the sublime, the memories are shared, often eloquently.Arthur definitely comes off as a jerk. A genius, a magnetic personality, a strong and charismatic force -- but a a jerk. Sarcastic, cruel, and he even, according to the author, stiffed the other guys and didn't ever give them their royalties from the work on these two albums. Harsh. My interactions with Arthur have all been positive; he even wrote me back when he was in prison, and has been kind and curteous every time I have ever approcahed hm. But maybe he has just softened as he's gotten older. Because in this book, he seemed pretty mean and unsavory. The liner notes to McLean's &quot;If you Believe...&quot; paint a similar portrait.My only criticism of this book is that it gives really short shrift to Forever Changes. In my opinion, Forever Changes is the greatest album of all time, ever. It moves me more than any book I have ever read, more than any painting I have ever seen -- it is simply the greatest human creative expression that I have ever expeienced. That said, I was let down that the author really doesn't say all that much about it. Just a little: they didn't rehearse much, studio musicians were brought in, then let go, then it was recorded -- and that was that and he quickly moves on. I was stunned. There was no discussion of the sheer brilliance of it; the non-traditional musical arrangments (like no choruses or hooks), the astounding lyrics, the chilling snare work in the beginning of You Set the Scene....I wanted to know more; how did they feel as they recorded it? What did the author think the first time he heard The red Telepone, for instance?This is a must-read for any Love fan, or anyone compelled by LA in the 1960s."},{"Title":"Love: Behind the Scenes: On the Pegasus Carousel with the Legendary Rock Group Love","review":"You must get this book. This book documents the Sunset Strip scene in the 60's better than any other book I can remember. The anecdotes recalled in this book are hilarious (check out the pigeon story).Maybe the reason the book is so good is because you have the drummer of the band writing the bio as opposed to, say, Grace Slick writing a book and needing to keep details as vague as possible because you have a public image to protect. The drummer has nothing to lose, so he's going to write all the dirt that's fit to print. We, the readers, benefit because we see everything on the band, warts and all.Even if you don't care much about Love, you should get this anyway and be surprised at how entertaining a rock bio can be."},{"Title":"Love: Behind the Scenes: On the Pegasus Carousel with the Legendary Rock Group Love","review":"Late last year, Rolling Stone published its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The number 40 spot belonged to Forever Changes, the 1967 classic by the bi-racial Los Angeles rock band Love. Changes peaked at only 154 on the Billboard Album chart. However, with its weird, druggy songs, and eccentric mixture of rock, Herb Alpert-like brass arrangements, and haunting strings, the album has become regarded as a masterpiece.Michael Stuart-Ware, Love's drummer during its heyday, apparently wrote this book for consumption by fans of the band (a version of Love still tours with Arthur Lee, its front man and sole original member). However, the author also has produced an engaging memoir of the 1964-68 L.A. music scene, when the rock genre was being transformed from a niche teen market into a cultural phenomenon.The son of an aerospace worker, Stuart-Ware plays drums in his high school band (a photograph shows him with a bow tie and a buzz cut) and earns a college scholarship. As a student at UCLA, he is taken by the new sound of The Beatles, Rolling Stones and other British Invasion bands. The author drops out of college, joins a band, and later is asked to join Love. Despite his awareness of Love's reputation for rampant drug use, and his own disdain for drugs, Stuart-Ware readily accepts the invitation.The author shares living space with other band members, and soon is smoking hash with them and dropping LSD. Indeed, a communal hash pipe seemingly accompanies the band's every activity, whether traveling on a commercial jet, rehearsing, or just eating. Lead singer Lee, a black man from Watts (but more musically influenced by folk-rocker Roger McGuinn than James Brown), is the focal point of the book. Lee is portrayed alternatively as a thug (mercilessly beating a man for a drug deal gone awry), and as strict taskmaster who successfully transforms his vision for Changes into a finished product.Ultimately, Lee's boorishness and self-absorption, and the whole band's drug use and unprofessionalism, spell its downfall. For instance, after flying to Miami at the expense of Elektra Records, and being entertained at the home of an Elektra executive, Lee cancels a gig when he learns that The Mothers of Invention have top billing. At what should have been the band's zenith, the original Love implodes and its members quickly scatter.Stuart-Ware kicks around with other acts, and is offered a job backing up Neil Diamond. He considers the offer, but declines after attending a Diamond concert and remembering, \\"I had never liked one song Neil Diamond had ever recorded, not even a bit.\\" After which the author permanently leaves the music business, going on to hold a number of different jobs, including printer, product inspector, scuba instructor and telephone pole climber.Stuart-Ware, a first-time author, is not a great writer. His verse is stilted and suffers from unnecessary detail (\\"We found a place to park about a half block from the restaurant and I fished some change from my pocket and fed the meter.\\"). Conversely, the interesting post-breakup escapades of Love's members are all but ignored. No mention is made of Arthur Lee's later, frequent brushes with the criminal justice system (culminating in a six-year prison term under California's \\"three strikes and you're out\\" law). Nor does Stuart-Ware relate that two heroin-addicted former band mates (guitarist Johnny Echols and bassist Ken Forssi) did time for holding up donut shops, or that singer-guitarist Bryan MacLean became a Christian missionary until his death in 1998. Those omissions are inexplicable.On the other hand, Stuart-Ware is a fine storyteller. He takes readers into the mid-60s L.A. club scene and culture, centered on Sunset Boulevard and places like the Whisky and Bido Lito's, and houses inhabited by rock musicians in nearby Laurel Canyon. The author relates how an agitated and prudish Lee chases a naked Jim Morrison from a swimming pool at MacLean's house. There is poignant tale of the shaggy-haired band amicably sharing a plane with Vietnam-bound troops. Also, there are plenty of anecdotes about how members of a working band pass the waking hours between rehearsals and gigs. Finally, without a trace of bitterness, Stuart-Ware recalls being in a Sam Goody's shop in 1998, when his young son shows him the Love box set CD; the author pays $30 to buy the music he created 30 years before.\\"Pegasus Carousel\\" is an enjoyable paperback about an ordinary man who took an early life detour into the realm of the abnormal. Unlike his band mates, the author returned seemingly unscathed. Now approaching the end of his working life, he writes, \\"I can honestly say I never had a job I didn't like,\\" presumably including his career as a drug band drummer. He concludes, \\"I like normal.\\" Apparently, the man in the bow tie is the real Michael Stuart-Ware."},{"Title":"Love: Behind the Scenes: On the Pegasus Carousel with the Legendary Rock Group Love","review":"The &quot;Love&quot; of the 65'-68' variety is the one I remember, and the Author, Michael Stuart-Ware &quot;Nail's It&quot; in this incredibly well documented and factually written book &quot;Pegasus Carousel&quot;. I do not claim to be much of a book &quot;critic&quot;, but being on the same bill occasionally in L.A. and the Bay Area with Love back in those days, I can certainly relate to quite a few personal experience's witnessed by myself that Stuart-Ware relates.It is as if Michael takes you back to the fun, and troubled times of a band that was marked for destiny, by handing you a &quot;back stage pass&quot;, and personally guiding you through the climb up the ladder of the talented musical talent's of the individuals of this group, continuing on to their &quot;mysterious&quot; cult L.A. Sunset Strip following and popularity, to the slow descent and desintegration of a band with a serious future.This is a MUST READ for any past and present Love fan, of any degree. Also, an influential &quot;guide book&quot; for any band now, or in the future. Once you pick it up to start reading, make sure you have a few free hours. Chances are likely you won't put it down until you have finished it!"},{"Title":"Love: Behind the Scenes: On the Pegasus Carousel with the Legendary Rock Group Love","review":"I was very sceptical when I first started the book, but as I continued to read it I found that it had a real sincerity about it.

If you're into inventive and dynamic musicit doesn't get much better than LOVE. Stuart-Ware's book tellsthe story of the pioneering psychedelic group in great detail without having to resort to sensationalism. He gives the reader a feel of the creative enthusiasm that blossomed in theL.A. music scene of the 1960s. For fans,of course,this is an important work. Personally,when I read it I felt like I was transported into the past to witness the good and bad times these guys went through. Stuart-Ware satisfied my curiosity abouttheir career onstage and in the studio.After enjoying LOVE's music so much I finally get to know the personalities of thebandmembers. He also candidly shares their experiences with drugsand in doing so provides us with an important lesson in decadence. One does not have to be a fan to enjoy this exceptional biography.

Michael takes an approach I haven't seen taken in a book of this type before . . . so personal and honest. In Pegasus he deals with much more than simply the literal history of the late-sixties underground rock group, LOVE. He uses the story of the band to give the readers a rare glimpse beneath the surface of an entire era, writing with an &quot;editorial&quot; slant and a style that borders on the &quot;conversational.&quot; Great cast of real-life characters.

The picture of the band standing under a chimney with only the logo LOVE on the cover enthralled me and I had to have it. I have been a Love fan ever since. Michael Stuart-Ware does a very good job at exposing why Love never became a super group like the Rolling Stones or the Doors even though Love could have easily been more popular than both those groups if Arthur Lee hadn't shot the band in the foot. My only criticism of the book is the slight undercurrent of bitterness (maybe my imagination) about what could have been. Mr. Stuart-Ware could have made a career in music in spite of Love, but he chose not to. It was probably a good move for him to leave the music business and I'm glad he has given the world of an insider's look at an truly extraordinary band."},{"Title":"Understanding Hieroglyphs","review":"I'm really in two minds about this book.The title suggests that it is a book about hieroglyphs, and a quick look through it seems to confirm that impression. On reading the book, however, it turns out that only the 1-consonant form is covered, there's nothing about determinatives (really?), there is no grammar to speak of, and that the illustrations from Egyptian inscriptions, although translated, are seldom if ever described in the detail I think a student needs (such as the variant writing Djedju for Djedu, which had me puzzled until I read Collier and Manley's book \`How to read Egyptian', which may be more suited to a reader who wants to get involved with the language rather than the letters or symbols it is written with).Most chapters have tables with common words or terms in hieroglyphs (usually related to the topics covered in that chapter): a very dedicated reader may be able to use these to &quot;translate&quot; some of inscriptions by matching the words in the tables with the hieroglyphs in the inscriptions. It takes a lot of searching, though -- and in a way that does help learning to recognize the various &quot;chunks&quot; of hieroglyphs. But as there is no clear reference to books for further study of hieroglyphs (a must, really), I can't quite make out how this book can be described as a complete introductory guide to hieroglyphs.However ...... there's another book here that must be reviewed as well. It's a book almost entirely about Ancient Egyptian society, a book that doesn't go into hieroglyphs more than necessary. This book starts off by describing the power inherent in names, why removing or defacing the name of your enemy is such an effective form of revenge, and why Tutankhamon had the last laugh on his enemies who wanted to obliterate him from history. It goes on with much and diverse information on Egyptian royalty, social geography, the duties of scribes, priests, and tomb workers, and ends by covering how the Egyptians counted things as well as time. The part on Egyptian names contains many thought-provoking parallels with ancient and modern society -- it seems a bit odd with all these &quot;Gift-of-Amen&quot; and &quot;Beloved-of-Re&quot; names until you're reminded of the meaning of names like Theodor and Christopher, Holly and Pascal, and the use of throne names seems equally weird until the similar name changes of popes and the odd British king is observed.*This* book is a much easier-to-read book, and can be recommended to anyone who needs a first guide to Egyptian culture and society. The only things I miss so far is notes on trade, crafts, farming etc. But if that was included the book would probably be at least twice its size, and no longer quite as light and enjoyable read as it actually is. That is also the reason why I don't bother to complain about the index: it's unusable, true, but this is really not the kind of book that needs an index very badly. The understanding-hieroglyphs book, though, does need a better index.I *am* in two minds about this book, as I said. The book suggested by the title doesn't seem to deserve much of a rating, I'm sorry to say, unless your language-learning style involves jumping in at the deep end. My rating reflects this, as I suspect other readers may judge the book from its title. The &quot;other&quot; book, however, is well worth excavating from where it is hidden among the Egyptian hieroglyphs. I did not expect this kind of contents when I bought the book, but I'm glad I found it. I think I can promise you, too, a few treasures."},{"Title":"Understanding Hieroglyphs","review":"This is an excellent book for people just starting to learn about Egyptian hieroglyphs. The author teaches the basic vocabulary that occurs over and over in most inscriptions, and she gives lots of examples of authentic inscriptions so you can practice what you're learning. This is NOT a grammar of the ancient language... but it's a great place to start."},{"Title":"Understanding Hieroglyphs","review":"I rate this book &quot;five stars&quot; as far as it goes. It is an excellent introductory treatment of names, naming practices, titles, gods,and geographic names in Ancient Egyptian, complete with copies of actual inscriptions from obelisks and other monuments. It is fascinating to read, but very difficult to use due to a lack of indexing of the Ancient Egyptian terms. The book is small enough to take to a museum with you, but you would waste a lot of time thumbing through the pages trying to find the particular list you want."},{"Title":"Understanding Hieroglyphs","review":"This book falls far short as a grammar, except as a bare minimal first introduction. However, the information about Egyptian writing, monuments, and society is all quite good. Very good for someone who is interested in Egypt and wants a very basic understanding of hieroglyphs."},{"Title":"The New Industrial State","review":"FROM THE PUBLISHER'S DESCRIPTION:Is it possible to offer a single comprehensive view of modern economic life and of the changes that are shaping its future? Mr. Galbraith in this volume proves that it is. He begins with the world of advanced technology highly specialized manpower, and the five or six hundred giant corporations which bring these into use. He shows how these firms supply themselves with capital, how the men who comprise them are motivated, how organized intelligence has replaced ownership as the source of power in the modern enterprise. He shows how the market has declined as a guiding influence in economic life, to be replaced in substantial measure by planned decision as to what will be produced, at what prices and for whom.Government in the industrial state, Mr. Galbraith makes clear can be understood only in light of the needs and goals of modern large-scale organization. And this profoundly shapes the prospect for trade unions, political parties, education and the larger culture itself. Only as we see the goals of the industrial system in a clear light will we avoid the danger of subordinating too much of life to their service. Only then will we exploit the opportunities inherent in well-being....The publisher's description goes on to herald The New Industrial State as Galbraith's \\"most important book.\\" The implicit comparison is with his earlier and immensely popular work, The Affluent Society. But the two books are quite closely related, as Galbraith mentions in the foreword: \\"I must again remind the reader that this book had its origins alongside The Affluent Society. It stands in relation to that book as a house to a window. This is the structure; the earlier book allowed the first glimpse inside.\\"And indeed, that is largely the truth. This book provides a framework for understanding Corporate America; its real and public purposes, its organization, history, strengths, and weaknesses. Surprisingly little of the book seems aged (of course the book exludes all mention of the last forty years, and the Soviet references seem a bit antiquated), and much of it, with minimal substitution (e.g. \\"War on Terror\\" for \\"Cold War\\" as the bogeyman for justifying the massive military outlays which feed the industrial system) is eerily applicable to the early 21st century.All of that said, this book is not for everyone. It is quite dense (especially the first third), and most of us will need a dictionary close at hand. This is a book which requires hard thinking and more than one reading. But if your purpose is to understand the type of economy we really live in, your efforts will be richly rewarded."},{"Title":"The New Industrial State","review":"John Kenneth Galbraith didn't respect the literary conventions of economics. He didn't express himself in math, he made sweeping generalizations about society (not always backed by strong evidence), and he freely drew on the insights of history, sociology, and politics, paying little heed to interdisciplinary boundaries. For that reason, many economists looked down their noses at him. And for that reason, his books are still in print and enjoyed by readers decades after they first appeared. Galbraith was more than an economist. He was a great social critic, a great debunker of cant, and a superb prose stylist. He was the Veblen of post-World War II America.He was at the top of his powers when he wrote \\"The New Industrial State\\" in the 1960s. The book came as close as anything did to summarizing the Galbraithian \\"system.\\" Parts of it are outdated, such as the assertion that financial markets have little influence on big corporations, or the strained argument that the American and Soviet economic systems were \\"converging.\\" Other parts, however, are as relevant today as they were 40 years ago, such as the critique of advertising and consumerism, or the analysis of how our gigantic defense industry shapes policy and influences the Pentagon. In a time when the Federal Reserve is bailing out banks and scrambling to protect the economy from the miscalculations of the financial sector, it's good to be reminded that the private sector looks to government to keep the economy on a even keel, no matter what the official ideology of the private sector may be.Most of all, \\"The New Industrial State\\" displayed Galbraith's genius for stepping back and asking big questions. These continue to haunt economics, even though textbook writers bury them in footnotes. Why DO we treat GDP is an adequate measure of social welfare? Why DO we choose to consume higher productivity in the form of goods rather than leisure? Why DOES our pedagogy emphasize \\"perfect competition\\" when the economy is dominated by big firms? Why DO we assume that workers and managers are motivated solely by pecuniary considerations? And on and on.\\"The New Industrial State\\" is a trove of intellectual riches, expressed in masterful and witty prose. Every undergraduate economics student should read it. So should every educated citizen. It's a 20th century classic."},{"Title":"The New Industrial State","review":"This is a superb book. It is a book, however, that has become dated. Its datedness should not dissuade potential readers. The datedness of \\"The New Industrial State\\" has only changed the books relevance and importance. When the book was first published in 1967, it accurately described how the then modern corporation functioned, its power structure, and the motivations of individuals who guided the decision making and development of the corporation.This book should be understood to be part of a publication trilogy, starting with Galbraith's \\"Affluent Society,\\" \\"The Industrial State,\\" and \\"Economics and the Public Purpose.\\" In my opinion \\"The Industrial State\\" is the apex of the series. It is however, the most technical of the three books. The \\"Affluent Society\\" being the most accessible.For economic academia the book was revolutionary, because it radically challenged microeconomic and macroeconomic textbook accounts of markets and market adjustments. Microeconomics was challenged on several fronts. The most important being the motivation of the \`power brokers' of the (then) modern corporation, what Galbraith called the \\"technostructure.\\" The technostructure is a complex and imperfectly defined \\"collective\\" of (especially) \\"technical\\" and \\"specialized\\" staff members at the midrange management level. It was the decision making of the technical and specialized staff members who really determined the development direction of the (then) modern corporation. This is revolutionary because the motivation of these staffers, or technostructure, was not one of profit, but instead \\"identity\\" with the group/staff and corporation and (marginal) \\"adaptation\\" of the company's goal toward their own.At a macroeconomic level Galbraith argues that it was not his beloved Keynesian interventionism which stabilized the post-WWII economy, but the massive capital contracts the U.S. government had with industrial capital (e.g. steel, rubber, chemical, etc.), mainly though the Pentagon and NASA. These contracts allowed for industrial companies to build inventories without worrying about sales or the business cycle.Galbraith argued, the (then) modern corporation is mainly concerned with its own stability and longevity. Stability and longevity required the corporation to become as enormous as possible. The enormity of the corporation's size required \\"planning\\" become its primary development activity. The planning goes on (1) between technical and specialized staffers and midrange and upper-management, e.g. human resource planning for internal consistency; (2) for research and development and technological growth; (3) for price stability, marketing, and reliability in demand, establishing external stability and consumer relevance; (4) for balance within the corporation, via collective bargaining with worker unions and predictability of payroll costs; and (5) for contracts with the State.Small business and entrepreneurial corporations far outnumbered the several 100 enormous corporations. The actual economic and business activity was dominated by the minority big/enormous corporations. This meant the American system was dual in institutional structure. One sector where big business predominated and the dynamics of \\"planning\\" ran supreme. The other where small business and the dynamics of the profit motivate ran supreme. This was a situation that businessmen well understand, but that policy economists and politicians failed to appreciate the full relevance and policy implications.In its fortieth anniversary publication, the institutional structure of the American economy has radically transformed. The technostructure is still necessary, but its power has been greatly, perhaps absolutely, diminished.Technological shifts and socioeconomic policy shifts have moved history and the world beyond Galbraith's \\"The New Industrial State.\\" However, the book's importance has not been diminished, but merely shifted. The book's importance is no longer in describing the institutional structure of American capitalism, but understanding from were the now current system evolved.To draw a Darwinian metaphor, \\"The New Industrial State\\" is the missing link between the \\"just-in-time\\" production corporation and the entrepreneurial capitalists of Adam Smith (1776) thru Karl Marx (1867). \\"Just-in-time\\" production corporations contract significant portions (if not all) of their production from subcontractors. The prevailing role of the \\"planning\\" of The New Industrial State has been demoted. The corporation does not have to plan because a subcontractor can almost always be found, the subcontractors planning is only as long as the contract with a Wal-mart, or some other mega-corporation. This institutional shift toward \\"just-in-time\\" production does not make the technostructure obsolete, but it does diminish their power role within the corporation.It will be Galbraith's \\"The New Industrial State\\" which will allow us to fully understand the \\"Post-Industrial State.\\"The \\"New Industrial State\\" should receive a wide and new generation of readers. It is an important book to understand a previous era, and a specific relationship between citizens, workers, business, and the public sector, a type of symbiotic embeddedness between each group. It is also an important book to understand how that specific relationship has be reconfigured, generating a type of disembeddedness between citizens/workers and business/public sector. \\"The New Industrial State\\" helps us understand why big moneyed lobbyists have come to dominate Washington, and how it could be, and was, different."},{"Title":"The New Industrial State","review":"John Kenneth Galbraith's \\"The New Industrial State\\" is a hallmark in economic thought. His work is both an extension and reformulation of his previous work \\"The Affluent Society\\". Galbraith spots fundamental contradictions throughout the modern field of economics. As always Galbraith is willing to attack all economists, liberals and conservatives alike, in search of the truthIn \\"The New Industrial State\\" Galbraith begins by looking at the modern composition of production. With small exception the mature corporation has become the central producer in the industrialized world. The mature corporation no longer seeks to maximize profits. It seeks, first, survival and, second, absolute growth. This means that corporations are held to maintain a minimum set of profits in order to prevent external influence on future decisions. Maximizing profits, and therefore increasing risk, is discouraged because with greater risk comes a greater chance of failing to maintain a minimum level of profit. After a minimum level of profit has been achieved it is the goal of the mature corporation to grow. By growing it gains greater influence over the economy and society at large.The reason for the rise of the mature corporation is because of technology. As production processes become more complex a greater need for planning becomes necessary. Without control of supply and demand it is extremely difficult to plan for a long production schedule (ex: 5 years). If, say, disposable income or consumer desires were to change then the mature corporation would fall into risk of bankruptcy or, at the very least, external finance (which threatens autonomy).In order to minimize risk the mature corporation must try to control supply and demand. The control of supply is done through a large degree of bargaining power with suppliers of material and through the use of unions. (Ironically, unions have become docile to the demands of the mature corporation and further its will.) In order to control demand the mature corporation relies on the government to stabilize aggregate demand. On the micro level the mature corporation manufactures artificial wants through marketing and public perception. While the mature corporation does not exhibit complete and total control over supply or demand they control both to a large extent.The reason why the mature corporation can exhibit such behavior is because of the division between management and ownership. The stockholders in a mature corporation have no input on management's decisions. The board of directors, indirectly chosen by management, choose the mature corporation's management. The traditional hierarchy of management is blatantly false due to the needs of teamwork and division of labor. Instead what is created is a \\"technostructure\\". It is the (headless) technostructure that inadvertently controls the economy. Very little of the United State's economy can be considered market based. The vast majority of the United States is a planned economy.According to Galbraith, \\"Increasing it will be recognized that the mature corporation, as it develops, becomes part of the larger administrative complex associated with the state. In time the line between the two will disappear... Though this recognition will not be universally welcomed, it will be healthy.. the autonomy of the technostructure is, to repeat yet again, a functional necessity of the industrial system.\\" (CHXXXV p.393)"},{"Title":"The New Industrial State","review":"Not an excellent economist. Galbraith's style and ease of readability is almost second to none but there is little substance in this book. I would recommend Mises, Rothbard, or Hayek to any interested in economics.

It stands in relation to that book as a house to a window. This is the structure; the earlier book allowed the first glimpse inside.\\"In the first chapter on \\"The Imperatives of Power,\\" he states that \\"Technology... leads to planning,\\" and ultimately \\"will require the firm to seek the help and protection of the state.\\" This is because the state can absorb the major risks, and guarantee a market for the product. (Pg. 20) Thus, in the areas of the most exacting and advanced technology, \\"the market is most completely replaced,\\" and \\"The fully planned economy ... is warmly regarded by those who know it best.\\" (Pg. 31)He invents the term \\"Technostructure\\" for the loose organization of those who bring specilialized knowledge, talent or experience to group decision-making. (Pg. 71) Mature corporations are run by this technostructure. He then opines that decentralization in Soviet-style economies does not involve a return to markets, \\"but a shift of some planning functions from the state to the firm.\\" Rather than both Soviets and U.S. returning to the market (which they have \\"outgrown\\"), \\"There is measureable convergence to the same form of planning.\\" (Pg. 108) (Obviously, this was written before 1989-1991.)He asserts that \\"Much of what is believed to be socially important is, in fact, the adaptation of social attitudes to the goal system of the technostructure.\\" (Pg. 163) The technostructure favors prevention of losses, over profit maximization (which \\"invites risk of loss\\"). (Pg. 168-169) He further argues that \\"Firms spend money to take business away from each other; all cannot succeed so the result is a standoff. The only consequence is that prices are higher and profits are lower than if by some act of government or industrial statesmanship the struggle were curbed.\\" (Pg. 203-204)He argues passionately that where there is a conflict between industrial and aesthetic priorities---e.g., defending the landscape against lumbermen---only the state can rule that \\"some patterns of consumption...are inconsistent with aesthetic goals.\\" He concludes ironically, \\"That one must pause to affirm that beauty is worth the sacrifice of some increase in the Gross National Product shows how effectively our beliefs have been accommodated to the needs of the industrial system.\\" (Pg. 350)There is much more in the book, of course; though more than 50 years old, Galbraith's arguments remain challenging and thought-provoking, and will be of considerable interest to modern progressives."},{"Title":"The New Industrial State","review":"Whether you agree with his political views or not, John K.

I can't believe I bought this book. He would likely pull gum off the bottom of park bench and be proud of himself for finding a way to get free candy.First of all, he is way wrong with his numbers. He must play at the dingiest casinos because he thinks betting $200 per hand makes you a high roller. It doesn't, it makes you perhaps a premium player but you'll be fairly limited as to what you can get comped at the nicer hotels.Second, do you want to spend your vacation hustling a few dollars like a common beggar?"},{"Title":"Comp City: A Guide to Free Casino Vacations, Second Edition","review":"This is an entertaining read and almost certainly the most comprehensive work on the subject. But the fundamental premise (basically: the casinos will do anything to screw you out of your money, so here's how to sink to their level) is not only self-demeaning (who could consider days spent trying to weasel their way into a crummy buffet a vacation anyway?), but almost certain to fail even on its own terms. As some other reviewers here have correctly pointed out, one bad streak at the tables will completely wipe out whatever paltry &quot;gains&quot; the comp-grubber may have nickel-and-dimed their way into.

This is the best gambling book I ever read."},{"Title":"Comp City: A Guide to Free Casino Vacations, Second Edition","review":"There's no point in wasting your money on this if you don't like blackjack. 90% of the book is based on blackjack play. If you play slots, for example, the advice is very limited and is mostly common sense- sign up for the slot club and you'll get discounted rooms. Don't sign up and you'll still get free drinks. That's about it. There's a whole section on why everything except blackjack stinks.If you like blackjack and play well, there are some interesting ways of trying to make the casinos think you play more than you do. Some will make you look like an idiot at the tables, but that's all part of the scam. Your main goal will be to slow down the game for everyone at the table so it looks like you play more per hour than you do.Some of the stories in the book are entertaining, and it did make me chuckle here and there, but there's nothing very original here. If you play $25+ hands of blackjack, bet huge when the \\"bosses\\" are around, and slow the game down as much as possible, you might have a shot at some decent comps. Bribe (Tip!) some of the employees if you can, and your odds of getting comps go up. Who would have guessed?The best advice I got out of it is that if you don't ask for comps, they won't give them to you. I'm one of the people who goes to casinos to relax, not to stalk the employees at 3 in the morning to bribe them with buffets from the hotel next door, so I'll probably never get that free hotel room.

This I admire, along with his writing style and ability to spin an ancedote. What I can't grasp is the cheapskate mentality that would have folks do almost anything for a comp. I go to Vegas to gamble and to win money. I can readily afford the cheap airfares, rooms, and food or I wouldn't go. I can't imagine making large bets into a negative deck just because the floorman is watching and I want to fool him into inflating my rating. Intentionally spill a drink on the table to stop the game for a few minutes so you play fewer hands than reported? Gimme a break. Ninety percent of average players would be far better off learning to gamble intelligently than worrying about sqeezing a few extra comp dollars. Still, some of the stories are laugh out loud funny and worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Comp City: A Guide to Free Casino Vacations, Second Edition","review":"This book was really a disappointment! We go to Las Vegas frequently and do take advantage of many legitimate comps offered by the casinos. I had hoped this book could give me some further insight into the intricacies of the comp system. Unfortunately, Max Rubin has written a book about squeezing the system dry.Some of his topics include \\"Feeding 4 with a comp for only 2\\" - this sections includes bribing the waitress with $5 and ask her if it is ok for your guests to \\"taste\\" your food. He says tomake sure you order plenty of appetizers so you will have empty plates for your guests' portions of the food.He says that if you are being comped for Room, Food and Beverages, never leave the hotel without taking home at least a couple of extra bottles of booze or champagne. This is not taking advantage of comps, this is stealing.He also says that if you are offered free tickets to a fight, don't worry if you are not a fan of boxing. He says to take the freebies and resell them and then he says \\"you're on your way\\".A really poor book. Not at all what I expected."},{"Title":"Comp City: A Guide to Free Casino Vacations, Second Edition","review":"This book is a good read for any gambler with limited knowledge of casino operations and marketing. Many of the reviewers pan the book for some of his comp hustling ways, but he explains that not all things in the book are for everyone. Max also states that it is for people that would have gambled anyway and were getting nothing or very little. I think this book benefits gamblers that are currently not comped and don't know how to get comps. Max is a bit overboard in his ways, but it is a good primer for people that don't know how casino comps work. Most people play and get nothing because they don't know they can get something. I have friends that I gambled with many years ago, but they don't go very often anymore. These friends are in significantly higher income brackets now and still don't get (or ask for) comps for their higher action during the few trips they make to casinos. This book would be very helpful to them.The one knock against the book is when Max writes if a game becomes a &quot;magilla,&quot; to leave because too many eyes will be on the game. If black chips are flying at a table, I think most people would stop comp hustling and get in on the winning!"},{"Title":"Comp City: A Guide to Free Casino Vacations, Second Edition","review":"In my opinion this is one of the few worthwhile gambling related books out there. Max does a great job clearly explaining how the anyone with a $500-$50,000 bankroll can get their full gambling value. My wife and I had spent the last couple years playing positive expectation video poker and obtaining comps the \\"Frugal\\" way. We always came home with a seriously depleated bankroll and free rooms, but rarely did we ever do anything better than a free or discounted buffet. However, I can now take $3000 to most any casino market, play Blackjack and break even for the most part, while eating at the best joints in the casino, free rooms, free spa admission, airfair discounts, etc. The trick is to make them think that $3,000 is $30,000 and this book shows you how."},{"Title":"Comp City: A Guide to Free Casino Vacations, Second Edition","review":"First, I would like to say flat out-- yes, Max talks about husteling every possible comp you can get and sometimes the methods he mentions can be demeaning or whatever (pardon my terrible spelling!). But this is the definitive book an all aspects of comps, from sittting down at a slot machine right as the cocktail waitress walks by to full RFB (room, food and beverage), and as such, it covers ALL aspects. You choose what you want to do, but don't bite the book because you don't like some methods. Secondly, I would like to inform all the people who rate this book low and talk about Max's strategies eventually losing your bank and this that and the other thing. Knowing about blackjack and standard deviation and the correct odds will help you there. If you DO play basic strategy blackjack, your comps will, ON AVERAGE, pay for your blackjack play and then some. Don't tell the people who are browsing this book that Max doesn't know about casinos. This is MAX RUBIN. Max is a very knowledgable man, and the host of teh infamous Blackjack Ball, where all the best of the best BJ players get together and brag to eachother about how great they all are. I can assure you Max knows what he is talking about. If you are looking to make money, learn to count cards, or better yet, get a real job. If you are looking to get the most bang for your buck, get free stuff, and maybe even have a Vegas vacation pay for itself, GET THIS BOOK.

I mean, who doesn't like free stuff?? Well after reading the book several times, and applying the tips Max Rubin tells you to do while playing table games, I ended up getting more in comps than I have ever did. and that was my first time using Max's comp counting techniques. I'd imagine that it would take a bit of practice to get higher-end comps and nicer accomadations. But after the first meal comp, this book had paid for itself.

Thanks Max!!"},{"Title":"Comp City: A Guide to Free Casino Vacations, Second Edition","review":"First, let me say that Rubin doesn't tell you to grovel before the pit bosses to get a comp, nor does he advocate stealing. He does say that it pays to ask, and at worst, they'll say no, but often they say yes, or at least make some kind of offer. He tells hilarious stories about Vegas characters, some of whom were thieves, but he doesn't favor copying their example.What he does want to teach is his ACES method of gathering comps, which is based on blackjack played with the black chips. But you don't have to lay down a C-note to use his methods. Even a low roller like me can get good comps, (particularly with the rise of the California tribal casinos creating wonderful competion for the gaming public) if I use his methods."},{"Title":"Comp City: A Guide to Free Casino Vacations, Second Edition","review":"I'm not sure if I'm reading the same book as the one read by all the 'positive' reviewers here. What I was hoping for when I ordered, was some insight into how someone with a relatively small (at least in the casino's eyes) bankroll could find places to exploit the comp systems at the casinos. Instead, I found the book was 90% geared towards 'high-rollers' who would be able to play blackjack for hours at $100 per hand.In my casino experiences, if you have the bankroll to play at that level, a) you have enough money that comps don't matter and/or b) the casino will make certain that you get the 'attention' you deserve.There was nothing that I found useful for the smaller player.

Its a good read."},{"Title":"Comp City: A Guide to Free Casino Vacations, Second Edition","review":"The reviewers who said Rubin is a cheat and a thief don't know what they are talking about, nor do the ones who say this is only for $100 and up players. He gives numerous ways for players of EVERY bankroll level to maximize their return in comps. If the casino doesn't want to give it, they don't. If they do, why not take it? Would you turn down buying a car that costs $18k normally for $15k just because you know other people are paying $18k for it, but you got the better price because you knew invoice on it? OF course not. Applied properly, this is the best edge any average player will EVER have versus the casinos, bar none, and all it takes is learning basic blackjack strategy and asking to be treated as you deserve. Some people just don't understand it, and I am thankful for that, as that is what keeps Las Vegas profitable for people like me. Trust me; this book is brilliant, well writen, well thought out, and anyone who loses sleep over getting extra comp value out of a casino is not of sound mind anyways.

The novel presents a fascinating account of the fierce campaigning that takes place in the time preceding the U.S. presidential elections. Candidly portraying the dirt and grime of politics, Bidwell writes of power hungry politicians and money-wielding businessmen who play the deadly game of politics to suit their own ends.Congressman Bedford Jones seizes the opportunity of his lifetime and becomes the Democratic candidate for the presidency. He is a seasoned politician who endorses the liberal ideology of the Democratic Party. He is very confident that he will win, but he makes one big mistake when he undermines his opponent. His rival Jeff Morgan is an independent candidate who gained popularity as the host of the talk show, \\"American Eagle.\\" In his show, he highlighted important issues that affect the common folk. With his background of supporting regular people, Morgan rises to prominence; and people overwhelmingly back him and his conservative and revolutionary ideas. In an attempt to preserve his idea of the distinct American identity, Morgan supports an all male army, racial segregation in prisons, and anti-immigration laws among other things. This starkly contrasts the Democratic Party tradition of supporting a multi-racial, multi-cultural, pluralistic society.Will the experienced Congressman win without much ado, or is his entire political career under threat from a novice? This riveting novel meticulously presents the intense campaigns of both the candidates who have a lot at stake in the elections. As the campaign fever rises, both camps are willing to go to any lengths including using money, sex, lies and spies to secure a victory.Will Jeff Morgan or Bedford Jones prevail? Who will become the most powerful man in the world?

I could see where that was going, so I didn't return it. I wouldn't buy from this seller again. Very rude!"},{"Title":"The Hebrew Goddess (Jewish Folklore and Anthropol Ogy)","review":"Dr. Raphael Patai, a noted Hebrew scholar and anthropologist and author of the HEBREW GODDESS is also the co-author of HEBREW MYTHS with Robert Graves (THE WHITE GODDESS). Those who wish to continue reading about the goddess in ancient religions will find parts of the HEBREW GODDESS quite interesting, however, Patai's book is not as lyrical as Graves' and not as readable in some sections as others. I found passages dealing with archeology in the Holy Land and quotations from the Old-Testament more interesting, and the sections dealing with the rabbinical writing of the Talmudic period proved difficult to follow (and stay awake).Essentially, Patai is not suggesting Judaism has reverted to polytheism or kept a goddess in the closet all this time. He says &quot;the legitimate Jewish faith, beginning with the earliest formulations of its belief-system ...has always been built upon the axiom of One God. He says Maimonides, the greatest medieval Jewish philosopher said, &quot;God is not a body, nor can bodily attributes be ascribed to him.&quot; Still, mere mortals have had difficulty understanding God as an abstract concept, and thus have ascribed human characteristics to &quot;him.&quot;.Patai says throughout it's history Judaism has stressed the moral and intellectual aspects of God and often neglected the affective and emotional dimensions. However, since the earliest times, the Jewish people have understood God through myths and these myths personify God. This personification of God has included the goddess worship Jerimiah decried, the female attributes of the Cherubim that guarded the Ark of the Covenant, the myths of Lillith, the visions of the Shekina during the Talmudic period, and the rise of the Matronite in the 15th-18th Centuries.Kabbalism during the Middle Ages was mass movement among Jews. During this period, a popular-mythical version of the Matronite overtook and dominated the scholarly-mystical variant. The attachment among Jews to the Matronite (mother of God) had a marked resemblance to Marioloatry among Christians in the Latin countries. Kabbala mysticism was associated with the Sephardic and Hasidic elements of Judaism which also associated with the Latin countries.Apparently, the Ashkenazi Jews were not as &quot;irrational&quot; and after the Jewish Enlightenment, their perspective became the dominant Orthodoxy. Still, the Sephardic practicies associated with the Sabboath, which men were instructed to keep &quot;Holy&quot; continued. Patai describes the rituals of Friday night which included the Seder meal and sexual consumation of the scholar and his wife as serving the purpose of reuniting God with his wife--Shekina.Patai's original book has been expanded with new chapters covering the Shekina in greater detail. Although he stresses the importance of the theological it is not clear even yet that ordinary practicioners understand the difference between the Goddess personified and the female aspect of the One God."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Goddess (Jewish Folklore and Anthropol Ogy)","review":"The Bible gives the impression that all ancient Jews shared a common belief system ... with only an occasional group straying from the fold. But the evidence paints a different picture. As Dr. Patai states, &quot;... it would be strange if the Hebrew-Jewish religion, which flourished for centuries in a region of intensive goddess cults, had remained immune to them.&quot; Archaeologists have uncovered Hebrew settlements where the goddesses Asherah and Astarte-Anath were routinely worshipped. And in fact, we find that for about 3,000 years, the Hebrews worshipped female deities which were later eradicated only by extreme pressure of the male-dominated priesthood.And then there's the matter of the Cherubim that sat atop the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies. Fashioned by Phoenician craftsmen for Solomon and Ahab, an ivory tablet shows two winged females facing each other. And one tablet shows male and female members of the Cherubim embracing in an explicitly sexual position that embarrassed later Jewish historians ... and even the pagans were shocked when they saw it for the first time.This cult of the feminine goddess, though often repressed, remained a part of the faith of the Jewish people. Goddesses answered the need for mother, lover, queen, intercessor ... and even today, lingers cryptically in the traditional Hebrew Sabbath invocation."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Goddess (Jewish Folklore and Anthropol Ogy)","review":"As a Jew and a student of Judaism this sits among the most important books I have read, although it took ten years for me to finish it. In a few words, it provides me with a factual-critical-intellectual basis for my engagement with the feminine in my tradition.I am only sorry the Dr Patai has passed on, may his memory be a blessing, so he will not be able to update The Herbrew Goddess to account for:a) more recent archaeology, andb) the recent flowering of the femininine in JudaismDavid"},{"Title":"The Hebrew Goddess (Jewish Folklore and Anthropol Ogy)","review":"This is probably one of the best academic books of all time. The area of Hebrew beliefs is not really tackled by even the most hardcore of Mesopotamian scholars. I always recommend this book to people who study Hebrew, Canaanite, and Mesopotamian beliefs as well as the people interested in goddess worship of the Ancient Near East and even those who are very critical of Judaism or Christianity. The book covers a plethora of goddesses and even has a chapter on the demon Lilith, with really good references to the demon Naamah and Tubal Cain. So its a plus for Jewish feminists and Goddess worshipers whom concern themselves with the modern image of Lilith.Patai is very excellent translator of the Hebrew language and his notes in other Hebrew translations (Such as his translations of the Zohar) are worth looking into to explain the translation for the lay people who know little Hebrew. There is a lot that the English language fails to grasp concerning translating Hebrew.I only have a few problems with it. For example, some of his more controversial assertions don't hold up to modern scholarship where archeology is concerned. The Burney relief is thought with great academic consensus to be Ishtar rather than Lilith. Jacobsen, a very renown Mesopotamian scholar, suggested this was a form of Ishtar in her Ninna (Lady Owl) form. Patai uses Kramer, whom makes great translations from Sumerian, but is outdated concerning that archeology bit and some theories. However, Patai does cite Jacobsen several times over on other things. He seemed to cite Jacobsen more than Kramer... Well, this is a minor problem, really.The other thing, which is also is very minor, is that the book isn't written so flowingly sometimes. It seems to just kind of go dry. You may find yourself not really paying attention. But this is something that is so overshadowed by the fact that the book contains eye opening and jaw dropping information about Yahweh. I found the book, overall, to be written in such a understandable way that no lay person should have problems understanding it.All and all this is my favorite book on ancient Hebrew beliefs, and though its been along time since it was written, I highly recommend it for anybody interested in Hebrew and Jewish myths, as well as Israelite worship and the concept of God."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Goddess (Jewish Folklore and Anthropol Ogy)","review":"Patai presents a vast lore of the Hebrew goddess in all her names and legends - Shekhina, Sophia, the Matronit, the Shabhat Bride. As a classical scholar in Hebrew legends, he shows us a mythology rich in female powers. What does it mean, for example, that a traditional term for the Hebrew goddess was \\"the neglected cornerstone\\", and then Jesus spoke of building on the cornerstone which the builders neglected?The book touches on numerous sides of Jewish heritage. For example, concerning the underworld of old fashioned demonology he explains:\\"At night, the female Liliths join men, and the male Lilin women, to generate demonic offspring. Once they succeed in attaching themselves to a human, they acquire rights of cohabitation, and therefore must be given a get, or letter of divorce, in order that they may be expelled. Jealous of the human mates of their bedfellows, they hate the children born of ordinary wedlock, attack them, plague them, suck their blood, and strangle them. The Liliths also manage to prevent the birth of children, causing barrenness, miscarriages, or complications during childbirth.\\" (p. 225.)This old myth suggests a certain equality of male and female evil spirits. The spirits are of both sexes, and afflict both men and women equally. The human hosts of evil are innocent victims, who must be somehow saved from harm. This is roughly what Jesus believed about demonic possession.Patai's work gives an enriched view of the biblical heritage, exposing the massive contribution of Jewish mothers through the ages.--author of A Galaxy of Immortal Women: The Yin Side of Chinese Civilization"},{"Title":"The Hebrew Goddess (Jewish Folklore and Anthropol Ogy)","review":"I purchased this book in order to research Lilith and I discovered a wealth of information beyond my original quest. \\"The Hebrew Goddess\\" is well written, informative, and easy to understand.

Peggy provides a unique view into the life of Peggy Shippen, wife of Benedict Arnold (famous for his treachery against the U.S. in the American Revolution). Not only is this a fascinating story, but the reader learns much about the history behind the characters as well. Peggy is a wonderful companion to Finishing Becca by Ann Rinaldi."},{"Title":"Peggy.","review":"Peggy married the greatest traitor of our time, Benidict Arnold. And this book was detailed and very discriptive of the Civil War. It told of how he was a traitor for Peggy and would do every thing in his power and that which was above him. He was a traitor for her and know one else knew. This book is one of favorite books i have ever read at my school library."},{"Title":"Peggy.","review":"peggy wanted everything and if she didn't get it..........well actully everybody wanted to please her so she got everything that she wanted"},{"Title":"The Miseries of Human Life","review":"This book was very interesting in that, although it was written nearly two hundred years ago, many of the miseries of living that are listed still occur. For example (from the chapter Miseries of the Table): \\"The moment in which you discover that you have taken a mouthful of fat, by mistake for a turnip.\\" Or \\"Finding a human hair in your mouth, which, as you slowly draw it forth, seems to lengthen, ad infinitum.\\" There are chapters on the miseries of Travelling, Social Life, Reading and Writing, and Fashionable Life. Readers who are aficionados of Victorian authors such as Dickens, Austen, Bulwer-Lytton, and Sir Walter Scott will appreciate the chapters on miseries of the Country, the Town, and Watering Places. In fact, many of the individual miseries reminded me of scenes from \\"The Pickwick Papers\\", such as \\"Sitting down alone in a large party upon a sofa which makes an equivocal noise.\\"This edition is a condensation of the 1807 two-volume expansion of the initial 1806 single volume. The original format was a series of conversations between Mr. Samuel Sensitive and Mr. Timothy Testy wherein they catalog, on a weekly basis, all the injuries, insults, and disappointments which have occurred since their last meeting. Ms. Lovric chose to edit out the conversation surrounding the miseries so they would stand out to the modern reader. While I appreciate having the nuggets extracted for me, I would like to enjoy for myself \\"...the grace and wit of the language, incongruously framing the vulgar and comical situations described, which is the great success of the original book...\\", as Ms. Lovric describes in her Editor's Note.I have references to Beresford's original work in another tome in my personal library, and it indicates that Ms. Lovric wielded her blue pencil rather freely to be able to compress two volumes into sixty-five pages of a pocket-sized book. However, for those of us who cannot afford to purchase the originals, this will substitute.I would sum up the work as the Cliff Notes version of an author who writes the sardonic observations of Mark Twain in the language of Charles Dickens.(There is also a miniature ball and chain attached to the volume to act as a bookmark, which usage the object is singularly unfit for. This could be entered in the book itself under the chapter on \\"The Miseries of Reading and Writing\\" as \\"A book with a novelty cover or attachment, which proves to be more irritating than amusing.\\")"},{"Title":"The Miseries of Human Life","review":"a lot of books of this time are stuffy and boring. but this is great. some of the miseries are out of date, but many are still with us. anyone who wants a good laff should read it."},{"Title":"Warpaths!: Travels of a Military Historian in North America","review":"I am a fan of John Keegan. History, especially military history, and geography as it relates to history are among my favorite reading topics and as such, John Keegan's body of work has been, title after title, highly enjoyable, informative and insightful. I've read most all of it. And as a British historian who admits to loving Americans and the U.S.A., he writes with perspective and objectivity that American authors can't have generally.Here's the rub. Glaring errors of fact in a history book are unacceptable. I noticed two. Johnston didn't order a retreat on the second day of the Battle of Shiloh because he died on the first day. And the Green river in Wyoming isn't a tributary of the Sweetwater, being across South Pass and hence the Continental Divide.As details, the factual errors don't effect the narrative or Keegan's conclusions but they cast doubt on the rest of the work. They stick in my head and won't go away. Whether caused by haste, poor editing or any other cause, they detract from the book and that is a shame.Three stars might be overly generous, but I am a fan and a reader of History books rather than a Historian or professional literary critic, so three stars it is."},{"Title":"Warpaths!: Travels of a Military Historian in North America","review":"Of the many books by John Keegan that I have read, this is by far the least enjoyable. Two stars is probably a harsh assessment, but there are a few points that annoy me greatly about the book, and overshadow the scholarship and insight that are also present in significant quantities.First, the positive. As usual, Keegan looks for parallels and contrasts in defining historical people, places, or battles. In this book he analyses the geography of North America and describes 4 wars on its soil in terms of the limitations and opportunities offered by key strategic points. The wars include those between English and French about Quebec, the American Revolution, the Civil War's Penninsular campaign, and the wars of extermination of the Native Peoples in the Plains territories (including Custer's Last Stand). He convincingly argues that the twin keys to North America are the St. Lawrence/Lake Champlain/Hudson River corridor and the extended Mississippi watershed (of course, these are connected through portages/canals). Of course, such a dry description does not do justice to Keegan's fine writing style that brings alive the geography, the society, and the battles themselves.And yet.... All the fine analysis is for naught. Keegan does normally inject a certain amount of his personal opinion and direct observation of battlefields and locations that he's personally visited. However, in this book, it is taken to an extreme. The first 65 (!) pages are a meandering, self-indulgent account of vacations he's taken in the U.S. and Canada, ostensibly to describe the geography, but redundently because he rehashes it all in the chapters dealing with the specific wars. Worse still, it's dull. The next few chapters perk up considerably, especially that describing the Civil War. However, it's all ruined again by his unbelievable defense of the genocide commited by the U.S. (and Britain/Canada, for that matter, but he focusses on the U.S. in this book) on their native populations. He seems to justify his stance by calling the Natives \\"selfish\\" for wanting to maintain their way of life and low population density. My jaw dropped in disbelief when I read it! That's like justifying Hitler's invasion of Poland (and his attempted genocide of its people) because Germany needed \\"liebensraum.\\"So, unfortunately, I cannot endorse this book, in spite of its many good points. Pick up Keegan's Face of Battle or Mask of Command for examples of his penetrating insight. Steer clear of this one (not difficult since it's currently out of print)."},{"Title":"Candide and Philosophical Letters (Modern Library)","review":"I think that Candide, by Voltaire is a must-read. It mocks the traditonal views of optimism and takes on a almost, humorous approach to telling that story. It also teaches a lesson of contentment and it shows how Candide experienced the contentment of El Dorado and the sybolism of El Dorado to God's kingdom."},{"Title":"The Learning Annex Presents Uncluttering Your Space","review":"I have read several organizing books, and this one is by far the best. Sullivan provides a system that can be tailored to many different people's styles. I used this book to organize my office and home several months ago and the most impressive thing is that...it has lasted! I have less clutter, better paper management, and for once I know where everything is! I find myself returning to the wisdom in this book again and again AND lending it out to my many clutter-challenged friends.

The questions at the end of each lesson help you think through the clutter issues for that area.Line drawings clearly illustrate the examples. The recommendations for action on each clutter situation (photos, mail, toiletries, clothing, etc.) are practical and concise.Get ready to organize and streamline.Sometimes the advice seems a bit obvious: \\"unsightly items (vacuum cleaners, dirty clothes) should always be hidden from view.\\""},{"Title":"The Learning Annex Presents Uncluttering Your Space","review":"Excellent guide to help all go room by room to declutter your home!

McDonald, an Australian journalist, photographer, and adventurer had become fascinated with Morrison's life and expeditions after stumbling across his books in a library. After walking across Australia and taking a near disastrous detour in Papua New Guinea as a youth, Morrison had gone on to spend the greater part of his career as a statesman in China. On his journey across China, Morrison had met up with a Danish photographer named Jensen, who provided a collection of black-and-white images to illustrate Morrison's book, \\"An Australian in China.\\" McDonald was particularly enamored with Morrison's journey on foot across China, and determined to recreate the journey as much as possible 100 years later. He also gave himself the goal of recapturing the scenes provided by Jensen by determining as best as possible Jensen's exact vantage points for the original photographs and reshooting the scenes as they appear in the late twentieth century. These pictures, some juxtaposed with Jensen's originals, as well as many other twentieth century scenes, are included in this book.Jensen is a skilled traveler. He knows how to negotiate public transit in China, and he's not afraid to stray far from the beaten path. He meets a number of interesting characters along the way, and many help him in his quest to locate the buildings or scenery from Jensen's photographs. McDonald seems to revel in the quest-Morrison's epic provided an excuse to do some hard traveling, and the backbone of a route to follow. Although the book provides some interesting information and analysis about the peoples and cultures of the region, the book isn't so much about China and Burma as it is about McDonald's personal challenge to follow in Morrison's footsteps."},{"Title":"Gendered Cyborg: A Reader","review":"i bought the reader for a class. really didnt end up being my cup of tea, but can see how it could be for others. if your into feminism and scifi this is the book for you. good essays well written by a variety of solid writers."},{"Title":"Imp","review":"The storyline was pretty good & the characters were believable enough, but two things struck me about the &#34;antagonist&#34;, and they have stayed with me ever since I got my first copy of the book at a local store here in the Puget Sound area. Mary Oakes is supposed to be the &#34;innocent&#34; one. The &#34;violated&#34; one. Right? She's the one who's supposed to be the heroine. Right? Imp is supposed to be the VILLAIN of this little &#34;slice of life&#34; story. Right? Well, guess what. 'TAIN'T SO!!! Remember, I said two things struck me about this so-called &#34;villain&#34;. Imp's nature, and the circumstances shaping & surrounding his life. He has been abused and neglected by turns by the emotionally unstable Mrs. Oakes, and he has been kept down in the basement of the house virtually since babyhood. The only &#34;care&#34; he receives from the deranged mom is food maybe once a day or once every few days, and a brisk scrub with as much frequency. He has a sister (only, she doesn't know until toward the end that she's his sister) who is emotionally abused by the woman as well. He's intelligent and curious and wants to see what the world is all about. I admit it. I cheered inside when Mary fell over an old dresser (or was it boxes? I can't remember right off the top of my head right now) in her latest attempt to catch Imp & throttle him yet again. That fixed her!"},{"Title":"Lutheran Book of Worship: Gift Edition","review":"Regrettably the book I ordered was not what I thought it was going to be.It was not the seller's fault.

Some of the basic regularly-used liturgy is good. However, the majority of it is extremely dry for today's church goers (Hence the increasing popularity of non-denominational highly-musical \\"fun churches\\" and the decline in membership to liturgical/ceremonial denominational churches). This worship book was published in 1978. It's about 6 years overdue for a major revision (though ELCA rumor has it that a new LBW is in the works).Yes, it would cost a lot for all those churches to convert to a new hymnal. Then again, it probably cost a lot when they moved from the 1958 \\"red hymnal\\" to the current 1978 \\"green hymnal\\". Though that didn't stop them from converting back then. How about a 2005 \\"blue hymnal\\" where they could incorporate some of the more popular hymns and liturgy from hymnal add-ons like \\"With One Voice\\". They could then delete some of the less popular hymns from the old (current) Lutheran Book of Worship. Honestly, do we really need two, three, or more different books in the pew?
