Italian is my mother tongue, so I bought this book to give it to a friend of mine studying Italian. I had to change my mind. The book is plenty of primary-school-level mistakes that, if you are learning Italian, actually makes the book pretty confusing, and that however aren't acceptable in any instruction book, even though about &quot;bad&quot; words. The vocabulary also is very much &quot;regional&quot; (mainly based on the dialect spoken in Tuscany) and so some of the words won't be understood outside that area. It is a pity, because the book about Spanish is pretty good. The book requires to be thoroughly revised by someone with more familiarity with standard Italian to make it worth even its relatively cheap price."},{"Title":"Merda!: The Real Italian You Were Never Taught in School","review":"I am italian and I was having a look at the book and I think it is really badly conceived and with so many elementary grammar mistakes. I could find at least 10 errors. For example it is an ELEMENTARY italian grammar rule that the feminine article before a feminine noun gets the apostrophe (un'assatanata) and NOT un assatanata. You say UN'AMICA and not una amica. You san UNO sporcaccione and not un sporcaccione. You say SPUDORATA not spudErata.... Just to mention a few errors... And the translations that he sometimes uses are obsolete: when I see a hunk guy I don't say \\"uno forte e ben armato\\" .

In fact, I think a lot of the words were created by the author. However, this book is absolutely hilarious. If you are at all interested in learning the Italian language do not buy this book. If you are at all interested in learning how to say some of the stuff (too nasty to print here) in this book in a different language than buy this book. Have fun with it."},{"Title":"Merda!: The Real Italian You Were Never Taught in School","review":"Mr Delicio in his comments state that &quot;Every Italian knows that Dante converted Tuscan into the Italian language.&quot; Well, I am sure he won't be able to read the Divina Commedia in an edition without extensive notes.

This is one of those books that is not necessary but is very entertaining. My darling husband bought this many years ago. However, I have been much more amused with the book than he ever was.The book is subdivided as follows (I have intentionally omitted the titles of the subsections since they are very colorful, which is putting it mildly):1. Basics and Naughty Nuances2. The Four Essentials3. Let's be Creative4. Love and Libido5. Versatile Suffixes6. Anger in Public Places7. Let's Keep it Clean8. For Ladies Only9. Sexual Odds and Ends10. The End (a test)The book covers many different arenas where profanity is useful. Ever wondered how to say \\"hooker\\" or that \\"someone is well endowed\\" in Italian? These are the sorts of things that are covered in this book. There is even an Italian equivalent of \\"road hard and put away wet\\", go figure. I think the most creative insult I saw in this book was \\"you are a hooker without clients.\\" That one really just made me giggle. Not that I can imagine a situation where I would use that phrase. Another excellent one is \\"the flesh of an older hooker is more tender than this steak\\". Only in Italy can they come up with phrases like these. The book also uses many of these words in sentences, for the overachievers in the group.Not everything in this book is rude; some of it is actually useful. They give the Italian for the following phrases that are fit for public consumption:I want you! ********************** Ti amo!I need you! ********************** Ti voglio!I am crazy about you! ************** Sono pazzo per te!You are the only one! ************** Sei l'unico!Without you everything will end! ****** Senza di te tutto finira!If you are looking for a book that has Italian phrases and is entertaining this is the book for you. It won't teach you how to communicate with many people in Italy, but it certainly is enlightening. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Now all I need is a good looking red blooded Italian male to practice my new skills with. On second thought never mind, my husband probably wouldn't approve."},{"Title":"Merda!: The Real Italian You Were Never Taught in School","review":"I am an Italian-American who discovered this book on the bookshelf of one of my older cousins. It is very amusing; you will finally learn what to say to obnoxious taxi drivers! \\"Merda\\" will also teach you some exceedingly crude phrases to use in the throes of passion (although I'm not sure that you should tell your ladylove that she has \\"the body of a goddess\\"; she may become alarmed).\\"Merda\\" contains some very common universal and regional profanities. Anywhere you go in Italy, they will probably understand what you are saying to them. (No, I am not telling you to go around calling total strangers vulgar names, but at least you'll know what to say if you get a bad waiter.) My family vouches for this; with a Southern Italian grandpa, a Northern Nonna, and a Central mom all living in the same house, one gets exposed to some very colorful language.\\"Merda\\" is not a terrible book, but it has its fair share of errors. There are numerous article and noun disagreements (there are 6 ways to say \\"the\\" in Italian, and this book managed to confuse these articles at least 8 times).

The latest one in her \\"American First Ladies\\" series features Dolley Madison, in an easy-to-read format written with middle-school children in mind. The book consists of interviews with Dolley by James Carter, a reporter for a Washington newspaper. Through her own narrative, we learn of the trying times during which Dolley and husband President James Madison occupied the White House, the events leading up to the War of 1812 and its consequences, and the heroism and heart exemplified by Dolley's loyalty to the United States during treacherous, volatile times. Ms. Sherman makes it easy for children to get \\"into\\" Dolley and understand what makes her tick. The story takes place almost 200 years ago, at a time in our history when life was much simpler and patriotism was more clearly defined, and love of country and freedom was becoming the bedrock upon which our nation still rests today.A fascinating glimpse into our nation's past, told clearly and affectionately with Ms. Sherman's imagination and creativity. Adults as well as children will feel comfortable learning history while reading about and enjoying the wonderful character of Dolley Madison."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Pages are all different size and roughly cut.

If he would have kept the book simpler, it might have been a little bit easier to read and understand. It also would have helped if the author would have only given some of the characters one name instead of giving some people two names making it look like they were a completely different person, that was very confusing.It was good at the end when things finally started coming together and making a little more sense. One of my favorite parts was when Pip finally realizes that he is not meant to be a gentleman, and that he was meant to be a blacksmith. The major themes were the only thing that really helped me understand the book. I really didn&#65533;t like this book very much because I couldn&#65533;t really relate to it, therefore, I couldn&#65533;t understand it. I think that we should have read a book that was more modern and practical."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is my least favorite book. I was forced to read it for freshman honors English, or I would have stopped reading it. It has a good plot, but because Dickens was paid by the word, he added too many useless details. I really didn't enjoy dinner scenes that lasted for 17,000 chapters without revealing anything remotely important. However, the way the characters intertwined was fascinating. If you want to get the interesting part of the book, read the cliff's notes. I've also heard it's a little less mind-numbing on tape. Only read the book if you're going to be quizzed on it the next day.

Thanks to a great teacher, we were able to get through this book without too many difficulties; however, I would not recommend this book to anyone who does not want to invest a while in reading it! I took us the whole second semester to finsh this book, doing most of the reading at home. While most everyone was engrossed in the storyline, it was like pulling teeth to actually read! I really enjoyed the story, but I would raher just remember the story than refresh my memory by rereading it because, face it, the story is just too long!P.S.Since I feel this is such a great story, instead of reading the book, might I recommend watching the movie?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In the first twenty or thirty pages, I was pleasantly surprised by Dickens's humor and had great expectations for his storytelling and prose-writing talent.I mean he is hailed as one of the greatest literary giants of English literature, as well as one of the most popular novelists of his time.But alas, my great expectations were dashed mercilessly, and I found myself - not unlike how Pip finds himself in the last portion of the novel - banging my head against the hard, boundless boredom that permeated the first 300 pages of non-drama, non-action, and non-story whose only saving grace was that it was not endless.In the beginning, Dickens sustains the story with action, and there's nothing wrong with that as it makes the story more engaging. But aside from that in the first interminable and insufferable two stages of \\"Pip's Great Expectations\\" that span exactly 300 pages, I was thoroughly disappointed in Dickens. Other than Pip getting rich all of a sudden, NOTHING happens: no desire, no real conflict, no gaps, no turning points.As far as the story is concerned, the 300 pages is crap.I said it. Don't gasp.The story finally, finally, finally picks up when Pip finds out the identity of his benefactor, goes through rather inexplicable mental ordeals about accepting the truth along with free money and sentimental outbursts with his \\"dear friend\\" Herbert about pretty much everything, followed by an incredibly maudlin confrontation with the guilt-stricken Ms. Havisham and a final showdown with the villainous Orlick into whose clutches Pip idiotically falls with a stupid letter that gives him little reason to risk the whole grand escape plan he and Herbert hatch for the next day.My conclusion: this book is overrated.Why is it that academics pick these boring books that can't tell stories as part of the western canon? I love reading classics, thanks, but THIS?The book displays a glaring lack of storytelling talent, psychological insight, and restraint. His prose is dense, sprawling, and unseemly as sentences are connected by ugly semicolons and don't flow beautifully at all. The scenes are more told than shown to the detriment of the flow of the story, and characters burst out into mawkish sentiments left and right.Yuck.People are irresistibly drawn to anything related to themselves. I have a sneaking suspicion that the academics who bill this book as \\"most fascinating\\" and \\"greatest and most sophisticated work\\" see THEIR prominent characteristic in it.Cloying, verbose, mediocre at best in the story composition, and irresistibly boring for the first 300 pages, it's \\"most fascinating\\" in the perplexing literary status it garnered over the years, \\"greatest\\" in its unnecessary length,and \\"most sophisticated\\" in the exquisite boredom it creates at that threshold pitch that is above sleep-inducing but below engaging.I won't be reading another Dickens in a long time.Read something else and save your time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm a senior in high school and was asked to read this book for my AP English 12 class.

That is not entirely true. I am in seventh grade. I not only loved the book, I understood it too. I have done character analyses (for instance: Bentley Drummle had a troubled childhood) and critisized Pip's character. My mom insists that he's a &quot;loser&quot; - but, then again, she never did have that much insight into character. The poor guy is in love so he can hardly see straight! Anyway, I don't pretend that I'm average, because I'm not. But I enjoyed it and understood it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's just too, too bad that no one reads this anymore. It is a timeless story of a young man (love-stricken from young childhood) growing to adulthood by means of a mysterious benefactor. Mr. Jaggers, John Wemmick, Biddy, Matthew and Belinda Pocket, Bentley Drummle, the Aged Parent, and Miss Skiffins are just a few of the absolutely marvelous characters that Dickens created for his story. And how could I forget Estella Havisham, the object of Pip's (christened Phillip) affection? Mr. and Mrs. Joe get a fair part of the story, and they are both delightful - one, because she is so horrible, and the other, because he is so good. A few of the more minor characters (the aformentioned Miss Skiffins is one) such as Trabbe's boy and The Avenger are superb even though they may only speak a few words. If I could give it ten stars, I would!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is Dickens' 3rd last novel, and nothing indicates that he was running out of steam. While this lacks (in my opinion) the energy of &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (1848), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850), &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853), or &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854), it is still a phenomenal piece of literature. Pip is an interesting creation. First we see him as a small child who is victimized by his sister. His brother in law Jo (while not too bright) never approves of Pip's abuse. It is interesting that Dickens wrote this troubled marriage scene soon after his own divorce! It is also painfully tragic when Pip starts to make his way into the world and he has to realize that the kind hearted but simple Jo has to take a back seat to his success. Jaggers offers some welcome comical touches. It is interesting that Pip becomes victimized by a legitimate colleague Orlick and as it turns out, the old thief was his benefactor. (In my opinion the old thief was a literary reincarnation of Fagin.) To this day, I have never forgotten the chills when I discovered that the old thief in the early part of the novel was his benefactor. So we have domestic quarrles, true to life tragic events, strong images, comical touches, and surprise events!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I reallly liked this book, though it made me tired to read it and I could not have any distractions while I read, I am really glad I did. This book was a good challenge if you stick to it. The book all comes together at the end if you keep reading. The characters are really deep. My teacher says the best thing about Great Expectations is it has a twisted plot line and the worst thing about Great Expectations is that it has a twisted plot line. Overall, I enjoyed the book, except the last two chapters. I believe Dickens got tired of writing the book and desided to end the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is superb. Everything about it is very real to life (unlike much of Dickens' other novels). Though it may be hard to comprehend, it doesn't take a genius to understand the themes of this book. I'm not going to spoil it for anybody, but believe me, the themes plays into everybody's life, including love, money, and heritage. I also recommend Catcher in the Rye if you're into the types of books that make you stop and ponder."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read Great Expectetions for school, at first it seemed like the worst book ever written, it was boring, confusing, and seemingly pointless. But, of course that was before I finished it and fully understood what Dickens was tying to convey. the whole book is a mystery, only in the very end do you finally find everything out. Note: if you are going to read the Cliffs Note version of the book (which i highly recommend you do) do not read the character summaries, because that will kill the whole book for you. Believe it or not, this is probabaly the only classial book with enough suspense to compete with the modern thrillers.

However, it is far too good to heap words like &quot;boring&quot; upon simply because it is long and involved. The autobiographical narration lends it a personal quality far more appealing than that of A Tale of Two Cities, and above all Dicken's empathy for his characters is apparent.

The story begins with Pip visiting his parents' grave sites. Here he meets a runaway convict and begins a new journey. The convict persuades young Pip to get food and a file for him. Pip does and the convict is thankful, but later is captured and confesses that he alone stole the food. Pip is sent for by Miss Havisham, a middle-aged woman whose whim it is to live in the bridal dress she wore on the day she was jilted by her lover. She hates all males and sends for Pip to enjoy the sight of him being tormented by Estella, a proud, beautiful young girl. Pip falls in love with her. Pip's sister dies before he comes of age, and Pip receives money from an unknown benefactor. During this time he learns about himself, his love for Estalla, and the unknown benefactor. This book is about a young mans life who has a few unique experiences and what he learns.Charles Dickens uses imagry that takes the form of real objects. The detail and words he uses gives more meaning and detailed images. It allows each situation to be clearly seen. The imagery also comes from the analogies and metaphors. It gave the book more life, more meaning. The visualizable images, metaphor and other kinds of figurative language set up great results thought the entire text."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"OK... I know how Dickens is supposed to be this wonderful author, but lets just face it - Its boring! Its not his fault, when he wrote everyone wrote like that, but these days its just too hard to follow.. The plot was really good tho.. almost like an old soap opera, with twists and turns everywhere.. Now if he could have written the same story in 200-300 pages instead of 500, maybe people would enjoy this book more!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a great mix of humor, thrills and suspense.

Without a doubt, my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; as well as other Dickens novels like &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; were written with a purpose. Dickens was so against some of the evils of his time that he had to do something to speak out against them. And he did. He represents in the lives of his characters the thousands of children forced into inhumane working conditions. And that is just one of wrongs he set out to correct. Carefully read, Dickens provides countless details of English life with its evils and triumphs. I have read several of his novels and always find them inspiring as well as educational."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am not going to bore you with excerpts from the text. But I'll say this, Great Expectations is one of the most compassionate novels a person can read. The complexity of the plot adds a certain greatness which undoubtedly entices the attention of the reader. The story itself teaches us to never give up hope and that our destiny does not depend on our social status; but rather, the quality of our character."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read this book twice: once in the ninth grade and once in college. While I think it is better suited for the college level, I can't say that I found it much more enjoyable the second time. The story revolves around the coming-of-age of Pip, the main character. Raised an orphan, Pip acquires a mysterious benefactor who funds his attempt to become a gentleman. There are some interestingly eccentric characters, and the book relies more on the characters themselves than the plot. However, this is an example of Dickens' wordiness becoming too cumbersome; it simply couldn't maintain my interest throughout the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is a very interesting book to read, from the beginiing scene with Pip at the graveyard to the touching ending of Pip with Estella, Charles Dickens has described wonderfully the plot and all the characters involved and how they all finally fit into place.

I thought Pip was pretty cute when he was a little boy, and I really didn't see any change in him when he became rich like my teacher said. This is a great book, and it's the only book I liked that I ever read in English class along with 'Anthem' and 'Of Mice and Men'. Like most books it goes slow at first, but you get into it more and more. Although I really, really do like this book, I refuse to see the movie which stars Ethan Hawke and Gwenyth Paltrow, because just by looking at the commericals and the pictures from the movie, I could tell that it's not like the book at all and for that, I know that I would hate it. As a matter of fact, my friend told me that it wasn't. So, I refuse to see the movie, but I was able to see an older movie of the book and I liked it, because it was like the book and that's what I like. This is a wonderful book and I wouldn't mind reading it again! A must have for any literature fans who like to sit back, relax, and well...read. : )"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read this book this year for my English class. At first I was interested, when Pip was a child, but I quickly became sick and tired of it's boring nature. I am in the honors program in my school, and we only had about 2 and a half weeks to read it, but it seemed like 2 and a half years. I was disappointed most because this massive plot builds up, and I was waiting for something to happen, but nothing really did. Furthermore, it was a bit hard to understand, especially since my mind was drifting, becuase it is hard to pay attention to this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is definitely one book that I'll read again and again throughout my life. If I had to pick a favorite character, it would probably be Estelle because even though she was cold and distant and VERY conceited, she still had a heart of gold. It was lonely Miss Havisham who made Estelle the cold-hearted person that she was. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading about interesting characters that continue to develop throughout the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've been out of college for awhile.

I picked this up and literally couldn't do anything else until I finished reading it! Highly recommended for anyone who loves good fiction."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"How nice to reread an old classic as an adult, instead of in the classroom. A wonderful novel of Pip who comes into his \\"great expectations\\" via an unknown benefactor -- who he believes to be Miss Havisham. We see how the influence of money and position affect Pip's relations with his family and former neighbors, and not necessarily for the better. There are lots of surprise twists and turns in the plot, especially about Miss Havisham and her adopted \\"daughter\\" Estella and her true parentage.As always, a Dickens novel is peopled with wonderful and unusual characters that eventually all play a part in telling the story. I noticed another reviewer said there were two endings. The version I read had only one ending and I don't know which one it was. I will have to search out another version to see which I liked best."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all (as I like to say!) I'm no smarter than you and I thought this book was great, that said, this book is not THE easiest to read in that it does take a while for things to get really interesting.

Popular modern fiction is so often shallow, and as such seems a waste of time. Which is why I read Great Expectations, it has stood the test of time. I never read it in the past because I assumed that the prose would be somewhat archaic and difficult, but I was wrong, I found it very readable and surprisingly funny, which I also didn't expect.

And you absolutely forget that it is all one person reading. The wonderful descriptors Dickens so artfully paints in complete portraits and scenery with words, flow effortlessly, almost musically so that the it unfolds in the listeners mind as sure as one were reading Dickens' words.

We find a set of interweaving story lines that rival today's best movies ('Crash' comes to mind. Sorry! I digress, already.) Anyway, as usual, the protagonist and narrator, Pip, bears all the innocense of Dickens' best characters. He is able to observe all the qualities and idiosyncracies of the good, the bad, and the ugly in Victorian England. As another orphan character, he is \\"brought up by hand\\" by his strict and nasty sister with the help of his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, a benevolent blacksmith. The plot moves quickly as he comes upon an escaped convict who coerces him to get him food and a file. He finds the experience all too much, for he is in a no-win situation. He manages to escape this escapade with grace, but not the situation his sister places him into. She forces him upon the company of Miss Havisham, an old, bitter woman who has never recovered from being jilted early in life. Through her he meets a young woman, named Estella, and falls hopelessly in love. Through Havisham's patronage, he becomes an apprenticed gentleman as well as Joe's apprenticed blacksmith; then he obtains wealth from a mysterious benefactor. From these experiences, he acquires a gentleman's demeanor as well as a gentleman's appetite for money.\\"Great Expectations\\" is a worthy classic book experience. The characters are drawn well, especially Miss Havisham. (The images Dickens uses for her and her surroundings are among the most memorable of the novel.) It defines what true wealth is, and juxtaposes well the pompous and the hypocritical characters with the genuine and good. 'Great Expectations' demonstrates, more than it preaches, about the virtues presented. Also, the plot lines run together in a way that is so skillful, it hardly seems contrived. There is also some good irony and suspense thrown in for good measure. \\"Great Expectations\\" is a decent and enjoyable reading voyage."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a timeless 19th century novel that addresses issues in life that remain relevant today. In particular, it explores the modern individual's personal development through experiences that span from youth to adulthood.In Great Expectations, Dickens employs several techniques to effectively portray the personal development of the main character Pip. The title, Great Expectations, is significant because it reveals that the plot focuses on Pip's aspirations in life. The novel is a first person narrative, with an older Pip retelling and commenting on past events that had an influence on his social development. This element allows the reader to observe how a young Pip reacted to events in his life and how an older and more mature Pip interprets these events years later. A recurring theme throughout Great Expectations is the class system of Victorian England and the significance of social status. Pip struggles with the issue of social status throughout the novel and must come to the realization that social status is not connected to one's real character.In his novel Great Expectations, Charles Dickens combined aspects of his own life, with his knowledge of human behavior, to create a realistic portrayal of an individual's personal development. The novel's portrayal is so clear and its content so relevant that it continues to be read and analyzed over a century after it was first written."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As young men and women, at some we must make the choice to stay in the community and be a humble fish in a little pond or strike out on our own in the big city.There are many ways to do this and Pip, the main character, does it scornfully although he does not know it at the time. Like so many people, he is lured by the bright lights, \\"sophisticated\\" culture and big money of the big city. He has no problem leaving behind a simple world where he is cared for via an unknown benefactor for an unknown reason. He guesses at whom the benefactor might be and what their intent is, but he gets it all wrong. He falls from the path of moral righteousness and has no idea what his life really means. Dickens masterfully crafts together this story. I think that Joe represented good Pip and Orlick was the alter ego. Additionally, I was kicking myself for not seeing a couple of plot twists, but I was so engrossed that I didn't see them coming. I hope the same thing happens to you.I wonder if F.S. Fitzgerald was influenced by Dickens because there is a fantasy like worship of the rich, followed by a downward spiraling degradation. Although F.S.F writes about the rich with outright contempt, Dickens neutrally accepts them more as a vehicle for the story.Anyway, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens' novel Great Expectations explores the side of human nature that many do not like to read in novels. In the United States, in the 21st Century, people would rather read about romantic-style plots where all turns out well for the protagonists. Dickens, however, chooses to illuminate what man can really be capable of: betrayal, duplicity, unfaithfulness, and a handful of other negative characteristics.Definitely an interesting novel, Great Expectations will undoubtedly have its audience intrigued and constantly pondering.I would highly recommend this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Unlike many of the reviewers who wrote so passionately about this work it is not a book that has played a significant part in my reading life. The great narrative drive, the tremendous skill in creating vital characters, the richly descriptive and often ironic language are aspects of Dickens genius.But somehow the world of Dickens dark and gloomy and Victorian and so British reality never really appealed to me. This says nothing however about the quality of the work and its great gifts to the reader. The book is the portrayal of a society, and of a moral education. This is a book about the formation of a character through experience, about learning from life's difficulties and disappointments to become a better person. It is about ' recognition' not only of one's own true and better self, but about what is important in life. This book as Dickens himself has had enormous influence on Western literature. I think of two very different writers, Kafka and Salinger both of whom clearly had Dickens in mind in certain points of their writing. Pip, Magwitch , Joe Gargary,Miss Havisham, Estella are living characters in the heart of Western literature. The book then I believe is far greater, far more than my own reading has given me of it. Not always apparently does the reader do justice to the work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i was a assigned this book to read over the summer between 8th and 9th grade for my honors english (it seems as though many students are assigned this book going into 9th grade honors english. is it some sort of nation-wide standard?)... at parts the language can be thick and a little harder to decipher than most the language of most authors people my age are used to reading... this is only a slight hindrance, though, because about half way trhough the book (assuming this is your first dickens book, as it was for me) you get used to it and you seem to be talking like pip in real life!!!!!!!

The story is narrated by Pip, brought up by hand by his sister, Mrs Joe Gargery, commanded to attend Miss Havisham, jilted bride now in decay, where he falls in love with the beautiful Estella and decides he wants to be a gentleman. Eventually, apprenticed to Joe Gargery, blacksmith, he comes into a fortune, and is convinced his benefactor is Miss Havisham, intending him to become a gentleman so he can marry Estella. Miss Havisham's intentions for Estella, of course, differ markedly from this. Dickens includes a rich cast of characters: the guilty and regretful Pip; the cold and cruel Estella; the warm Herbert and Clara; the kind-hearted and faithful Joe and Biddy; the capable Jaggers; the split-personality Wemmick; the nasty Orlick; the single-minded Magwitch. Great Expectations is a much easier and funnier read than the only other Dickens book I can remember reading, and this books immediate predecessor, A Tale of Two Cities, and I noted the echo of the knitting women at the gallows in Estella's actions.

In my opinion, GE is a glorious (not glorified) soap opera chronicling the wildly fluctuating vicissitudes of Philip Pirrip's (Pip's) eventful life, from an orphaned, tormented child apprenticed to genial blacksmith Joe to, by a turn of ironic fate, a wealthy \\"gentleman\\" of leisure. As been often noted, Dickens created worlds, if not universes, in his novels, and GE is certainly no exception. In this review, I will try to avoid detailing the plot, which is already well-known. Instead, I will comment upon Dickens's use of backstory and flashback to flesh out most of the major characters in the novel.Even the most colorful, flamboyant characters in GE are not one-dimensional or stereotypically good or evil. We learn how Miss Havisham's marital jilting by Arthur compelled her to become a spectral recluse in her gloomy estate. We learn how Miss Havisham's misanthropic upbringing caused her frosty ward Estella (whose name suggests a blazing but distant star) to become an inaccessible man-hater. We learn how Magwitch, Pip's surprising benefactor, became a convict through cynical ad hominem prosecution in the barbaric English court system, was transported to the penal colony that was Australia, and how he acquired the money through hardship just to help the orphan Pip, who showed him mercy at the graveyard, and why he risked arrest in London to see his gentleman. We learn that Estella's mother, servant to Mr. Jaggers the lawyer, was convicted of murder but saved, after a fashion, by the lawyer and how she had to sacrifice her daughter so that she could become a lady. We even learn about the somewhat schizophrenic Wemmick, Jagger's clerk, who is sullen and joyless at work but positively animated and exuberant when he is at home (The Castle) with his elderly invalid father The Aged. Through these backstories, we find out that no Dickensian character is ultimately utterly despicable, or demonic, or flawless, or saintly. They are all achingly human, trying to live life the best they can.Since GE is primarily about the growth and development of Pip, we witness his human complexity most of all. In a paraphrase of a comment made by his friend Herbert, Pip is intelligent and naive, curious and hesitant, loyal and perfidious, snobbish but introspective, a false gentleman (through wealth) and a true gentleman (through re-discovered contrition, feeling, and love). Dickens's revelation of the humanity that still lurks in the most wretched of us is encapsulated nicely by Pip's caretaker and brother-in-law, the brawny but forgiving Joe, who says about his abusive father, \\"Whatsumever the failings on his part, dear reader, remember that he was that good in his heart\\". This noble, some may say Christian, sentiment, elevates GE beyond its busy, coincidental melodramatic soap opera plottings and trains its sharp focus on the multifaceted levels of the human condition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Compared to other Dickens' books I have read, this one is the most bizarre and strange story, and it took a little bit of adjustment to get into it. But it didn't take long to lose myself in the magical, grand drama by this literary wizard. As usual, this book has rich background materials, the marshes, deprivation, violence, mysterious and dark past, turns and twists, surprises and over the top coincidences, vengence and forgiveness...The first person perspective by the protagonist is candid and often humorous as well as insightful about the conflict and frustration of an underprevileged person with aspirations in the society where status of a person is not very mobile.

A classic story of poor boy makes good, loses his good fortune, finds it again through sacrifice and character and hard work. Lots of interesting examinations of British class separation and discrimination, expectations, and dry humor.

I thought it was an extremely good story. The characters (my favorites being Orlick and Trabb's Boy) are brilliant and subtley funny. The story is creative and unpredictible, and overall, it was absolutely supberb. The only reason this book doesn't get 5 stars is because it tends to drag a lot of the time, and Dickens overlong descriptions are a bit grating on the nerves, but I DO understand why people would have liked it like that in the 1800's. They liked their books long and juicy. It's a bit dated but Great Expectations is well worth a read if you have the patience. Even if you are impatient, you can not miss this great story and its wonderful characters, so at least see one of the many great movie adaptions.

It has all the classic Dickens-style plot twists, with some great surprises, as well as some pretty contrived coincidences (also classic Dickens).I only took off a star because the ending was changed from how i remembered it. When I googled it, I found that Dickens often changed the endings of his books in to go with the times..... not a big fan of that!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I just graduated with a Literature degree and, amazingly, had never read anything by Dickens. I had gained a sort of superiority to the man and his works. I would dismiss it as all sentimental unbelievabilities. But I decided to not be so proud and read one of his books. On a recommendation from one of my professors, I started with Great Expecations. What I found was a deeply engrossing, funny and humane book that captivated me for the week and a half that it took to read it. Much of it was very realistic (barring, of course, the unrealistic coincidences, that are actually, in their own way, quite comforting) and believable. Dickens went a long way to get into the mind of his narrator, and it works beautifully, as we struggle with Pip in every decision and look back with him at the bad decisions that he made. The themes of the novel (pride, isolation, friendship, hopeless love, etc.) can easily be translated into our own society, putting ourselves in the shoes of the characters as we deal with our mistakes and try to do the right thing. A very amazing book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There is no doubt that Charles Dickens' \\"Great Expectations\\" is a masterpiece. The intricacy of its plot has rarely been matched. Its characters are unforgettable. It speaks powerfully to what it means to be human.Pip is the perfect picture of flawed humanity. He is essentially well meaning, but his vision always seems to get cloudy at just the wrong time. Throughout the book, Pip falls prey to his dreams and infatuations. In the process he ignores those who truly love him. Only in the end does he learn, in catastrophic terms, the importance of love. Only then is able to accept it.\\"Great Expectations\\" is the story of Pip's learning process. Along the way we encounter some of Dickens greatest secondary characters: the fierce Mr. Jaggers, the self-centered and mentally unstable Mrs. Havisham and her heartless prodigy Estella, and Pip's great friend Joe.I give a special recommendation to this Bantam Classic edition of the work. Its introduction by John Irving is one of the greatest pieces of criticism ever written.Though not my favorite Dickens novel, I give \\"Great Expectations\\" a heartfelt recommendation."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations succeeds beyond almost all novels of its time in exploring the roots of character and moral behavior. Charles Dickens makes the case for there being the potential for good in everyone. Evil and sin follow from a combination of being self-absorbed and selfish. What is remarkable about the way these themes are handled is that they are clearly based on an assessment of human psychology, long before that field was established.The book is also remarkable for its many indelibly memorable and complex characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are characters you will think about again and again in years to come.The book also surrounds you with a powerful sense of place. Although the England described here is long gone, it becomes as immediate as a nightmare or a dream that you have just awakened from.For a book about moral questions, Great Expectations also abounds in action. The scenes involving Pip and Magwitch are especially notable for way action expresses character and thought.Great Expectations also reeks of irony, something that is seldom noticed in more modern novels. Overstatements are created to draw the irony out into the open, where it is unmistakable. Yet the overstatements attract, rather than repel. The overstatements are like the theatrical make up which makes actors and actresses look strange in the dressing room, but more real on the stage when seen from the audience.At the same time, the plot is deliciously complex in establishing and solving mysteries before that genre had been born. As you read Great Expectations, raise your expectations to assume that you will receive answers to any dangling details. By reading the book this way, you will appreciate the craft that Mr. Dickens employed much more.This is the third time that I have read Great Expectations over the last 40 years. I found the third reading to be by far the most rewarding. If you like the book, I encourage you to read it again in the future as well. You will find that the passage of time will change your perspective so that more nooks and crannies of the story will reveal themselves to you.If this is to be your first reading of the book, do be patient with the book's middle third. It may seem to you that the book is drifting off into a sleep-inducing torpor. Yet, important foundations are being lain for your eventual delight.Mr. Dickens wrote two endings for Great Expectations. Be sure to read both of them. Which one do you prefer? I find myself changing my mind.Give love with an open heart, without expectations!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"All right. I admit it. The book starts out slow. Dickens, though I love the man, writes in such flowery and long winded language at times.

I'm very happy I did not.With so many detailed threads in the story, the depth to the characters--when they all start to blend together a few chapters in, the result is page-turning.The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. You cannot help but love the boy. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who refuses to return your sentiments and only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself, as shocking as they may turn out to be.I felt as if I was side by side with Pip through it all, and that made the novel a wonderful experience for me. I recommend the novel for the young because so much relates to them, and also for the older readers--because you can experience it all again.A wonderful and heart warming tale. Just get through those first chapters.The book is timeless, with the basic story line being one that has affected almost everyone sometime in their life; falling in love with somebody who does not return the feelings. Pip, the main character, falls in love with an exotic and beautiful girl, Estella, but of course she does not have any feelings for him. So Pip does everything he can to win her approval, and most importantly her heart. It is hard to skip around in the book. While some passages might seem as if they have nothing to do with the story, they do. Everything in the story is tied together somehow. Skimming the book is not going to help. Certain events and people the reader thinks are insignificant or forgot completley, will appear over and over throughout the book. I am glad that i decided to read Great Expectations, despite the negative remarks from peers. I found out that most of them never made it past the first few chapters, so they missed out on the good parts. The only reason I did not give the book a higher score is that parts of it are slow and dry, but stick with it, you will not be upset. --This text refers to the Mass Market Paperback edition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens, for whatever reason, never crossed my path in high school, and in the years since I have found myself intimidated to pick up one of his books. This year I resolved to get over that and selected 'Great Expectations' to be my first venture into Dickens' famous fictional worlds. And what joy! As it turns out I had no reason to be intimidated because Dickens is imminently readable and highly enjoyable.This novel is told from the point of view of Philip Pirrip, nicknamed Pip, who begins his tale as a young boy visiting the graves of his parents when an escaped convict happens upon him and threatens him into helping him get food. This experience will have a huge impact on Pip's life, although just how huge is left to be discovered until much later in the novel. Pip soon finds himself in the service of an eccentrically, manically wounded old woman and her beautiful but cold-hearted charge Estella, whom Pip is doomed to fall for and spend the rest of his days pining for. He begins to feel oppressed by his poor life, anguished that his miserable situation will never be good enough to win Estella's heart. And so it seems to be a blessing when a mysterious benefactor takes Pip away from his home to make a gentleman of him in London. Certainly Pip is pleased to have been \\"rescued\\", but over the course of his teaching a curious thing happens to him: he begins to lose the humanity that had made him such an upstanding young man in the first place. He forsakes relations with his loving family, judges his best friend as a great guy doomed to failure, and slowly allows his finances to spin out of control as he begins to spend more and more of his unnamed benefactor's money.'Great Expectations' is, ultimately, a journey of self discovery. Pip rises in society and leaves his life behind him without realizing just how much it had been worth to him. When he reflects on all that has happened to him and wonders if the inaptitude he had sensed in his friend \\"had never been in him at all, but had been in me,\\" it is a thoughtful discovery that really makes you think about what is truly important in your own life. What makes someone a success? Is it the amount of money in their bank account? Or is it the friendships they forge? Does someone need to be educated to be happy, or can they just be satisfied with what they have? Dickens pulls you along through Pip's story with a great deal of wit and a dash of cynicism that, refreshingly, serves to enlighten the reader rather than depress them. It is an intelligent and heartfelt novel that has become a classic for all of the right reasons, and is one that remains relevant to modern readers -- the true test of a classic, in my opinion. As for myself, I have been thoroughly enchanted by my first experience with Dickens, and look forward to reading many more of his books in the coming year."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was my first book by Charles Dickens, and I still believe it to be my favorite. It is a very powerful book that connects with people's lives all over. The main character,Pip, grows up in the home of a blacksmith. With both of his parents dead, he lives with his overreactive sister and her husband, Joe Gargery. Pip soon meets Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella that lives with her. He longs to be a gentleman, but the social class division leaves Pip a blacksmith apprentice, and Estella a lady. However, one night, Mr. Jaggers (a lawyer)comes to Pip and informs him that he is a man of great expectations. Pip has no idea of who his benefactor is, but heads to London to start his eventful life as a gentleman.Great Expectations is a amazing book in many ways. Three of these ways are: the themes, the characters, and the writing. Themes in this book are very important. They can easily relate to us today, and these main ideas are crucial lessons through literature. Next, the characters. Dickens creates such perfect characters that they will stay in your mind and you will begin to link people you know to people in the book. Such characters include Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Mr. Jaggers, Magwitch, Herbert Pocket, and many others. These people in Great Expectations make the book enjoyable to read. Lastly, the writing is awesome. Sentences are easily read, and the suspense keeps you reading from cover to cover.Great Expectations will always be one of my favorite books, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a challenge, and a excellent read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"An outstanding book that I read this year was Great Expectations. This was a wonderful classic written by the magnificent author Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens wrote a book that truly captivated the power of human love. He showed us that life can be very difficult, and you have to work very hard in order for you to succeed.In the beginning of the book, a character named Pip lived on a forge near some marshes in England. His family was generally poor. He lived with his older sister and her husband named Joe. Joe was a fairly poor blacksmith. One day, Pip was walking on the marshes. Suddenly, a strange man came up to Pip and threatened him. The strange man was a convict who was put to die on the marshes. He was handcuffed and chained. He told Pip that he would kill him if he didn't bring him a steel file and something to eat. Pip then ran back to the forge and brought the convict a steel file and some food. This vivid occurrence haunted Pip for the rest of his life.After the incident on the marshes, Pip met a lady named Miss Havesham. Miss Havesham was a very weird lady. She always wore her wedding dress in her house. She never left her house. Miss Havesham had a very beautiful adopted daughter named Estella. She was an arrogant woman. While looking at her, Pip fell in love with Estella.One day, a mysterious man came to Joe's forge. This man was sent by a secret benefactor who was residing in London. The man didn't give his name. He told Pip and Joe that someone in London was requesting him. The secret benefactor wanted Pip to come to London so that he could become a gentleman. Pip was very excited when he heard that he could work in London. Pip and Joe agreed upon the proposal. Later in that same week, Pip left Joe's forge to travel to London. There he could be a gentleman with a bright and bold future.While in London, Pip encountered many strange mysteries. Pip finally met his secret benefactor. Read the book to find out who the secret benefactor was...Overall, Great Expectations was an outstanding book. It really captivated the vast stretches of life. Great Expectations really made me feel quite sad. I felt very sorry for Pip. He had a very difficult life. He had change his personality forever once he became a gentleman. I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys reading classics. I have read other excellent books by the wonderful author Charles Dickens. I have read Oliver Twist and The Christmas Carol. They were also excellent books."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am 15 and reading is my least favorite thing to do. If I ever read, it's only for a few minutes. Not with this book, I read it all day, and so far have read it several times. I don't know about this edition however, b/c it is for younger readers. I am also sure that whatever edition you get will be great. This book shows tons of emotions, and is guided by the narrator, Pip. It is a superb book, that once you pick up you will never put down.Pip is raised by his sister and brother-in-law, both named Joe, b/c of his parents being dead.

Brought back so many childhood memories and thrills !! Worth reading over and over !"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel mostly because of the rich text and language Dickens used to display the imagery. Dickens wrote this piece in such detail that allows the audience to fully engage in the text, relate to Pip and his struggles, and bring a deeper thought to the way we treat our individual social statuses. As citizens of the United States, we are obligated to work our way to \\"the top of the food chain\\". The majority of the time, we are not given a high status, by blood or other means, to build a superior reputation for ourselves. Therefore we must have the will and determination to make our personal goals become reality. In Great Expectations, Pip's struggles and adventures are great examples of how the audience can relate to the story line and setting throughout the novel to our own personal lives.I thought that Dickens' creatively demonstrated that an individual's social status is not what determines the rights of respect and standards on a person's character. The ability to prove our greater meaning in this world is not something that the government can label us on. As humans, we have the right to make mistakes and errors in life, but out of the morals and standards in which we uphold allow us to make those mistakes result in a learning experiences. Pip strives to become a better man throughout the novel for various reasons. However, Great Expectations allows us to see the connection between the book and real life. In both situations there are/ will be countless obstacles getting in the way of ambitions we set. When Pip decides to leave Joe behind and pursuit his ambitions of becoming a true gentleman he made a decision, much like Dickens himself, to benefit his own life. With any decision there must be great responciblity and will.Personally, I strongly believe that anyone can improve their well-being within a reasonable manner. Only with dedication and support from relatives or friends can one truly achieve their goal. Sometimes our goals don't have the exact result we wished for, but we should be grateful for what we have and work hard for what we want to improve. What I have learned from this book is that no matter what your status is in school, work, at home, or in society as a whole, we all have the ability to make something greater of ourselves. Each individual has the capability to achieve all of ambitions in life we wish to imagine."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is one of my favorite books, so when I got my kindle I was delighted to see it for free.

Still highly pertinent in the 21st century."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Contentment in life is a struggle; in \\"Great Expectations,\\" by Charles Dickens, a young boy is faced with disappointed expectations of ambition and desire for social self-improvement. Set in the mid-nineteenth century in Kent and London, England, social class is portrayed as utmost importance. For young orphaned Philip Pirrip-Pipp- life is a struggle of realization of the real world and place in life as well as culture. Through traumatic events, mishaps and altered expectations to the truth, Pipp learns that social improvement is irrelevant to one's real worth.The reoccurring motif in, \\"Great Expectations,\\" is in direct relation to the major them of self-improvement through social class. Through characters, places, and infatuations, this motif is prominent. Miss. Havisham, Estella, the Satis House, and Bently Drummle all introduce different levels and perceptions of social class of the 1800's. Bentley Drummle represents the grotesque side of high class, Miss. Havisham and Estella are the quintessence of the highly educated, lavish and greatly respected side of the upper class, and the Satis House is merely the embodiment of the riches young Pipp adores and idolizes. Each character not only adds to Pipp's life long obsession of social well being, but life lessons learned in his battle for fulfillment."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens was one of the most popular writers of all time, creating some of the best-known characters in English literature. In the book \\"Great Expectations\\", the protagonist and narrator, Pip begins the story as a young orphan boy being grown up by his sister. I like this book, because Charles Dickens takes you right inside the Pip's mind and you live through the events and discoveries of his life with him. Pip is passionate, romantic and somewhat unrealistic at heart. That makes the novel interesting. Of course, you cannot forget the great love story (Pip and Estella). The other characters Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Miss Joe, Estella, Mr Jaggers and Mr Wemmick are all unique and special in their way and they add to the novel's richness. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are interrelated to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel. This novel will make you sometimes laugh and sometimes make you feel sad, but it is always entertaining. Latif Dose simplifies the texts. The language is very clear. There are not old English words and this gives the reader much pleasure while reading the novel. I think most young people would like this novel because it's not as hard to read as an other classic books. I recommend Great Expectations to anyone who wants to read a good, classic book because Great Expectations has a little bit of everything in it, mystery, romance and suspense. You cannot easily find all of these properties in other novels, which makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a special and a classic one.. That makes this novel very different. It is probably one of the top ten English novels of the 19th century. Some of the passages are beautiful. I cannot forget Pip's response to Estella when she says \\"You will get me out of thoughts in a week.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There is really no need to recount the plot of this classic - I think most people who are thinking about reading it already know it is a story of poor boy done good and has wrong assumptions about how he comes about it. But despite the storyline being well-worn, there is till so much to get from this story. What comes across most clearly is the theme that nothing comes without strings-attached - Pip's great fortune, that at first looked like manna from on high, turns out to cause more trouble than it is worth.Dickens is a joy to read - his description is masterful, and his ability to paint pictures of his eccentric characters is unsurpassed - the contrasts between the charming Mr Wemmick and the slimy Mr Jaggers; the amazing Miss Havisham; the self important Pumblechook (who I could not stand! Is there any character in literature so annoyingly self-deluded?). My absolute favourite is Joe - his convoluted ways of attempting to pass information onto Pip, his attempts to spare Pip from his evil sister and his localised venacular. The only disappointing characters are the two main ones - Pip comes across as insipid, uninspiring, and frankly undeserving of the fortune that he falls into. Estella is so sketchily drawn that you never get any feel for her, and I think that given how much complexity Dickens manages for some of the minor characters, he could have afforded more to Estella.However, this is a great read. Don't read it just because you fell you \`have to read a classic' - read it because it is a well written story with the right balance of humour and pathos."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I don't think I'd be giving away much of the plot if I were to say that the story revolves around Pip, a young, middle class orphan who has dreams to be a wealthy, respected gentleman, but has no hope of this as he is a rural blacksmith apprentice. His prospecs change, however, when a mysterious, anonymous benefactor offers to make Pip's dream a reality. I won't give away the ending, but the novel supports Dickens' belief that the middle class is the class to which people should aspire.The plot of this story wasn't to my liking. Dickens' attempts towards the end to wrap all the subplots into one neat little package annoyed me...similar to plot twists in modern Hollywood movies--things so outrageously convienent that it makes one want to roll his eyes. The manner in which things are written, however is fantastic. While the main characters are rather boring, the minor characters, (especially Biddy, Herbert Pocket, and John Wemmick) were much more interesting. Thankfully, Dickens focused on them enough to flesh them out and make them memorable. I would recommend this book, not because I enjoy the plot, but because the writing style is superior and because I, being lower middle class, enjoyed the positive viewpoint Dickens extended concerning my class."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"What have I missed all these years? I'm ashamed to admit that this is the first Charles Dickens' I've read and I'm 40! Heavens forbid! Don't make the same mistake.......read this book now!I've spent the past week being thoroughly entertained by Pip! No wonder Dickens' is considered such a great writer....this book will have you laughing out loud, and being inspired by the incredible depth of understanding Dickens has for the human condition at all levels of society.....and he manages to do so while weaving a story about one young boy's transformation and maturation...and the tradeoffs for every choice in life.Once you pick this book up, you won't want to put it down until you finish. It's that good!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens, along with Dostoevsky, stands atop my list of novelists who could most accurately portray the subtleties of human emotion and passion. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is simply a masterpiece of 19th-century fiction, and is pure Dickens. In this semi-autobiographical work (a trademark of Dickens' writings), the life of a poor young boy, Pip, is followed from his humble beginnings to his rise into the middle-class, due to the mysterious aid of an unknown benefactor. His pursuit of Estella, a beautiful young girl raised to break the hearts of men by her jilted caretaker, Ms. Havisham, is a classic of literature that has been repeated countless times since. The tragic, gradual break between Pip and his family (particularly the humble but caring Joe) is heartwrenching. Pip's eventual realization of the insincerity of the middle class, and his love for Joe, brought tears to my eyes.&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a wonderful, moving book that has been copied and satired again and again, from Mishima's &quot;Forbidden Colors&quot; to South Park. An important and unforgettable novel!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A great story about a young man who has lost his mother and father and is being raised by only his older sister, Charles Dickens' &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a story of diversity, poverty, and growing up.

As Pip grows up, he must strive to understand what is going on, and why it is going on.The book is very long and almost covers Pip's entire life. The book is enriched with humor that we can all relate to. Short episodes make up the majority of the book.

And even I have to appreciate this classic. Charles Dickens knew what he was doing, okay? Great Expectations is a classic, and there's a reason it's a classic. For the plain and simple fact it was well written, with an interesting plot and a good twist. Just because something doesn't contain profanity, sex and violence doesn't mean it should be presumed boring. A basic summary - it tells the story of life, obsessions and social status. As far as I'm concerned, it isn't boring. Just wake up to yourselves, teenage world. Virginia Andrews isn't the extent of reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I find myself surprised at the comments provided by earlier reviewers. One critic gave &quot;Great Expectations&quot; one star because he/she failed a test. Why should Dickens be blamed for that? Another said there was no structure (in a Dickens novel???). Another, that there was &quot;little direction and less power.&quot; That there was no theme and no plot. Perhaps I am seeing things that aren't there but, whatever the shortcomings are, it is not in plot, themes, or characterization. It is the story of the orphan Philip Pirrip, known to everyone as Pip, from the age of about seven to the age of twenty-three, with a brief section at the end that takes place about eleven years later. Pip is being brought up \\"by hand\\" by his loud and quarrelsome sister and her kind and quiet husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. Young Pip is soon asked to serve in the home of Miss Havisham, who appears to be half mad since the day, years earlier, when she had been left at the alter by her old lover. Miss Havisham is raising a young girl named Estella to be heartless in her treatment of men when she grows up as a form of revenge against all men. And, Pip naturally falls in love with her. After a few years, Pip finds himself wealthy due to some unknown benefactor (who he mistakenly thinks is Miss Havisham and who he also believes has planned to have Estella marry him when they are older) and he now has \\"great expectations\\" made of him. He plans to become a gentleman and he leaves the kind and devoted Joe to live in London, Pip hoping to leave behind his humble past of which he now feels ashamed. After a few more years, he discovers that his unknown benefactor was Abel Magwitch whom he had helped when he was seven. Magwitch had been convicted and deported to Australia where he became a wealthy sheepman. Even though Magwitch was forbidden to return to England, he does so just to see the young man he had been helping to become a gentleman. Through problems with the law trying to arrest Magwitch, problems with Magwitch's past, the loss of the fortune and of Pip's great expectations, and through illness, Pip discovers the basic goodness in Joe, the devotion of Magwitch and of Pip's close friend Herbert Pocket, and what really is important. He discovers the value of family and of close friends and confidants. Estelle, who had married a cruel oaf, also learns her lessons and finds that she may have a heart as well (in the more common of the two endings of the novel). This is a great novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"If you're like me, you were forced to read some Dickens in High School and found him to be pedantic and to sound archaic.

I enjoyed getting the feel of what it was like in the old days of Britain."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am making my way through Charles Dickens...not in any particular order...the first few I've picked are mostly familiar through TV or film adaptations that I've enjoyed and/or on the recommendations of friends.\\"Bleak House\\" was my first read, finished last month. \\"Great Expectations\\" is my second read.What can I say? I am just so enamored with Dickens's story-telling and character development that I have a fear that when I am done reading his canon I'll have to declare a 13-way tie for first place. We'll see.Between Bleak House and Great Expectations I *almost have a two-way tie for first place, in no small part because they are such different types of books...Bleak House was a universe of characters and subplots; Great Expectations fewer characters and not as much intrigue, although the last 1/4 to 1/3 of the book is riveting. And some good comedy also.But I am going to put GE at #1 and BH at #2...while I loved Bleak House as I read it, and have a few favorite characters, \\"Great Expectations\\" will *stay with me* much much longer I think...Bleak House is brilliant (really brilliant) for its commentary on the period and for its settings and for its intricacies; Great Expectations is brilliant because it is simple and timeless.I'm not nearly vain or clever enough to think I'm the first to recognize this, but three neat things about Great Expectations are: 1) it's a novel which illustrates the old warning \\"Be Careful What You Wish For...\\", 2) it is the complete opposite of \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" - an earnest, non-cynical first-person narrator who meets so much kindness along the way, and fewer \\"phonies\\" (although there are a few), and 3) it's such a personal novel that anyone who dares wonder what they could possibly learn about human nature by reading such an \\"old\\" book NEEDS to read it for that very reason.The characters are just so memorable...if I had to pick a favorite, I think it would be Wemmick...you probably work with him and don't even know it: he's the man (or woman) who is competent at work, works for an insufferable boss, and has a completely different home life than work life. His care of \\"The Aged\\" is a remarkable example for any of us in caring for our parents.The love stories are also very touching - especially the ones that turn out for the best...but no spoilers in this review.And the story of Pip's unrequited love is so true to life...and although I think it would have been worse for Pip to lose Estella had she been more than just beautiful outside but also beautiful inside, Dickens wrote beautifully and agonizingly of the highs and lows associated with unrequited love as only one who has experienced it can truly identify. One of the worst and most painful aspects is not the fact that you aren;t chosen but that they chose *that* person. And all you can think is: anybody...anybody but *them*.A memorable book and must reading.Now on to another Dickens novel! :-)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It is one of the magnificent books in history that everyone should have.

The haunting figure of Miss Havisham has stayed with me since my 10th grade literature class (almost 30 years ago) and my recent rereading of the novel brought her horrid existence into full view again. The plot has twists and turns and although I found myself having to stop reading and letting certain episodes sink into my understanding, the beauty and scope of the writing is truly remarkable. As a young student of Dickens, I resisted the long descriptions and difficult dialogue and I don't remember loving the book when I read it the first time. As an adult, however, my admiration for the novel is undeniable."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read Charles Dickens's book Great Expectations. This book is about a young boy named Pip. Pip lives with his older sister Mrs. Gargery who is married to a black smith named Joe. Early in the book Pip meets an escaped convict that was on the run. He may not know it yet but the convict will have a lasting affect on him. When Joe finds out about the convict he asks Pip to help the police catch him. After a quick battle the convict and his partner are caught. Later in the book Pip meets Miss Haversham whose cold ward Estella Pip adores. An unknown person pays for Pip to go to London and become a gentleman.Charles Dickens is a wonderful writer. The Great Expectations is a great example of Dickens writing power. Moby Dick and other books are just as well done. I enjoyed reading the Great Expectations it was a long and detailed story of adventure and affection. I hope you enjoyed reading it too."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I can only agree, a great book that is very nicely done and is easy to read. I like it, it is simply a classic everyone should have read!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This seems to be a very nice copy of the book, it is easy to read in its big font and looks nice aswell. :)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yes, Dickens was paid by the word when writing this.Yes, this is a big bookYes, if you were forced to read it in school, you probably hatedYes, if you read it on your own at or after age 25... you probably loved it.I for one, thought this book was great, sure it was wordy, but it was not wordy in that \\"what the heck is he trying to say\\" way that gets many other wordy books (Crime and Punishment - though I blame the translators for that one).Short Summary: This is the story of Pip, starting from a young age after his parents and many younger siblings are deceased and he is being raised by his militant sister and her lovable but slightly dense husband, Joe. Pip has very little hope of a future other than an apprenticeship with Joe as a Blacksmith. Suddenly... doors start opening for Pip, and opportunities present themselves to him. He accepts but never knows who or why strings are being pulled in the background to open these doors for him. We follow Pip through his life as he accepts these opportunities, and they lead him down a strange but wonderful path of self discovery, maturity, and opening his eyes to the real world.The reason this book is so effective is because Pip is so real. We follow him through his blunders and successes, we dread his putting his foot in his mouth, saying the wrong things to Biddy, or Ms. Haversham, and we rejoice when he commits selfless acts and hate him when he commits selfish ones. It is my personal opinion that this book will have more of an affect on the late twenty year olds and up because by then you have suffered a bit, and made some of the same mistakes as Pip, you have wandered through finding your way in the world, and the confusion of who you are, wishing you were something else, loving what or who you cannot have, and figuring out what path to put your life on.The rest of the cast of characters is quite a collection of multifaceted, entertaining, and interesting people. Ms. Haversham is a favorite of many, so strange, so tortured, so heartless, and so intriguing... then we have Dear old Joe, so Simple, and mild, and encouraging. Joe's love is unconditional and unwavering. Biddy, is so loyal, so kind, and so honest, then you have her polar opposite, Estella. There are so many other characters that are interesting, fun to read about and that you will have strong feelings for one way or another.I highly recommend this book, even though it is over a century old, the language is not difficult to read (very little work required) and the plot and characters are stellar. True there are no explosions, but a book can be engaging with out them. Give it a try."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I agonized through this book in HS and have recently breezed through it. About 30 years have passed in between.What I was most struck by in my second reading was how relevant the story was to our own times. Child abuse and emotionally damaging relationships, celebrity lawyers, prison reform, the dangers of easy credit, how easily a person can dispose of their past identity. Dickens wrote about this 140+ years ago but he could have been writing about the present day. Yes, a reader has to warm up to the 19th century language, but once that happens, the characters and their emotions are so authentic and fully developed. I found myself so annoyed at Pip in the middle of the novel, I almost put it down. How could I possibly care about such an obnoxious young man. But I did care and cared more and more deeply as the book wound down. Pip's transformation was convincing because the reader sees how it occurs in small increments. In the end I took a deep breath and thought to myself, well, Pip, you finally grew up. It may not be the best book to force teenagers to read, but I hope mature readers will take it up and find the treasures inside."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is an incredible masterpiece of storytelling. Charles Dickens is witty and intelligent. He creates characters that you are able to warm to and he is able to sculpt a brilliant plot.

I read David Copperfield after, which was supposedly Dickens' most belove character, but I enjoyed GE much more. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is Charles Dickens' version of the poor kid fantasy. This is almost a fable, I would say. This is the kind of story that you hear over and over growing up in poverty. It is almost in the category of Robin Hood, but this is the real thing in the flesh and blood. The old man in the cemetery scene still plays over and over in my mind. I should have read everything written by Charles Dickens by now, but yet I haven't. I started A Tale of Two Cities a little while ago and I have it on my night stand. I think that I'll get back to it tonight. I don't know who beats Dickens in superb phrasing and style.

Charles Dickens' eloquent language enthrawls you and keeps you reading on. I have seen how some people find this hard to get through; I was 12 when I read it and I understood it perfectly and loved it. Others think it is too long - this just gives you more to enjoy. I also had to read it because I was told to (for school) and I just read with enjoyment without focusing on every little detail like others have (which in my view is the reason for their disliking.) This book is a classic which must be read. Words cannot describe the quality of the book. Take my advice - purchase a copy and READ IT!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book at the beginning seemed to me a little boring but as i read on it got really interesting.

It really makes you think about yourself, society, and the world. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There really aren't words for this book.

The characters are unforgettable and the story which starts out slow in the beginning grows very quickly. The book is about life, living and the disappointments that come with it. The novel seems to have a very sad and uneasy tone throughout it. And if you have right version of the novel you will be able to read Charles Dickens original ending for this novel. Its very sad and disappointing to the reader but you cant help saying to yourself that the ending fits."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"O.K. lets face it. im in fourth grAde. this is a very good book,but its hard.im akmost half way tttthrough it. its been a challenge."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After several futile attempts, I was literally forced to read this novel for school. I found that the reason I had such difficulties beginning it, was due to its monotonous and dull beginning. Once past that section, Great Expectations dramatically lifts. I found the whole idea of a women stopping her clocks and living in darkness due to unrequited love a little morbid, yet also slightly romantic, and I found myself disliking the main character with a vengence. Not his best, certainly, but still okay."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A word I hear spoken often today is: boring. I hear that word coming out of the mouth of many teenagers. We live in a society that is so bombarded with continual stimulation, that we expect to be entertained at every turn and get bored too easily if &quot;forced&quot; to read a classic book like Great Expectations. Many high school students would rather be doing something else than reading so it doesn't surprise me when I see all the reviews by teenagers who said they hated the book. I recommend that they read it again in 20 years after seeing the world."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Although Great Expectations is better-written than most contemporary novels (Miss Havisham alone makes the book worth reading and demonstrates Dickens' wonderful skill with characters), I fear that GE is most people's only contact with Dickens because it's short enough to assign for school. (So is A Tale of Two Cities, a great story, but not much like other Dickens works.) If you can stick with them, I recommend even more highly Dickens' Bleak House, Our Mutual Friend, David Copperfield, and Little Dorrit--they're long but they are great, well-written stories with fully developed characters and (sometimes mysteriously long) plot and description that turns out to be crucial (you get a hint of that in GE). Don't give up on Dickens; his works are classics for good reason."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Love it....Love it! I have been trying to find the book, but I guess an electronic copy works better since I will forever own it on my kindle!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Enough has been said about the book itself by others who are far more qualified--I've read it and I like it. I'll speak to the edition itself, because formatting of Kindle books (especially free ones) can be very hit and miss. The illustrated Kindle edition by Top Five Books is easy to navigate, formatted well, free of errors, and contains a variety of illustrations. It is free, and there is nothing about this version that recommends choosing an alternative."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is widely regarded as one of Charles Dickens' finest works and I have to agree; it is one of my favorites, second to A Tale of Two Cities. The story of a young boy's growth to manhood, and his rise to unexpected prosperity and subsequent fall, is strongly written and captivating. Great Expectations captures the attention from the first page and, unlike some of Dickens' other works, it never has a dull moment. Like all of Dickens' works, it is peopled with a large cast of unique and quirky characters whose relationships to each other, as the story unfolds, end up being as intertwined as a plate of spaghetti. Some of the scenes and characters in Great Expectations are downright bizarre; the scenes involving Miss Havisham and the Pocket family felt distinctly Alice in Wonderland-ish in their weirdness.What makes Great Expectations so strong is the main character, Pip. He is that rarity among Dickens' characters, one that has depth and more than one dimension and mood. He tells his own story and, as an adult reflecting back on his own childhood and adolescence, he reveals his own youthful selfishness with a poignancy that surely every listener can connect with. Haven't we all been Pip, selfish and unappreciative of the goodness of others and unworthy of their admiration?I did not listen to this particular audio edition, although I know that Brilliance Audio produces top-notch audio books and Michael Page is an excellent narrator. I highly recommend the edition I listened to, produced by BBC Audio. It is a no-frills production, but the narrator (Martin Jarvis) is outstanding. He truly has a gift for voices (I especially loved his rendition of The Aged), and adds color and personality to the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I enjoyed reading this book in high school and also enjoy watching one of the old B&W; movie versions if it happens to come on TV.

His nagging sister and weakling of a brother-in-law are raising him. He doesn't have much, yet is compelled to help an escaped convict with food and drink. (More out of fear than compassion, mind.) He knows no other way of life, so he doesn't expect anything... until he meets Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham is an old recluse who still mourns after the man who broken her heart on her wedding day. One day, she invites Pip over to \\"play,\\" and that is where he meets young and beautiful Estella. The pretty girl intrigues and irritates him in equal parts. Proud and cruel, she makes him feel like a nobody. And that is how his desires to become a gentleman emerge. So imagine his surprise when a secret benefactor grants his biggest wish, a stranger with \\"Great Expectations.\\" Pip soon moves to London, abandons his old acquaintances for new ones, and reunites with mean girl Estella, now older and more beautiful. Will he be good enough for her now?Great Expectations is my favorite Dickens novel. Granted, I have only read this one and Bleak House (I've also read A Christmas Carol and another novella of his), but it is my favorite one of the two. This novel contains beautiful storytelling, lots of irony and Dickens's signature eccentric characters and hilarious dialogue. This is my second time reading this after over a decade, and I enjoyed it more the second time around. (I enjoyed this as much as the other novel I read at the same time as this one, which, to my surprise, brought up Dickens and Great Expectations.) Pip is a wonderful character. He does, however, get on my nerves when he wants to be around people that to me aren't worth it. Estella is such a snob, a total beyotch, but I can see why Pip would want her to think well of him. One thing I've always found interesting is that Dickens always depicts lawyers as greedy and callous. Bleak House illustrates this even more. Perhaps Dickens disliked lawyers. Could his father's stay at a debtors' prison have to do with this? Well, one thing is clear: Great Expectations is a beautiful novel, one of the best out there, even with its altered ending. I've read both endings and like them both (though I prefer his original ending). Two endings are great because they give you a choice. Anyway, a great summer reread. I have A Tale of Two Cities and look forward to reading it soon."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love listening to audiobooks while I work out and have a special fondness for the classics, so I was very excited by the excellent reviews this audio version received. I had read that each disk contained 90+ brief tracks, which is fine with me as I have never had a problem importing audiobooks into iTunes. Well, there is always a first time. I don't know what iTunes uses to find CD info or track names, but not a single disk came up identified as Great Expectations, nor did the tracks have any type of logical naming system. I had to type in a name for 93-94 tracks on every single disk (eg. disk01track01, etc).The audiobook itself is quite good of course, thankfully. I just need to warn those who plan to import for their iPod that it will not be a simple process. Better have a couple of hours to type. Had I known this would be a problem, I would not have purchased this version."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As usual with Dickens, improbable coincidences abound. They are artfully presented however and Dickens does offer one or two surprises.For one thing, the novel is quite violent. Dickens graphically describes one character dying from burns. He presents a ruffian or two. Even one of the better gentlemen manhandles his maid.Also as usual with Dickens, we find a full cast of memorable well-defined characters. Mr Jaggers, the lawyer to beat all lawyers, and his assistant Mr. Wemmick who never mixes business and home matters, except under exceptional circumstances. We find Miss Havesham a wealthy but bitter spinster left at the altar years before. We meet Joe Gargery, a wise well-meaning blacksmith who lovingly raises Pip, the novel's main character, taking him on as his apprentice. Pip leaves him when fortune mysteriously smiles on him. An unknown benefactor gives our hero a substantial income so that he may fulfill his Great Expectations and become a gentleman of means and of leasure.And there you have Pip in a nutshell: he leaves a loving home, a kind man and a good position to become a man of the world, a man about town, in short a bit of a parasite.But then to become a man of means is for Dickens to have attained heaven on earth and he only lets the truly good enjoy their fortune. Jaggers is rich and cannot be called good, at worst he is amoral, but he is a man of action. On the other hand the thoughtless and ungrateful Pip doesn't deserve heaven. Not just yet.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My only real complain about this bookis that Orlick seems to be an annoying intrusion. Both of the \\"Great Expectations\\" movies I saw deleted the role of Orlick, and I can't say I missed him. Along with \\"Oliver Twist,\\" \\"Great Expectations\\" was one of my father's favorites.Onto the text. Pip (who is still a child and a literary reincarnation of Oliver Twist)) has a frightening experience in a graveyard when the escaped convict Magwitch (kind of a literary reincarnation of Fagin) threatens him and demands a file and some food. When Pip goes to get these things, we meet his sister who is not so nice to him. Though her husband Joe is. (Undoubtedly, this tense marriage reflects Dickens's divorce.) Moving on, Pip delivers the file and food to Magwitch who is of course grateful. sadly, Magwitch is captured, but he remains grateful to Pip.Later, Pip meets the tragic Miss Havisham. Havisham was left at the altar, and she never quite forgave the male sex for this. Interestingly, she has no concept of time. She has friends who visit her on her birthday, they do not mention it. Havisham trains her adopted daughter Estella to hate all men. Pip continues to visit Havisham and Estella for sometime. Soon, some good news comes from lawyer Mr. Jaggers. Pip learns that he is to be trained as a gentleman. Pip knows that Jaggers is Havisham's lawyer, so he assumes this gift is from her. (Why not?)Pip is accompanied by Herbert Pocket who is the son of Miss Havisham's cousin. Herbert tells Pip of Havisham's tragic past. We are permitted some sympathy for her. Pip (who is falling love with Estella) knows that Estella resembles someone, but he can't quite place who.There is a sad, but true to life scene when Joe comes to visit Pip, and because this kind man is not so educated, he turns out to be an embarrassment to Pip. In a scene of self sacrifice, Joe decides to let Pip go his own way.Later there is a disturbing scene between Havisham and Estella. While we may feel sorry for Havisham, she tried to plant her hatred in Estella, and naturally, Estella could only take living for hate so long. The real drama is still to come. Pip finds out that his benefactor was indeed Magwitch. (The man from the graveyard!) While we may share Pip's horror to some extent, we later learn that Magwitch is a sympathetic character. Basically, Compeyson was a kind of Uriah Heep who manipulated Magwitch. To make matters worse, it is punishable by death for Magwitch to be in England.I don't want to give away the ending, but this is easily one of Dickens's greatest books."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After reading a bunch of these reviews, I've come to the conclusion that this book should not be pushed on high school students or younger. It's almost sad to read a review from someone who just read the cliff notes. Come on now, do we really need to hear from you? This is my favorite Dickens novel so far, and though I haven't read them all, I loved everything about it. Though the ending is happy, it is by no means a Hollywood ending. Would recommend to any SERIOUS reader that wants to read authentic period prose and a great story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thing Great Expectation is a great book in many way such as the Themes, the Character and the Writing Themes in this book are very important. They can easily relate to us today. The main point of the book that affection, loyalty and friendship are more important than social class, wealth. The character of Pip made me feel quite sad. He had a very difficult life but he can improve himself and become the gentleman finally. There are many character of this book that also made this book very interesting follow up."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"and I very nearly did.For the first half to three quarters I was utterly and completely amazed. The character of Miss Havisham is genius, and a character like none I have ever met before in literature. The images of her sitting corpse like in her decaying house will stick with me for all time. Everyone should read this book for this fascinating character.While the first part of the book delighted me with wicked satire, and dark humor, the last quarter of the book was too morally right for me. Every character saw the error of his ways, and strove to be a better person, and here the book lost much of the original feel it had going for it. I suppose maybe in Dickens' time, he couldn't get away with a book that did not have a morally uplifting ending.However, I say this is a must-read for the characters of Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella alone. Also the lawyer Jaggers is a great character."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is filled with ambition, greed, cruelty, and love.

However, it still hasa very interesting storyline that is very very detailed :D"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens's later novels, a work of his artistic maturity. The narrative is symbolic rather than realistic. Although, as in most of Dickens and in Victorian literature in general, the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is acceptable here because the events are true to the internal, psychological, logic of the story.Great Expectations tells the story of Pip, a boy who starts as an orphan who moves on to apprenticeship in the business world of nineteenth-century England. Along the way, he falls in love with a girl from a wealthy family, and gains a mysterious patron.The book is heavy on character development and descriptive detail, but relatively light on action and suspense. The orphan Pip, the convict Magwitch, the beautiful Estella and her guardian, the embittered and vengeful Miss Havisham, the master lawyer Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick his secretive assistant - all play their part in this story which is a memoir, a mystery, and a romance.Great Expectations never loses sight of the social mishaps of the time and is often on the teacher's list in literature classics. Most people who read it will like it and will be able to identify with the characters, but impatient readers will drown in the details, extended descriptions and explanations, and deep characterizations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens is to me the most obvious of writers. Most of his novels are to various extents semi autobiographical. Most are populated by people with amusing names who, aside from the main characters, seem to be caricatures more than humans who think and feel with any semblance of subtlety or complexity. Most are deeply concerned with social injustice and class struggle. Most are filled with plot twists, and almost all are very enjoyable reads. Dickens is nothing if not a master storyteller who loves to manipulate the emotions of his reading public. His stories are theatrical more than novelistic. It is no wonder he is the most popular author of the Victorian age, and maybe second only to Shakespeare in the history of English literature.GREAT EXPECTATIONS and DAVID COPPERFIELD are my 2 favorite Dickens novels, probably because they both have more overtly autobiographical elements than his other works. I also love BLEAK HOUSE. GREAT EXPECTATIONS is the story of Pip.. of his rise and fall, and ultimate redemption. This novel gives us a clear window into the heart and mind of Dickens himself. The story itself held my interest from beginning to end, had important themes to explore, and despite it's lack of introspection in examining personality issues, made you care about the main characters. Dickens was one of the great writers but he is not my favorite novelist of that period. I prefer George Eliot's style as a novelist. To me, Dickens power was in connecting emotionally with his audience and it must have been some experience hearing him tell his marvelous tales in person."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is an excellent coming-of-age book with which many people will be able to relate. I will admit, the beginning was rather grueling, but looking back, I am glad I finished the book. Dickens has a fabulous vocabulary and an excellent sense of people. The characters are dynamic and quite various. I would recommend this book to other scholars."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is a masterpiece of fiction. Until you read the book you don't realize just how influential this story is in western literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations didn't meet my expectations. I was a little bored throughout the begining and middle of the story. I think what kept me reading on was the desire to read a \\"classic\\" (I usually read biography or history).I continued reading because I wanted to find out if Magwitch would meet his daughter. In addition, I was interested in Pip's strong desire to be a gentleman. Other than help his friend in business and dawdle about thinking about an emotionally deadweight chic, Pip didn't seem interested in obtaining a job or taking real advantage of his opportunities. I'll give Pip credit for helping his friend attain stature in business, and eventually going on to operate with his friend after losing his unearned wealth. But the lazy part is 19th century gentleman, huh?Maybe Dicken's purpose was to show the benefits of wealth and the slothfullness of one who didn't have to work himself to attain it. Maybe it hit me at the wrong time, as my fiancee just took a hike and left me after I just sold my house (and now have no place to go). Trust you me, I won't be wasting my life away like Ms. Havisham though. I haven't reached gentlemanly status and need to continue working . . . .I've only read Charles Dicken's Nicholas Nickleby and Oliver Twist in addition to \\"Great Expectations\\". Of these, I thoroughly enjoyed Nicholas Nickleby. In the future, I'll look for Kates and Madellines and not Estellas. Great Expectations was a tougher read for me as these characters just simply didn't entice my interest too much. Of course, maybe I needed a brighter read . . ."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this novel for a class. Years later, I picked it up again and reread it. It's excellent. The characters are very interesting. Pip who loves the cold-hearted Estella. It is good to see how their characters interact and how desire is lasting. You got to feel bad for poor Pip. Miss Havisham is the most interesting of all, still in her wedding gown after all these decades. A must read.

At parts of the book it was good but then there were those parts where I didn't like it in all books there are usually those parts. I though it was easy to understand.For the major themes I didn't always understand it all. Some parts I never really caught on to were at the beginning when he was a little kid then he had grown up I never caught on to that right away. But when I finally did it was good and interesting to find out.I do think Charles Dickens did bring the story alive. I think also he should have had so many characters because then it was hard to understand who was who and where did they come from. At some points I wish he would have had explained himself more then what he did. I got mixed up so much with all the characters it was hard to keep track of them because they were in the story and then they were gone then all of a sudden they came back.

Dickens is one of my favorite novelists, and normally I am passionately enthusiastic about his books, but I could only manage to get slightly warmer than lukewarm about this middling novel. Overall, it wasn't bad- it is, in fact, one I wouldn't mind rereading in future. However, I didn't think it was quite as good as many of Dickens' other works. The plot, while not bad or boring, was not as suspenseful and intriguing as that of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, as slowly but enjoyably developing as that of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, or as wonderfully tantalizing and gripping as that of &quot;Bleak House.&quot; The characters, while not hopelessly mediocre or bland, were not nearly as likeable and were much more forgettable than those of other Dickens novels. Although Pip was not a bad protagonist, I did not enjoy or like him as much as I did, say, Oliver Twist or Esther Summerson. Likewise, his character development, while interesting, was not, to my mind, as good or as interesting as that which is undergone by David Copperfield, a hero who I liked better than, and with whom I could sympathize more than with Pip. Estella and Miss Havisham, while interesting, did not add much to the plot, and when it comes to criminals those of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, are, in my opinion, more memorable, and in many ways, more sympathetic than Magwitch. While not a thoroughly forgettable or bad book, I wouldn't reccommend it to first time Dickens readers- it may discourage them from reading more. Wait until you've read one or two of his better novels, such as &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; or &quot;Bleak House.&quot; Then come to this one- only don't come with expectations that are TOO terribly great."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"this book was good and had many irony. its just didn't like it much because was boring for the early part.only the suspence kick up it was really nice to read..but the ending i didn't like cause it left me knowing that estela won't get with pip"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Reading for me is boring, but I was not bored for one second while reading this book. Throughout the whole book Dickens kept my attention and had me wanting more. From the very first page when Pip encounters the convict, I could not put the book down. I had to find out what was going to happen. Also when Pip's sister, Mrs. Joe, was attacked I was guessing to the very end to find out whom it was who attacked her. This is by far one of the best books I have read. All in all, I recommend you read this book. I'm sure that you will enjoy it as much as I have."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel is excellent. Although it starts out slowly, it begins to pick up in the middle.

Seeing Pip grow up, I watched him go through a transformation. Once an unitellegent child, he grew up to be an intelligent young man. The book deals with child abuse, social status, and family and friendships. I saw how a sister took in her little brother to raise him and keep him from dying like the rest of their family. Love is another thing that continually comes up. When he was young, Pip fell in love with Estella and I saw how she tortured and teased him.

I felt bad for Pip because he was living as an orphan with an abusive sister. That must have been very exhausting mentally and physically. I admire Pip because he is very young and the fact that he has to travel,work, and take care of his sick sister, he is a very good rolemodel. I also admire him because if a ex-convict came up to me, I would be so scared that I would run away. The fact that he trusted Magwitch with a lot of things really amazed me. Pip has gone through a lot of things with his family and his own personal life in a considerable amount of time and I admire him for that. Hopefully him and Estella get together because Pip is a very nice guy and I think that they would have a lot of fun together."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"if there is ever a person i feel sorry for: it's Pip. we have all looked up to the pretty girl (or boy) at school, and had that utter pain of knowing that it is impossible. pip is the patron saint of the rejected male.i have two problems with this book: one is the deus ex machina-esqe conclusion in the final 50 pages, where everything falls into place. when i say everything falls into place, i don't mean neatly. the ending is anti-climatic and pensivly moody. but things seem to work out in a weird way that i have some problems withsecondly- the whole plot of the book is one whole huge coincidence.with that said... i didn't mind the two faults whatsoever. there are few books that i have enjoyed so thuroughly as GE.anyone that has read Dickens in the past already knows about his prowess as a writter. and for people who have yet to read him (or highschool students who have just recieved their copy of GE, with a frown) will realize why he has remained contemporary, and still enjoyed.when i was in highschool, and i had to read a tale of two cities... my teacher exhausted the book, going over every minute symbol that was in it... in the end, it bored me. so, with that said, i love two cities regardless cause i read it independantly, and enjoyed it on my own pace. i recomend to all highschool studends to read the book at their own pace and bugger what your teacher tells you (yeah, i'm a good rolemodel). school tends to destroy great works of literature, don't fall into the trap.... whooops i thought this was a book review...great book, beautiful characters, a classic and well worth 5 stars... nuff said(i shed a tear or two at the end)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When his magazine, All the Year Round, began failing due to an unpopular serial, Dickens was forced to begin publishing installments of a story of his own. The resulting work, Great Expectations, was published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861. This was his second semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to happiness. In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years. Indeed he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words. Despite, or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;. When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before being carted back to prison.Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward Estella. Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding gown. Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman. Pip assumes, and Havisham allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will make him worthy of Estella.As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing up. He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber. So he is stunned when he discovers that he is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Now I'll admit that when all is said and done I am a newborn to the world of so called classic literature. So when I was assigned to read Great Expectations for English class, I'll admit to being a little more than skeptical. However once I began to read the novel I discovered something. The novel wasn't that hard to understand. While it did take a while to get fully immersed in the novel, once you were in you really wanted to see the novel to its resolution. The prose was easy to understand, and the plot crossed generations easily. Maybe classics just have a bad reputation with the younger generation, but Great Expectations went a long way to helping to shorten that gap. I think the driving force that leads me to recommend this book is the fact that we all have great expectations of life, and that we all dream of improving our status in the world. People will always share a common bond, and in this novel Dicken's truly shows us that."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is one of my favorite Dickens books, detailing a lifelong love story between Pip and Estella. So sometimes the circumstances aren't realistic - so what? TV shows these days aren't either. Pip is a likeable character, and the various other characters represent real forces in our society. This is a great novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Each time that I read Great Expectations I'm left wondering whether or not Pip would have been happier if he had never been made the gift of \\"great expectations.\\" More importantly, would he have been a better man if he had remained apprenticed to his blacksmith brother-in-law Joe rather than having been sent to London to be trained in the ways of a gentleman?Great Expectations is a Dickens cautionary tale in which the author warns his readers of what can so easily happen to a person when given the opportunity to \\"better himself\\" by leaving his home, family and friends behind for education and fortune-seeking in the big city. As soon as word reached the local townspeople around whom Pip had spent his early years that a fortune was soon to be his, Pip found himself treated with respect and awe by the very people who had had little time for him in the past other than to chastise his behavior and relationship with the sister who was raising him \\"by hand.\\" Their \\"boy\\" became \\"sir\\" overnight it seemed.But sadly, after arriving in London and seeking to impress his new friends and colleagues, Pip decided that those who loved him most were an embarrassment to his future prospects and he only occasionally felt any guilt about his lack of contact with them. It is only when Pip's future prospects shockingly take a turn for the worse that he seeks the comfort of the family that he left behind.Along the way, Dickens fills Great Expectations with some of the most memorable characters in British literature history. There are Miss Havisham, the spinster who never recovered from being jilted at the altar; Joe, the blacksmith and Pip's brother-in-law who never stopped loving Pip as a son no matter how much Pip neglected him over the years; Estella, the beautiful young woman whom Pip has loved since they were small children but who has been raised by Miss Havisham to give her heart to no man; Herbert, Pip's best London friend, a truly good man who both benefits from Pip's help and who eventually offers Pip a new future of his own; and, of course, Magwitch, the colorful escaped criminal whom Pip meets in the first pages of the book.This is one of those books that I read every few years because re-reading it is like visiting an old friend after too long an absence. As the old memories come back, it's like I've never been away."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all (as I like to say!) I'm no smarter than you and I thought this book was great, that said, this book is not THE easiest to read in that it does take a while for things to get really interesting. I rated it 5 stars because it is excellent but you need to have some patience with this book, in the end it is much worth the effort....and keep me updated!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I don't know what you guys are talking about. If you're a serious reader - and I expect you are if you willingly attempt this book - then there shouldn't be a problem getting into it. Dickens is far easier to read then Dostoevsky or Tolstoy or even Hawthorne or James.You have to understand that you can't skim the classics. If you do, then you miss out on subtle prompts and hints. In fact, any good book should have some buried clues, clues that if you don't pick up, the plot will be confusing or pointless. That's what makes these kinds of books great, the challenge and the reward, plus the wonders they do for your vocabulary.If you want books you can skim over before bedtime and still pick up the plot and characters, that's fine, not everyone needs to be a serious reader. However, don't go around bashing great books that you shouldn't be reading, because you might turn off somebody who will really enjoy it.If you have a real problem with the book, mention the plot, or accurately describe why you don't like the writing style."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is truly one of Dickens' best works. It is long but there is so much to offer - rich, memorable characters, universal themes, exciting adventure, unrequited love, murder, mystery, and revenge. The plot touches heavily upon social class distinctions, education, economics and crime and punishment. Issues that still resonate with the modern reader today.Great Expectations, famously, begins in a cemetery where the orphaned Pip is visiting the graves of his parents. There he encounters an escaped convict from a nearby prison ship who is to change his life though Pip will not understand fully how until many years later. As the book continues he meets many surreal characters with perhaps the most memorable being Miss Havisham, the crazed jilted bride, whose manipulations in regard to Pip and her adopted daughter,Estella, break Pip's heart and leave Estella a shallow, empty woman. Another one of Dickens more famous characters appearing in Great Expectations is Pip's guardian, Jaggers, the successful and possibly compulsive obsessive, attorney. Less well known but equally memorable appearances are made by Pip's loyal friend Herbert Pocket whose unusual family provide comic relief and social satire, Pip's brother-in-law the kind but uneducated Joe Gargory, Mrs. Joe, Pip's shrewish sister who is raising Pip \\"by hand\\", Jagger's assistant Wemmick who neatly divides his home life and his work life plus a host of others. Life in 19th century England - both London and it's small towns - are masterfully kept alive by Dickens' sure contemporary descriptions."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My first complete Dickens book was \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\" Since that was an idealistic romance novel, this book rather surprised me with its portrayals of the darker side of human nature. Instead of heart-wrending sacrifices, I found painful ingratitude. Instead of perfect heroines, I found scheming, insensitive women. This book was not anything I expected with regards to characterization and theme. However, I would have to say this book exemplifies human nature much, much better. It was not a very entertaining read at all, but the craftsmanship and word employment simply could not be better. This book may not turn one's daydreams on paper, but it is a solid, landmark work of literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My daughter had to read \\"Great Expectations\\" for 9th grade English,she was short of time and a slow reader. This unabridged version really filled the bill. She could listen while being otherwise engaged or read along with the book. The Actor/reader is the same one who read all of the Harry Potter books. Well read and helped keep her interest."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I wanted to revisit this \\"classic\\", having read it in high school and remembering it fondly. I was not disappointed, for I found the story more applicable to my life now, ten years later, than at the time of my first reading. Back then, it seemed a good yarn - lots of fun characters, intriguing plot twists - a grand adventure. Upon rereading, I was able to absorb the story while thinking about my own \\"coming of age\\", and weigh the morality of Pip's universe. At the same time, my original impressions were not misguided - the moral/societal questions Dickens explores are layered into the fun characters and strong plot development.In addition, there are some interesting \\"reading group\\" questions at the back, as well as some interesting commentary by various authors since the time of the original publication. For that reason, I would recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Above all what I loved about this book was how all the characters came together and were somehow related in some surprising way. The book was very well written. I had to read this book for school and I'm glad that I was forced to or I might never have chosen to read this book. The language was very understandable unlike some other books I've read from that time period. I really recommend it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"One of the great novels in the English language. It would be presumptuous of me to add more.

Fortunately for me, it soon re-kindled my interest (no pun intended), and only got better as it progressed. This was my first foray into Dickens, and if his other works are as entertaining as this one is, I anticipate a world of wonderful reading ahead.

Of all the novels I've ever taught my students these 12 years I've been in Education, this novel, Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens, is by far the best! It is easy to read and understand, and it holds students' attention until the very end. The plot is like a roller coaster and all the characters seem to be connected in some way. The end of each chapter leaves the reader in suspense and anxious to continue reading. Although the setting of the novel takes place in 19th century England, the novel's themes and the characters' experiences seem to relate to all social classes, races, and both genders. Even my students at an inner-city high school in Atlanta rush home to read ahead to find out what will happen to Pip next!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yet another success by Charles Dickens, this book is sure to warm hearts of both children and adults everywhere. This book is another classic, telling the great story of a once simple orphan boy named Pip. I greatly enjoyed this book, with Charles Dickens' enticing use of imagery, it is sure to keep anyone reading. This book could make one cry, and smile. And to me, for it to cause any sort of such emotion, it has to be a truly lovely book to read. If you want a cozy, enticing book to read by the fire on a snow day, go ahead, and read the powerful story: \\"Great Expectations.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickens is a very haunting novel. While the book portrays England as dreary, in a strange way it makes England seem like a nice place to live in. 1800s England as depicted in the novel has a lot of poor people. But the people seem nicer and more innocent minded then people are these days. Even the bad guys in the story seem more innocent minded then people these days.The book begins with a young child called Pip visiting his parents grave only to be stopped by an escaped convict who asks him for food and a file. Pip goes and gets these things secretly to avoid getting in trouble with his sister. Later on the convict is captured and before he is led away, he lies that he stole food from Pip's aunt's cupboard to Pip's uncle Joe and this saves Pip from getting in trouble for taking the food. After that, Pip gets a strange opportunity at a house called Satis House owned by a Miss Havisham. She pays his aunt to have Pip play with a beautiful girl called Estella. Later on, Pip is told by an aquaintance called Mr. Jagger that he has great expectations. He tells him that a secret benefactor has provided for Pip to be educated. Pip, jumps at this opportunity. He goes to live in a rented room and is educated all the time not knowing who is providing him with the sums to be educated. He continues to think about the beautiful girl Estella who shuns his advances.\\"Great Expectations is a very haunting novel. With the book, I got a full view of what life was like in England in the 1800s. The character Miss Havisham is really scary. Her house with its room where there is a decaying wedding cake is almost like a haunted house. The book contains no supernatural elements though and that's what is so amazing, that Charles Dickens manages to make it scary without putting ghosts or monsters in it. Miss Havisham was clearly a woman with a lot of potential who ruined her life because she couldn't get over a romance that went sour. I felt bad for her and hope people learn from her example.The character that really caught my attention was Estella. I have had experiences in my own life where I had a crush on a girl who didn't have a crush on me and so I knew what Pip was going through and related to his character in this respect. Its when they're young that men are haunted most by those feelings for a girl or a woman, it is clear though that Pip needs to move on and find another girl to get in a relationship with.All in all, Great Expectations is a good fast read even though it is not an adventure novel, which makes the novel even more amazing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Just a wonderful enthralling read! I enjoyed this so much! I read this in high school but decided to read it again. I just did not appreciate the story line or the characters back as a teenager. I am so glad I decided to re-read this again! I am now going to work my way through more of Dickens novels. His character development is wonderful!

They touch you and remain with you - even becoming icons. This is true in all Dickens novels, and it is no less true in this work.

Who else could come up with such a marvelous character?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm not going to say much about the story, because you probably already know it. I first discovered the book over 40 years ago in high school.But I really appreciated this edition. As a forward, there is an overview of the book, pointing out things to help you understand them when you read them. It also clarifies some of the points made. It doesn't say anything about Pip suffering from depression, but I think he does, which contributes to his low self-esteem.Then at the back of the book, there is a section of notes, including the original ending. There are also notes on some of the words used or articles mentioned in the book.All in all, this was a wonderful read and look forward to reading it again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is hailed as a one of the great masterpieces in literature and for good reason. However, it does drag in the beginning and current audiences may not be able to fight through to reap the rewards this book gives out. Also, the language used in the book is not used currently in use and may throw off some readers. Midway threw the book I was enjoying Great Expectations, but disappointed in the pace and flow and ready for it to quicken. But it did and I was enthralled with the final 200 pages."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Hi, Great Expectations is probably (besides David Copperfield) my favorite Dickens novel. I read it when I was a child, and having been re reading it ever since. It is told through Pip, the narrator. His voice is clear and realistic.The reader feels for him as if he were a real person. Miss Havishman is a sad character and her disappointment in love is very understandable. Mr. Jaggers the lawyer is sharp as most lawyers ought to be and are. I felt for Magwitch, Pip's benefactor. And I understood Pip's feelings towards him when they meet again after many years, Estella is not my favorite character, but she learns to be a better person. Charles Dickens is, needless to say, a timeless writer, one of the very best. Eugenia RenskoffDifferent Flags"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens, Great ExpectationsDickens tells an intriguing yarn, creates suspense and amuses us with a range of eccentrics, friendly such as Wemmick or Herbert Pocket, or macabre as with Pumblechook or Jaggers. As in David Copperfield, he gives us strong and often threatening women, like Betsy Trotwood, and here Mrs Joe. Both of these semi-autobiographical novels begin with a shock to a child that reverberates through the rest of the action. Both are seen from the dual child-adult perspective; both belong to the Bildungsroman genre. Both have been repeatedly adapted for stage, screen and radio drama, and yet both have their weaknesses of characterisation and narrative tedium.Several decades ago it was not unusual to find a Dickens novel as a set text for public examinations. Today this would be unheard of: \`Too long, Sir!' \`Boring, Sir!' I recall attempting to \`teach' Nicholas Nickleby to secondary modern school pupils in the Sixties. Then that outmoded method of \`reading around the class' was still in vogue. The lads enjoyed that and were doubled up laughing as Nickle Arse and Queers went about their business. Those who say they still love Dickens today, are probably thinking of one or more of the excellent BBC adaptations rather than the text of the book itself. Reading a Dickens novel today, except as a Simplified Classics text, is no mean feat.It has taken me several weeks to get through Great Expectations, reading it in bite-sized pieces, often as a Book at Bedtime treat. That is probably the best and most appropriate method, since like most Victorian novels it was designed for serialisation, which also of course accounts for the repetitiveness and the prolonging of tension by ending each Part on a cliff-hanger. It is not easy for the modern reader to read with the eagerness and innocence of his Victorian counterpart. The sheer thickness of the books and the at times plodding nature of the narrative demand a time and patience that for most of us today is in short supply.Nevertheless, I am pleased to have made the effort, and was for the most part captivated by the narrative and relished the sheer exuberance of the language, as when Dickens allows Pumblechook or Joe Gargery to indulge in their respective bumbling monologues. True, I got tired of Pip's continual self-analysis as he expounds on his guilt in rejecting the advances of good friends like Joe, Biddy and, later, the convict Magwitch aka Provis. I cringed, too, at the moral miracles of a converted Miss Havisham, kneeling before Pip. And the fire was an unconvincing contrivance. As for the cooked-up non-serial happy ending, the less said the better."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book when I was in high school.

The rationale for reviewing in this manner is to provide a foundational point of reference for those new to Dickens' work.In the last two years I have read, in this order, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations, and David Copperfield. All three of these books were exceptional reads, and if you are thinking about dipping your toes in the waters of Charles Dickens you can't go wrong with any of them. However, notwithstanding the fact that these three books are all in the upper echelon of world literature, I have no difficulty in distinguishing between them and coming to the conclusion that they are properly ordered, from \\"most best\\" to \\"least best\\": David Copperfield, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations.It seems generally to be the case that, for those who have read just one of Dickens' books, Great Expectations is the book most people have been exposed to. And most people who read Great Expectations love it. The genre is probably best described as romance meshed with individual tragedy among numerous characters. However, perhaps the strongest part of the book is the manner in which the secondary characters present a contrast to the primary story. I liked the book very much, but I think it suffers from two flaws not present in the other works reviewed here. First, the characters are not as believable as in the other two works. Second, the plot follows an unlikely path, especially in the end. Concerning this second point, it should be noted that Dickens struggled with the ending of this work, and I think it shows.Tale of Two Cities ranks second in this group in my mind. This book is a combination of political intrigue, romance, and personal triumph. I rank this book above Great Expectations for the sole reason that the characters in this book are so strongly developed. I don't think I have been exposed to more memorable characters in any book I've ever read. The story is interesting, too, because it takes place against the backdrop of a historical event, the French Revolution. I think Dickens had an easier time writing a convincing plot in this story than in Great Expectations because he had the aid of a real historical event.Great Expectations and Tale of Two Cities are both excellent books, but David Copperfield is simply the best piece of literature I've ever read. To be sure, I'm only 24 and have only read 10 pieces of classic literature since my high school years. However, David Copperfield so outdid anything I've read that I feel more than comfortable in recommending it as certainly one of the best books of all time. Dickens did a remarkable job of capturing a wide variety of human emotions and mindsets. He was aided in this by two things. First, the length of the book gave him space to fully develop his sentiments. Second, the book is written in a first-person autobiographical voice, which I think made capturing sentiments much easier than in attempting to narrate them in the third-person. Further, because the book chronicles David's life from childhood through middle-age the reader is exposed to a wide variety of human thoughts. The characters, for the most part, are more believable and the plot is generally good; I took offense to only one chapter in the whole book.Now, if you haven't read any of Dickens' books, I don't recommend starting with David Copperfield. I would start with Great Expectations and work through a couple others before David Copperfield. In terms of the plots, David Copperfield is much more similar to Great Expectations than Tale of Two Cities. So if you loved Great Expectations I think you will be well satisfied with David Copperfield. The plot from Tale of Two Cities is the odd-ball of this trio. In any case, all three of these books are great pieces of literature... enjoy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Many people scoffed this book back in my freshman English class, because it was Dickens, and Dickens meant \\"boring\\" to them. However, shrug off the normal tendencies to stereotype an old-time classic to be a bore, one can find a true delight in this beautiful story of a young man struggling with an impossible love, the pressures of money and society, and, of course, himself. It is an excellent, absolutely enriching read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is certainly one of my favorite books. It's about a boy named Pip who struggles to find his own identity. While struck with unfortunate circumstances, Pip remains resilient and continues his struggle in becoming a \\"gentleman.\\" Truly a Brittish classic, it has been called the unofficial autobiography of Dickens and it can be easily called one of his best works. The novel is filled with symbolism and characters that come to life as you read the pages. This book still graces my shelves and I look forward to reading it again. I recommend you pick it up and rea it too."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Perhaps the greates novel I have ever read. Not only enjoyable but contained relevan lessons for my life - you can't escape who you or where you come from by changing your circumstance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Like several of the people on this review page, I had to read this book for a 9th grade English assignment. Unlike most of the people in my class, I read the whole book and liked it. The book is about a young English boy named Phillip \\"Pip\\" Pirrip living in 1800s England. He is the son of a blacksmith and then is invited to play at an old woman's house. The impression Pip gets from the old woman and her daughter is that Pip isn't good enough. From then on, he grows up and tries to get better for his life after getting a fortune, but things go downhill from that as he gets deep in debt and becomes ill. This book is by no means perfect and has plenty of flaws. The book is way too wordy and could probably be half as long as it is and still get a good point across. I also felt that the ending of the book was a little strange, but overall it was an okay book and I was not bored with it at any point."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"...the defect of almost all the movies (except, perhaps, the 1989 version with Jean Simmons as Miss Havisham (!)) is that the movies emphasize Pip's pursuit of Estella to the exclusion of almost all else. In truth, the core of the story is Pip's class strivings and his inability to distinguish the valuable from the shiny and superficial. Read the book and you will appreciate the character Biddy who is the polar opposite of Estella in every way, and the way, to paraphrase Othello, Pip \\"threw a pearl away richer than all he yearned for.\\"Some of Dickens' characters and coincidences are a little stretched, but they nevertheless are woven together very nicely in the fashion of a good suspense novel. Great Expectations is divided into three volumes, each representing a phase of Pip's Expectations. The structure is strangely like \\"The Monkey's Paw\\": The first expectation (wish) is for riches; the second expectation finds the granted wish not exactly what the protagonist thought it would be; and the third and final expectation leaves the protagonist trying to pick up the pieces.As another reviewer commented, do get an edition that includes the original ending. It is only a few paragraphs but it wraps up this morality tale in a way that is appropriate to the entire theme of the story. If you wonder where the \\"new, happier\\" ending was substituted, just look for the place in the very last chapter where Pip suddenly changes direction and makes a lie of what he has just told his family.If you feel that you cannot sit through the novel, then at least get the 1989 film version (though it is out of print--you will have to pay a little more than you might like) and watch it for probably the accurate representations of the various characters, if not some of the stellar performances of the most acclaimed 1946 version. If nothing else, you will see something very rare for any actor or actress--the opportunity to define two characters in the same classic. In 1946, Jean Simmons' Young Estella defined \\"beautiful but cruel\\" for a generation, and in 1989 the same Ms. Simmons revealed the pain but even greater cruelty of Miss Havisham."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is another book which is forced upon unsuspecting high school students. With many younger reviewers giving this classic 1 and 2 stars shows that this novel will not be appreciated by most studetns. If you hated this book in high school I recommend picking it up again after college.This novel follows the protagonist Pip, from inncocent boy, to dreaming adolecent, to proud gentelman, and comes full circle to the disullusioned adult. Tha characters he meets along the way are some of the most memorable in english literature, especially Miss Havishham, Estella, and Magwitch. Dickens also treats us, about half-way through, to perhaps the best twist of any novel I've ever read.The only thing I at first disliked about this novel were the bizarre coincidinces which caused seemingly unrelated characters to actually have close histories with each other. But I reconciled this for myself in the following way: A major theme of this novel are the machinations of characters to control other characters. Well we must not forget that there are meta-machiantions above this by Dickens himself, and for that all readers can be thankful."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens' Great Expectations portrays the life of the protagonist, Pip, and how he begins as a mistreated orphan and transforms into a gentleman with a mysterious benefactor. Set in the mid 19th century, Great Expectations is a novel with a surprising plot that keeps its readers guessing. Its' intriguing story line and interesting characters keep the story light-hearted and humerous, but Dickens' dreary descriptions and gloomy details bring also a sense of sadness and compassion to the novel. Aside from the novel being time consuming, indepth, and in great detail, Great Expectations is a classic novel that all should read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Though someone stated you have to be over 21 to appreciate this book (and I am 21 now) I first read this story when I was 14 years old, in 8th grade, and understood (and loved) it right away. Why? As an adolescent struggling with popularity (the modern, teenage equivalent of the English class system) and unrequited love, I immediately identified with Pip. Furthermore, the romantic atmosphere was completely intoxicating, from the vast marshes to the city of London; though the narrator describes it as disappointingly crowded and dirty my sense of the city from this book was much more elevated. I also admit I was helped by the updated Classics Illustrated comic book version of the book, which I peeked at now and then while I was reading Great Expectations--despite my aversion to revealing the ending before I reached it in the text (eventually, I succumbed to my temptations). If you can find this (probably) out-of-print illustrated version of the story--not sure what the status of Classic Illustrated is these days--make sure to buy it. But to return from my digression, the novel is where it's at. Dickens' impeccable imagination creates an vivid sense of place, an unforgettable cast of characters (including the ultimate romantic ideal: Estella), a rich and textured story, and an immortal message of aspiration, disappointment, and dreams. This story really fired my imagination as a teenager, so I encourage those youngsters who may be dissuaded from reading it to pick it up--I'm not guaranteeing you'll like it but if you read it before you're forced to you just may find something valuable in it. As for the rest of you \\"grown-ups\\" if you haven't read this masterpiece yet, get off yer asses and take a trip to the local library. It'll make your day."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've read many, many books throughout the years, in a wide variety of genres. Periodically, I try to stretch myself by taking on works that I might not otherwise gravitate toward. Sometimes I am rewarded; that is how I discovered Hemingway and Vasily Grossman (much to my delight). However, I generally read for pleasure and will never be considered an erudite literary critic; in other words, you won't find me reading Shakespeare.I recall reading A Tale of Two Cities in high school and to my recollection, enjoying it. With that in mind, I was determined to give Charles Dickens another shot, with the knowledge that if it were to my liking, there would be a wealth of material at my disposal. That is how I came to read Great Expectations.The novel centers on young Pip, an orphan taken in by his domineering older sister and kind, blacksmith husband. Pip is destined for a life as an apprentice blacksmith, a member of the English lower class, until an encounter with an escaped convict radically changes the course of his life. For you see, young Pip harbors \\"great expectations\\" and a life far beyond that set before him. With the help of an anonymous \\"sponsor\\", Pip begins his journey toward life as a gentleman.When reading Dickens, Tolstoy, and even more so Shakespeare, the first hurdle is becoming familiar with the language, the style of writing and the idioms and terms used by writers of the era; even more so with Dickens, where he routinely spells words phonetically when spoken by Cockney British commoners. Somewhat offputting at first, the reader soon becomes comfortable with the style and is amply rewarded and entertained.Having read numerous novels from the period, I was well familiar with the British class system on the mid-19th century, but nowhere is its rigidity more apparent than in this work. Within days of attaining a sponsor, young Pip completely removes himself from his former friends and relatives (both geographically and socially), even expressing embarrassment for having been associated with them. There are several story threads that work themselves together nicely near the end of the novel.Having become reacquainted with Dickens, I fully expect to sample more of his work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all (as I like to say!) I'm no smarter than you and I thought this book was great, that said, this book is not THE easiest to read in that it does take a while for things to get really interesting.

To me, it is not dissimilar to David Copperfield in its themes; however, David Copperfield moves me to tears every time I read it.I came across an original review of Great Expectations at The Atlantic Monthly's website. The reviewer wrote of Dickens and this work &quot;The very title of this book indicates the confidence of conscious genius. In a new aspirant for public favor, such a title might have been a good device to attract attention; but the most famous novelist of the day, watched by jealous rivals and critics, could hardly have selected it, had he not inwardly felt the capacity to meet all the expectations he raised.&quot; T.A.M. then went on to state that they felt the book did in fact live up to its title.Unfortunately I am not permitted to type in the whole web address so that you could more easily find this review, but if you are interested, go to The Atlantic Monthly's website and under the section entitled &quot;Books and Critics&quot; type in &quot;greatexp.htm&quot; at the search engine.

Hating &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is kind of like hating Beethoven, Shakespeare, or Monet: O.K., it's not your taste, but it's really a waste of time to say &quot;IT SUCKED.&quot;Dickens's novel is one of the all-time champs. Unforgettable characters, beautiful writing, and a depth of understanding of human nature rarely equaled in English or American fiction. As they say in theory class, it works on many different levels. If you hated &quot;G.E.,&quot; well, then, you probably wandered into the Literature aisle by mistake. You probably also don't like &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; or anything by Hardy or Austen, if you've bothered.Otherwise, if you love literature and haven't read &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; consider your education incomplete."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This has to be my favourite Dickens novel. In fact, I would go so far as to place it alongside Flaubert's &quot;Sentimental Education&quot; and Dostoevsky's &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot; as one of the great novels of the 19th century. I am astonished by the number of one and two star reviews even though they do appear to come mainly from high school students being &quot;forced&quot; to read the novel for English class. Judging by the spelling mistakes and grammatical errors which proliferate these submissions, Dickens is not the only thing that they've had trouble staying awake for. In addition, it is ridiculous to suggest that Dickens's novels were so lengthy because he was &quot;being paid by the word.&quot; His books initially appeared in serial form as books were very expensive in the Victorian era and he understandably wished to avoid precluding large sections of his target readership from being able to sample them. The fact that some current &quot;readers&quot; find this novel &quot;too long and boring&quot; is, I believe, a sad reflection on our media saturated society where a two-second attention span is rapidly becoming the norm."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Why, in God's name, do high school teachers insist on stuffing this complex novel down the throats of their teen-aged students? Because the initial chapters are narrated by, Pip, a little boy we watch become a young man? Because there are pirates and bad guys in it? Because there's a sort of love story? I'm sure some high schoolers understand GREAT EXPECTATIONS but the majority of them... I don't think so.GREAT EXPECTATIONS contains many complicated, adult themes and issues that adults will surely appreciate. A virtual encyclopedia of human emotions--fear, child abuse, anticipation, disappointment, love, jealousy, manipulation--this greatest of all of Dickens' novels has everything. And all these ingredients are woven into an incredibly entangled plot, full of twists and turns. On top of all that, the novel is also a virtual encyclopedia of the layout and attitudes of Victorian London.Holding it all together is Pip's incredible perceptions into his world and his emotions. Never before had there been a character so aware of his feelings and, still, because he is human, he allows these emotions to sometimes compel him to do the opposite of what is right and best. Pip does sometimes behave like the child and young adult he is, but that doesn't mean this novel is suitable for anyone of that age.Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectations is an extremely wonderful book!this book starts talking about a boy named Pip.he is trying to live up to everybod's expectations of him while trying to live his own life.Pip was born an orphan.his older sister adopts himand thats how his sister is admired for bringing him home and raising him. she was married to joe her husband. this story really starts off when Pip meets the convict on the old church graveyard on the hill of the marshes.The convict told Pip to bring a metal file,pork pie and a meat bone. The convict was very thankful. from that day on Pipd id not tell anybody about that day. His sister later on dies and he meets a girl named estella. estella was adopted by miss Havisham. Pip loved her but miss Havisham taught her to hate all men.This book is a wonderfully good book. I would recommend this book for children ages 13-21. It is an arduous book for some readers but it is aninteresting book to read. I love books that Charles Dickens writes. He is an awesome writer. If you like to read about romance, deception, horror and drama then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I must admit that beyond my initial attraction to the novel's title I made several attempts over a period of years to settle into the story but could not get past the first several pages. There are many things to throw off potential readers to aged classics like this one, not the least of which is Dickens' choice of character names such as Pumblechook, Wopsle and Magwitch, which I at first found absurd and annoying. However on a recent attempt I made it as far as chapter 10 (of 59 total) when it dawned on me suddenly and unexpectedly that I was hooked and that there was no turning back.The unabridged version is not something one can breeze through in an afternoon, especially considering that it requires the development of a certain skill to absorb Dickens' narrative style, much as it is with the often difficult prose of Henry James. Some parts read very fast while others are tortuously overwritten creating a virtual standstill as the eyes glaze over and one starts to look for good reasons not to throw the book against the wall and pull out tufts of hair from one's head in frustration - a good editor would do this book no injustice but I am not going to recommend the abridged version because most parts are not to be played with. But as is the case in life, our accomplishments must be earned, and so I will make this promise to those contemplating reading this work: make the effort, put forth the time to read this novel, which is not a short one, and before long it will grow on you and you will come to treasure your time spent with it, and even savour its pages as the story unfolds and comes to an end.It would be so much easier for the many students who are assigned this book to take the low road and read only a study guide and then rent one of the movies of it and then definitely not ace the class, but the intelligent ones could pull off a pass; but they would be cheating themselves of something that one cannot put a price on- a well told story with vibrant characters who share in our capacities to be hurt, to feel joy, to be knocked down and to live life, for what are stories if they are not reflections of ourselves, our desires, our fears, our untold secrets, our ability to connect to other souls and grow or be cut off and wither.Let me tell it to you straight. Dickens is a master storyteller. He has created a legacy that has been surpassed by only a few and is a standalone in terms of sheer narrative prowess. Modern writers, especially screenwriters (like myself, eventually) would do themselves no harm if they took Dickens' work to heart and used it as a model for their own for here there are no pyrotechnics, no stretching of rehashed plot ideas into the thinness of an overblown balloon, no exaggerated or contrived formulae, granted there is no small measure of coincidence in his stories, but here there are real characters with beating hearts and flesh, fully capable of a misstep and fall, part of a story that is relevant and timeless and enriching, even necessary to the human spirit if we are to grow and thrive and not kill one another with the evil and savagery that we are all capable of.As Nicole Kidman said during her Oscar acceptance a few years back: \\"art is important,\\" and for Dickens' contribution I am grateful and would be doing a disservice if I did not write this ditty for those that may listen. To Kidman's remark I would like to add that without art, life would no longer be tolerable and not worth living. It even convinces one to stick around for a little while longer. Those who do not feast on classics like \\"Great Expectations\\" are paying a very heavy price, one that not even Mr. Gates can well afford."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I spent a whole term going over this book in freshmen English class. It is an overall good book, full of interpritations. There are many symbolisms and allusions. However, it is important to remember that this book was originally a serialization, as it came out every week in the paper. There are some parts when Dickens drawls on with his plans, events, ect. However, there are scenes that are very fast paced and action filled. The overall plot is a young, naive boy of about ten lives with his sister and her simple husband named Joe. However, Pip is given a secret benefactor and is thrust in the life of nobility. Pip is tangled in his probelems of leaving Joe behind and his encouters with the shallow (and I mean SHALLOW) Estella and the wicked Miss Havisham. Dickens is a master with characters and the languege, but he doesn't describe any everyday events. For example, Pip goes to study law, but thats all we know. In my opinion, it gives the characters this higher than life importance, and less real. But, if you take this book slowely, maybe a chapter a night (instead of the five I had to do), you will definately enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; seems to be a term used to describe a young man with expectations of becoming a Gentleman. This is the story about a young boy named Pip who though considered poor, was raised as an apprentice in a respectable trade. When his parents died when he was very young he was brought up by his older sister and her husband Joe Gargery the blacksmith. Joe although a little slow, acts in many ways as a loving father and friend to the boy, and is more noble than any of the other characters in the whole book. His older sister however isn't as nice, and in the modern day world probably would have been brought up on charges of child abuse. (If this book was ever remade into a modern day movie I couldn't think of anyone else I'd rather see playing Pip's older sister than Kathy Bates. I pictured her every time the character is mentioned.)Pip then comes into some money by a mysterious benefactor, and becomes an ungrateful little boy who looks down upon those he used to associate with and puts on airs. At this point, in my opinion Pip becomes a very unlikable character for most of the remainder of the book. He believes Miss Havisham who is a mysterious mean old wealthy lady is his benefactor and falls in love with her adopted daughter Estella. I believe this makes Pip look very shallow, since the only redeeming quality she seems to possess is her looks.Pip moves to London and is entrusted to a lawyer named Jenkins and his assistant Wemmick to teach him how to become a gentleman. The lawyer Jenkins, while unloving, is likeable, and in his own way noble. Wemmick who leads a double life is one of the best characters in the book. (I believe there are many people who would like to keep their work life separate from the home life, and can relate to this character.)Jenkins hires a tutor for Pip to teach him how to act like a gentleman. It seems that all the gentleman in this story do however is spend money. Pip and the tutor's son Herbert who becomes Pip's best friend then proceed to work themselves into debt.A pirate which Pip met in his childhood comes back into this life, and brings many changes. (The pirate Pip meets reminded me of the sea captain from &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, or the main character in the &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.)In the end Pip tries to redeem himself, and in some ways does.There are some plot twists and mysteries to solve. Some work out well and are pleasant surprises, others just seem unnecessary to the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"GE is one of the better books that I read in my illustrious high school education. The book threw me a little because of all the words Dickens used to describe every character right down to the tiniest little thing. Pip and Joe is a good pair of characters to have in this book, because they are so different and so alike at the same time. They both like to work with metals and Joe is a blacksmith and pip is his apprentice. They are different in the way that they act. Joe takes the brutal ness of pips sister, and pip does not. When pip starts to work for Ms. Havisham it shows his torture that he has to take from Ms. Havisham in the way of verbal bashings. Thought Ms. Havisham does not beat him unlike his sister does, she is a very cruel and malignant women. Then one-day pip meets Estella, she seems like a nice girl but in fact she is a very cruel women just like her grandma. This is the beginning of pips crush and then turns into a passion. Dickens then goes into the part of the story where pip finds out why she wants Estella to hate men. He finds out that she was left at the alter by her ex. This set a fire in her and that is why she hates men. Then pip returns home one day from work at Ms. Havisham's house and he finds a lawyer there with Joe and some one gave him enough money to get a good education and a home. So he takes the money and pip goes to school in England and the story pretty much lost its importance after that, but pip does find out that the person who gave him the money was from the Escaped convict, he owned his own farm in Australia and he was rich from that. These are just some of things that happened in the book, to find out some of the finer details I urge to you read the book for yourself.

He ends up being sent away to England to become a young gentleman, and strays away from the love of his life. A great deal of scandal goes on, and if I tell you anymore than you'll know what happens, but I will tell you this.

For any one who has read everything by Dickens, I'd suggest &quot;Titus Groan&quot; and its follow up &quot;Gormenghast&quot; by Mervyn Peake. They are fantasy novels but are extremely Dickinsian (though original enough to keep from being derisive) and in my opinion equal to any thing Dickins wrote and in better prose."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Sorry for the nasty mean review.

But anyway, if thats the way they feel then I guess thats just the way they feel and nobody should write such nasty reviews or get mad for such a petty, stupid reason anyway. So, anyway, this is one of Dickens best, as I've said before."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of all English writers,Charles Dickens is the champion of the genre of \\"Bildungsroman\\",a department of fiction writing pertaining to growth and development of the protagonist. Dickens's writings are darkly underlined by an all-dimensionsal illustration of aperson's character and by an uncanny portrayal of childhood. \\"Nicholas Nickleby\\",\\"David Copperfield\\" and \\"Great Expectations\\" have gone into the literary folklore as novels containing some of the finest amd most vivid passages ever composed on children's psyche and indignified lives. Perhaps the author's this ability to paint children's woe stems froms his own abusive and disruptive boyhood and perhaps in several of his fancy's infants,Dickens was actually trying to reflect his very own horrible childhood. \\"David Copperfield\\" is undoubtably his most personal and in certain fractions autobiographical novel but in \\"Great Expectations\\",employing a compatible first person narrative method,Charles Dickens conjures up a very much real life character who,like David Copperfield,narrates the story of his life as he progresses through his childhood,errors of judgements and unseeming expectations to a tragi-joyous adulthood;as he stives on in life with a plethora of illusions;as he realises the moments of truth one by one.\\"Great Expectations\\" is young Pip's story,a trajectory of his yearning to excel and drift away from the \\"oncommon\\",a desire to be loved and respected in society, a not-so-uncommon craving to grow up and establish himself. For an orphan living in the country marshes in England and brought up \\"by hand\\" by his sister Mrs. Joe Gargery,Pip's on;y genuine friend in his early boyhood was Jor Gargery,the blacksmith---also supposed by the central character to have been made to \\"marry her by hand\\". But a sudden and apparently misfortunate meeting with a fugitive from the nearby Hulks---and the consequent burden of guilt his troubled conscience has to bear---a visit to the queer Miss Havisham's and an unexpected deliverance of all his miseries all consire to Pip's rise in life. The mysterious London lawyer and master defender of criminals Mr. Jaggers arrives one day to inform Pip that if he would,then he is entitled to excercise a proposition of going to London and studying and doing all he can to rise up in life and be an established gentleman with no cost from his side---a mere boyish fancy of Pip till that moment. so marches on our gentle little gentry class boy to the city on te back of the notion that it was Miss Havisham who was actually his benefactoress and who had destined him and her adopted daughter,the cruel,unforgiving and heartless Estella,to be together. And thus begin young and inexperienced Pip's trysts with harsh realities of life.In a novel that essentially figures around human expectations and failures through the tame medium of words,Pip's story is massively apt for the enlightenment of this theme. Pip is found to be a real-life character leafed out of life's own text book and not an imaginary effigy of fairy-tale gratifications,which David in \\"David Copperfield\\" in some stretch is. He's an ordinary person with extraordinary aspirations but as he moves on in life,he learns about himself and this personal growth is exquisitely and relistically portrayed by Charles Dickens. Indeed it's in a great city like London where truth dawns upon Pip,truth that demolishes all ethereals about life,about riches,about Miss Havisham and EStella,and most important truth of them all,the truth about himself. Pip runs into debt,makes several mistakes,is broken down and broken apart by an illusory love and endures fits of remorse,which punctuate his entire existence arising out of a marked ingratitude towards Joe and Biddy,his friend from his old school. His only means of moral salvation from this quicksand of sin is te hearty relationship with Herbert Pockets,his best friend and companion in all his catastrophes. Actually in Herbert and his father,also the tutor of Pip,Charles Dickens creates two characters dissolved in innocence and ignorance with no big aims for money. When all of Miss Havisham's near and distant relatives are coaxing her to milk her fortune,the Pockets are the sole remaining figures to brush aside such ideas. This is one of Dickens's numerous tricks as a writer to subtlely show that goodness can still be glimpsed in an otherwise sadly denudating world.Charles Dickens is believed to have gone through his work \\"David Copperfield\\" thoroughly before writing \\"Great Expectations\\" but even so on certain occasions,the reader does decipher resemblance between these two high acclaimed novels. The shape of Pip's path i life doesn't bear that great degree of difference with these two popular fictional characters are often found to merge. Miss Havisham is reminiscent of Betsy Trotwood's resentment towards the male society,only more elongated and elaborate;in Pip's detest of Drummle and his love for Estella,the reader catches a fair glimpse od David's own contempt towards Uriah heep's lust for Agnes;Mr.Pockets and his family's fiascos and innocence bear a certain kinship with those of Mr. Micawber's;and Pip's deep friendship with Herbert reminds the reader of David's relationship with Traddles. These similarities could blot Dickens's claim to unprecedented imagination power or may strangely prove that life of one is often intertwined with aanother's. The first person narrative technique used to describe Pip's story in this book too isn't without some strong criticisms. The opinions and witty contemplations formed by Pip of people both is his marsh country as well as in London from an early stage in his life render the reader musing as to how his innocent and delicately humorous conjectures could suddenly be transformed into something satirical and concrete. Are his views constructed on the spur of the moment or are they being built now as Pip stares down the years and pens down his history? If the latter be more inclined towards the truth,then it definitely distorts Pip's authenticity as a writer and his memoir is left somewhat ineffective with misleading overlapping of the past and te present.Certain detractions are not so difficult to eke out from \\"Great Expectations\\" really but flaws are a regular parameter of any work of literature. The genius of Charles Dickens is never in doubt in this book as the reader discerns the author's accustomed mingling of humour and dark pictures in a book that promises life as it is. Dickens's obsession with wit and humour is revealed in the features of Mr. Pumblechook and Mr. Wopsle and in incidents such as the latter playing Hamlet on the stage. That when perceived from te swift flow of narration perfectly complimented by the dialogues and conversations and punctuated by moods of reflections makes the book instantly appealing. The caricature of the marsh country is another point of revelation of the author's informed and classy state. The world of Dickens is one of individual identities and aspirations,where all characters find their own proper places. And this world isn't a big one but a narrowed and trimmed realm of compulsive non-overlapping characters all fuctioning significantly in the due course of Pip's realisation of the world and its intricacies.The most beguiling factor in providing Pip's tale a touch of realism and in turn making the novel more touching and endearing is the evident defects in his character. He feels remorseful at his ingratitude towards his poor and \\"common\\" family;he is exasperated at the return of his \\"old convict\\" years later and in his refusal to address him not as Magwitch,his real name,but as Provis,his assumed name,he subconsciously admits denial of his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own present either,and time and again has to rush to Herbert and wemmick,Mr. Jaggers's assistant,for solace and help. As illusions fade one by one and emotions of al sorts jumble up together in Pip's life,he's found to portray at least fractions of our own lives. \\"Great Expectations\\" is vastly a cofession of a dilapidated soul whose expectations in life are not without unforseen twists and turns. This is an immensely moving tale of a young man's ineptitude and discontentment told in restrained sentimentality,empathic ruminations and glittering descriptions. This classic is a gem for any literature lover,where Charles Dickens;s authority as a writer is amazingly deft."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dudes. You gotta read this book. It's totally awesome.Charles described the people and places so well, it's like its real and your there with everybody.Pip and Estella's love story might be the greatest love story in history. Greater than Rhett and Scarlet. Greater than Romeo and Juliet. Greater than Spiderman and Mary Jane. Yes, it's that good.Sure, there are plenty of movies, but none do it justice. Its like the Scarlet Letter. You've gotta read it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's not worth it, even with the low price of 1.99. You're better off getting the free version. The only thing you're going to get is a couple of illustrations and there is no link for a free audio book like it says there is."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There are two main sorts of novel - those that end quite happily and satisfactorily, with everything essentially \\"working out\\" for the better and most great problems resolved. The second kind is quite the opposite, an about-face, and of course \\"Great Expectations\\" would fall into the latter category. It's only main tender-bellied spot for me to prod with critique would be the fairly obvious plot unfolding, even to someone unfamiliar with the story as I was.As so often happens with \\"classics\\", in the end the main characters end up being one another's long lost aunts or cousins, fathers, daughters, stepmothers, caretakers, lovers, or perhaps the cause of misery to one or many, of course all unbeknownst and hidden until you happen to stumble in on their story. That's not really giving anything away, for those that are worried. And it is not to say that Dickens was unoriginal with this one, because it's a fantastic read, but that he's had better - even in the form of \\"Oliver Twist\\".Those that like the happy ending shouldn't really be too interested. Those who like ..., intrigue - um, stay away too. The heart of this pup is dialogue and the torture of internal thoughts and personal dissatisfaction. The protagonist is poor, so desperately wants to be a gent and have \\"expectations\\", ... The guy doesn't get the girl. No real living happily ever after. But I don't see why that's necessary."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickins is a really good book. I personally do not like to read but i truely enjoyed this book. Although the beginning is very slow and Dickins takes forever to get to the point many times, i found myself unable to put the book down at times. Great Expectations is a good book about loyalty, trust and fate. It also teaches you to remember your true friends and do not let wealth go to your head. The story is centered around an orphan boy named \\"Pip\\". Miss Havisham is the woman who looks after and takes care of Pip. One day Pip is at the gravesite of his parents and the convict, Magwitch, asks him to help him out. Pip does help the convict out not knowing what Magwitch will do for him in the future.One day at Miss Havisham's house Pip meets Estella. He falls in love with her but she does not return the feelings. In fact she is cruel and plays with Pip's emotions. Despite the way he is treated by Estella, Pip never gives up on on trying to win her over.Later on, Pip is told that he has come into a great fortune from an anynomous benefactor. After he comes into all of this money he goes to London, England to study and become a gentleman. While he is in England he becomes somewhat \\"stuck up\\". He treats his old friends like they are not as important as his new friends.While in England he finds out that Estella has married a man who he cannot stand. He also meets up with the convict, Magwitch. Magwitch tells Pip how he is Estella's father and how he is the secret benefactor to his new found wealth. In gratitude, Pip tries to help Magwitch escape from England, but while escaping the police catch them and arrest Magwitch and put him to death, while Pip's money is taken away from him.Pip goes back to Miss havisham's house and becomes friends with his old friends again. He also meets up with Estella there and after awhile the two marry.This book is well written in the way that everyone can relate to the subjects in some way.I really enjoyed reading this piece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I still wonder why this book is a perennial reading requirement in junior high schools across the country. I had to read it way back when, and it almost turned me off from books in general. This is not to say it's a bad book, because, on the contrary, it's great, but don't have great expectations of an exciting contemporary read. To enjoy this book and appreciate the beauty of fully-fleshed characters, come-alive scenes, and intricately woven plot, you absolutely must keep in mind that this book was written in a different time, before the Hemingway revolution of sparse prose. As you read it, expect long verbose passages and miles between exciting scenes. But stick it out, and in the end expect a great read that stays with you a lifetime.

It is a well done Dickens-style (obviously) story of a young boy raised in a poor environment by his sister--his only living relative--and her husband, a blacksmith named Joe. After visiting a very rich and eccentric woman by the name of Miss Havisham, the young boy named Pip is approached by a lawyer and is told he has &quot;great expectations.&quot; And that he is to move to London to be bread as a gentleman, when after a certain period he is to inherit a large sum of money. The story goes on to London where he is brought up, and leads to some very interesting twists. The tale is well told, and enjoyable if you are fond of Dickens (while I appriciate Dickens.. I admittedly do not like &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; so keep in mind that if that is the only Dickens you have been exposed to, give him a try through one of his major novels.) The character of Pip is a very sympathetic one, and his faults are all to scarily human. This novel covers great, surprise, assumption, and other noteworthy themes. A good classic read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked this book because it kept me wondering what was going to happen.

I found this to be a rather good novel. If you are willing to read a big novel, do so and you should find some enjoyment in this book. If you can't stand reading some pages with just too much detail to get to the actual plot, avoid. Email me your comments, peace."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I don't know where to begin. The book never had me. I don't think it ever actually tried to have me. It's premise centers around a boy named Pip and his life in 19th century England. It's only too bad that Dickens spends far too much time showcasing his prolific skills of writing in the English language and less time on any sort of a solid base for this specific novel. The reader feels absolutely no connection to any of the characters, most notably Pip or Joe. The one bright part of the book is Miss Havisham, who Dickens spends enough time with for us to empathize with her for her lonely life.The biggest problem of course, is it's lack of commitment to any sort of theme. A great novel, as many would claim this is, must possess the language and have something to say. It seems, especially at the beginning, that Dickens is taking his stand against early Industrial Revolution labor practices. However, the book never really delves into that in any way shape or form. When Dickens chooses to describe Joe's house or some other hovel, he persists to use the same kind of language as when he describes, for instance, Miss Havisham's or Wemmick's house. This book, on the whole, is as dry as Spanish sherry and is simply not meant for anyone who wishes to extrapolate anything of meaning from the books they read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"my 14 year old daughter needed to read this book for one of her classes. she didn't think she would like it, but she ended up loving it. my 17 year old son is also reading it now and he also really likes it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love listening to it. It is beautifully done. Voices are expressive and understandable."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Some audio books are unlistenable, with inept hammy actors mucking up the text. I recently had that experience with one of my favorite books, HUCKLEBERRY FINN, which was so appallingly read by a horrible ham, I would have thrown the CDs out the car window if they hadn't belonged to my local library.This GREAT EXPECTATIONS is probably the best \\"book on CD\\" I've ever heard. Michael Page reads Dickens' great novel beautifully, giving each character exactly the right voice without ever sounding phony, hammy, or exaggerating or over-emphasizing anything.Page makes every sentence perfectly clear and delivers each line of dialog just right. His virtuosity in scenes with several characters talking at once is truly wonderful. I've never heard of Page before -- is he an actor? -- but he certainly deserves an award for his brilliant performance reading this novel, one of the crown jewels of English literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My biggest complaint concerning many audio books is that they're poorly narrated--often in monotone, or with one character's dialog sounding much like the others. Not here though--this version is expertly narrated. Like other Dickens audio books, it is probably a little advanced for young children on a long car trip, but most teenagers should be able to enjoy it unless they're dolts."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I highly reccomend this book to anyone interested in reading the classics. I first read the story in high-school and immediatly fell in love with Dicken's eloquent style. His descriptions of Pip's surroundings, emotions and experiences never fail to capture my imagination and tug at my heart. Dickens can be very tough to read, but also very rewarding because you know that you are enjoying a piece of literary genius. Great Expectations provides a nice into into his style and prepares readers for his more challenging stories.The story is long, and detailed but extremely captivating. The characters are complex and the mystery will keep you turning the pages. Even if you've never considered reading Dickens before, read this one!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Hopefully, the review by Nick of Cleveland won't scare lovers of classic audiobooks from this masterpiece by Charles Dickens and Brilliance Audio.My wife and I have listened to audiobooks for years.

It's a timeless classic and one everyone should read!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Without a doubt this has to be one of the greatest novels of all time. I won't say it's the best just because once a work of art attains greatness I find it quite incomparable to other great works. Great works are ones which have fully succeeded in expressing the emotions and convictions of the artist, and without a doubt Great Expectations acheives this. Unfortunately I only hold this view of the book containing the original ending, which was not the originally published ending. (spoiler) The original ending at first seems sad and frustrating, but one can't help but to feel satisfied in knowing that through suffering Estella had gained a heart, which is much more than she would have gained through a cold and heartless relationship with Pip. The happy ending which was published is almost a fairtale ending and it perverts the themes which make the novel so relevant to reality. I must admit, like Dickens' friends and publisher, the original ending was hard for me to swallow, but as I dwelt on it and how it related to the novel, no other ending seemed appropriate, especially not a happy one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well, i have read all of the previous reviews, and it is apparant that people either love this book or hate this book. I was 15 when i first read this book, and have since read it again and it is probably my favorite book of all time. Yes, it is rather boring at times, and yes, it has a long, involved, and confusing plot, and yes, Charles Dickens gives very tedious descriptions of everything. But the morals and meanings portrayed in this book far outshine the faults. If you cannot find them, then it will most likely be boring and dull. If you can, it will probably become one of your alltime favorites."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I simply loved this book. The characters are so rich, and the story so intricate and well written, I found it engrossing from beginning to end. I loved how the author explored Pip's journey of the desire and love, which really lives in the heart of everyone. This is a \\"must read\\" for those wanting to catch up on all the classics. I have not read much else of Dickens' work, but this story is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As I complete my reading effort of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations I feel both satisfied and enriched. This book is outside of the genre I usually read and I am greatful for having taken that leap into the unknown. The satisfaction came from a story that was not only told well but one that ended well. There, in my humble opinion, is nothing worse than experiencing a story only to find that the ending is not truely a completion. Each character and plot line is seen through to its end! The enrichment came from an insightful journey through the trials and tribulations as well as the successes and failures of these well developed characters. This adventure turns from a tale of successes and achievents to one of self realization and personal fulfillment through Mr. Dickens' skilled hand.Nothing is perfect. The story starts slowly. The reader must stick with the book to understand the fact that the beginning of the story was not simply necessary, but a foundation that supports and grows the story like no other introduction could. Some of the descriptions of places or things I found to be exporbitant. This leads to great character development but also to some tiresome chapters. As with any work of literature written durring the time period this book was written, the language is trivially dated or old.I would, and do recommend this book to my friends as one that will not simply pass the time but provide enjoyment!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book when I was a kid and I still remember Pip and Estella.

With the Kindle reading is now convenient. Sorry for the plug, but it is true. I have read many of the \\"classics\\" in high school and college literature classes, but somehow missed this one, among others. I did watch the movie many years ago with my wife, and it was good, but of course, the book gives you so much more.Do be warned, this is not a high adventure action-packed read. It is simply a good story well-told. I was surprised to read so much to get so little, in the sense of reading many pages to find out so few or minor details. I continued to read as much and as often as I could to get through this book. It is a great story even if I think it could have been written in half the pages.It is classic for a reason, do yourself a favor and read it if you had not. I hope many high school students do not have to read this book, as it is something beyond their typical capabilities because it does not move quickly and is not too exciting. I think it is more a college level read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Much easier to read and get into than A Tale of Two Cities.

I guess it's just a case of \\"too each his own\\". I'm sure there are some books that I would think were terrible that others rave about. Having said that, I loved this book. I don't know why it took me so long to read it. I've been reading a lot of classics lately - mainly classics that my son is reading or will have to read for homeschool this year. For some reason I thought this book was on his list, but later, after I was in the middle of the novel, realized it wasn't. No matter. I'm very glad that I read it. I was surprised by how involved I became with the characters and the book when I was reading it. I couldn't put it down. I thought a book by Charles Dickens was going to be dry and boring. How wrong I was. I actually found myself grieving with the characters. I would be happy with them and angry with them when they did something that was, in my opinion, wrong or ill-advised At one point I actually found myself having a down day but couldn't put my finger on it until I realized I was at a point in the book where Pip was depressed. Some of the language and unusual expressions that are used in the book can be difficult, but, if you are a fairly well read person, you should be able to do fine. Great book!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much i did like it. Usually the books that they force you to read i don't enjoy.

I really liked the storyline and thought the characters were enjoyable. I will definitely have to pick up more of Dickens' works.SPOILER: a lot of people didn't like the new ending that Dickens wrote, saying it is too happy and that the original depressing ending was superior. I actually didn't like the original ending and didn't find the newer one to be too joyous. I read the new ending as Pip being doomed to always love Estella, making it more depressing than the original. Anyway, that was my take."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens could put in some really cool surprises for the plot through his books, and this one is no different. When Pip learns who his benefactor is... whoo! I suppose some of the surprises could be predicted if you read enough, but it still makes for an interesting story, and especially good for the time it was written in.I remember reading this many years ago. This may not appeal to people who do not like 'old-fashioned writing', and yes, this book is different than many of the 'easy' novels you will find today, it is still a solid and die-hard classic with a cast of good characters and a story with enough twists and turns to keep it good. Charles Dickens wrote many fine books, and this is definitely one of them."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book truly shows how well written a novel can be.I read this book for school, for all those who are having to read this book for school, I reccomend reading it beforehand because not doing so means finding the book dull and unnatractive while answering all the tedious questions that can ruin a book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was quite disappointed reading this book after having read David Copperfield. Although both books bear some resemblances, the plot in Great Expectations is much more condensed and simpler. The story is again the orphan-boy-who-gets-away-from-home-in-search-of-a-happier-life. The plot, however, is much less intricated than it is in David Copperfied. There are fewer characters (and fewer pages!) in this book. That caused me an impression that the story is not as feasible as it is in David Copperfield. Some things seem to be rather unreal or fantastical. There are some qualities, however, that remain the same as they are in David Copperfield. The narrative, the characters descriptions and their surprising behaviour keep the reader up to the last page. So this is my advice: if you are one of those who tried to read David Copperfield but gave up because thought it was too boring or long, Great Expectations is an excellent book for you. And maybe, after you have finished it, you'll be willing to read a much better one: David Copperfield."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i have read the book twice once last year for my teachers book report and this year for the 9th grade merit english classes.

I admit it. The book starts out slow. Dickens, though I love the man, writes in such flowery and long winded language at times. What takes many authors a line or two, Dickens will devote whole pages.And I almost put the book down for that exact reason. I'm very happy I did not.With so many detailed threads in the story, the depth to the characters--when they all start to blend together a few chapters in, the result is page-turning.The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. You cannot help but love the boy. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who refuses to return your sentiments and only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself, as shocking as they may turn out to be.I felt as if I was side by side with Pip through it all, and that made the novel a wonderful experience for me. I recommend the novel for the young because so much relates to them, and also for the older readers--because you can experience it all again.A wonderful and heart warming tale.

I have heard that many people think this was his greatest book and that makes me wonder if they have read anything else by him because I do not think anyone could get much more boring!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well I read this book with some great expectations and I shouldn't have. I figured that it was going to be a wonderful book because of the author (wrong) Ihad to strugle just to read 2 pages without getting sleepy. Altough I have great respect for Dickens and all of his accomplishments, I did NOT like this book !!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Last year as a Freshman in high school I was assiagned to read this book as a class project like many of the other critics who have already written their crities. Although I must admit that the book was in reality flat out boring and totaly lacking in point I would not recomend giving up on Dickens becuse of it. I can not with in any honesty recomend this book to anybody but I would eagerly recoment Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read this for a high school summer reading list. It was the worst reading experience I ever had, and I love reading books. I cried several times trying to plug through the long-winded (obviously Dickens paid by the word) presentation. While some themes are mildly interesting, there were no scenes that captured my attention or held it for any period of time. This book might be great as an adult (which I'll gladly never know), but definitely not as a 16 year old. Sucks sucks sucks.Note to Teachers and Principals, please don't assign this to your high school students. There are so many better and more captivating books. This was the first book I ever read that truly took the joy out of reading for me."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This page tells me next to nothing about this product. When I try to find out anything at all about this audio version, I can't. I can't see the back of the package, which would tell me something, because when I click \\"see the back cover,\\" it gives me the Norton Critical version, which is NOT this product. The reviews also are of the paperback version, NOT this product. Please provide adequate product information. Who is the reader? Is there just one reader, or a cast? What else have the reader(s) done in their careers? Is this their first professional job? How is the audio quality? Etc."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm just starting to read it but I'm sure the novel will fulfill my \\"great expectations\\". But I have to complain about the physical book. The pages came incredibly badly cut and the cover was thorn and damaged, as if it had been used for over a decade!Besides, the introductory study gives a lot of details and hints about how the story is going to end and I hate that!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Put simply, Great Expectations is a wordy, convuluted, and overrated peice of trash. Written originally in different volumes and distributed to an excited Victorian republic, Dickens was able to make his audience care and feel for his odd, moving characters. He was the Stephen King of his day; a clever businessman who distributed mediocre books to the public. That Dicken's fever passed on from one generation to the next is fine, that this made Dicken's books classics in schools is a shame. But let me get to the actual book at hand! Yes, many characters in Great Expectations are original and interseting. Overall, however, Great Expectations is wordy (!), and painfully convoluted. It is often difficult to get through, and geared towards a certain audience only. This is not to say that everyone will dislike Great Expectations, but we live in an age (good or bad) of gritty realism. Authors like James Joyce and F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote with and still show a heavenly pen, Dicken's stories are what turns so many young people against reading. Anyone who wants to live in a former era, Great Expectations is a must; for anyone who wants a powerful, sophisticated read PLEASE put Great Expectations in the incinerator."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was a large disappointment for me. I had seen the movie, and hoped that the book would be good. However, I was wrong. In fact, this book turned out to be one of the worst I have ever read. The book has too much description, not even important to the story. Dickens lost my interest in the book from the very first chapter, just a plain description of main character Pip's history of his family and town. This chapter drags on for too long, as does the rest of the book. As an example, the character Estella's rudeness towards Pip is repeated so often that it becomes annoying. I got the point of Estella's bringing up and lifestyle early on in the novel, and this did not have to be repeated so often. This book could very well have been interesting, but Dickens did not do a good job writing it. His continuous decscrptions of such landscapes as rivers and trees are irrelevant to the story, and caused me to drift away from it. I do not reccommend this book to anybody, and advise you to avoid it. I, as well as many other people I know, could not even finish this book. It brought no interest to me, and it is too long, considering that it contained nothing attention-grabbing and no excitement. However, if you do insist on reading this book, please just get the cliffnotes. It is not a book worth buying."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"when I read this book. Honestly, after I liked &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; I was expecting more from Dickens. Maybe Dickens wrote in the style of his time, which was to be very detailed, but it really doesn't translate well to today. I don't mind long books (I'm reading War and Peace now) but this book went into extreme detail about the most meaningless things.This story was essentially a Victorian soap opera. Theres all sorts of unknown parents, secret coniving, mysterious benefactors, and worst of all, many unrealistic characters. This book was so contrived and unnatural that I really don't see how it's attained &quot;classic&quot; status.If you don't mind meticulous attention being payed to the minutia, which is Dickens's style, then I'd recommend &quot;A Tale of Two Cities.&quot; If not, there are many other authors much better than Dickens that you can read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was a mediocre book. I was not impressed. I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wopsle's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! If you want to read a good Dickens story, read \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to do this for school. I could hardly get through it. All they did was talk. It was long and boring. I HATED IT!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The most boring book i've read in ages. If it wasn't for school I would never have read this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"this book sucks very badly! as soon as i was on the second page i threw it in the fire place!!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating. This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was literally the worst thing thats happened in my whole entire life.I was forced to read this long. boring book for english class and either fell asleep, or sat there and sared off into spce.THIS BOOK WAS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!The only GOOD thing about this book is that I hav found a new way to doze off without sum sleeping pills (just read the first two pages and WALLA ure fast asleep!!!!!!!)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"after reading this book i think dickens would benifit from very low expectations. and by that i mean a lot of people will be returning this book and giving bad reviews. all the classics always in my opinion, are very bad"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Let me see.I hate this book. It is a required reading for English, mostly to show the difference between Flat and Round characters. Well it worked! Most of the characters in this book are flat! Ugh.I can't get over how the plotine doesn't even move normally. Its like when you want to drive somewhere and you hit a million and one detours. Eventually you'd say, \\"Screw it! Who needs food?\\" But nooo... Dickens just kept on driving around. I think only ONE subplot was actually straightforward, and that would be Miss Havisham and her ex lover.Basically, I got halfway through this book, then fled to Sparknotes. I wasn't going to read it. I was just going to make sure I knew enough to pass the test I had to take on the garbage.Ironically enough, those of us who used Sparknotes got better test grades than those who actually read the book. That say something about how much sense it made..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book by far is the worst piece of shi--garbage I have ever laid my eyes on. The story has a skeleton, and a little bit of meat (and I like meat), but mostly, it's just fat. Especially the second stage of Pip's expectations, which finds Pip devoid of any characterizations beyond \\"I'm rich and you're not,\\" and \\"Oh, how I do love the lady Estella.\\" It's enough to make you vomit. Mr. Dickens should have made this a much shorter novel, or maybe even a short story. It still would have been boring, but maybe not as boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A guy I work with read this book and it seemed like he was reading it for three years! Every day he sat there with his legs crossed sipping his tea and reading Great Expectations, spending about an hour on every page! What an aristocrat. It was brutal!Than I tried to read the book.I couldn't get past the first stage or the first part or whatever because it was so f*cking boring i thought my f*cking head was going to explode! NOTHING HAPPENED!That freak I work with didn't like it either.I'm just surprised he could read the whole thing without completely losing his mind."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"AAH! This book bored me to tears... literally. Thanks to Charles Dickens and his array of b****y women and the rest of the babbling morons, I never want to see that book again. It was thrown across the room many times in the course of my reading. Being forced to read that garbage didn't help much either. I don't understand why honor english students have to be tortured with his 500 pages of nothingness. I had to get the monarch notes to be able to understand it all! It made me feel like an idiot and maaaaaaybe if it was understandable and shorter.... it would actually be good. MAAAAAAAYBE!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think Great Expectations was a very long, boring book that didn't have a plot. Dickens seemed to drag the story on and on. If the book wasn't as long, it might have been better. I heard somewhere that Dickens got paid by the word and that is was there's a lot of extra, stupid words in it. I also think that it was twisted because everyone was realted to each other."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"the book was boring, poopy, i didn't like it at all, had to read it for school, not a good time"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens was actually a good writer, but he never could come up with a decent ending. His stories were well written, and the characters were interesting, especially in this book. This story follows the life of a young boy as he grows up and tries to make a place for himself in the world. He meets some interesting characters that, at times, get the better of him. He also falls in love with an unattainable woman. The story carries on without a climax, without a point, without resolution, and, ultimately, without an ending. It just abruptly stops. I think this was the best book I read by Dickens, which isn't saying much."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thought that this was a pretty good book. In the beginning I wasn't sure if I would like it becuase it was kind of different but I continued reading it and I ended up enjoying it. Some of the parts in the story were kind of hard to read. There were so many characters to remember and to keep track of. One of the characters went by two different names so that got confusing. Another thing that got difficult while reading was the dialect that Dickens used while writing the book. I like the way Dickens wrote this book. He doesn't tell you about everything that is going on, so you have many questions about things and at the end everything is answered for you. It doesn't turn out how you would expect."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I found most of the book a good read. I was suprised by who Pip's benefactor was but that's what a good book is suppose to do. Intregue you, suprise you.... I didn't enjoy the ending though I thought with all that went on in the book that there would be a different approach to the ending."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thought this book was a really good book. I liked it because it was very exciting and interesting. I thought it was difficult to read though because of all the characters in the story. I thought that there was way to many characters and there didn't need to be that many. Dickens also used a lot of long and hard words which I didn't understand that well. That made the story even harder to read. It was also very long and I think that Dickens could have taken some parts out. It got kind of boring during the middle of the book but at the end it was all worth reading. I think Dickens is a very good writer and I would like to read some more of his novels. He thinks of neat stories that no other author would think of. Overall, this was a very good book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I must confess that this was the first book I've read from Charles Dickens and did'nt liked it.I believed that he would describe more profoundly the rigid class difference in the british society of the end of XIX century."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book got to me fast and in great condition, and at a great price!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The Great Expectation was a great book. I thought that it was a little hard to read. But I just read the part over that I didn't understand and I eventually understand it. Another thing that confused me is that Charles Dickens uses a lot of names for his characters. He should of just stuck to one name per character so that the readers wouldn't get confused. He also had some unrealistic plot in the story. Otherwise this was a great story how a boy becomes a gentleman and learns how to act. I would recommend you to read this book if you want to keep guessing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Pip craves the approval of Miss Havisham and the love of Estella, who basically treat him like dirt. Even when he's with them he's miserable and knows it. Pip also knows that he's being an ungrateful snob towards Joe and Biddy, who've done nothing in his life but love, respect, and protect him. This because he cannot help but view them through the eyes of the rich and vindictive Miss Havisham and the beautiful but really darn mean Estella. Despite all this, Pip is a likeable character with whom it is easy to identify and sympathize. Eventually he confronts the superficiality of his expectations and embraces his true nature. In the process he transforms both Miss Havisham and Estella into feeling human beings, understanding and remorseful of the pain caused by their previous conduct."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"...this book and I are! I had to keep reminding myself that this story was fiction, otherwise I probably would have gotten much more emotional about it than I did. Many of the emotions Pip went through, I have also at some point. What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger (or at least very sick... poor Pip!)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is in one of my Top 5 Favorite all time books. I have read it again and again. The only problem I have with it is that I am never able to get through part three. How could I call it my favorite then? Read the book and discover the magic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My first experience with this book was as a freshman in high school. Being so young, it was nearly impossible to grasp the depth and breadth of this genius piece of work. This story is amazingly broad in character development. Through the novel, one is able to follow the life journey of Pip, and his ties to those closest to him in life. He &quot;changes, and changes again,&quot; and can never fully recover from what he learns. There's no going back. This book will forever remain one of my favorite. It's one that leaves you wondering how a person could have the talent to create such a touching, masterful work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"People have enjoyed the adventures of Pip and friends (or enemies, as the case may be) for decades! Though quite confusing at times, Great Expectations was a well thought out novel. This book required more concentration than most, with a cast of characters that would fill the world many times over. I had trouble reading it in the normal haphazard fashion I usually take; a chapter here, a few pages on the way to school, because of all the details put into it. I know this classic was written with money being paid per word, but I found much of the long, rambling, descriptions to be the one major fault of the novel. I think that the one reason people accept and cherish these lengthy descriptions is because Great Expectations is one of the &quot;classic classics&quot;, so to speak. People expect it to become tedious in places, filled with descriptions of anything from a desk drawer to toenail clippings. But overall, I found this to be a touching book, about mangled love, childhood, and life in general. A great read for anyone with patience!!-LJ"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think that this book was superb, not just because it's a classic but because of it's morals and it's story of young Pip and how he goes through many many adventures and many wonderful happenings in his life. That's why of course it's called Great Expectations - the title tells all"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book helped me realize I do not need to read books in a conventional manner to fully enjoy them. I read the book with the aid of books on tape while in the back of my parent's Toyota riding through Holland. The atmosphere of the many hours spent enjoying the book while I would have been sleeping or staring vacantly at the fields still calls me to thank my eighth grade teacher for assigning it to me. Even though I remember groaning at the first sight of the thick novel, I am happy to have known the eccentric nature of the rich old lady, the adventuresome curiousity of young Pip, and most of all the intriguing presence of the girl Pip would be affected by for his whole life"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel, written by Charles Dickens, shows us that we cannot achieve happiness from money. It also teaches us that if we succumb to our desires we will end up losing in life. I recommend this beautifully written masterpiece to anyone who enjoys reading"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After doing numerous analysing on the novel, I find Estella the least developed of all the main characters in the book. The chapters in which she apperas in are short; her actions are small and her speeches are simplistic. I find it a pity that Charles Dickens did not actually further develope Estella and based the entire story on Pip"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is one of the most depressing novels I haveever read. Just about anything and everything goes wrongfor Pip and just about everyone in the story dies. It wasa good book, don't get me wrong, just a bit of a downer."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens is a rare genius who succeeded in capturing vividly the manifold pains - physical, emotional, and moral - of childhood and the effect of these scars in the adulthood. As a result, his stories still resonates powerfully after so many years. On the weak points, Dickens tends to rely on remarkable coincidences to tie the plots together, and the psychological studies of his characters are not as sharp and profound as those of Dostoyevsky or Henry James. I also found the contrived happy ending very unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is an incredible read. The main character really absorbs the attention of the reader. The plot is amazingly well done, you won't want to put the book down!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Everyone must read this book. It is quite a story, but not for the weak of heart. It will make impostors change their ways (or at least know the extent of wrongdoings) and those who are earnest count their blessings that they are."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book shows alot of character and keeps you wondering what this little boy is going to go through next. charles dickens is a wonderful writer. This book should be made mandantory for all students to read while they are still in high school."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"More high school students should read this book. I loved this book, and I read last year as a freshmen. If you think about it, high school students can relate to this book just as they can relate to books written now. Even though it is written in older times and with &quot;big words&quot; doesn't mean one should not read it and say it is boring and stupid. Many high schoolers can relate to Pip when he was bored with being a blacksmith because he got tired of doing it, because alot of times high school students sign up to do stuff that it turns out they don't like or that they are tired of because they thought they would like it or their parents made them do it. Many high schoolers can also relate to when Estella makes fun of Pip, because they argue with siblings or that guy/girl who sits next to you in biology class that you don't like but they still talk to you. Then when Pip gets his chance to finally become a gentleman, many high schoolers finally get their chance to do something they want. Once you read the first few chapters of Pip's childhood and up to when he gets to become a gentleman, you are hooked. I personally loved this book. It was one of the only books I read in my freshman year of high school, and now I am glad that I read it. It was wonderful."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was a great book because of the way that he made it seem that you were there.Also because of the way he kept you on the edge of your seat, and the way that all the characters are all familiarized to each other makes the book good but hard to understand,except the way that he wrote it in Old English made it hard to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this book when I was 12 or 13 - ten years later I decided to read it again because I remember loving it so much. It was just as good the second time round.While not his best book (of the ones I've read David Copperfield takes that prize) it is a thoroughly enjoyable read with larger than life charcters and, in places, Dickens' trademark subtle, sarcastic humour. Add a great storyline and you've got a great book.I cannot believe that so many younger people are panning this book. Not being full of adrenalin-packed scenes does not make it boring! Get an attention span!One more comment - while the recent film with Hawke and Paltrow was a good film in its own right, it lacks so much when compared to the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am 16 years old and this was my summer reading book. I thought it was pretty good. Just because you have to read it for school, don't just discount it as a worthwhile book. Yes, it is long, but it DOES have a point. You have to keep in mind that Dickens publiched this in monthly installments in his magazine - so yes, it is long. But take your time and enjoy the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This review comes from a 15 year old male. I found this to be a rather good novel. If you are willing to read a big novel, do so and you should find some enjoyment in this book. If you can't stand reading some pages with just too much detail to get to the actual plot, avoid. Email me your comments, peace."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations has been one of the first of many novels I happen to touch upon fashioned by Charles Dickens. I set forth to reading it with a mind not interested but curious. Zeal may be the one motive that takes me through the first part of the novel. Fleeting moments of ambivalence of good and evil throughout the novel can always be found in one's life. As have been articulated, I find myself in Pip's reaction to what his fate and destiny has brought him. Pip's oscillation between compunction and remoselessness, egotism and selflessness is the cardinal element upon whcih the story is built .On the other hand, the plotting of the novel is superbly constructed, with the lives of countlss characters interwined with one and other. Miss Havisham, I reckon, is one of the best of them. This is one great novel that you should not miss. Miss it and you shall lose what is more valuable than Pip's expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a classic story of unrequited love and growth. It teaches something to everyone who reads it. There is so much beauty and depth in this novel, it cannot be put into words. My advice for anyone and everyone who will read this in the future is to treasure every moment you spend reading this book. Take every detail in and you will never regret the time you spent because it is entertaining and absolutely thrilling. There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot as well as the emotions in the characters and it literally brought tears to my eyes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book in 5th grade and I loved it! I still do. It is the best book. I think it is not boring at all and is very very very funny!!!! I think that everyone will like it once they get into it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think that two clarificifactions need be made to edify those who thought this book &quot;sucked&quot;, and that the characters were &quot;insane&quot;. Dickens is exaggerating! For example, there are hardly any people in real life like Jaggers, who do everything in such a business-like way. And yet he is very interesting and highly entertaining. And for everyone who thinks there were too many details: try to imagine just a bleak straightforward account of Pip's life. A good novel shouldn't just be a summary. And if you think it's wordy and too descriptive, try IVANHOE (another great book). Regarding the alternate ending: YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FOCUS OF THIS BOOK IS NOT PIP&quot;S LOVE FOR ESTELLA. Who gives a damn whether he marries her or not? The focus of the story is on Pip's aspiring to such expectaions, and being drawn away from his family and humble origins, until he discovers the true treasures of life. I loved this book, and if you do not think it ranks as a classic, then what does?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is the story of a young boy, Pip, and how he struggles to reach the experiences of Estella, the girl he loves, as he grows up and matures. This novel, written by Charles Dickens, explains the disappointment of loving someone without response, and being unsatisfied with one's life, because of having such high expectations that one cannot meet. I liked the way that the author portrays the characters and the setting to give a resemblance of the theme. I was interested throughout the story, for it is gripping and unpredictable. I sincerely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys novels that one can relate to with a deep meaning. Also, to anyone that likes a challenge Great Expectations is an ideal book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When a game of leap-frog goes awry, young Pip Maplethorp's father is killed.With the family crumb-winner out of the picture, Pip is forced to travel to London where he finds employment as a Governess to the Lingus family (whose daughter, Constance, taunts him with cries of \\"you're lost - lost in a Fog of Lag !\\"). On day, while gathering pond scum, Pip meets and befriends Dr. Wetherbee. This chance meeting provides the book with one of it's few moments of comic relief, as Dr. Wetherbee repeatedly strikes Pip about the face and head with a cricket bat that he affectionately calls \\"Trevor\\". I won't ruin the book for you by telling you what Pip sees behind the potting shed that makes him no longer desire to be a Pediatrist, but I will tell you that, after reading that chapter, I never looked at pudding the same way again. I predict that this book will have resurgence in popularity and soon everybody will be saying, \\" Is that your Dickens in your hand?\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is Dickens' greatest novel, and one of the best of all time. Full of some of his most memorable characters, such as Magwitch (convict with a heart -- or liver), Miss Havisham, Pumblechook, Jaggers, Wemmick and more. From the opening graveyard scene to the final confrontation between Pip and Estella, you're hooked, laughing and crying. Pip is the Dickens character with the most psychologically realistic growth, and is therefore the author's most sympathetic hero. Wonderful plot, wonderful description, an absolute must. I highly recommend the Bantam paperback because the introduction by John Irving, &quot;The King of the Novel&quot;, is just as extraordinary in its own way. It's a superb, personal, passionate defense of Dickens that has affected me as much as any of Irving's best novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"While reading the reviews that others had written, I was amazed at how many people did not like this book. Maybe if you weren't so rushed into reading this book, you might actually enjoy it. Some of the reviews may stop you from reading this book, but I am telling you to read it. It is very descriptive, has a wonderful plot, and a great author. Ignore the other reviews because this book is clearly a classic and will ALWAYS be a classic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yes, it's hard to believe. Not a page is wasted. There are no digressions and few apparent digressions; the story - admittedly a long story - is swiftly and cleanly told, and it contains all the character growth, suspense, and frippery that one could reasonably ask of any story. This is DESPITE the fact that the book has all the virtues of any Dickens novel. The languge is, as usual, witty and a delight to read - in fact, more so than usual: it turns out that first person narration suits Dickens. All of the charcters are memorable - in fact, more so than usual: it comes as a great surprise to hear that this is the Dickens novel with the fewest characters, if you actually number them. The usual quota of gorgeous incident is there: in fact, more. And so on. It's hard to imagine a more nearly perfect book. -And there's one other thing I should mention. \\"Great Expectations\\" probably has a special personal appeal to many different sorts of people, but I would like to especially, from personal experience, commend the novel to graduate students. I hope they'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"An undeniably solid book. I can certainly identify with Pip, but it was, at times, drab. Maybe if I hadn't been forced to read it I would have enjoyed it more."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I coulda thought there would have been a better ending, but it doesn't really matter. Mrs. Dooley gave us a really easy test over it, so I don't really care, because we spent a whole 3 weeks reading this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Love Great Expectations and love Charles Dickens. Would recommend this book to anyone. I read it in school and am reading it again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It is fifty years since I read this book at school. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it again and was able to relate the work to the world around us"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had a chance to see the film several times. I really loved it. It is a bitter-sweet love-story of a boy with deep feelings. It is not an easy-to-read book, not everyone will like it. It is much better, than the film I also like."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've always wanted my own set of classic books. These couldn't be more beautifully bound. They really are beautiful. I absolutely urge you to buy this book if you're on the fence about it. It'll at least at some visual interest to your library if you don't plan on reading it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this because my son had to read it for his 9th grade english class. For a younger reader the language can be difficult, so I helped him as much as I could. I thoroughly enjoyed the story though! I like Dickens' since of humor as well as the way he kept you hanging on wondering just how this was going to end. As we get farther and farther away from the lifestyle of the 1800's I think it is important to look back and see what life was like before technology. I also enjoy the British take on things. I don't always &#34;get it&#34; until I re-read it a time or two, but the humor is there. (SPOILER ALERT!) I actually thought the ending was sad until my son pointed out that in class they considered the fact that when Pip &#34;saw no shadow of another parting from her,&#34; could mean that they were never seperated again.

Do not touch it if you like literature!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In honor of Charles Dickens' 200th birthday, I re-read one of the first of his novels that I experienced originally over 30 years ago. After having read some eight or nine other Dickens novels, revisiting Great Expectations was a somewhat different experience this time around.Like David Copperfield, this is a first person narrative. Being inside the mind of the central intelligence and narrator, the reader can only know what he knows. Therefore, there are fewer narrative threads and multitudes of characters to weave into a complex tapestry than there are in other great multi-layered novels such as Bleak House and Little Dorrit. The jovial wit and exuberance of Pickwick becomes saturated with a world weariness and verges on cynicism in most of the novels of the second half of Dickens' career. As one of his last completed novels, Great Expectations fits within this pattern.Pip is not quite the bland, colorless character that Oliver Twist or David Copperfield are. True, the structure of the plot almost demands that he be a passive recipient of much of the action. His fate is mapped out for him by the anonymous benefactor from his youth and it is not until well into the second half of the novel that he actively seeks to steer the course of his life with each subsequent piece of knowledge he acquires. Pip is not quite an innocent. From an early age, he is consumed by guilt over unknown sins he feels he has committed. He does fall prey to vanity and he descends easily into spendthrift habits and enjoys his unearned prosperity with shameless hedonism. His greatest sins seem to be pride and vanity, leading to the snobbery that fuels the snubbing of his faithful and saintly brother-in-law Joe. To his credit, he is self-analytical and examines these shortcomings as soon as he realizes he possesses them.The sentimentality that often mars even the greatest of Dickens' novels is muted in this one. Pip is fully aware that he is no angel and there are few \`catch phrases' as often appear in his other novels to signal the reader to be moved. On the other hand, the coincidences are piled a little too high for my taste and the evil Orlick subplot seems to be one adversity too many for this plot which can sustain its own weight on the saga of Pip, Estella, Miss Havisham and Magwich.As much as any novel, in Great Expectations Dickens captures the torture of a male's infatuation with an \`unattainable' female beauty, especially one so willing to inflict heartache. This novel still reaches across the centuries with an emotional power that is timeless and universal. Regarding the so called happy ending that Dickens revised as a concession to public sentiment, the ending for this novel is not quite so clear cut as one might expect in a Dickens novel. The last sentence, in particular, includes a double negative that in no obvious way equals an unequivocal positive. By doing this, Dickens is able to sustain the tone of the novel leading up to it and not betray the thematic thread he has followed for almost 500 pages. Despite its shortcomings, Great Expectations possesses a power never surpassed in his novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Anyone who loves the english langauge language will enjoy this book. Dickens is a master of description bringing to life the colorful characters. So, if you haven't read Dickens for years, pay him a visit ."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had great expectations, because I had listened to a very good Charles Dickens recording by Martin Jarvis earlier (Hard Times), and Great Expectations was also good, even if it did not make me laugh quite as much as the Hard Times audiobook."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Read this when I was about 10yrs old, then saw the movie at an old theatre. I've probably reread at least a few times later.

Used a dictionary and encyclopedia to figure certain things out.I purchased the BN classic and it provides a bit more history that one would have known, unless you've done a research paper on it. Other helpful insight & information one may not know during that time period or era. BN does a pretty good job."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is one of the greatest novels I have read. First, I admit, I have difficult transitioning to Dicken's novels. They are written in English, but not in the version of the langauge I speak. However, after reading for a while, I am able to adjust to his style.This novel is great for many reasons. First, it helps me to understand the poverty and hardships faced by the poor in England during his time. Whenever I read one of Dicken's novels, I am always left with an attitude of gratitude. Additionally, in this novel, nothing works out the way I expect or want it to. I wish that Pip would not have acted as he did once he came into his great expectations. I wish that things could have worked out differently with Miss Havisham and Estella. But, the ending is well done. The twists are what I enjoy most from Dicken's novels. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As background information, I am in the process of reading most of Dickens 22 novels. I bought the Penguin Popular Classics version of the novel. It is very basic and comes in a simple green cover. It contains no introduction or analysis, just the text plus a very brief historical sketch of Dickens. It seems to be an excellent value for the money and I bought three Dickens novels in the series. I was a bit disappointed in that one book seemed to fall apart as I read it: the binding seemed very weak and cheaply made. It was marginally okay for the present book which is just 400 pages, and the book did not fall apart, but did seem damaged after one read. Another Dickens novel, which was 700 pages long, fell apart with at least 50 pages coming loose. After this bad experience, I bought other versions of Dickens's works - Wordsworth Classic versions and the regular Penguin Classic versions, the ones with the photo on the covers.Charles Dickens, who lived from 1812 to 1870, is the best know male English writer of the 19th century. He authored 22 novels plus numerous short pieces. Most of his writing was first written in serialized form, later published as single novels.A young Dickens at the age of 12 had the unenviable job of attaching labels 10 hours a day at the Warren's boot blacking factory. That experience shaped much of his writing career. Still in his teens he became a law clerk, then later in his twenties a journalist. The last job as a reporter led to the serialized writing of his novels. His works were social commentaries with larger than life characters, or colorful caricatures, living in the slums of London. He was a critic of poverty, social injustice, and the slow moving court system. Those themes permeate most of his novels and it is present her in Great Expectations. This is a novel set in London and the countryside close to London. It is a story of a young boy who wants to grow up and become wealthy and to be a gentleman. Those are his \\"great expectations.\\"Without giving away critical plot elements, it is the story of a young boy called Pip, whose parents are dead, and who lives with his sister and her husband Jo who is a blacksmith. They want Pip to learn the trade and be a blacksmith as well. They live in a small town near marshlands near London. His ambitions are grander and he wants to escape to London and become a gentleman. Will Pip find happiness? Will he succeed? Action shifts back and forth between the small town where Pip first lived and the city of London. It involves Pip, lawyers, accountants, Pip's new friends, his love interest, etc.The novel is not used by Dickens for any pressing social issues, although one might argue that it shows how Pip's ambition blinds him to his true friends. But mostly it is pure entertainment. The book is a classic but has a choppy feel that one can attribute to the way it was written. It was written as a series of dramatic stories for popular serialization which were then combined to make a single novel. I enjoyed the read and would highly recommend the book.Having read 10 of Dickens's novels I still rate David Copperfield as best, and ahead of the present book, both as a work of literature and for entertainment value. In many ways the two novels are similar, but the plot is far more interesting and realistic in David Copperfield, and Dickens has many more interesting characters in that book, and as a bonus it is almost twice as long."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Beautifully binded book.

The rest of the book is just a pleasure to read, beautiful. Pip's early behaviour really got me angry, he was pompous indeed, but I still loved him."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have absolutely no doubts whatsoever that Charles Dickens, if he lived today, would still classify as an author's author. He's a master of all the things that make for great writing and storytelling. Dickens has an ear for dialogue most authors would kill their own mothers to possess. He also is a master of creating vivid scenery, another sign of excellence essential to great writing and one which many authors lack. Finally, but not least in importance, Dickens knows character development. He REALLY knows how to develop intriguing characters, to the point where many of his books spawned figures that have become literary archetypes. Not bad for a guy who grew up in extremely adverse circumstances. He even spent some time in a factory sticking labels on bottles after his father's imprisonment for debt. Most people wouldn't recover from such poverty, but Dickens did. He went on to a successful career in journalism before settling down as an author of serial novels. This format, which allowed Dickens to write and release his stories piecemeal, made him a great success with the public. The anticipation for the latest chapter or two of his stories often led to near riots. Not many writers can elicit such a response today.Many consider \\"Great Expectations\\" a seminal work by a master. Millions have read it, most unwillingly, but most consider it one of Dickens's most accessible stories. It's a tale about a youngster named Phillip Pirrip, known throughout the story as Pip, and his rise from relative obscurity to the heights of wealth and privilege. As the story opens, we see Pip lamenting the passing of his parents in the local cemetery. Their deaths resulted in Pip living with an older sister and her blacksmith husband Joe. Life is tough in Pip's village. His sister wields a heavy hand against her younger brother, relatives like Uncle Pumblechook berate him, and they live in a place where convicts often escape from barges floating on the river nearby. In fact, Pip has a frightening encounter with one of these prisoners at the beginning of the book. His actions, undertaken at the command of this felon, result in a series of incidents that lead Pip to the home of the local recluse, a dour old woman by the name of Havisham. This woman, as rich as a lord but as unhappy as one could ever be, takes a liking to Pip and keeps him around for entertainment.It is during his tenure as Havisham's court jester that Pip comes into contact with several important figures that feature prominently in the story's later episodes. He meets the cold yet beautiful Estella, Havisham's adopted daughter, and falls in love with her. He also makes an initial contact with the old lady's lawyer, the highly successful Mr. Jaggers, and an odd young man named Herbert. All play an integral part in what is to follow, namely the announcement (through Jaggers) that Pip has suddenly come into fortune, or great expectations, that require him to move to London in order to train as a gentlemen. In London Pip spends time with Jaggers, his assistant Wemmick, Herbert, and even Estella. He spends his money, helps his best friend in covert ways, and wonders who in the world set him up with this money and property. Jaggers makes it clear that he isn't supposed to dig too deep concerning the origins of the fortune. Instead, he is to wait until the day when the individual responsible steps forward. When that happens Pip's world as he knows it nearly collapses. He must move heaven and earth to avert disaster while at the same time coming to terms with who he is and what his future holds.\\"Great Expectations\\" is, in a word, great. It contains all of the hallmarks one associates with Dickens. The characters, everyone from Wemmick to Jaggers to Havisham to Joe, sparkle brightly as fully formed individuals living and laboring under very real problems. Atmosphere is divine: Pip's village and London come to life under the writer's pen. Even the author's penchant for examining social ills moves to the fore in a chapter that looks at the horrific conditions in London's main prison. Another real plus is the humor. If you haven't read Dickens, you don't know what your missing in the humor department. This author has an amazing sense of what is funny, and it is nowhere more apparent than in the scene in which Pip and Herbert take in a play starring one of our hero's relatives. This short chapter along with the ones describing Wemmick's abode are absolute masterpieces of hilarity, and they're actually bright spots in what is otherwise an occasionally dark piece of writing. And last, but not least, there is the downbeat conclusion. There are actually two conclusions to \\"Great Expectations\\". Make sure you pick up a copy that has both of them.About the only thing \\"Great Expectations\\" lacks is length; it's one of Dickens's shortest novels, which is probably the reason millions of teachers assign this book to their students. That's unfortunate because most kids want nothing to do with this book once it's forced upon them when in fact they could actually benefit from reading it. Why? Because \\"Great Expectations\\" teaches us a lot about love and identity, two things that matter quite a bit (or should matter) to young people. The teachers ought to assign something like \\"Hard Times\\" and let those who want more seek out \\"Great Expectations\\". The prevailing opinion on this book is that it is semi-autobiographical. It doesn't really matter whether the story is about the author's life or not. What is important, I think, is that this story attains a perfection that few books ever reach. That's why it's a classic, I guess. If you haven't read Dickens before, you should start right here."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations, 1860-'61, Dickens's second to last completed novel is the first tome I have ever read and is one of the best books I've ever read.The story centers upon Pip who is orphaned and lives with his mean sister and her kind husband Joe. The book's classic opening is when Pip meets an escaped convict and he forces Pip to give him food and then later is caught. Little did Pip know that this occasion will live on and he will be reminded of it in a very unexpected fashion later in the bookYoung Pip is then sent to Satis House to meet the very mysterious and eccentric Miss Havisham who, jilted at the altar spends the rest of her cursed recluse life in her rotting, yellow wedding dress in Satis House. Pip also meets Estella, a beautiful, yet very cold and proud girl brought up by Miss Havisham to hate men as revenge for her fiance's betrayal.Great Expectations is the story of Pip's life and of all the surprises (there's a lot of 'em folks) hopes: some lived some smashed, and of course, Dickensesque eccentrics who populate the book.Great Expectations is the first tome I have ever finished and I must say that it was worth it. Since I didn't have the book for a while, it took me about three months to read it but have no fear, for this is a pretty quick read with many twists and turns along the way.This book is often considered Dickens's masterpiece. Well, I don't really know about that but it has to be close to that. It certainly was a great read and I think you will agree."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've taught this book in 9th grade for years because it is a curriculum requirement. During that time, I have raved about the incredible abilities of Dickens to create memorable characters, plot fascinating fiction, make the lives of ordinary people in England memorable, write incredibly descriptive passages . . . .The time has come to tell the truth. While it may be a great *work of literature*, Great Expectations is a tough book to like.There is much to appreciate - in the intellectual sense of the word - about GE, from carefully drawn characters to an infinitely detailed plot. Without exception, students love to play *connect the characters* as the novel progresses. They discuss the unrequited love between Pip and Estella, Biddy and Pip - they love the relationship between Joe and Pip. They are fascinated and repulsed by Miss Havisham and her house. They are shocked by Magwitch, and enthralled by his sacrifice. Truly, this has all the makings of a 9th grade *hit*! So what's the problem? Language,length, and format.The language is off-putting. So much is colloquial to the time and difficult to bring current. Joe's dialect (along with the convict's) is VERY difficult for my deep south students to imitate when reading aloud, and sometimes even difficult for them to decipher at all. Sentences can go on (and on and on and on and on) so that the end hardly seems connected to the beginning. While common when Dickens was writing, these patterns are a bit difficult for a modern audience.Length and format are a problem that go together. Originally published as a serial, this novel was presented a chapter or two at a time, with a wait between installments. That allowed a reader to digest the events in a chapter, contemplate the relationships, discuss them with friends and build up anticipation for the next installment. By virtue of that style, many side-stories are included that have little bearing on the overall plot. Likewise, there is much detail included that seems almost irrelevant when one is reading the novel in full. Those are the very things that fostered interest in the serial, and yet in a novel, they seem extraneous and confusing. At the end, the novel seems (just a bit) overwritten (and perhaps that is because it wasn't originally a novel).In summary, my feelings about this novel are mixed. The story itself is fascinating, but I find myself eternally dreading that time of year when I will yet again introduce it to another crop of unsuspecting students . . ."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In this delightful edited version of Dickens immortal tale, Hugh Laurie reads. Now you may or may not know Mr. Laurie spent years in London as a kind of character actor. Today he;s playing House on TV. But, he reads GE as each of the characters. As he is so talented each voice is hardly like the other. Some may remember him from Black Adder and the silly prince. But here you see just how versatile he is.As for the story...Dickens' twists are remarkable. GE may have the funnest of the who did what whens.

DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was just 10 years old, when I first read an abridged version of this Dickens Classic. I must have read it many times since, and everytime I read it, I am filled with array of emotions, and a deep respect for the author. Pip, the hero, is a character that embodies hopes, disappointments and dreams of every boy. As he narrates his life, we grow with him, see many people come in and go out of his life, and we feel with him his emotions and predicaments. Life is full of surprises, unexpected twists and turns, and this novel is a great chronicle of the possibilities of fate. But most importantly, this is a story of pining... and a novel worth pining for.Miss Havisham, the old lady, epitomizes eccentricity, while Estella in her cold abandon represents every heartbreaker. This story is about pining, about love, about friendship (especially Pip and Joe, and later Pip and Herbert), about relationships, and most importantly about what one feels and lives by. Like all Dickens novels, this is a very well written story, and is much more engrossing than any of its on screen versions. This is a story that must be read at leisure and it must be failing of the reader to try and compare it with some cheap paperback that one can scram through while watching a movie and munching chips and cola. Classics deserve respect, attention and concentration: dedicate yourself to one, and trust me you will discover a lot more. A lot more about the novel and a lot more about your own self.We all have Great Expectations, and this one by Dickens beats them all!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Written as a serial publication, Great Expectations is very fast paced and the character development is superb.

Having served in the house of Miss Havisham, a woman jilted on her wedding day and filled with hate and revenge for the male species, Pip receives notice of &quot;great expecations&quot; - the term for the potential inheritance of a large fortune. From his humble origins as the son of a blacksmith, he is destined to become a gentleman. But the identity of his mysterious benefactor continues to haunt him.

After all, we're talking about blacksmiths, pirates, and so on. Hardly things the average teenager of the 2000s can relate to.But if you're in your twenties, thirties, or forties, this book is as compelling a novel as you'll ever read. It's an opportunity to look back at Pip and ourselves, the great expectations we all have, and the major surprises, disappointments, and regrets of life.The adult reader can understand the vindictiveness of Miss Havisham, the pride of Magwitch, the true and rare friendship of Herbert Pocket, and, of course, Estella. Each man has in his life an Estella.Beyond the true-to-life tale of hope and defeat, is the wry humor throughout the book that a more mature reader can appreciate.Surprise yourself.

Dickens did a wonderful job with the characters and how all their lives are somehow connected."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"From the moment I discovered that \\"Great Expectations\\" was a mandatory book to read in many high schools I thought that I belonged to those happy people on whom, by good luck, it hadn't been forced in their teenage years. I do not think that even if it had, the novel wouldn't have brought me pleasure later, when I grew up, but my past experience with it would have certainly impeded taking the book in my hands again. There is little doubt that in many cases high school stifles the willingness to read literature (not \\"bestsellers\\", however) when young people are confronted with such serious and complex works as \\"Great Expectations\\".The situation with \\"Great Expectations\\" is similar to that when a high school student is forced to read a fairly technical textbook on contemporary physics: there are chances that he or she will like or even be enthralled by some ideas in the book, but inability to follow and understand details (although symbols might be recognised) will almost certainly produce a negative opinion of it in the end.\\"Great Expectations\\" is one of the greatest novels I have ever read. Often humorous, with a carefully planned structure and set of heroes, wonderful narration and an unmatched appeal to senses, it reveals a story of unrequited love, an affair which now stands out as one of the most painful in classical literature. The complex relationship of the principal heroes - Pip, a touchingly honest and faithful young gentleman, and Estella, his beautiful and highbrow tormentor, are at the heart of the plot. But such original figures as Miss Havisham, Mr Jaggers, Mr Pumblechook, Joe Gargery and Biddy supply a rich background - each of them being a perfect example of a character in literature. For, as Alphonse Daudet noted, \\"It is the business of the novelist to create characters, not to write fine prose\\". Though Dickens' fine prose is also above all praises.But \\"Great Expectations\\" is much more than a simple romance - it is a great life lesson. Why do people \\"destined for each other\\" often end up being apart? What makes us break other people's hearts? How long will true love last? What obstacles surmount?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said already? &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a tremendous novel from the introductory paragraph to the final sentences. The plot is deep and intricate, and there's even a surprising plot revelation occuring late in the book about the origin of Pip's wealth and opportunity in life. The characters are all well-defined and inherently interesting, and such major characters as Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, and others vividly live in the mind. Even minor characters such as Mrs. Joe and the Aged Person are memorable and amusing. The novel's storyline, beginning with Pip's early childhood and ending in his late middle age, is epic in breadth. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; treats the reader to a delightful plot and scene for all of its five hundred pages.Even better, however, is the brilliant prose Dickens gives us in the novel. It is humorous, moving, touching, witty, clever, and always perfectly phrased. Never for a single second does the reader feel bored. Like many great works of literature, there are plenty of moments where the writing is almost awe-inspiring in its beauty and language. With a talent as great as Dickens, one could write about almost anything and it would be tremendous reading. When paired with the brilliant plot of &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; it feels almost heaven-sent.Many readers see the term &quot;classic&quot; on a novel and feel that it becomes a type of chore, and add it to a laundry list of literature that somebody felt would be good for them. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a classic, but it's not at all the literary equivalent of medicine. It's a delightful treat, and a quick read despite its length. I can't imagine reading this and not treasuring it. It is, quite simply, fantastic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I studied this book for 2 years in high school and never really read the book itself until a month before my super majorly imprtant exam. Up till then, i was surviving on cliff notes and whatever my tutor said. I had tried to read the book at least a hundred times but fell asleep after the first page.I give this book 4 stars for the fact that dickens is such an AMAZING writer. i'm not saying this coz its a classic. after studying this book for 2 years, you get to know the structure, the language, the relationships between the different plots and sub-plots. and i was BLOWN AWAY by the BRILLIANT way dickens tied everything together. SIMPLY AMAZINGI admit, it IS a tiring read. but like what another review said, Great Expectations was meant to be read chapter by chapter, one per week or soemthing like that. the book i read came with a timeline which shows the publication of each chapter.I do recommend this book. just make sure that you're really really awake when you're reading it. pay attention to the details e.g. how the atmosphere reflects the different characters stuff like that. Read it once. and read it AGAIN. i swear the 2nd time you read it, everything will become clearer. Read it a third time and you'll notice how Dickens pulls the novel off. pretty intriguing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I know lots of people will flay me for saying this, but this book has a lot of repeat value. I could read it every year, for five years at least without getting bored doing it. I had read the abridged version in school, and a year ago i had seen the movie (featuring gweneth paltrow and ethan hawke). I liked these so much that inspite of knowing the story i bought the unabidged version and was plesantly surprised how much i enjoyed it. Both the movie and the abridged version concentrate only with Pip's relation with estella. The book is infact much wider in its scope. For example Pip's relation with Mr.Pocket fills more pages than that with estella.Charles dickens surely spins a superb yarn of pip, his ambitions, desires, weaknesses, and pureness of character which is so entirely credible and believeable that it seems like an autobiographical account told in the third person. This inspite of the novel containing eccentric characters like miss havisham difficult to find in actuality. Another important contribution of this novel is to portray the relation between pip and estella. Its extremely difficult to say what exactly it is. Infatuation? No. It was the very soul of his existance without which he could not exist. It lasted from childhood till the end. Love? Unlikely. He was torturing himself in her company and this can hardly be called love. Hatred? No. Vengence? No. On miss havisham's part maybe but not on that of pip or estella. There's no answer forthcoming. Just when we thought we were intelligent and mature enough to understand relationships Mr. Dickens comes along to tell us to start from kindergarten once again.I found Mr. Dickens style of writing quite modern. Of course there's an influence of the times he lived in but the novel has a very modern tang. In fact if the means of transport were cars instead of horses, there was electricity instead of candle light and so on, making only such cosmetic changes the novel would definitely seem to be written very recently. I just realised - the movie proves this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I must admit, this review is slightly prejudiced. I am a high school student, and I read this book for fun. I had tried to read Dickens before, but found myself having a hard time ploughing through the complex vocabulary and intricate parlor dialogue of Hard Times. But I decided to take another stab at Dickens, perhaps with something a little more palatable. All of Dickens' novels, I realized at the end of Book I!!, are VERY, VERY SLOW -- AT FIRST. Then Dickens decides to play on his own soporific introductions!!!!! There is a crucial turn in events for Pip, and the book takes off. Every few paragraphs, there's another handhold so to speak, to keep the reader's suspense and to keep the plot building. Both the language and the many interwoven plots are delectable and unavoidably magnetic -- your hands just can't seem to put down the book, no matter what you do. This book has it all. It also helped me understand why I hated reading the Odyssey for English. (Translations always lose some of the vivacity and fullness that the author has pumped his or her very original work full of, and it is this fullness that made the work so great in the first place.) It is a long read, and you have to be willing to be patient with the beginning. But it's definitely worth it. And the more you read, the easier it gets. After reading this book, I feel inspired to read all of Dickens' works!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When I found out I had to read Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens for school, I was extremely dissapointed. I had already read A Tale of Two Cities, and absolutely hated it. Students in other classes had read Great Expectations and not liked it either, so I figured I would not enjoy it either. But I decided I would read it anyway, because it is considered to be one of the best books of all time. The books starts out fairly slow, and it takes the reader a few chapters to get used to Dickens's writing style, for he uses an abudance of description. He was paid by the word so he had incentive to do so. For those who are able to survive the first few chapters, they will enjoy an extremely lovable book and not be dissapointed. The book is timeless, with the basic story line being one that has affected almost everyone sometime in their life; falling in love with somebody who does not return the feelings. Pip, the main character, falls in love with an exotic and beautiful girl, Estella, but of course she does not have any feelings for him. So Pip does everything he can to win her approval, and most importantly her heart. It is hard to skip around in the book. While some passages might seem as if they have nothing to do with the story, they do. Everything in the story is tied together somehow. Skimming the book is not going to help. Certain events and people the reader thinks are insignificant or forgot completley, will appear over and over throughout the book. I am glad that i decided to read Great Expectations, despite the negative remarks from peers. I found out that most of them never made it past the first few chapters, so they missed out on the good parts. The only reason I did not give the book a higher score is that parts of it are slow and dry, but stick with it, you will not be upset."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens takes you on a ride that will keep the reader enthralled throughout.

How did I get through high school without reading it? My hs English teachers chose the heartbreaker, David Copperfield, so it's not my first Dickens. I can see that Dickens can tell a story. Who wouldn't love this book? It's the Harry Potter of its time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is such a good book in so many ways. It's funny, I couldn't get through it as a kid, but now I've really enjoyed it. Charles Dickens writes these characters that seem so alive. He describes them so well, their little mannerisms, that that part alone fascinated me. Pip's perception of them felt really spot on for a kid. He was definitely put upon to some degree, but much of what he felt was horrible behavior toward him by the adults was really stuff that's common to every kid. It reminded me of how I felt sometimes toward relatives and friends of my parents, all of whom I like now, and I both laughed and felt horrified to realize it. Anyway, very very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was a Book Group choice, but I really enjoyed reading it.

Many people love or hate, but I loved it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was forced to read this book in high school and hated it.But I find going back to some the old classics and re-reading them very enjoyable.And best of all they are free."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens was part of a great humanistic effort, of the 1800s, that more than ever evoked and espoused the Christian principles of human respect for one another. Great Expectations is about the unexplicable evil youth encounters and how one should rise above the hate and vindictiveness of stupid, petty people. It is a book that explains that there is great suffering in the world and there are those that will hate you for no other reason than that you look the way you do, or simply for the fact you exist in the form you are, or have the ancestors you have. And this hate may never be fully exposed, but be there none-the-less, lingering in mysterious shadow and never seen. An honest read of this book by my ninth graders allowed some, who felt anger and self-pity in the form of vengful hate, to rise a little out of their cycle of dispare. The greatest revenge, some say, against your oppressor is to live happily. The book shows how a vengeful heart is so self mutilating and unfulfilling. Great Expectations runs the coarse of someone who managed to forgive. It is a moving book and one that gives inner strength and respectful grace and recognition to the divine in all of us. It is better to not get bogged down in a discussion of Dicken's personal life, which is a mixed bag, but just read the book. Why would ultra feminists hate this book? Because they hate. Hateful people will hate a book that so poignantly exposes these wreched people for what they are. The book also shows, most significantly, and contrary to much of the belief of the time, that bad people can reform and become good. The significance of this, and its effect that Dicken's made upon this notion, is as haunting and deep a goodness as the evil Mrs. Havisham placed in Stela's soul."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectations is a very good book. It has action and a meaning. The book starts off by pip, which is a young orphan boy, going to a graveyard to look at his parent's tombstone. Then a escape convict grabs pip and tells him to bring him food and a file for his chains. The next day pip brings the man what he wants and then police capture the man but he protects pip and says he stole the food because he is touched by pips kindness. Then one-day pip is taken to the satis house, the home of miss Havisham, pip meets a beautiful young girl named Estella and falls in love with her. One-day Jaggers who is a lawyer tells pip that he has received a great fortune from a secret benefactor. The man tells pip he must go to London immediately to start his education as a gentleman. Pip thinks miss Havisham has given him the fortune. When pip is in London he finds new friends and begins to treat his old friends coldly, especially Joe. Several years later a familiar face comes in to pips room it is the convict, Magwitch. He then tells pip that he is pips benefactor. Pip then agrees to help him escape London. Compeyson is pursuing Magwitch and pip later finds out that Compeyson is the one who left miss Havisham on the alter and that Estella is Magwitch's daughter. Pip begins to care for the convict but later Pip hears that Estella has married another man. When Pip goes to visit miss Havisham she catches on fire and is burned badly. During the escape attempt Pip and Magwitch are capture by police. Magwitch is sentenced to death and Pip loses his fortune. He gets back together with Joe and later ends up marrying Estella and living happily ever after. I think that the author of this book could have made this book in 3rd person instead of 1st and it could have made it better. I think that this book was well writen had had a good message of dont let money go to your head and know who your true friends are. I recommed this book to anybody."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It may be difficult to rehabilitate Dickens from the reputation assigned to him by his critics, such as his being labelled as a spinner of popular yarns; a prime representative of Victorian strait-laced morality; a notoriously verbose prosaist whose writing teems with rhetorical redundancies and digressions; a careless plotter and over-plotter with a propensity for hyperbolic and grotesque comedy, depicting grim and depressing situations peopled by caricatures and abnormally exaggerated personages. The criticism that he commits a number of unforgivable Freudian flaws cannot so easily be obviated as well. Unlike the more firmly established exponents of the realist novel, such as Stendhal, Balzac and Dostoevsky, with their searching psychological assessments of character and motive, Dickens seems concerned mainly with evoking the idea of a certain character and not the character itself in its concrete, three-dimensional actuality. This explains his penchant for caricature. Nevertheless, his ability to present concrete characters is illustrated in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, one of his later and finer works, particularly the characters of Pip and the convict Magwitch, who are psychologically profound and sympathetic portrayals in comparison to the host of other characters. His ability as a profound satirist and social critic is conclusively demonstrated by his interweaving his analysis of class, injustice and crime with the narrative. Pip, who finds himself elevated from his humble origins to one of the highest strata of society, by being made into a gentleman by a mysterious benefactor, is shocked to discover that this same benefactor, the agent of his social progress, is a despicable criminal who offends him by his sight. The message is obvious: society is a complex network of interrelations that interpenetrate class divisions; Miss Havisham is jilted by Compeyson, who is Magwitch's accomplice; Magwitch is the benefactor of Pip, who is in love with Estella, Magwitch's daughter. All, Dickens seems to say, are equal, regardless of their class or origin, before the judgement of God, which transcends human judgement. This is memorably brought out in the courtroom scene, during Magwitch's trial, in the description of the shaft of light that illuminated the room, \\"between the two-and-thirty [prisoners] and the Judge, linking them both together and perhaps reminding some among the audience, how both were passing on with absolute equality, to the greater Judgement that knoweth all things and cannot err.\\" Dickens's moral is the necessity of human fellowship, which we see lacking in the dehumanised Jaggers and Wemmick and in Estella and Miss Havisham, who both come to tragic or regrettable ends, through their coldheartedness and pitilessness. This quality, Dickens's use of plot coincidences to deliver profound human statements, partially redeems him from the charges of being a mere popular storyteller or a romanticist. In this respect, and also with regard to his verisimilitude in rendering authentic detail, he invites comparison with the great realists, such as Flaubert and Joyce, the masters of radical and even amoral realism, though Dickens, with his undisguised moralising, his chaste heroes and puritanical heroines, does not sit comfortably amongst these two; both of whom had works banned, one for his apparent frankness, the other for his obscenity and scatology. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; remains, however, as one of the great representatives of the realist, or social, novel, the product of an age that abolished serfdom and slavery, that witnessed the Industrial Revolution, the growth of large towns and the expansion of business enterprise. as such, it is an invaluable document of its time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A classic British novel written by Charles Dickens, Great Expectations, is a great novel with a very good moral at the end. The main character, Pip, is a very dynamic character. His morals and thoughts change throughout the book.In the beginning Pip grows up living with his aunt but then he gets an anonymous benefactor who helps him grow up a new life as a boy with a good education and living as an upper class citizen. Throughout the book we see Pip's struggles and he overcomes them. This book draws one in so they are not able to put it down. A good twist at the end."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I really loved this book, but the best part about this particular form of Dickens's classic novel is the section at the end of the book that included Dickens's notes on the characters and plots, an alternate ending, and footnotes about the use of language or phrases that might be confusing to the modern reader. Also, the cover does not press an image of the characters or setting onto you, and allows you to picture your own Pip or Estella. Other editions of this book might not give you so many resources and be so reader-friendly. I am glad that I was forced to read this book, because I would have never read it on my own, or I would have quit after the first book---- which is a little boring, but reveals some very important facts to develop the intricate and complex plot. Isn't it great how everything ties up so nicely in Dickens? Read this book, but make sure never to question the genius of Dickens... putting you halfway to sleep before dropping a bomb and putting a huge plot into action.

Depspite his financial windfall, things don't go well for Pip. Estella, the beautiful but haughty young woman he loves, coldheartedly tortures him. And then there is the reappearance of Magwitch, the escaped convict who forced Pip to steal for him when Pip was a young boy. While Pip's maturation and moral education forms the heart of novel with his usual array of unforgettable characters, such as Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Jaggers, and of course Pip.

As a kid, we had this book on our Literature List and every time we had to write down the answers of Literature tales, it was rather strenuous and boring as this meant to be a part of education. However, when it came to conduct a teaching class in literature, Great Expectation turned out to be an adventure. Unlike Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Pip is not really a hero and also it does not end a Happy ending but Pip is being stripped of his wealth and his position in society. Pip is sent to London to be educated as a gentleman, he is impressed by the wrong people for the wrong reasons. He neglects and abandons the honest, hardworking folk who care for him and his pride is hurt when he learns who his mysterious benefactor is. Pip express guilt for his behavior who have a violent nature and crude ways but altogether he is courageous too. Pip, his father surname being Pirrip and his Christian name Philip, that's how he is called \`Pip' , has a fascination for Estella but is brought up by Miss Havisham to wreck revenge on all male sex and break hearts. Herbert Pocket is a character who has frankness was amiable and cheerful who became a friend of Pip. Dicken's novels have a central theme \`rags-to-riches' tale of a poor, underprivileged boy who is finally accepted into society. Strangely, this one has a different end. A nice read and great pick for Classroom Literature workshop."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When i first red the book in the highschool i've looked through like Pip.

If not, he's very lucky..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's a shame that most people resign this book to their \\"having already been read\\" list as a result of this novel being assigned coursework in junior high or high school. Dickens was a master of depicting subtleties of human relationships and personalities. Great Expectations illustrates this gloriously. Whatever can be said of Pip, is that he is abashedly a hopelessly human character. I sincerely can't imagine a young reader to identify with the maturity of these character's substantive familiarities with one another. Please don't write this book off, because you feel as if you already know the plot line and story because you read it young, I guarantee, read as an adult, this celebrated novel will take on a whole new light when you have been out in the world and experienced the complexities of the human condition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I respect the point of view of the reader who said that he/she can't add much to the opinion of countless generations who read this classic for the past 150 years. Classics last this long because they're masterpieces, and hence this work deserves five stars.The only thing to add in my point of view, is that I won't be surprised to learn that Dickens wrote this story especially for school boys who are really struggling to identify themselves and determine what is really important in life. No wonder this is one of the most required readings in middle school. In other words, adults won't find in it a mature story like the one in Steinbeck's East of Eden, or the taboo-sex theme of Nabokov's Lolita. This is about a young boy who goes on a long journey and ends up finding himself and realizing what really gives him happiness in life.As for the ending, there are two endings; published and unpublished, and I like the published more. Don't read further for I will give the ending away, unless you've read it already, but in the last paragraph Pip says that the mist of the evening when he held hands with Estella reminds him with the morning mist when he left the forge. The way I see it is that Estella will go through the same journey that Pip went through when he left the forge and went to London, the journey that was initiated by Estella's father and that helped Pip to be a better man. Now Estella will go through a journey initiated and guided by Pip in order to make Estella a better woman. Magwitch hurt Pip in the beginning but Pip helped him so Magwitch gave him all his money. The money was gone but was left was more important than money: The journey and experience that made Pip a better man. Estella was mean to Pip, but Pip loved her, and destiny put them both on a crossroads at the end of the novel, but because Pip loves Estella and because she is Magwitch's daughter, Pip decided to walk with her in a journey that will make her a better woman.Magwitch and Estella, father and daughter, never met. But there was a link between them; Pip, who became a better man because of the father, and who will now pay him back by making his daughter a better woman. Great Expectations is about the magical and ironic links between people, and how the person who you think hurt you the most may end up to be the person who helped you the most. The fact that an evil man is not as evil as he seems, and a pure man is not as pure as he seems.And these are just few of the many other themes in this classic. So the bottom line is, this novel may be more meaningful to the middle school son than to the forty something father. Read it early before you get older!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Victorian society got a good spanking when Great Expectations was published, at the time Dickens's anger and frustration was at one of its highest points. Pip, the novel's protagonist - I hesitate to call him the hero - is at once likeable and recognizable as a powerful symbolic tool, though the former quality intentionally decreases as the novel progresses.Pip is joined by a cast of the most memorable characters in literature - the cold, ethereal Estella, the crazy, wounded Miss Havisham, loveable dullard Joe, whip-smart lawyer Jaggers - the list could, and possibly might, go on for pages. If there were literary awards for Best Ensemble, the characters in Great Expectations would clinch them all. The characters function as both political/social symbols and, though they exist in a time period far removed from us, identifiable and memorable figureheads that will - and should - be a literary hallmark forever."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this about 12 years ago as a teenager in High School of course at the time I could not possibly comprehend everything that is going on. On a whim I decided to reread this novel and am very happy that I did, Pip, Joe, Estella, Mrs Havisham all these charecters are so colorful and well written it amazes me. This novel covers a diverse collection of human emotions such as love, friendship, loyalty, shame, and forgiveness. If the only time you read this it was mandatory reading for freshman english do yourself a favor and pick it up again and reread it I found it very worthwhile."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Many reviewers have called this Dickens' greatest novel. One reviewer says it was the first time a character's feeling had been explored in such detail. These things I cannot comment on - this is the first Dickens novel I ever read, and I am not familiar with other works of this period. I can say that it was a damn fine read though.I must admit, maybe it was a convention of the time, but there were a great many impossible coincidences in this story. The term &quot;soap opera&quot; even crossed my mind at one point. In the end I forgave these improbable coincidences because the story was so compelling, and the novel so old, and the author of legendary repute.I loved the saint-like character Joe. I think he was my favorite character. And Dickens does a masterful job of showing the friendship between Pip - the protaganist - and Joe and especially Herbert. Miss Havisham is the picture of the bizarre rich recluse. And Estella the epitome of the cold-hearted shrew. All of the characters are rich.And it is true, as many other reviewers have commented, that so many issues are explored in this work. The meaning of true love, genuine friendship, the implications of &quot;moving up&quot; and it's effects on family and friends, good fortune, redemption, etc. It's all there - life is there.The book was slow at certain parts, but most of the time I found myself eagerly turning the pages. Dickens is a master at compelling his reader to turn the pages. What will happen next? At some of the titanic coincidences and plot turns I found myself thinking, &quot;what?! You've got to be kidding me...&quot; and then begging for more. I think you will too.There are some deeply heartfelt moments. Deeply heartfelt, touching, that inspired warm feelings in me. It was a pleasant change of pace from the darker, more cynical literature of today (though there are evil people and violent actions in Great Expectations as well). The final lesson of redemption is truly heartwarming."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is my favorite book. I've read it at least 6 times, and it is still a wonderful story. Dickens makes you feel what little Pip feels on the unexpectedly interesting journey of his life. From his childhood encounter with an escaped convict to a mysterious rise to riches and fame later in life, I am completely immersed in his story. The tale of his love for a girl named Estella who, not only will never love him, but emotionally tortures him every day of his life is heartbreaking yet somehow familiar. There are subtle lessons to be learned from this book. If you haven't already read it, you should."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"All that can be expected from great English classic is here.

The descriptions are detailed, of course. The fact he wrote this in sections to be published in the newspaper just amazes me.

It is a fascinating look into 19th century Britain."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my oldest granddaughter. I was very pleased with the item and the shipping. She was delighted to receive the book.

Laughed out loud a number of times. The plot was compelling and kept my interest, though at some point things began to bog down a bit. The chatty, meandering prose put me off at times.

Still, an enjoyable read.Keep a dictionary handy to deal with some of the antiquated and/or vernacular language."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am an English Major, so I have a soft spot for anything written by Dickens. I bought this for a friends graduation (get it...Great Expectations...)and I am jealous of her now. This edition comes hard bound with an old style canvas-like covering. As far as I've seen, it is a reliable and true-to-original edition (Penguin is usually good for this). There is critical material in the back of the book so non-critical or casual readers can do some in-depth thinking into the piece after reading it.

I really enjoyed reading it and would recommend it at any time.Regards,B."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Listening to the audio version of this Dickens classic is thoroughly enjoyable. The narrator, who is also the main character, addresses you directly and colours the whole story with his own amiable personality. Indeed, one can imagine that the novel, published in instalments in that long bygone era before radio, television and other non-printed media, was conceived to be read out loud in the family parlour.The characters are straightforward, captivating and likeable. Totally removed from any realistic complexity, they are all the more memorable: nave, honest Pip; distant, cold, condescending Estella; devoted, loyal, simple-minded Joe; mysterious, ethereal Miss Havisham; etc.The plot, convoluted, wholly implausible and a tad predictable, evokes harsher but so much simpler times. Though by no means a cliff-hanger, the work is suspenseful and the reader's interest is expertly sustained throughout.Extremely well written, peppered with tongue in cheek humour, this archetypal novel is strongly recommended to any audience, particularly in audio form."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I needed to purchase 3 books at one time for my daughters high school assignment, I was given a \\"short\\" notice.

As all of Dickens' tales do, this provides a look at life for the ordinary man in that time and place, England in the 19th century. It is also a parable about the worth of people as judged by their wealth, status and power vs. their character and more. It is filled with wonderful character studies that only Dickens could do: Miss Haversham, stunted and destroyed by her bitterness, in turn doing great damage to the beautiful, cold Estella. The star of the novel, the orphaned Pip, raised by his shrewish and abusive sister and her wonderful, loving and simple husband Joe, the friends Pip makes, etc. Mr. Prebble reads this great novel as no one else can. He brings the characters to life so I could feel their emotions. All of the characters had unique voices and suitable accents that matched them perfectly. I was particularly moved by his portrayal of Joe. By the way, Mr. Prebble's beautiful, very masculine voice does the female characters believably. One does not even think about it. Thank you, Mr. Prebble, for narrating this novel and providing me with the best Christmas I've had for a while."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I loved it! In fact I remember reading Great Expectations during a 7th grade English class and getting in trouble for not paying attention to what was being taught. I came to this book on my own, as opposed to being made to read it, and while the lenth and the language was challenging for the first few pages, I remember falling head over heels in love with Dickens' style. This was the first time I felt myself get lost in a book. I've read it several times since in the last 14 years and I get lost in Pip's world every time!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yes, the prose is overlong. Yes, the English language has evolved since Dickens' day, so you'll be using the dictionary feature on your Kindle often. But Great Expectations transcends time to bring a very relatable story to modern readers. The mystery deepens at every turn, the characters develop more fully and, if you open your mind and relax, the book's a downright page-turner (or page-clicker, for Kindlers).I tried reading this classic when I was younger and less patient, but it took a 40+-year-old me to 'get' it. Perhaps young people need to experience life and the lessons we all learn to really appreciate Great Expectations. Perhaps they relate a little too much with the freshly made gentleman and don't really understand why he castigates himself for his behavior. Or perhaps they're just not patient enough to 'zen out' and enjoy the book for what it is. Whatever the reason, I sincerely hope the young people who hate this book today, will pick it up again when they're more 'seasoned' - then they might just understand why it's a classic.If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great & free down load to PC Kindle product; yes, Kindle has a free software download so that you can read their books on your PC too.

It is really difficult to understand also."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I wanted to start collecting the Penguin Classics hardcover editions, and I needed this book for a class so I bought it, and I guess I'm glad I hadn't bought a couple other novels to round out my purchase! The cover was rubbing off by the time it arrived to me, in a padded box. However the print on the cover is made, it is done very shoddily and couldn't handle being on a shelf, much less being read. I am very unhappy indeed. Phooey on whoever came up with this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was greatly disappointed with the way this classic story was printed. The typing errors throughout the book ie.words that all ran into each other, and even pages of the story missing, made what should have been a pleasant read into a chore to finish it.I had looked forward to re-reading all the old school classics on my new Kindle but if the conversion of the old publications to e-readers are of the same standard, then I will not want to do so.I fear that \\"Oliver will not be asking for more\\" unless the recipe is improved.I have rated it only one star ,not because of Dickens Story but because it was spoiled for me by it's typing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am no english literature purist by any stretch of the imagination but I did have high hopes for this book.The characters are realistic to the period but the story is very slow. The first half of the book is little better than boring. It picks up through the second half but finishes rather disappointingly.This book was purchased after a book club suggested it was Dickens' greatest work. Having read David Copperfield a number of years ago I would have to disagree.I am glad I read the book even if the only thing I got out of it was to be able to relate to it when others are discussing it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great novel to stand the time. I heard and read the novel in my high school days. However, I just tested the Amazon functions using it without actual reading."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have read Great Expectations more than 2 times. I have listened to it also on Audio CD more than a few times. I occasionally just listen to any randomly selected track(s) at any randomly selected part of the story in it's unabridged version.I was excited to hear it in an abridged version and with several persons portraying the various characters.As much as I love the unabridged reading of the story; I was quite pleased with the acting out of the story in this radio-presentation-like recreation of Great Expectations.It was refreshing that Pip's dialogue was a faithful recreation of the actual text due to him being the character telling the story; so the Dickens' wonderful wordsmithing was not lost.It is a great story for all ages, to listen and learn to love; and I hope for their sake, to encourage them to read the story in its entirety."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I bought this book on Amazon about a year or so ago & just was really turned off by how much writing they cramed into even one page & the font is pretty small, it turned me off to the point that I never did even read the book, to those that did, hope it was good."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A great reading but the sixteen discs are not labeled as to chapters on the disc nor are there any liner notes. You must play the disc and wait for the chapter to be mentioned during the reading. I do not see why they would have left these necessary conveniences out. Very inconvenient."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have to admit I have not read this yet. I saw these advertised in a magazine and just HAD to have them.

I BOUGHT IT FOR MY CHILD TO READ OVER THE SUMMER AND IT BOUGHT BACK SO MANY MEMORIES. I'M GLAD WE HAVE A COPY TO KEEP AROUND THE HOUSE."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My daughter had to read this book for school and she said it was a great read. She is 14 and it was easy for her to understand and follow."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Like many other reviewers, I read this book because it is a requirement in many English classes. Although the plot becomes interesting at times, the majority of it is filler. The book is filled with pointless characters and chapters devoted to run-ons of Pip's thoughts.Because the book was written so long ago, it is also very difficult to connect with. The character relationships are annoying. The romance between Pip and Estella becomes very hard to believe, because Estella is not a likable person. And the dialect is very unbelievable. It is hard to picture someone using Joe's speech patterns, even in old English times.While there are probably many people who will enjoy this novel, I would not suggest this book to someone looking for a quick read (meaning high school students). It is very difficult to skim and requires alot of time to appreciate. If you have a lot of time on your hands and you enjoy long, character developing novels this book may be for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was an interesting book. It is the first book by Charles Dickens that I had ever read. The language was weird but that was because it was a British novel written in a different era. I enjoyed it though because it was a escape to a different era and time. I plan on reading several other works by this author. It was slow to start but only because I was not used to the writing style or language. I would recommend."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The setting of this book is in the Elizabethian era. Class, titles, and wealth is veryimportant around this time period and Dickens shows the importance in this great novel.Another theme of this novel is that not everyhting is as it seems.The story starts with Pip(Philip Pirrip) at the graveyard. He went to visit his dead parentswhen all of a sudden he was snatched by an escaped convict. The convict threatened Pipsaying that he will slit his throat if Pip did not bring food, a drink and a file. Pip did whathe was told and felt guilty for helping the convict out for many years after.He is asked to play at Satis House where he meets Miss Havisham and the beautifulEstella. Pip hoped that Miss Havishams intentions were to make his fortune, make him agentleman and have Estella to wed. He was wrong, instead Miss Havisham's intentionswere for Pip to fall in love with Estella and then have his heart broken.After this dissapointment, Pip hears news that an anonymous benefactor wants to makePip a gentleman and give him a fortune. Pip believed that the anonymous benefactor wasMiss Havisham but instead it was the escaped convict that Pip helped when he was ayoung boy. It gets even more interesting when Pip finds out that Estella is the daughter ofthe escaped convict.This novel comes with interesting twists and great themes that can have a reader thinking,\\" whats going to happen next?\\" I recommend this novel to any reader who likes a greatstory."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The reason I choose to write this review is quite simple: to tell of a great book that gets better every time you read it. The compelling twists of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are very involved and makes for a book that not only comes off extremely in depth but also entertaining. I first read this book and high school and have since read it twice more. It seems the more knowledge I have gained the more I take out of each segment of this book as it is more closely tied into my real life.Simply put this is Dickens masterpiece and that should not be overlooked as many of his books were of extreme quality."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked the book Great Expectations, I thought it was very interesting to read. When I first found out that we ha to read it I didn't think i would like it at all but I did, once I got into the book.I thought it was hard to read. Sometimes I didn't get it but othere times I did and did think Charles Dickens made it easy to understand. I don't think he should have written so many characters becasue I lost track of who was who and where they were at. He should have written more to the ending, like what happend to Pip and Estella.I did like when Pip started realizing that just because you have money dosen't mean you can be mean to people like Joe and Biddy and everyone else that do't have as much as he does. I liked how toward the ending everything kind of came togeter; that's whenI really understood who was who. I really liked how all the characters were sonnected in some way like Magwitch, Estella, And Molly. Also Compeyson and Miss. Havisham."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is one of Dickens's better known classics, though not his best. The theme is worthy enough of study, though, and the reading is enjoyable. Recommended."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens less &quot;weighty&quot; novels. It is slow-moving and at sometimes tedious to read. While the setting and characters are developed well enough to draw you in to the story, the plot is quite unbelievable and the book sometimes tedious at times.The story is about Pip, a young working class boy who comes into great wealth because of a mysterious benefactor. He abandons his good old friends Joe and Biddy to follow his heart towards Ms. Havisham and her cruel daughter Estella. Also dragging along with him are Hubert, his friend and confidant, Magwitch, a filthy convict, Mr. Wopsle, a bad Shakespearean actor, Mr. Jaggers, a vindictive lawyer, Mr. Wemmick- Jagger's more amiable assistant, Molly, a servant with a mysterious past, and Old Orlick, whom you'll know all about at the end of the book.After my first go through, I gave this book a second chance to grow on me and read it again, but it didn't. Unless you are absolutely OBSESSED with Dickens,you are required to read it for a class, and/or you don't have anything to do over a weekend, then don't bother reading this book"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I found this book hard to read and hard to comprehend. The book is about a boy named Pip and his rise from lowly to gentlemanly status. Along the way, he manages to alienate his friends and he learns some valuable lessons about friendship in the end. The way the sentences are written and structured made it difficult for me to understand everything that was going on. Many of the sentences would be considered run-on today."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens tells his story through the consequences of several secret, unsolicited acts of kindness. The consequences of these acts varies greatly. Dickens seems to be unconcerned with passing judgement on the acts themselves, instead he prefers to humor himself by exploring of their unpredictable outcomes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Almost every negative review about this book was made by a 15 year old 9th grader. I also had to read this book when I was in ninth grade and I had no clue what was going on. Those kids might not want to admit it, but it was above thier understanding, I am proof of that. I decided to read this again and even though I was indifferant to it the first time I read, and realized it to be the literary genuis that it truely is. It has an amusing story line of the events that surround a young boy's life and how he copes with his coming into fortunes and life in general. But Dicken's masterful writing makes more than just a story line, it is also a social critique of Industeralized Society. For existance, Joe represents how life was before the Industerial Revolution. He was kind, hard working, morally upstanding, and happy, amoung other desirable qualities. Whereas Estella, for example, represented how it was during the Industerial Revolution. She was greedy, self-centered, controlling, and unhappy. This is also evident in Pip. At first he had the traits of the former, but once he got his &quot;Expecations&quot;, he exhibited the traits of the latter. Another part of his critique was the differance between the rich and the poor. There are other important ways in which he portrays them, but for lack of time the poor people were happy, whereas the rich were unhappy. Dickens is also great at describing setting and characters, so as some might see that as boreing, I see that as giving more depth to the story. He makes it seem like the reader is actually in 19th century London and meeting such interresting characters as Jaggers, Mr. Pocket, and of course honorable Joe. Anyone concidering buying this that is in high school, I reccomend not buying this because you will not undersand it, hence dislike it. But anyone who is already out of high school, or someone who read it in high school I would reccomend this book. Dickens is well know in literary circles for his genuis, but for some reason I cannot explain, in popular culture he does not come close to the popularity of Shakesphere, even though he was writer and Social Critic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The way he describes everything from the eerie feeling he has in Ms. Havisham's room, to the smell of hay in the streets of London. Also the way everything connects together with the things you think are not important, an the way the book, sort of calms down at the end and explains everything that happens. This was a very hard book to read, so I would recomend Cliffs Notes with this, bot do NOT read the cliifs notes seperate! It ruins everything! Even if you hate classics, this is still one great book, I hate classics too, but still, it's very good. I had to read this for a freshman honor class exam, so not that I read this by choice, but i'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It took me a little while to get into the story and get to know all the characters, but once I did I couldn't put the book down. Charles Dickens is a wonderful writer, and Great Expectations prooved it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A good read from start to finish, typically Dickens, one ofthe classics. A fine work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a novel of bitterly dashed hopes and people who still cling to their broken dreams, allowing them to rob the present of meaning. Pride and greed are shown to delude even the best of people, causing them to believe what they want, rather than the obvious facts. The characters are over-the-top, yet still drawn sympathetically, and are some of the most memorable figures in the whole of literature. This is Dickens' best work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"One could not expect to get a decent review on this book from American youth who lack the culture, knowledge, and discipline to enjoy anything that is not a video game. Understanding Dickens, one must remember that he wrote his book in chapters which were printed as excerpts in popular magazines of the time. Compiling these excerpts together results in a lenghtier novel. Appreciate the author's ability to develop characters, to visually put the reader into 1800 Victorian England, and Dickens as a social justice advocate for the poor. If you're looking for extensive sex, violence, and meaningless dialogue and plot, watch American Television."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was on my reading list for 9th grade, and it was my first Dickens novel ever. It took me about 3 days to read, and it was kind of a fluctuating thing. Some parts of it I couldn't put down, while other parts I dragged myself through. On the whole, I thought it was a good book, but not one I would read over again for a while. Dickens' use of figurative language is exquisite, but sometimes I found it hard to understand at first. The way almost every character described is tied some way into the tale is fantastic. You always have to pay attention, for you never know when that character might turn up again. This is such a tragic story already that I wish it would have ended a little better. I know it broke my heart. All in all, I would only recommend this book to someone who is in the mood for a complex tragedy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Even though I'm only in High School, this book had a deep impact. This book was extrmely well written, Dickens use of figurative language and his descriptive language was fantastic!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a great book, and if it's too 'complex' for you, you haven't read many good books, because it pioneered the layout of a novel. It is full of forgiveness, obsession, pride, disillusionment... rich and involving. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My previous experience with Dickens is that I picked up A Tale of Two Cities, got about five pages, and then returned it to the library, yawning.Well, I finally decided that I would will myself through a Dickens novel. And I enjoyed it immensely. I can't say that the plot was especially thrilling -- nor the ending particularly satisfying. And yes, it is long, and if you just want to find out what happens, you won't find it to be of much interest. But what I like about the books is the attention to characters and details -- even ones that are almost irrelevant to the story -- but which kept kept me smiling and reading. In particular, his friend who is a clerk who has made his house TRULY to be his castle, complete with moat and drawbridge -- and who has an Aged Parent that had me laughing like crazy. The unexpected irony -- when Pip describes things to be such and so, but when it is clear to the reader to be much different -- I found to be wonderful. I felt that Dicken's had painted very strong visual elements -- by the end of the novel, I had very strong visual images of most of the characters and settings. I'm pleased to say that I have read a Dicken's novel and I truly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of all the negative reviews I read, the common theme is &quot;I didn't understand it.&quot; Or, &quot;I was forced to read...&quot; Truth is, it is a very solid novel; not the greatest, but very good and insightful. For those of you who claim not to understand this work, may I suggest a return to Winnie the Pooh? Give the book a chance, think a little about it, and you may be surprised."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I remember having to read this book when I was a sophomore in high school. At the time I hated the book with a blue passion. Basically becuz I didn't understand it. Just recently, I decided to give it another chance (fifteen or so years later) and could not put it down. Although Pip is the main character, I found my sympathies lying with Estella. So young, so beautiful... so hardened. Ms. Havisham, in her greedy bitterness, deprives Estella the chance of real emotion, real love. Although I believe Ms. Havisham realizes what she has done near the end of the story, it is much too late for Estella. The re-written ending, although it pulled at my heart-strings, didn't work for me. The original ending is the only logical, perhaps realistic, ending in light of the events that occur within the story. For you kids who are forced to read it, try it again in a few years. I know your perception will have changed."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read Great Expectations for a class project. I looked at how many pages it was and froze; &quot;How am I ever going to finish this book?&quot; I thought. After about 30 pages I was hooked and read it in a week. The language is old, so if you're young read it with a dictionary, it helps a lot! Dickens did a great job of tieing everything together at the end, and you know he must of had some master plan on what was going to happen!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectations is not only a great story filled with mystery, drama and action. Great expectations is a book that points out the personality flaws in all of us. It examines relationships and how they function between individuals. It is a great book and well worth the effort of reading."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is an excellent book. It boosted my vocabulary level up a great deal and contributed to my education. Thanks to Charles Dickens for writing this extrodinary book!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"An extremely beautiful novel that displays human conflicts throughout its length. No wonder it is described as a timeless classic! I loved this book because it had such a greta plot, with all the relations surfacing at the end. The relationship between Pip and Estella is particularily interesting, especially the change at the end. This is a treasurable addition to any collection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A book that captivates the ideals of entertainment, Great Expectations is a novel that cannot be put down. Having previously read &quot; A Tale Of Two Cities &quot; for an English topic, I was dissatified with the quality of work that Dickens produced and did not understand the hype surrounding his works and the popularity of sales. Great Expectations has changed my view entirely, as Pip, the protagonist will always be a person that can be related to and felt for. The life of the protagonist experiences many facets of human education, and the outcome is satisfing to himself and to the reader. Dickens has created a true exploration of people and how and who we are. Each chapter ends on a twist and torments the reader into further readings. The life of Pip and the events and characters that involve him work fluently and emphasis this theme. Dickens commonly gives subtle hints of information for the reader to use in working out the complexities of the novel, sometimes leading in the right direction, and other times, in a misleading direction. This keeps the reader informed and eager to process all the facts to conclude their own opinions. The ending is truely &quot; warm-hearted &quot; and acts ideally to conclude the novel. A splendid book not to be neglected from any book collection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This may be Dickens' finest novel, for while it may lack some of the comic character that animates his other masterworks, it has a focus and coherence unseen elsewhere in his serial novels. Filled with memorable images and the pain of unrequited love and self-reproach, Dickens has invented a superb comment on wealth, on youth, and on life in general. (Youths forced to read it in high school may not understand the pain of looking back until later in life.)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I, too, languished through this in High School. I, too, vowed never to pick up Dickens again. Then something happened. This is not bragging: it just happened. I grew up. Any intelligence I had mellowed into understanding, a very different faculty. Saddened, changed, I picked up Dickens again. And at last, I understood. Great Expectations isn't a classic for its language, plotting, style or wit. Like all Dickens' work, it is faulted in these areas. It's a classic because of Dicken's passion, which along with Bleak House pours onto the page and if you are at the right time of life, into your heart. So to all the reviewers here who find him problematic, wait a bit. Read a little about the nightmare world he lived in, the choked waterways slimey and poisonous with oil, feces and dye...the dangerous, airless shacks stacked up on each other, the rotten food...when it could be had at all. If you can, too, research a little into the social mores of the day, because what Dickens says about Victorian manners is quite true: virtue was often toggled to wealth in an absurd attempt to justify those unworthies clawing their way to the top of the &quot;Beehive&quot;. Try Dickens again later, when you have grown old. He's a ripping good yarn, but you must forgive him...he sees people as tiny valiant miracles amidst a roiling world of injustice, farcical posturing, physical danger, ignorance and want, and he needs to tell you about it. He often jokes about it, because the society he was writing for was very touchy and required its medicine to be sugar coated. It is only after you've put a Dickens book down that the images--minus the wit--pour over you and like the smoke curling through a Dickens novel it occurs to you you cannot breathe..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dicken's novel, Great Expectations, teaches a lot to the reader. The best thing about the story is Dicken's development of plotting and characters. It is about a person who experiences grown and shattered expectations from childhood to teenagehood to adulthood. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; basically means what is &quot;expected&quot; in life: a job, a career, money, marriage, etc. Pip helps a convict, Magwitch, in the beginning, to escape by bringing him a file to file the convict's leg iron. In the second stage of Pip's expectations, Pip has always been thinking that his secret benefactor is a certain Miss Havisham (whom he met in childhood), because he thought that her daughter, Estella, was destined for him. At the end of this stage, the benefactor appears, and Pip finds that it is the convict whom he had helped so long ago!! He is filled with repugnance. And Estella also gets married to his most despised enemy. And he is deeply in debt. Pip's great expectations are shattered to pieces by all of this. Later, Pip has to deal with it in the third stage of his expectations, and the story ends with all the people around Pip married, but with Pip still single. But Estella's husband had done so much evil gambling, and he also died in a horse accident, leaving room for relief from Pip. So, the story isn't exactly a happy ending, but it's better than nothing. This is a GREAT book!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was the worst book that I have ever read in my entire life. I dont know why anyone would want to read this for fun.

I think its awful that I was forced to read what amounted to an 18th century serial out of a tabloid.The reason the book is filled with so much meaningless drivel is that Dickens was paid for each installment and the longer the series lasted the longer he had a steady job, At least thats my theory. I just wish I could ask the dead author some questions like Why didn't you let Pip grow the Hell up? That poor me, I'm a country peasant with no friends act got real tired real quick. Second question Where in his warped imagination did he get Ms. Havishom? News flash! Anyone who did so many terrible things because a man left her was mentally unstable before she met the jerk which explains why he left her. Oh and one more thing if your a feminists (like me) this book will get you upset enough. The only women in the book are either crazy old hags or out right bitches. It certainly says a lot about male Victorian sensibilities!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I looked forward to reading a classic of Dicken's.

I don't like long books like Great Expectations but this book went into extreme detail about the most meaningless things.The novel grabs you fast and has a story with many surprises and twists along the way.Theres all sorts of unknown parents, secret coniving, mysterious benefactors, and worst of all, many unrealistic characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are the characters that you should think more about them understand them.If this is to be your first reading of the book, be patient with the book's middle third,because the real and important events starts very late;The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself.It is a darker work, but it has some exciting and entertaining parts to it, too. If a ex-convict came up to me, I would be so scared that I would run away. The fact that Pip trusted Magwitch with a lot of things really amazed me.Actually there are great descriptions with wonderful dialogues and I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, but an illogical read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Do not give this book as a gift.

Some of the words the use you don't normally hear everyday or the way they phrase some of their sentences makes it harder to know what is going on. I liked this novel though the story was great in how all the events that took place connected to something else in the end of the story.My favorite parts in this book were when Pip was finding more and more about Estella and her family because it kept you wanting to read more and more of the story so you could find out what happened. The major themes of the story were kind of hard to understand because some of them are hidden in the story and Dickens doesn't come right out and say what's happening and sometimes he drags out the seen and makes it really easy to lose interest or just get confused.Dickens didn't really bring the story alive for me because I didn't really understand some of the parts in the book, but I did like the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"HOW I JUDGE A CLASSIC: I don't give extra brownie points to classic books.

The story line is mildly interesting, but most of the book contains fluff that is pointless and you just have to suffer through.

It is considered to be his greatest work to many critics. I read the book and found that it was probably the most boring book I had ever read in my life. Overall the book had a pretty well thought out plot. To me though the book was a classic and masterpiece only when it was first became published. People now in the present are not very easily satisfied with a book with a good plot and are well written. People now are just more interested in books that have a lot of twists and turns in the story. They want be able not know what is going to happen next in the story. The book Great Expectations even though it was such a boring book it did have some very interesting parts. Also the book was overall well written by the author. One strength that the book had was the fact it had such interesting characters. The author had well character development throughout the book. All the characters in the book were described that you tell each character apart because of their personality or physical appearance. The main character Philip Pirrip also nicknamed Pip was very well described as a character. The author told everything possible about Pip so throughout the book you saw the main character grow into man and also grow as person in general. When Pip when through something you almost felt like it was you in the book. Also another strength in the book was the great setting descriptions. It was so good because when you were reading the book you could actually picture the setting in your head. The book had very little strengths because I was forcing myself to actually read it. If it had actually been actually interesting I would have finish the book in one day instead of a three weeks. The only reason that I actually read was the fact I knew had to do a report on it. The book had many faults for a classic book. The main weakness of the book was the chapters that were pointless and just there to take up space. The book seemed was written to just tell a story of boy without any really interesting parts. I was somewhat disappointed in the fact that the book was considered a classic book because a classic book to me is book that can interest anyone and any age. The book had great plot and well-written characters but I thought that the book could have been shorter. It could have been shorter and would still have the same impact on a reader. The reader will eventually find out that the book Great Expectations is just a book to read when you have nothing else to read. Think this book just wasted my time. I hated every minute that I spent reading this book. In scale of one through to ten I would give it a four. The book is fairly good but the book is simply too long to tell a simple and boring story of a boy named Pip. I wouldn't recommend this book because I think that the reader will be truly bored. Probably the main target audience of this book was of young adult. The book is good for that age range because of the somewhat difficult and confusing vocabulary. The book Great Expectations is just a book to be read when there are no more books to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"this book basically bored me to tears, it's one of those books that you really have to be into from the beginning to get the story at all, like harry potter or lord of the rings. main point = if you're not a charles dickens fan, the amazon description doesn't amaze you, and even you've read it before and reallllyyyyy disliked, then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In my opinions, the book is alright, but not the greatest book ever as other people like to say. The writing is beautiful and clever, but I think that the characters and plot are really all pretty stupid and unrealistic, especially Mrs. Havisham; that would never happen and I don't believe it's possible to wear the same clothing without bathing for all those years. The clothing would be torn apart and you would smell horribly. The cake would've been gone, too. And the aged one in Mr. Wemmicks apartment who gets happier the more violently you nod at him?

Dickens' tedious descriptions and constant indecision on how the plot should turn makes the novel lose it's potential merit.Thousands of scholars and other readers have lauded Great Expectations as the finest Dickens' work of all time. The fact remains that it appears Dickens could not decide whether to make this a tragedy or an &quot;all's well that ends well&quot; happy-go-lucky type of story. This is proven by his change of the original ending. However, any reader could give testimony of feeling &quot;yanked, strung along, or thrown about&quot; from page one as they wonder just what Dickens wants them to think about Pip and his less-than remarkable life. Should we sympathize, feel disgust, be concerned? Does he deserve Estella's scorn or is he a victim of circumstance?The more you read of this cryptic novel the more you grow to understand that Dickens doesn't know what his novel is about, either. The entire book seems to vary by the chapter. And the fact that the plot has a potentially good story behind it that Dickens doesn't care to elaborate on makes the entire thing a bit more tedious for the take.The fact remains that Dickens is a fabulous story-teller. He has accurate, unjaded descriptions, refreshing, occassionally bitter, sometimes triumphant plots, and enough suspense to keep you reading throughout the night. It's just that none of that takes place in Great Expectations.Holly Burke, PhD.Clinical Psychologist, Abnormal Psych.

But there are other great stories that Dickens has done such as \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" and I am unsure why this one is always required reading.The story itself is mildly interesting and the characters and dialogue are unrealistic. There were many times that I felt like I was visiting an insane asylum.Dickens is labeled as a classic author, and often that gives reader's pre-conceived notions that his novels must be good.

Don't write me off as a slack-jawed Gen-Xer though, because I've read some pretty heavy stuff (Faulkner, Montaigne, Steinbeck, Salinger, Dumas, Hemingway, Vonnegut, Tolkien) and loved it. I eat up Mark Twain; &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot; was a page-turner for me, and &quot;Huck Finn&quot; is my all-time favorite book. I just don't like Dickens' writing style, which he shares with most other Victorian novelists: unnecessary verbosity, obvious pomposity about the self as a masterful writer. I agree that Dickens is one of the great storytellers of all time, and he may have had the greatest imagination for character development since Shakespeare. But his writing style turns me off."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am currently being forced to read this book for my Honors English class in high school. I've already read it once before for a different class, so I know what I am talking about when I say this book is the ultimate cure for insomnia.I honestly try to appreciate what is *supposed* to be fine literature, but &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is about as entertaining as watching kale grow. First off, the fact that this book has two endings inspires a bit of skepticism in me. I've never heard of an author so indecisive that he would put two endings in a novel. It creates a generally unsatisfying conclusion, as you're at a loss for which ending to &quot;accept&quot;.Aside from which, this book has enough useless passages to fill a hundred pages or so. It seems that, basically, Dickens didn't quite know exactly what to write about, but felt the urge to *write* *something*. So he wrote &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, following the traditional poor-boy formula of his previous 15 or so books.I find it especially hilarious that none of my teachers have ever even read the bloody novel, but it's &quot;good&quot; according to the curriculum. In the words of someone from a certain other Charles Dickens book, &quot;Bah! Humbug!&quot;.Don't judge Dickens by this book, however. &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, for example, even though it follows the same &quot;poor-boy&quot; formula, is worlds better than this.As much as I'd love to say, &quot;Oh, it's a classic, everyone should read it!&quot;, I personally don't think so."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great works of English literature from the 1700s and 1800s shared one thing in common; twists and turns in the plot lines that are never fully exposed until the last lines of the book. Chief among these twists are reversals of fortune both good and bad. So goes this work of literature. Though read by many as children, I would consider it more worthy of young adults, as the text can be quite boring for anyone below their teens. Basically, the plot revolves around Pip, a boy who grows up poor in the care of his sister and apprenticed to a blacksmith; a blue collar job by any standard. But he comes into an inheritance which he gladly accepts, leaving behind his previous life. A second theme of this story is his awe and obsession over Estella, a pretty girl who he meets first when young and poor when she does not even see him, and later one when he is rich when she cannot look past him. This is the probably the part of the book best remembered; a boy infatuated with what he cannot get, only to re-encounter it on later on in life as something he might not want anymore.As a book, it is shorter than most of Dickens' work, and much easier to read. But it has less historical meaning, and to me, less exploration of social ills than his other works such as Oliver Twist and Great Expectations. The book focuses more on personal travails, and how relationships between individuals all depend on the where the individuals came from. The book is interesting enough, but not that exciting, and I would not consider it as a mandatory work for all students to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked this book, I really did, I promise.

That doesn't mean that it will be better in all people's opinions."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens, was a very strong novel. I enjoyed it, but found parts of it confusing and difficult to read. It is a very &quot;deep&quot; novel which has twists and turns throughout. In the begining, Pip was an orphan who went to live with his sister (who was mean) and her husband (who was an OK guy.) Later, he goes to the home of Miss Hauisham. She is a lady who is kind of crazy because of a past situation. Her lover left her years ago. Here is where Pip meets her daughter, Estella, who is very beautiful ( and who was always moody and was spoiled.) Pip falls for Estella (I guess he can put her personality aside.) Later on, Pip becomes wealthy but he can't figure out who left him the money (He thinks it was Miss Hauisham.) It ends up that a man named Able left him the money. When Pip was young, Able asked him for food. Pip got it for him and Able was convicted and he was forced to move away. After he moved he became wealthy and because of Pips heart and help, Able left him a fortune. As for the end... you can read it for your self and find out the suprises. My only complaint is that there are some confusing parts (as I said above.) Overall, I really enjoyed this book and reccommend it for people who like Dicken's work. To be honest, when I first got this book I did not want to read it. I figured I would just rent the movie with Gweneth Paltrow, and base my report on that. It is SO DIFFERENT. The book and the movie are not alike. I decided to read it and so I did. I reccommend this book for people who like Dicken's work. He really did a great job with this one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations must have been what the readers of Dickens' serial publication must have had when they first read it, and I have to wonder if they were as disappointed as I was after slogging all the way through to the skewed, disjointed, and extremely contrived ending. This was written as a serial, not a novel, and I think Dickens (and his readers) would have benefited from a rewrite before publication in novel form.If ever there was a novel that set out to have no meaning, no core, no arc, and most of all, no satisfaction, it must be Great Expectations. The novel's title clearly states Dickens' perspective and intention; that great expectations in life will be met by great (and bitter) disappointment, and the greater the expectation, the greater your disappointment in life will be. The idea that a woman jilted at the altar will spend her life grooming a young girl to make other young men's lives miserable, is a contrived, almost paranoid idea from a male's perspective. Mrs. Havershim's great expectations for life were dashed, because instead of moving on to meet a better man, she chooses to become a shut-in and ruin a young man's expectations for life. However, if it seems that Dickens is building towards some kind of message about not having overblown expectations and then being bitter if they don't work out, the reader is to be disappointed. Dickens goes out of his way not to make this point or any point, but to make a grimly sad tale bereft of any kind of compass or solace for either the characters or the reader.Pip, the protagonist, survives his encounter with the damaged Estella, who had been deliberately damaged by Havershim to be \\"unable to love\\". The ending, in which he encounters her again briefly and is glad she is able to have the heart to \\"understand his heart as it was\\", is unbelievable, pompous and drowning in its own self-pity, all at the same time. It also feels as if Dickens took a perfunctory way to get out of a story that had meandered its way away from him.Great Expectations must be the most disappointing, overblown \\"classic\\" novel I have ever read, not because it doesn't have a happy ending, but because of the way that Dickens has created his characters and shapeless mess of a story, and presented it in the most abrasive fashion possible. I was relieved at the end to have finished it, not satisfied, not sad, and certainly not edified. There is nothing to learn or grow from in this novel; it has made me less of a Dickens fan. And that is the most disappointing result of reading it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm surprised that this book is a requirement in highschool.

Magwitch and Miss Havisham are definitely original and entertaining. But everyone else is pretty bland.Pip's love for Estella is rather pathetic. Why he would love such a despicable person is beyond me. This fact alone makes Pip difficult to relate to, and thus not a very good choice for the point-of-view character.But the one thing that absolutely ruins this book is the clutter of coincidences. One of the first rules of fiction writing is NO COINCIDENCES. And Dickens goes out of his way to break this rule. Over. And Over. And Over.Really, it is not a very good book. Please do not wasted your money on it (although there are a LOT of pages, so it could last you months as toilet paper"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of all the Dickens novels I've read, this one is certainly the most atmospheric and perhaps the most true to life. In terms of art, this is probably his supreme achievement. The plot isn't as convoluted as it is in Bleak House. The action is more dramatic. The female characters, particularly Estella, are more believable and (in the case of Miss Havisham, for instance) more intriguing. The sentimentality and the overall length are under tighter control. The humor still abounds. The language is easier to read but no less descriptive. No, it's not a perfect work -- there are still cloying and annoying characters and incidents, and far too many ridiculous coincidences -- but to me, at least, Great Expectations is Dickens' greatest achievement."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The book \\"The Great Expectations\\" was probably originally intended for middle-class adults in London. Today however the book is read and understood by both children and adults. Some things about the book that made it worth reading was first and most obvious the story line. Also the book seemed to go really fast. The story started with action wich made the book more enjoyable to read. Also it didn't get bogged down very much throughout the entire story. Another good quality of the book is that it didn't contain much romance, which can also slow a good book down. The main point of the book that affection, loyalty, and consience are more important than social advancement, wealth, and class, could have a strong affect on certain communities. Since this sort of theme has been around for a while and will continue to be around for a while gives the book credit for being a classic. Also the fact that this book is fairly old and is still being read to this day makes it a classic. The book was written in great detail. All the characters were fully described and all served a purpose. That also made this book very interesting. I would recommend this book to middle school students, and to adults as well as anyone in between. This book and the main idea was not difficult to understand. Also it is enough of an action and \\"turn around\\" book that it keeps the readers attention even to the end."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens was a very good novel in my eyes. The main character Pip believed, as a true Victorian, that a gentlemen is made solely of financial aspects and physicall possessions, and he is oblivious to moral aspects of the positions. Upon recieving his great expectations, he moves to London for a further education, and to become what he thinks is a gentlemen. Through Pips life he learns that his life as a gentlemen is not what he thought it would be, and his views of a true gentlemen start to change. With thanks to Dickens and Great Expectations, we realize that sometimes even a convict may be more genteel than a traditional gentlemen. He may start as a poor orphan boy, like Pip, or labour as a blacksmith, like Joe. truly, what matters is the heart and inner worth that make a genuine gentlemen, and social prestige has not a bit to do with it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Although one of the first Dickens books that I've read, it is still one of my favourites. The scenes with Miss Haveisham's ghost wedding banquet are haunting and have stuck with me for years. We see how Pip saw this abandoned wedding banquet, and then we follow Pip and his subsequent relationship with Miss Havisham as he grows up. Miss Havisham, for some reason has resolved to take out her considerable vindictiveness on little Pip, and we see how this moulds little Pip's character. We also see the positive effect that a prisoner (Joe Gargery) has on Pip. The tone of this novel is quite gloomy throughout, but it does end on a positive note. Although gloomy, it does have Dickens' usual warmth and humour displayed throughout, and of course his wonderful characters. This is a book that will stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"great expectations is just that. i am not much of a classics fan, preferring contemporary writers. i decided to read this after reading john irving's \\"trying to save piggy sneed, in this book irving finishes with an essay on dickens where he says that great expectations was the book that made him want to write. being a big irving fan, i decided to read great expectations and i have to admit i was blown over by dickens' writing style. the humour, the characterisation, the verbal jugglery, the pompousness, the joy of writing were all apparent and absolute fun. the best thing about the book is that it hasnt aged one bit.dickens writes with rare moral courage and compassion for the failings of his characters, he creates a vividly colourful world populated by extraordinary characters too bizarre to be real, yet makes us trust in them, and slowly makes us sympathise with them and eventually grow to love them. the strength of this book is not in its plot but rather in the style of writing.a thoroughly enjoyable book if you love a colourful writing style."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have to read this book for highschool, and even though I'm not through with it quite yet, I think it's a lot better than I expected. Charles Dickens threw in a few parts that I thought were kind of exciting. In the beginning, you really have to get used to different spellings of words, like &quot;skilful&quot;, for example, but after you get into the book more, you catch on.The main character, Pip, goes from being a boy raised by his sister, to becoming a gentleman. In his journey, he meets several different people, like Ms. Havisham and Estella, for example. There are many different things he must go through before he is told he has an opportunity to become a gentleman. Now I just have to see how it ends!I'd recommend it to people who are older than highschool, just because I think you'd enjoy and understand it a lot more! But if you're a real bookworm, you'd like it. :)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is an extraordinary novel of a young boy's journey to adulthood. We meet Pip as he describes his sister who &quot;raised him by hand.&quot; However, despite his misgivings about his sister he still feels very fondly towards his brother-in-law Joe Gargery. He meets many extraordinary characters along the way one of them being the classic literary figure Miss Havsiham. Miss Havisham had a broken heart and she raised her daughter Estealla to view men the same way she did. As Pip grows up and moves out on his own he becomes the only person to know the true identity of Estella. The other important character in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a criminal. He had threatened Pip in the marshes when he was a young boy and came back from New Zealand many years later to see Pip again. All though the criminal meets his untimely demise we still grow close to the character and miss him when he goes. This book gives an excellent view of not only a young boy's thoughts and emotions but outlook as well. It takes you on a journey that provides you with many lessons that can be carried throughout your life. Despote the magnificence and brilliance of the author's writing it is still a very difficult book. Dickens gives an amazing outlook on life and he deserves the recognition he has gotten, even since his death. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a true classic and deserves to go down in literary history."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Absolutely one of my favorite books ever written... superb, intense and emotional, this books is highly reccommended to anyone who likes literature. Follows the coming of age of Pip, who is realized so fully that the reader cant help but identify with him, and come to feel as if he knows him. Anything by Dickens is bound to be something special, but in my opinion this one takes the cake."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a great story of Pip (Philip Pirrip)'s obsessive love for a woman who neither loves him nor seems in any way the typical heroine. As he strives to become a gentleman, aided by an anonymous benefactor's money, he succeeds only in alienating those who love him best and most honestly. Appearances, as in most Dickens novels, are deceiving, and those who are wealthy in a material sense are not those who are wealthy in the emotional sense and vice versa.The language and sentence structure are both complex; if you have any difficulty in understanding this sort of English you'd do well to wait awhile before reading GREAT EXPECTATIONS, because Dickens' brilliance is in the wording. This is less humorous than many of his other stories; however the humor is there if you look for it and listen for it in the phrasing.Dickens provided two endings for this book, and, frankly, I don't care much for either...but read the book, read both endings, and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a story that only Dickens could tell, and no Hollywood screenwriter can capture the same. Dickens created characters that can not be placed in another time. Pip is a blacksmith apprentince and meets up with a man in a graveyard named Magwitch. He helps Magwitch out and then Magwitch takes the blame and gets sent to Australia to pay for Pip's crime. Pip is then invited to play at Miss Havisham's manor with her ward Estella. And Miss Havisham uses Estella to despise any man. Since Miss Havisham was betrayed by her husband to at the altar by not showing up, she feels it's her life's duty to make all men suffer. So Estella makes Pip feel horrible for his hands and only allows him to get close enough to toil with him. You feel so sorry for Pip and how he is tormented by Estella. All the while he gets money from an unannounced bennefactor that turns his life around. And he moves to London to become a gentlemen. A great story about friendship. Dickens created quite a story that nobody can quite capture the same."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have loved this book since I first read it in high school.

I have also become a great admirer of the work of Frank Muller, who has recorded countless works, both popular novels and classics (including Moby Dick, the brave soul!)When Mr. Muller sank his teeth into Great Expectations, he created a performance with the perfect combination of innocence, humor, irony and adventure. He had me laughing out loud despite being stuck in terrible rush hour traffic.The actor manages to become the characters to the point where you forget only one man is reading all of the parts. He has created convicts you could easily picture, and almost smell. His portrayal of Joe Gargery makes you love the character for his heart of gold. His portrayal of Wemmick's \\"castle\\" and the \\"ancient\\" was so hilarious I was almost in tears.Of course, Dickens had quite a bit to do with it too.I realize there are countless recordings of this great work, and I'm sure this won't be the last I will ever hear. But I will always remember Frank Muller's rendition with great appreciation and a broad smile."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is a novel that will keep you interested all throughout. It follows the interesting story of a boy named Pip throughout his many life experiences and different phases of his expectations. The plot is connected in a unique way throughout the book, and mysteries are solved and connected with it. Through his beautiful writing and interesting plot, this novel is arguably Dickens's greatest work. The language does require your full attention to understand it, and it is a very long book, but the writing is so great that you don't really notice to much.The tone of the novel is pretty dark and gloomy, but there is a constant sense of hope throughout. With themes of social class, guilt and innocence, and ambition we see Pip grow as a person and learn about the struggles and trials in life. There is also a bit of a love story that occurs that puts some fey real emotion into the story.I would reccomend this book to younng adults and adults who have the ability to understand the writing. I would reccomend that a person read it when they are looking for a good book, but have plenty of time to read and really take the story in. You need full attention to read it, but it is well worth the time it takes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After having finished the novel and feeling uncertain as to what was meant by the ambiguous ending, I did some research in some critical journals. Lo and behold, I came to find that the sentence, as published in this edition, is NOT what was supposed to have been written. Doubtless it is a (large) typographical error, but it changed the entire ending of the novel. Shameful to have happened, particularly for a book that markets itself towards classrooms and reading groups.The only good thing that developed from this experience is that through my research I discovered an alternate ending that Dickens had originally intended to use. Reading about the controversy between the two endings was interesting. Aladdin's nonsensical third ending was not. Further, it makes me wonder what else in the story was horribly wrong......Great novel, but don't buy it from Aladdin. I won't be buying anything further from them in the future."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had thought of reading this book many times and am glad I finally gave it a read.

It definitely was tough to get through a few of the chapters, but overall I really liked it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Though this is a decent, affordable edition of Dickens' late masterpiece, any mildly curious reader should buy the Oxford Classics edition instead. The notes in the Oxford Classics edition are much better (more thorough and more informative), and so is the introduction. George Bernard Shaw's introduction to this Modern Library edition is an intelligent piece of criticism, but it's also very partial and shortsighted. There's nothing terribly wrong with the Modern Library edition, but it's not the best one. I have used this for a class I was teaching, but next time I'll be using the Oxford Classics instead (unless something better comes along in the meantime)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a great classic. One of my favorite books by Dickens.A book everyone should read at least once....(though you will probably read it more than once!!!!)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This unabridged audio edition of Dickens' classic superb chronology of \\"Pip's journey through life going from a poor boy to becoming a man with \\"expectations\\" is simply marvelous. As Pip comes into a small fortune, and becomes a \\"gentleman\\" he learns the value and true meaning of friendships and life. But the journey is a long one, with many lessons to be learned along the way before he can find his true self. Dickens has given us a wonderful story, with rich details of the setting and characters that grow and are among the most interesting and magnetic to be found in literature.I don't need to go on and on about the book itself(although I could easily go over my allotted word count here), if you haven't read it yet ,just know you are in for one heck of a literary treat. It is a story that will transport you to another time and place, and you may not want to come back. I will however, talk about this marvelous audio book. Michael Page is the reader, and what a reading he gives. Just curl up and listen to this master storyteller. Every voice, every nuance is captured. There is no doubt who is speaking as he gives each character the personality and cultural characteristics as Dickens intended. He even does the women wonderfully, without going over the top. In my mind Miss Havisham has always sounded just the way Page portrayed her, Estella as uppity as ever,the humble Joe, along with all the rest.If you are a fan of this book, this audio edition will give you a fresh read and new appreciation of this fascinating book. If you are experiencing it for the first time, you can't help but to become enthralled. Great to take on long drives or for younger readers to be introduced to classic literature in a most entertaining way.Enjoy the read...for the 1st Time or the 50th time!....Laurie"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Read this book in high school many years ago and probably did not understand the story fully. Just reread it and I absolutely loved the story. The depth of the characters is amazing. You feel like you have know them all of your life. Much more enjoyable now than at the high school level."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Pip, the main character in Charles Dickens's Great Expectations, writes the story in first person as a middle aged man looking back on his life. Pip's parents die when he is young making him an orphan. Pip is \\"brought up by hand\\" by his sister, who treats him with scorn. His sister's lack of love, however, is tempered by her husband Joe, a blacksmith. Joe is a simple, uneducated man and Pip's only \\"friend\\" during childhood. Pip commiserates with Joe about his sister's verbal thrashings, trying to make the best of his unhappy upbringing.Early in the story, Pip has an encounter with a convict in the cemetery among the marshes near his home. Unbeknownst to him, this man would be the source for his \\"Great Expectations\\" later in life.One day Pip is invited to the home of Ms. Havisham. Ms. Havisham is a single, eccentric, old woman who stopped living in the real world many years earlier when she was spurned by her lover on her wedding day.Ms. Havisham has adopted the beautiful Estella, and from the moment Pip meets her, he is infatuated with her beauty. Estella represents wealth, education, success, and opportunity--things Pip values but thinks he will never have.Dissatisfaction within himself grows as he wants to be more in life than a partner with Joe in the forge. Pip becomes unhappy not only with himself, but also with Joe, who represents what he does not want to be--uneducated and simple. Failing to appreciate Joe's moral character, Pip's world view begins to change as he sees education as something to be attained--the sure way out of his wretched life and the means by which he could woo the object of his unmerited affections, Estella.Pip's life changes dramatically when he is visited by a well respected and fiercely admired lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, who brings him an unusual message. Mr. Jaggers tells Pip he is to receive \\"Great Expectations,\\" but the benefactor is to remain anonymous until and only if they choose to reveal their identity. Pip mistakenly assumes the benefactor is Ms. Havisham, and the manipulating, self serving woman does nothing to dissuade him from his incorrect assumptions.The story takes Pip to London where he lives a life of excess and discards many virtues from his childhood. He no longer wants anything to do with Joe and believes his future course has been immutably set--that he is to marry the beautiful Estella. He shares his indulgences with his new friend, Herbert, whose acquaintance he had made years earlier at Ms. Havisham's place. The two of them rack up excessive debt as Pip sees himself as \\"a man in waiting\\" for all his fortunes to come to pass.Things are not what they seem, however. It is eventually revealed that the benefactor is not Ms. Havisham but the convict, Mr. Magwitch, whom Pip had met in the cemetery many years earlier when he was a young, impressionable boy.Pip is confronted face to face with the despised convict, hounded by the remembrances of him torturing him in the cemetery, dreams that lingered, causing him much consternation. But now he has to accept the undeniable truth that his turn of fortune is not because of Ms. Havisham's provision, but the despicable convict's desire to make him a gentleman. The convict wants his life to be redeemed for something good and chooses Pip to be that vehicle.Through a series of events, Pip acknowledges the inexcusable way he has treated Joe and wants to make amends. Before he can accomplish this, however, other happenings complicate his life. The convict, now in England, needs Pip's protection. Pip must make a way for Magwitch to leave England without being discovered.While Pip hides him with a trusted friend, Pip comes to realize that the convict he had earlier despised has more redemptive qualities than Pip has within himself. As he makes provision for the convict's escape, Pip sees Magwitch change for the better, and in so doing, Pip also changes. Instead of hating the convict, Pip grows to love him. The self centeredness of Pip's indulgences is replaced with care, not only for the convict, but in growing degrees, for others.In the process of trying to escape, the convict is attacked by his long-time archrival and enemy. As a result, Magwitch is severely injured, discovered by the authorities, put on trial and convicted, but dies from his injuries before his death sentence can be carried out. Magwitch's estate is turned over to the authorities to make restitution for past wrongs. Pip is left penniless and obligingly accepts that his Great Expectations and source of income have dissipated into nothing. Meanwhile, Estella marries someone else--a man whom Pip despises.A few years earlier, Pip had secretly made arrangements for his friend Herbert to have a small expectation out of his \\"Great Expectations,\\" amounting to a sizable sum of money. When it becomes known to Pip that he will lose his \\"Great Expectations\\" to the authorities, his only thought is for his friend. Pip returns to visit Ms. Havisham and requests, in a show of repentance for the wrongs she had done to him, a sum of money that Pip could again secretly provide to Herbert.Herbert wisely uses this money to successfully buy into a business venture. He later marries and moves overseas in his business pursuits--none of which would have been possible without Pip's anonymous provision to Herbert.Pip credits this as the only redeeming thing he has accomplished, reflecting on all the other things he did or didn't do that could have been used for good.Pip falls ill following the death of his convict friend, Magwitch, and Joe comes to England to care for him until he is well. Joe surreptitiously leaves early one morning when Pip is sufficiently recovered, and when Pip wakes up, he discovers Joe has paid off all his creditors. Pip immediately returns home in penitence to confess to Joe all his past wrongs, realizing that Joe is a better man than he. He recognizes in his now humble state that his \\"Great Expectations\\" deceived him into using it as a source of pride against Joe.Upon arriving home, Pip's expectations are not what he envisioned. His sister who raised him by hand has long since died as a result of an attack on her by the evil Orlick. His childhood friend and confidant, Biddy, has just married Joe. In the end, redemption works its way for good. Joe and Biddy are happily married and the sore memories of Pip's sister are forgotten.Pip returns to London and within a month, leaves England and joins Herbert's firm, Clarriker and Company, overseas. Pip lives abroad with Herbert and his wife, and after successfully making partner, eleven years later, returns to his boyhood home in England. He discovers Joe and Biddy now have a son who reminds him of himself.Before bidding Joe and Biddy a final farewell, Pip makes one last trip to the Havisham place, the old woman having died many years earlier. Pip discovers Estella in the garden, a chance meeting since she no longer lives there. The old house and brewery have been torn down and sold off except for the garden enclosed by the ivy covered wall.Years of a stormy, failed marriage have softened Estella's vindictive, prideful nature, and she confesses that \\"suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.\\"The reader is left to ponder whether Pip and Estella ever marry because Pip says, \\"I saw no parting from her.\\"In the end, Pip learns much about what matters--wisdom he would not have possessed if he had stayed working at Joe's forge. As a middle aged narrator looking back, there is sadness but sweetness about what he has lost because of what he has gained. Perhaps the reader is the real winner, having seen redemption on so many levels within each character. In the end, if we are honest, we can identify these shortcomings in ourselves. If Pip can work out his \\"Great Expectations\\" to bring redemption, perhaps we can, also--that is, again, if we are honest. Our sinful nature will always be there, but if we look for good, God will not disappoint us. Maybe \\"Great Expectations\\" will not only find us, but redemption will be there, too, just as it was in Pip."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was my first time to read a Dickens book i thought i wouldn't like it but once i got to know all the people and there ways which were very funny ways at times, i really enjoyed the book and couldn't but it down i love the sweet friendship Pip and Herbert have in the story but the best thing was Joe how could you not love Joe in this story!!!! he wasn't the smartest person but he was the best person..!!!,Im not sure which ending i like most but i thought they were both good in there own way.. ;)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This particular book is just the right physical size, as are the type and font, to make it easy to read, unlike any paperback version you are likely to find.To enjoy Dickens is to enjoy his preposterous characterizations, clever and cutting wit, wonderfully complex story lines, and of course his trademark maudlin interludes or devices.The latter make a pretty rich broth making one of his books go a long way. His use of language too causes one to undertake his novels fully prepared to spend time parsing his sentences and consulting a dictionary in order to satisfactorily comprehend his writing.In other words, Dickens can never be read lightly even though, strictly speaking, his work might be considered light reading.'Great Expectations' is particularly worthy of close reading for, whether intentionally or not, it harkens back to 'The Odyssey' by Homer. Yes, that's right, apart from being a truly ripping yarn, the gist of which you can doubtless cull from other amazon reviews, this is a book in which Dickens examines or, more accurately, lays bare the inner workings of the (male?) human psyche.Humans are raised upon a diet of myths of human perfection, a list of which is endless; superhuman athlete, heroic military personnel, idealistic politician, anointed prophet, perfect mother, exalted leader, etc. What Dickens does in this great book is discuss the contradictions that lie within us all that make us heroes one moment and cowards the next; paragons of virtue on the one hand, and unprincipled thieves on the other; selfless benefactors today and greedy self-servers tomorrow.Most of us believe ourselves to be endowed with above average amounts of courage, generosity, and charity, etc. In addition to pointing out such conceits, Dickens proceeds to demonstrate how we maintain these notions while acting in radically contradictory ways to them.This brings me back to Homer's 'Odyssey,' and also to the works of Wm. Shakespeare which are the West's most revered examinations of man's psyche. It strikes one that this book is Dickens' effort, successful and brilliant effort, to do as they have. Granted, the latter's work is sentimental and written to be broadly popular; however, this accessibility in no way can hide the fact that Mr. Dickens addresses fundamental human truths/traits in this book.Based on amazon reviews, this book is evidently assigned to many 9th grade English classes. What a shame, as it is doubtful that such a young person has yet had a broad enough experience of the personal contradictions that allow us to tick. Perhaps Freshman classes would be better served by 'The Great Gatsby,' 'Catcher in the Rye' and similarly glib works, leaving sublime works such as this for later years. (It could be argued that early exposure might arm one against future bad behavior...the point Dickens makes though is that we can't avoid ourselves.)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I cannot fathom how this novel only has a rating of 3 stars. It is an exceptional book that well demonstrates the genius of Charles Dickens. Not only does it have suspense and charm of romance and adventure, but it delivers thematically a look at the hypocracy of wealth in Elizabethan England, and a philosophical perspective on the meaning of happiness. In the end of course there is the climax with every bizarre plot twist imaginable. It is true, this is not necessarily a happy one: Pip gains happiness at the end only by learning by immense misfortune to himself and others, and by having his &quot;expectations&quot; crash down upon him, nearly destroying his future. Yet, this novel is an essential read for anyone, no matter how old or young because it still retains its meaning as freshly today as it did when it was written. It's only unfortunate that it's wasted on all of these people who don't bother to take the time to actually to try and comprehend what they're reading and who have consequently made such poor reviews."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm here referring to the Oxford World's Classics edition, published in 1999. Firstly, I love the book itself. It's compact, the pages have a soft, easy feel to them, and the print is a welcome size: smaller but very readable. A+ here.The characters are particular and animate. Through the use of his famously detailed characterization and description, Dickens creates an elaborate colorful neighborhood of which you feel part. A+ for this escapism and for the sheer pleasure it brings. I especially admire his keen sense of the droll. However, while the tale runs well through the first half or so, as it progresses -- did you find so also? -- it loses the intact sympathies of the reader by trying to connect all the dots that its intricate plot has spun out into. It's forever tying its own shoes. I was similarly disappointment in the final denouement of Estella and Pip, as a let down and overly cerebral. (B-) But I highly recommend this book as a good Dickens novel, and on its own terms, a great one.A very fun read!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations, a book that Dickens ironically considered as one of his \\"little pieces.\\" Though it is small compared to other works by Dickens, what this novel lacks in size it makes up for in quality. Great Expectations succeeds beyond almost all novels of its time in exploring the roots of character and moral behaviour. Charles Dickens makes the case for there being the potential for good and evil within everyone. Evil and sin follow from a combination of being self-absorbed and selfish. What is remarkable about the way these themes are handled is that they are clearly based on an assessment of human psychology, long before that field was established. The book is also remarkable for its many indelibly memorable and complex characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are certainly some of the most complex characters ever created by Dickens.Though a novel founded on philosophic concepts, the story is full of action to keep the plot moving. An escaped convict, an attempted murder, and a mysterious benefactor all add to the sense of mystery that exists throughout most of the novel and forces the reader to continue. Murder, deceit, jealously, and revenge also help to hold the attention of the reader while Dickens explores the depths of human nature.As you read Great Expectations, raise your expectations (sorry, I couldn't help myself) to assume that you will receive answers to any dangling thread. Every detail is important, if not to solve the mysteries of the characters then only to enhance the \\"sense of place.\\" Although the England described here is long gone, it becomes as immediate as a nightmare or a dream that you have just awakened from.This story by Dickens is a must-read and deserves five-stars."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The great English master is at his best in &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; This is a story about loyalty, trust, and, this being Dickens, dark overtones of the human nature. One should not expect something for nothing, that is what this novel makes perfectly clear. Pip, who is the central figure of the novel, a good-natured boy growing up into adulthood, expects to be continously favored by fotrune and his mysterious benefactor who, he thinks, is acting out of the goodness of her heart. Along the way he meets a cast of character who represent the entire range of human nature: devotion, strength, treachery, level-headedness, and brutality.&quot;Great Expectation&quot; is a classic because of its relentless exposure of truth about the human condition--the condition in which decency and sanity are maintained at a high price, and innocence not at all."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I imagine many of the negative ratings are from high school students forced to read the classics, and this book is one of those undisputed classics. Why else would every student I've talked to have had to read this book? Me included.I must confess I didn't like it in high school. Dickens does have a way of writing elegant sentences conjoined by semicolons. A great editor would have told him frequent use of periods is acceptable.However, eight years later, while frustrated at my illiteracy in Japan, I was starved for great literature in English. I had gone through a couple of contemporary literature that always left me vaguely dissatisfied. I started reading my favorite author Jane Austen again, and picked up Great Expectations on a whim. What a difference those eight years made!!No one can touch Dickens ability to evoke an atmosphere. I felt I was right there with Pip in the foggy marshes, shivering before a menacing Magwitch. Or sitting around the fire of a small but cozy house while Joe was smoking his pipe and passing along nuggets of his own brand of wisdom. Or creeped out in Mrs. Havisham's mausoleum of a mansion.In addition, the dialogue is so authentic you feel as if you're eavesdropping on people's conversations. Joe's working class speech, Mrs. Havisham's upper class diction, the lawyer's dry speech all ring so true.Ultimately, the story itself is so carefully constructed, even after countless rereadings, the clues in this mystery of who Pip's benefactor is are barely perceptible. And Dickens' themes of human pride, ultimate humility, willfulness of character that only later realizes the consequences, and the six degrees of separation are priceless. Dickens' championing of the working class pervades all his books, but in this one his affection for the working man is more personal. You really can't help but love Joe and his bungling dignity.Yes, Dickens can border on the excessively dramatic. But most of the time this drama works to pull you into a touching tale."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Having seen the many reviews written by students, I must say that I would agree. In fact, they sounded like they could have almost been my students from the past. Overall, GE is well liked, but the major complaint most have is that the story line is too slow-developing. I think this is a fair assessment. Of course, this was the style chosen by Dickens since this book was compiled from serial form. How many people would claim that we ought to take a week's worth of a soap opera program and turn it into a movie? I doubt such a production would attract much attention. In the same way, a serial writer's objective was to build mini-climaxes throughout the book, twisting and turning to get the audience to scream with anticipation, so that the next segment would sell. From what I understand, Americans could hardly wait for the shipments to get off the ships. They would purchase the newest segment and immediately dig in!If you are a teacher, I highly recommend showing the 4-hour movie starring Anthony Hopkins (produced in the late 1980s, I believe). It is the best and most accurate of all the GE movies. This works really well in conjunction with the book, and it truly helps in the interest level for those students who are not as motivated as &quot;the readers.&quot; So go ahead and find out about the adventures of squeezable Pip, lovable Joe, the mysterious Miss Havisham, sweet Biddy, snooty Estella, and of course the mysterious Magwitch. I think you will be as surprised as I was when I first read it.

I must admit that it is a tad wordy and the details are overwhelming, but that just adds character to the book. My favorite characters were Estella, Biddy, and of course, Pip. Many poeple my age (I am 15) have said that this book was a long and boring ramble. I thought it to be exciting and very funny. I especially enjoy the part where Joe visits Pip in London and he has no place to put his hat, so he puts it on the mantle. During their meal, Joe's hat keeps falling, and Joe keeps picking it up. Finally, Pip gets so annoyed, he throws the hat across the room!

Or I'll eat your heart and liver too..&quot; Out of kindness in heart, Pip &quot;befriends&quot; the convict as his fate is changed forever. Little does he know how his whole existence is to complete the life of another--a stooping savior.Though of little social significance, Pip lives a content life full of innocent happiness and simple joys. As his horizon suddenly expands with an unexpected fortune, Pip finds his own path crossed with the paths of a misanthropic Miss Havisham and her young, beautiful, yet seductive ward Estella. Extravagance feeds Pip's vanity to burgeon, desire flourishes his motives of becoming some one he can never become. Pip strives desperately to extricate from the deepest root of his whole being. And the obsession grows for Estella as he wanders of further away from his true path.Followed by the death of Magwitch, love once again awakes within Pip as he embraces the man hidden in the darkest corner of his soul. No longer the dashing young man in his blooming age, Pip at last starts a expedition to pursue something that is conquerable.Thus we see &quot;no shadow of another parting from her&quot;..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think this book is so good, it doesn't need to be explained.

AS an adult though one can appreciate it more because we choose to read the book instead of it being an assignment that needs to be completed for school."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is Charles Dickens classic novels that portrays the story of Pip, born into a destitute and poor family, with little hope for a bright future. We would expect someone born into his social class to remain in this position forever, without much hope for improvements. However, Pip surprises us when he has a chance encounter with Miss Havisham, an old, grumpy, widow. She's obviously delirous, upset at men who have crossed her, and does take out some of her anger at poor Pip. But yet Pip is lucky behind his wildest dreams, for he is about to meet the beautiful Estella, and while this may appear normal, it is definitely not. And this is what makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a classic: the book is about Cinderella from reverse: it is the man, in this particular instance, who moves from working-class peasant to meeting an upper-class elegant lady who is beautiful beyong Pip's dreams.It is an aspiring tale in that it tells the reader that they, too, may be able to have widespread class mobility. They are not stuck in their present circumstances and may indeed exceed their own expectations.-- Michael GordonLos Angeles"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all, I too am a student forced to read this book for a Freshman Honors English class, and I fail to see how many people can call this book a waste of time. Sure, I know the language is a bit of a challenge, but that's what a dictionary is for!Anyway, I haven't yet finished the book (I still have a long way to go,) for I'm only on chapter 13, but I had to chime in and counterattack what all of the rest of the whiney students have said. So far, the way Dickens portrays his characters (by means of language, description, and dialogue) seems ultimately realistic (it should be, considering it was written in the 1830's) and there are many things throughout the book one has to come to love: Pip's almighty guilty conscience, the friendship bond between Pip and Joe, etc.I can't sum up everything, for as I've said, I'm not finished yet, but for those of you who are being forced to read it, read it with an open mind.

Nicholas Nickleby is next for me..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Certainly one of the most famous of Dickens's novels (right up there withOliver Twist (Penguin Classics)andDavid Copperfield (Penguin Classics)), Great Expectations follows a familiar coming-of-age narrative as young Phillip Pirrip - better known as \\"Pip\\" - negotiates the rocky road to adulthood in early 19th century London. One of only two of Dickens's novels that are written in first person narrative (the other being David Copperfield), Great Expectations is a fascinating tale of ambition, love, regret, missed chances and redemption, topped off with an adequately ambiguous ending (more on that later).Raised by his tyrannical sister and her kind, doting husband Joe, Pip is contented enough to become a blacksmith and live out his life by the misty Kent marshlands. That is until he is unexpectedly thrown into the path of two extraordinary people. The first is a convict, escaped from the prison barges offshore, a terrifying man who coerces the young Pip into stealing him some supplies from his sister's larder. Stricken by guilt and terror, Pip complies. The second is the mysterious Miss Havisham, a spinster woman who employs Pip as a playmate for her young ward, the beautiful Estella. Estella is regal, snobbish and cold - naturally, Pip falls head over heels in love with her, despite the realization that she's far beyond his status. Wretchedly aware of his own shortcomings, Pip yearns for a chance to make a gentleman of himself, and win the hand of fair Estella.And then, just as unexpectedly, fortune is thrown his way. He is informed by Miss Havisham's lawyer that a secret benefactor has endowed him with great expectations, and that he is to travel to London in order to prepare for his future. The only catch is that Pip is forbidden from investigating the origins of his newfound fortune, although logic dictates that it must be Miss Havisham, who surely has designs for both Pip and Estella. Locked up in a house full of bitter memories after she was jilted by her lover, Miss Havisham is certainly one of Dickens's most famous creations, with her own disturbing brand of revenge against mankind: to unleash her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Estella out upon the world, to break hearts wherever she goes.Dickens has created a twisty and labyrinthine plot, with plenty of intrigue and adventure throughout, as familial bonds, secret alliances and loyalty among friends and work colleges are tried and tested. In typical Dickensian style, there are several extraordinary coincidences concerning shrouded parentage and wayward meetings, but everything hangs so well together that it's instantly forgivable. \\"Great Expectations\\" is Dickens at his best in terms of plotting and characterization; though there is a melancholy twinge throughout that no doubt stems from Dickens's personal trouble (he had recently divorced his wife, and has carrying on a stress-filled love affair with a young actress). As such, romanticized domestic bliss that so often concludes a Dickens's novel (reflective of Dickens's own longing for such a state) is completely absent here. The domestic angel-woman that is given so many names and forms throughout the canon of Dickens novels (here called Biddy, though she is virtually identical to dozens of other Dickens heroines) comes to a surprising end in \\"Great Expectations\\", as does Pip himself.Pip himself is certainly an interesting character; in that he is woefully aware of his own shortcomings, yet unable drop certain attitudes that make him miserable. After becoming accustomed to the life at Miss Havisham's manor house, he is frustrated to find that he now holds his beloved brother-in-law Joe in contempt, embarrassed at his low breeding and lack of gentlemanly manners (despite the fact that Joe was always his staunch ally against Pip's terrible sister, and the epitome of the virtuous commoner). Likewise is Pip's self acknowledgment that his love for Estella never brings him any happiness, only pain and longing. The fact that Pip is narrating his own story from a point in time *beyond* the proceedings mean that we are never overly critical of Pip, considering he is his own harshest critic when relating his behaviour - and it certainly makes you consider your own shortcomings.This is not to say that the whole story is woe and misery, as there are plenty of comedic characters that help lighten the mood, such as Pip's best friend Herbert Pocket, who (at their first meeting) challenges him to a fight, and Mr Wemmick, who survives his job by assuming two personalities: a grim and dour one during working hours, and a cheerful one when he returns home. There are several moments of humour in Pip himself, (though they are usually tempered by a sense of disappointment or miscommunication) such as his misreading of his parent's gravestone, or his excitement in reaching London gradually dissipating when he realizes that...well, that it's a bit of a hole.Last of all, there has already been several mentions in other reviewers about the fact that there are two endings to this novel; the first was considered too melancholy by Dickens's publishers, and so was revised (although to be fair, Dickens's himself didn't seem to put up too much of a fight, suggesting that he himself was divided on the issue). The published ending is still ambiguous, yet with room for hope (at least in the mind of Pip) as to the future with Estella. Now, most agree that the original ending is more powerful, and I have to agree. However, I do issue a warning *not* to read both endings in the same sitting. In my edition the original ending was added in an appendix directly after the conclusion to the book, and because it is so drastically different to the published ending, it disrupted my appreciation of the novel. I was left in two minds as to what truly happened. So if you're a serious reader, do yourself a favour and decide what ending you want to go with *before* you finish the book. It may be a tricky business, but it'll enhance your enjoyment of one of Dickens's best novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens' ability to turn a beautiful phrase is done complete justice by Michael Page. He delivers all that Dickens intends for you to find in Great Expectations, as though he was Pip's shadow for those many years described in the story. This CD set is worth listening to; I looked for chances to get in the car and continue the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When his magazine, All the Year Round, began failing due to an unpopular serial, Dickens was forced to begin publishing installments of a story of his own. The resulting work, Great Expectations, was published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861. This was his second semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to happiness. In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years. Indeed he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words. Despite, or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;. When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before being carted back to prison.Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward Estella. Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding gown. Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman. Pip assumes, and Havisham allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will make him worthy of Estella.As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing up. He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber. So he is stunned when he discovers that he is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I listened to the unabridged audio tape version of this book narrated by Michael Page. It's one of those deals where you listen to each tape entirely on the left channel, then play the whole tape again on the right channel to get the next part of the story. Which is kind of awkward, since you forget which channel you were on if you also use your stereo for music; but these editions are probably the least expensive (by the hour) audio tapes you can buy.I think Dickens' tendency toward exhaustive descriptions works a lot better when you're listening to it in the car than when you're reading it in print. I might never have had the patience to read the actual book while sitting in a chair, but listening to it in the car was pretty entertaining. Colorful characters, humor, suspense, unexpected plot twists; I can picture a lot of it in my mind even now.

This edition has the 1986 introduction by John Irving. It contains the Dickens classic in its intact form, with the original ending following it separately. It is 528 pages.When Dickens first wrote Great Expectations, it had a different ending. There are some who feel that the original ending is more in line with modern tastes, and that Dickens \\"caved in\\" by changing the unhappy ending to one that was \\"more acceptable.\\" Some feel that Dickens went too far in order to cater to his audience rather than stick to a literary standard. In the introduction, Irving discusses this issue among many others and suggests that Dickens was not so much driven by the audience as he was in touch with their lives when it came to inspiration. Ideas in literature may seem fantastic and improbable, but Irving points to events in Dickens's life that would seem equally improbable had they appeared in fiction. He also mentions modern real life events that, if put in a novel a decade earlier, would have seemed impossibly unrealistic.Yes, Dickens was an optimist. But the new ending is not a \\"happily ever after\\" one so much as one that leaves the door open. I can't think of anything more suitable for a book entitled \\"Great Expectations.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have now listened to three of the five available Dickens' readings from Martin Jarvis and, whilst there are other fine readers out there (e.g. Robert Whitfield for Blackstone Audio Books and Patrick Tull for Recorded Books), I truly don't think there is a finer performer in this particular market.As Great Expectations unfolds through a vast range of character voices, Mr Jarvis' obvious empathy with the text makes this an effortless yet utterly engaging way for the listener to experience the genius of Dickens, whilst Amazon's price makes this item an absolute bargin.I cannot recommend Great Expectations read by Martin Jarvis highly enough..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Over the last few years, every other book I've read has been Dickens. This is, so far, my favorite. It is an absolutely brilliantly woven tale.

If you are new to Dickens, this would be a great place to start."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"&quot;Great Expectaitons&quot; deserves to be called great. While not as emotionally satisfying as the earlier &quot;David Coppefield,&quot; it is nevertheless tighter, more compact, and displays a greater maturity and discipline of writing style on Dickens' part. Those who feel 'Copperfield' has all the characters, take note of the ensemble here-- Pip, Joe Gargery, Biddy, Mr. Jaggers, Uncle Pumblechook, Abel Magwitch, Estella, and the novel's haunting, living spectral figure, Miss Havisham. The intertwining of these lives, the playing out of these destinies, combined with its memorably Gothic beginning and unsettling ambiguous ending make &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a pleasure to read for both its narrative power and literary craftsmanship. Considered by many to be Dickens' &quot;best rounded&quot; story, I concur by offering this example. Having finished the novel, I craved a viewing of David Lean's brilliant 1947 film. I ended up by mistake with the Ethan Hawke Gwyneth Paltrow 1998 remake. I decided to give it a try, and was so enraptured by the look of the film and its grasp of the material I stayed with it. Not as satisfying as Lean's film, to be sure, but it works.

In classical Dickens style, Chuck makes a good social commentary or stirs some good emotions, yet does it way too slowly.

Dickens is accused of being &quot;wordy,&quot; and I see why: British authors were often paid by the word and length of their novels and short stories.

It is the story of what each of us would probably do if placed in the situations Pip deals with. There are love, friendship, and warmth, which are nearly destroyed by obsession, discontent, and the desire to keep up appearances during the course of this powerful novel. These seemingly necessary emotions and acts of something near betrayal are finally exposed as cheap and worthless when the hero's true benefactor is known in the end.

The story moves so slowly that at times you'd swear it wasn't moving at all, and, to be sure, at times, it isn't!

I usually fly through novels within a few days, but getting through this one is likened to going through a maze in the dark. I give it two stars because I do think the plot was interesting, but the execution was abominably horrible. I actually had to have a dictionary next to me in order to understand all the weird words Dickens used, words such as 'peppercorny' and 'farinaceous.' Now, I usually pride myself on having quite an excellent English vocabulary, but I felt utterly lost when trying to read this book. Some of the dialogue was completely unfathomable and pointless, and about a quarter of the time I did not have a clue as to what he were talking about. Many of the characters were annoying, Mr. Pumblechook for example. I cringed during the chapter when he saw Pip, after Pip had become a gentleman, and the stupid man kept saying \\"May I? May I?\\" Ugh. There was so much this book could have done with out; the endless pointless descriptions, the useless minor characters, and the stupidity of some of them was unbearable. What I mean by that is Miss Havisham's voluntary reclusive existence; I mean, how can somebody live like that without going completely insane, just sitting in the dark day after day, wearing the same clothes, and throwing her life away for a man who was only after her money? Stupid and lame that was, if mildly noble (her behavior). I cannot understand why Dickens is so praised as a writer. His plot may be good in this book, but it is terribly written. I have made two attempts in my life to read this book. The first time, I got about halfway through and had to stop because it was about as enjoyable as plucking my eyebrows. A few years later, the second attempt got me to about the 42nd chapter, but again, my interest fizzled out. I do not think I will ever finish this book, and would only advise reading it if you have trouble sleeping, because it will knock you out fast. As a final note, I could not get through Oliver Twist either. Again, a great plot, but poorly written."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Reading GREAT EXPECTATIONS as a 14 year old high school student in 1967 helped me acquire a clearer understanding of the concept of infinity.

This story will make you smile, cry, dream, feel betrayed, and laugh very hard. Charles Dickens make the reader see his character for who they really are through there eccentric action and responses. Read it. These is a classic and my favorite Dicken's novel. Fall in love with and his often misguided heart."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's ridiculous to review Dickens, who is as secure in the Western canon as Shakespeare. Nonetheless, I'll make two points about \\"Great Expectations\\", which is the first Dickens novel I've read since my adolescence. (Kennedy was President, alas.)First, I'll say that the characters in this book are affecting exaggerations and not quite real. For example, Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, is touching in his decency and saintly in his generosity. But Dickens gives him no rough emotional edges, and so he never rises beyond rustic sentimentality. Likewise, Hebert Pocket, Pip's friend, is a lovely young man but exists in friendship with out making any demands. And, there is the resolute and controlling Mrs. Havisham and her pathetic martyrdom. Yes, she was hurt by a man. But, it's hard to imagine a person living in the filth and disorder of her mansion, unless she is crazed, like a modern street person. To sum this up, I'd say that his characters are not really persuasive, even though they resonate emotionally.Second, I was surprised by the near total lack of visual effects in the writing. Early on, there's a moment of visual writing when young Pip is in the cemetery. But thereafter, this element is all but lacking in the book. Even after several re-readings, for example, I could never quite see Magwitch tumble into the river.Regardless, I enjoyed the read and did not find it discursive or too long. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked this book even though sometimes I couldn't understand it. Charles Dickens used a lot of words he didn't need to, and he used a lot of big words that needed to be looked up. There was a lot of parts that I did not understand. Otherwise it was a pretty good story when I knew what was going on. I would recommend this book to other people because you learn about the lifestyles back then."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel was pretty good. I liked how everyone's lives in it were somehow connected. I also liked how Pip matures and learns the big lessons of life.One thing I didn't really like about it was that it was hard to understand. The English dialect was hard to follow, all the different names were hard to sort out, and there were manyold-time-ish and confusing words. But other than the confusion, the story line was great and Dickens wrote it really well and brought everything and everyone in the book together nicely. All of the characters were fun to read about and Dickens made them seem interesting and some very weird. I would recommend this book to anyone because it seems like anyone could connect with the characters in this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book seems interesting as you would expect from Dickens, but I must admit that i found it boring. I only got past the first chapter, and found my self asleep. I think that the plot is a good structure that could be updated very well. If you can get past the boring language you will definitely enjoy it. If you went in with 'great expectations',then i doubt that you will come out with great pleasure. if you are put off by this review, hten check out the 1930's version starring the late Alec Guiness- it's absolutely brilliant!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was assigned to read this book for my English class and I have never read a more stupendously boring book.It's almost 500 pages long and has a story that could be told in half that.A poor, young orphan has aspirations to one day be a respectable gentleman.Big deal.

This is the worst, yet! I don't understand why students have to read classics that people rarely understand! I thought the book was pointless with nothing to look forward to while you're reading. Many books have a strong structure and basis where you want to know what will happen next, which keeps you reading on. This story has no meaning and Charles Dickens is going no where with this. Not to mention the characters are just plaing weird. Where in the world did Dickens get a bizarre lady like Miss Havisham, who is practically ill in the head? I would never recommend this book because it was boring, time consuming, and I can rarely consentrate on what I was reading. I'm glad I got over reading this. I'm sure the only people who read this book is the ones who are forced to, like myself. If I can give this book's rating as a no star, I would.

The fool author made it up as he went along not caring if it made sense or if the characters had any meaning. I hate this novel with a passion so great it scares even me. I'd like to see all copies burned. Okay, not really. That's a little extreme. But, at least take this garbage out of school curriculums. Its' making us stupid, making us believe Pip's world is what the world really is. Pip if a fool that got dumped too many times and where's the sex. Was Dickens scared of it. I believe that all great novels should have sex in them. It brings some humanity to them . Great Expectations is a fantasy on level with the Bible but worse, tragicly worse."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was a mediocre book. I was not impressed. I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! If you want to read a good Dickens story, read \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I didn't enjoy this book in high school back in 2000. I am re-reading this book again after 12 years.What an amazing gift we have inherited from Charles Dickens. I am enjoying revisiting the Victorian society again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was compelled to read Dickens (\\"A Tale of Two Cities,\\" in my case) in eighth grade and decided that I didn't like his writing. I managed to avoid Dickens and the Victorian novelists for several years, even as an English major. It wasn't until I was in my mid-20s that I read \\"Great Expectations,\\" and I'm glad that was so, because I was finally ready to appreciate Dickens. If you've ever picked up a Dickens novel and put it back down with relief, you might try again in a few years. If you do, \\"Great Expectations\\" is an excellent choice for meeting, or for encountering again, this amazing author.Like \\"David Copperfield,\\" this novel is written throughout in the first person, and follows the title character from childhood to adulthood. The first-person point of view gives the story vividness and impact, as we see everything that unfolds through Pip's eyes. The difference between the perspective of Pip the boy and Pip the adult, looking back and writing, colors the plot and creates suspense.There are many possible reasons to read this book (other than having it assigned to you, of course).You could read it for its astonishing characters -- Miss Havisham, defiantly moldering away and shut up in her never-used wedding finery; Magwitch, the escaped convict with a backstory you'd never expect; Joe Gargery, the blacksmith whose external roughness is matched only by his inner tenderness; Estella, as self-divided and self-destructive as she is beautiful. You could read it for its settings -- the spooky marshes, the busy streets of London, the gothic horrors of Satis House. You could read it for the plot -- the hidden connections, unexpected reversals, and ambiguous endings. You could read it for its social criticism -- the comprehensive view of working-class, middle-class, and upwardly-aspriring characters; the insight into what people will do to themselves and others for money; the unsparing look at ideas of gentility versus actual nobility of character. You could read it for its language -- the idiosyncratic dialects, the indelible scenes, the variety of prose rhythms Dickens employs.In the end, there are two main reasons to read this novel: pleasure and wisdom. \\"Great Expectations\\" is of its time without being dated, and can be enjoyed as a satisfying story. The themes Dickens addresses are timeless, and speak to the 21st century as forcefully as they spoke to the 19th.This isn't my all time favorite Dickens novel -- that would be \\"Bleak House,\\" followed by \\"David Copperfield\\" -- but it's one of his best. If you've never tried it, or if it's been a while since you did, give it a try. You may well become a Dickens addict."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The DK series of classics are great!

I loved the book then, and I love the book now. It is easily one of the best books that Dickens' has written and well worth the read for everyone.

Charles Dickens is one of my favorite authors of all time next to Sparks, Crichton, Irving, Brewer, and Bradbury. The story follows the inheritance into wealth of a fourteen year-old in 18th century England. Told with detail, finesse and a mystery that will keep you hooked, don't miss out on this first rate literary experience.The young orphaned Pip, the sensual Estella: the boy's love interest, the enigmatic and vengeful Miss Havisham in her bridal wear. These are images you will never forget. Pick up a copy (unabridged if you can) and loose yourself in this carefully and masterfully wroght world.I also recommend John Irving's works, mainstream fiction, and Dandilion Wine by Ray Bradbury. Also look for the edition with the forward by Irving and the original ending.Check them out and buy while prices are cheap!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations read by Michael Page, unabridged on 16 audio CDs, was a great listening experience. I've had my copy of the book on the shelf for years, but never got around to reading it. Unfortunately, I spend more time driving than reading. Michael Page did a fine job reading all the roles with distinctive voices for each character, male and female. The total listening time was about 20 hours. There were many tracks on each CD. So if your CD player only remembers which track was playing when you stopped it, then probably the most you will have to repeat when you re-start the disk would be about 40 seconds. The recording quality was good, but the duplication process less than perfect. There was 1 disk out of the 16 that had some \\"popping\\" sounds. I do not know if every copy of the audio book will have 1 disk with some static, but my copy did. It was a little annoying, but was not too bad. The audio book was produced by Brilliance Audio of Grand Haven, Michigan. The bio on the box says that Michael Page is a Professor of Theater at Calvin College. I was impressed and entertained by his reading. He did sound British!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\`Great Expectations' is one of my favourite Charles Dickens', second only to A Tale of Two Cities. Those who are not habituated to his style of writing may find it a bit difficult, but eventually that hurdle too would be overcome and the reader can enjoy the work of one of the finest authors of all time to its fullest.Phillip Pirrip was an orphan living with his dominating elder sister with no great ambition for the future, other than to become a blacksmith like his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery. But that was before he inherited a large amount of money from a mysterious benefactor. Now, leaving behind his shallow ambitions and old acquaintances, Pip follows his dream of becoming a \`gentleman'. Then maybe the beautiful but cold-hearted, Estella, the ward of the eccentric Miss Havisham, would accept his love for her. But will the unsolved mysteries of his past hinder him from fulfilling his \`Great Expectations'?Though Great Expectations first appeared in Dickens' weekly magazine, All the Year Round, more than a century back the story and the characters of the book still live on. Like all other books by Charles Dickens \`Great Expectations' too, does not just tell a story but also gives a message to its readers. Pip after coming into his inheritance starts ignoring his old friends because he feels that they are inferior to him, little realizing that they were the ones who loved and cared for him when he had no money. This situation is not something unique or something that can be related to only by the people of that time. This happens with almost every one of us. Once we achieve our goals we conveniently forget about those who helped us reach that goal. The way Dickens' has woven this message in his unforgettable story makes the book all the more beautiful. One thing I liked about this book is how all the seemingly unconnected characters seemed to fit together like the missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle by the end. What makes this book truly unforgettable is its characters. Every character of the book has an eccentric side to them. The only character that I think is \\"normal\\" is Pip and I did not find him interesting at all (I like eccentric characters. Am I weird?). Maybe that's how the author wanted it to be. Though the book has only a few female leads, they are the ones who steal the limelight. The eccentric Miss Havisham who sits in a room with a rotting wedding cake, wearing her wedding dress seemed more alluring to me than any of the other characters. It was her eccentricity that truly attracted me to her. If she had been some old, moody spinster, I would not have liked her half as much.Though I have repeated the point more than once, but \`Great Expectations' is truly an unforgettable book. Combined with prolific writing and memorable characters, this book is something which should be read at least once by all.Favourite Quotes:\\"Suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but - I hope - into a better shape\\"\\"Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was better after I had cried, than before--more sorry, more aware of my own ingratitude, more gentle\\"\\"There either is or is not, that's the way things are. The colour of the day.

I'm not going to tell you the story the way it happened. I'm going to tell it the way I remember it.\\"Overall:Beautiful and one of its kindRecommended?Yes, to everyone.

I can honestly say I hated it! I found it weird and difficult. I am now 55 and decided it was time to check out Charles Dickens and find out what all the fuss was about. Having completed two of his greatest novels, Great Expectations and David Copperfield, I am a Dicken's fan for life! As an author, I realize how much I have missed. I love the old-english style of writing, the great history of Britain, and the downhome stories of boys, which seems to be Mr. Dicken's love. I am sadly impressed of the mistreatment of children of that era and am surprised that any were able to rise to achievement. What was true then, is true now - if we are to achieve anything in life - no matter our past, we must pull ourselves up by the boostraps and become... Excellent read. I enjoyed watching Pip come full circle from a poor boy to wealth to realizing a simple, honest life is to be desired.

Not me. Granted, part of the reason I enjoyed this book so much was because I had expected it not to be (A Tale of Two Cities is still collecting dust on my bookshelf). The writing is flawless; characters, wonderfully varied; and plot, save an occasional feeling of contrivance at the almost uncanny character interconnections, spectacular.Pip, an orphan, lives with his 20 plus years older sister Georgiana \\"Mrs. Joe\\" Gargery, an unhappy woman who \\"rampages\\" on him and her blacksmith husband Joe, a simple, kind man. During an unexpected encounter with a shackled escaped convict, he is coerced into helping the man to prevent bodily injury to himself. It's not the last the boy will see of him. Pip is later asked to visit an eccentric woman (having been left at the altar by a scheming fianc&eacute;), where he encounters the beautiful but cold Estella, a future love interest, and several other central characters. Eventually an anonymous donor provides monetary help to Pip hoping that it will facilitate his becoming a gentleman and a scholar. But as his financial situation changes from meager but adequate to one of relative wealth, his personality transforms from kindhearted and unpretentious to inconsiderate and snobbish. Only through the adversity that follows his attempt to fulfill the expectations of his benefactor does Pip learn some important life lessons.Also good, Mr. Pip by Lloyd Jones (wish I hadn't read it before GE), An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser, and The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When I was a teenager, I loved Dickens. In later years, however, I abandoned Dickens for more overtly \\"intellectual\\" authors. The wonderful thing about great books is that they do not suffer from multiple readings. Returning to Great Expectations after maybe 20 years was a delight. It is simple, accessible, gently humorous and heartbreaking. Dickens' love of language is simply a joy to experience. The novel is beautiful, effusive and yet tinged with Pip's own discomfort of class and self. Dickens holds his own as the Master Storyteller of the 19th Century."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"All the standard Dickensian motifs are present in this book: deus ex machinae, factitious coincidences, longueurs, inventive names, an empathy towards children in a world of pompous adults, and sheer expository brilliance.Dickens paints a picture in your mind...you see the country, smell the air, and hear the voices of the characters as if they are actually speaking. This being Dickens, you must allow for some patness in the plot...grant that, and then you can enjoy the genius of his phrases, metaphors, characterizations, and recounting of the absurd.(Wopsle's go at Hamlet in London should have you laughing out loud.)This is an excellent book...a classic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A dark night. A pair of escaped convicts; a young boy named Pip who is seven years old. Pip helps the convict Magwitch with food and drink. Magwitch is sent in chains to banishment in distant Australia. Pip living at the forge of Joe Gargery and Pip's sister (Joe's wife) becomes an apprentice blacksmith. Pip also meets the enigmatic Miss Havisham who dresses in a yellow wedding dress lamenting her lost love. At Satis her estate he encounter Estella (star) who becomes the love of his life. Estella is as cold as an Eskimo and her heart as icy as Mt. Everest. He also meets Herbert Pocket who becomes his best friend.In part two we see Pip moving to London as he and Herbert become dissolute, fall into debt and live shallow lives.In part three secrets are revealed which make Pip a good man. We learn that it was the convict Magwitch who provided the funds needed to allow Pip to go to London and work for Mr. Jaggers the lawyer. We discover who is the father and who the mother of Estella. We learn what happened to Magwitch and all other mysteries are revealed. To give these secrets away in this review would ruin the pleasure of reading this classic novel.Great Expectations is a bildungsroman which is darker and more inttrospective that Dickens earlier David Copperfield of 1850. In it we see Pip grow from a selfish callow boy to a man who has suffered, helped others and been reunited with his lost love.Along the way we meet such immortal characters as Joe Gargery and his loving wife Biddy; the tragic Miss Haversham; the evil Orlick and Compeyson and the complex convict Magwith.The novel is cinematic in its ending as Magwitch returns to England to see how Pip is doing as a young man who has lived on the convicts benevolent financial bequest.Some critics believe that Estella is a representative of Dickens mistress Ellen Ternan. The novel is well plotted and moves quicker than many Dickens novels. This 1861 novel is narrated in the first person by Pip and was the last completed novel in the prolific Boz's illustrious career.Great Expectations should be read by everyone who loves English literature and Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a wonderful story that Everyman's Library has place in great binding."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"If you have a student who either hates to read or struggles to read I would highly recommend this audio book.

Were I able to, I would give the book four and a half stars, rather than the four I've assigned it. As other reviewers have already amply commented on the book's numerous merits, I should like only to point out , what I thought to be, its foremost shortcoming. Although intentional by Dickens, I found my extreme dislike of Pip for much of the book to be a nuisance, chiefly because, as narrator, Pip set the tone of the narrative. It can be difficult not to equate the loathing of the narrator with the book itself. Luckily enough this was not a particularly prominent failing, and did not heavily tax me. Besides this, I found the book to be splendid, particularly during the bits concerning Joe and Mr. Wemmick, who were, at times, heartwarming and emotionally evocative to an extreme degree. In short, Great Expectations is one of Dickens's greats, with only minor, easily overlooked flaws."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It is impossible to exaggerate the satisfaction this book gives to its reader and the power of its deep human sympathy. If you were to read only ten books in your lifetime, Charles Dickens' GREAT EXPECTATIONS should be one of them.If you were to listen to just one audiobook in your life, Frank Muller's narration of Great Expectations should be it. One of the most complimentary things that can be said of such a performance is that it leaves you feeling that the work can be read only in that way. Muller accomplishes this, with the curious and endearing twist that Pip's own narration comes with an American accent, while all others speak in the unforgettable idiom of their place among the English classes and subclasses. Muller on Dickens is a triumph that even Dickens would have applauded.Now, for the book. The personae will stay with you forever. Pip himself. The deeply generous Joe Gargery. The immortally beautiful Estella, her heart in the end made soft through suffering. Miss Havisham, too terrible to believed but in the end redeemed from her lake of bitterness, if her cry, 'What have I done?!' is to be taken innocently. Wemmick and the Aged P, then - belatedly, Miss Skiffens the gloved. Herbert, then Herbert and Clara.Jaggers, about whom one is left to ponder, 'Who *is* this man?'Dickens and Muller are at their best with scoundrels. Expectations provides them no shortage of villains upon whom to practice. Pumblechook. Bentley Drummle. Old Orlick. Compeyson, about whom the best thing said is that he has drowned.Dickens' keen eye for the glory and the pathetic depths of humanity is almost unparalleled in English literature, with apologies to his critics. He knows that there are Gargeries and Biddies and Herberts. He understands this without for a moment denying the hell in human hearts that is comprised by the likes of Pumblechook with his false respectability and Orlick with his violent, drooling hatreds.He has comprehended that heaven - if he believed there is such a place - is likely populated by people surnamed Havisham, Jaggers, and Magwitch, who perhaps dance the more vigorously for having been much forgiven.Yet writing *about* Dickens and his worlds takes time that could be spend on reading Dickens and of his worlds.For that you'll need to pick up Great Expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Michael Page gives a wonderful performance that brings \\"Great Expectations\\" to life.

My students find this edition less intimidating than some others; overall, this edition seems user-friendly rather than overwhelming (which is often the case with such a long story)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Charles Dickens most famous books. Even with Dickens' extremely long r&eacute;sum&eacute; of books Great Expectations maybe the only one read by younger readers because the other are usually mature plots or have extreme length. But, Great Expectations is a \\"great\\" exception.Charles Dickens used a very eloquent vocabulary. His absolute mastery of English makes his book interesting yet difficult to read. Terminology has changed since he wrote the novel, and, in addition to the evolution the language, Dickens was British. This fact changed his wording from typical American English and helped the book be more in character. Dickens also exercises his talent for manipulating words and creating vivid word pictures like these sentences, \\"Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself,\\" and \\"It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.\\" These brilliant word pictures make the book a bear to read when quickly read but also makes it brilliantly fascinating when soaked in and read slowly. In short Dickens has the entire language in his hands and works it masterfully into a brilliant weaving of plot.Dickens also knew how to capture his audience. He used a fantastic plot that wove in and out. Even though his plot was almost cheesy, he managed to pull it off without to much \\"cheese\\" suspected. Though I thought this book had too many climaxes, if you think about its original form - serial - then you understand that he had to keep his readers interested. Dickens keeps the plot \\"writhing\\" until the very end where he had a most expected and cheesy ending. The ending seemed rushed and scrambled together. Out of the whole book spanning thirty some years the last eleven are on the last five pages. The plot as a whole was very good. The plot moved the characters along and changed them to be what they are at the end. The characters grew as you read it not only in age but in emotion and focus.Dickens characters are amazing. He captures a lot of emotions and kinds of people in one book. He grasps a boy's changing thoughts until he grows to be a man. The innocent, childish fears of Pip are so easily grasped, and Pip's relations with Miss Havisham completely change him into a self-centered man trying to woo and unlovable woman. He also shows the starkness of humanity when exploited by its own race. Even some of the lesser characters still show the variety of human expression like Joe's nobleness and Wemmick's eccentricism. In all the characters were amazing.As a whole the book is a masterpiece and classic for all generations. Great Expectations will always be close to my heart."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all, in reference to the reviewer who seemed to think the title was inapropos, all I can say is that I hope that they didn't read the book, for such a lack of understanding would be pathetic. I digress. I am here to dispel some myths. Since this book is often assigned in school, and perceived as \\"important,\\" as another reviewer noted, I think a lot of people shy away from it and assume it will be boring or difficult to understand. Dickens' novels, however, work on multiple level. There certainly is important social criticism and a web of subtly laced motifs within this novel, but on the surface, it's just a good read. I read it on a whim and ended up staying up all night to finish it. So, don't dispel this novel and turn to the many vapid works available to you. One piece of advice, read the real ending before the changed ending (though the changed one will appear first). I felt that the original one was far better, more relevant, and sadly invalidated by the changed ending thrust upon me first. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectation was a wonderful classic written by the author Charles dickens. The main character, Pip, grow up in the home of a blacksmith.

He had a very difficult life but he can improve him self and become a gentleman finally. There are many character of this book. That also made this book very interesting follow"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Probably one of the most memorable Dickens characters, Philip Pirrup is known to most readers as Pip, the 7-year-old boy whom his short-tempered sister raised by hand. Little Pip infers that he has sustained, from as early as his babyhood, a perpetual conflict with injustice. He has known, from the time when he can speak and discern his surrounding that his sister, in her fits of caprice and violent coercion, is unjust to him. It seems to poor Pip that all the endearments in life brushes by him or bypasses him altogether. Fate has ineluctably deprived him of the lightsome hours that make our childhood a time to be remembered like a happy dream through all our after life. The bright side of growing up with his sister's fits of spleen is Pip's friendship with his brother-in-law Joe, who not only has taken him into apprenticeship but sanctified the house Pip calls home that is otherwise sullied by his sister's temper.A chance but terrifying encounter with an escaped convict for whom he brings provisions pilfered from the kitchen cupboard changes the entire course Pip's life. But it is not until he meets the beautiful, cold-hearted and haughty Estella during a summon to a decaying Miss Havisham that he sets his mind to whittle away his coarseness and to become a gentleman, one on Estella's account. The sudden but timely generosity of a mysterious benefactor comes to assist his making of a gentleman and promises a handsome property. The prospect of great expectations not only immediately relieves him from his ordinary sphere of life and frees him from apprenticeship with Joe, but also concurs with his eagerness to abandon his humble origins.GREAT EXPECTATIONS thus follows Pip's new life under his fortune and depicts his education, new relationships, and development through adversity as he slowly dawns on the true nature of his great expectations. The new life does not come without a catch as he finds himself living in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting his perfidious behavior to Joe, whose interference in his life he now regards as disturbance. The more Pip basks in the favor, privilege, and conviviality that is concomitant of his fortune, the more his is convinced of a happier life derived from simplicity and fidelity that only Joe can offer. As he sidles closer to the truth about his benefactor's identity, a revelation for which he is not prepared struck him.GREAT EXPECTATIONS is a story of moral redemption with a prodigal son-like protagonist in the orphaned Pip. The tale is extremely straightforward but is woven with substantial issues he has to deal with. Eager to shred his humble roots, he promptly disavows family and friends at the prospect of a fortune. As the fortune loses its luster and eventually dissipates altogether, he confronts his own ingratitude and learns to love the man who both creates and destroys him, figuratively speaking. Dickens deftly validates Pip's redemption by showing that it produces good deeds as well as good works. This is especially worthy of merit because the novel is told in Pip's first person narrative. Mishandling of the narrative might render the whole tale unconvincing.The proof of Pip's redemption comes laden with good deeds rather than airy words: his clandestine acts of kindness in securing Herbert a partnership in business, and in securing Miss Havisham's respectable opinion of the long-suffering Matthew Pocket, and in his refusing to accept money from Miss Havisham, and most significantly in his love for the man whom has bequeathed him with the fortune."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was reccomended to me by my mom for me to expand my reading tastes. I was maybe a little hesitant, but I began reading it, and was immediately pulled in by the compelling, quirky characters and the mind boggling plot. Each new character is equally amusing, and their names seem to depict their nature. When I first saw Uncle Pumblechook's name, I was immediately able to guess what sort of a person he was, same with Mr. Wopsle, Mr. Wemmick, Mrs. Joe Gargery, and more. The humor is subtle, but once you get the joke you'll be howling.However, Dickens is certainly not an author who says little when there is an opportunity to say more; in a nutshell, his writing is quite flourid. Ten pages can be a whole lot to get through, not because it is boring, but because it is full of complex words, sentences, and paragraphs, that you'll need a little bit of rest. I felt sometimes like reading it was like an excercise seminar for my mind. But don't let these few words discourage you, it's a great read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"...endless is the error of intimacy.Such is the story of &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; I have to say that Dickens totally floored me with this magical tale of love and pedestals. I don't even know what made me read it. I think I just found it in my mother's house amid throwaways in the attic. Oh no...this is NOT to be thrown away, this treasure of English literature. This is the reason why we read.Pip is an orphan with no prospects in sight. But one day, under the strangest of circumstances, he becomes the veritable ward of an unknown benefactor and hurtles toward the gentlemanly future of high living and culture. Along the way, he is placed in the almost daily charge of the bitter and rich shut-in Miss Havisham, guardian of the irresistable, yet bitchy Estella. Poor Pip spends a great deal of his days partaking in the education of a gentleman, doing the bidding of the witchy Havisham woman and pining after the girl who uses and abuses him. It sometimes seems like this high society training is a big freakin' mistake.Things heat up when he comes across the criminal Magwitch and doesn't turn him in to the authorities. From there on in the piece continues to fill the mind with limitless imagery. The writing style is a beaut and the characters continue to intrigue with every passing page, from the disgustingly prunish Miss Havisham to Pip's dim-witted, but thoroughly likeable father - a man he sadly comes to see as shameful as his education and training strengthens.This is a story of yearning and loss, guilt and foolish pride as one person after another gets a wish granted and regrets it or waits for a train that never comes in. Yet somehow the ending leaves behind a great feeling. This is among my favorite books ever."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I may be only a 6th grader, but you wouldn't believe how much I enjoyed this book. Charles Dickens having a poor childhood because of the little money his family earned, has written a miraculous book having to do with money. Charles Dickens makes his case for there being a potential for good and evil in everyone. I really enjoyed reading this book and if you are looking for a fabulous book to enjoy, I strongly reccomend you read this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love the cover of this edition. The painting seems almost perfect for Dickens novel.But on to the novel itself. \\"Great Expectations\\" was the first of Dickens' novels that I read and I had to read several more before I found another I liked anywhere near as much. It is a small work compared to \\"David Copperfield\\" and his other massive English comic novels. It is a much darker work, too with less of the comedic touch.Dickens published and/or edited several magazines and some of his novels were first written as serials to bolster flagging circulation, \\"Great Expectations\\" is one and it shows. The novel grabs you fast and has a story with many surprises and twists along the way. The one drawback to the earlier serializaztion is that the book probably has too many small climaxes and cliffhangersLike many of the other great novels of the 18th and 19th century a modern reader may well find it a little too full of long descriptive passages. I personally feel that it travels along fast enough that you won't notice.I feel a word or two may be necessary about coincidence in the novel, certainly some other reviewers here at Amazon have felt there was too much. The first thing that should be said is that Dickens readers would not have criticised the coincidence, at the time they had a much firmer belief in \\"fate\\" and would have felt that the coincidence showed how much of Pip's tale was fated to be. The other thing worth mentioning is that the coincidence is no less than one can find in quite a lot of modern television if you just explain the plot. We need to ask if the number of coincidences seems unnatural within the book and if the book works. My answer would be that this tale runs along at a fine pace, well written and well worth the read. The coincidence does not detract from the novel.I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, classic read. As one of Dickens shorter works it is also a fine place to start."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As a student, I had to read this book as a requirement for my junior year summer reading. Being the largest book of them all, I reluctantly started on this one. However, after giving it the twenty-five page test, I found the book terribly addictive. Had I had a more generous time budget, I would have finished the book in two to three days. As it was, it took me over a month. The storyline, with Pip intertwined in a weird emotional triangle with one Miss Havisham and Estella, has the reader wondering &quot;Who is on Pip's side?&quot; and &quot;What the heck is going on with this Estella babe?&quot; The emotions Pip felt, the things he went through, and just the thought of actually having to go through what he did brings tears to the eyes (even mine, which had been dry for years). By reading this book, I even became more in-tune to my emotions. This novel is an excellent piece of literature for any language buff (Dickens is a sheer master of the English language), and for anyone who loves a good tearjerker. Happy reading!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Another reviewer claims that you have to be at least 21 years old to read this book. Although I don't think it should be \\"forced\\" on schoolchildren (they will only hate it) I read this novel when I was a child and I loved it. I have just re-read it now and I enjoy it all the more. This is my favorite novel by Dickens. It is from his later period and is criticized for being too dark - which, however, makes it more perfect for today's sensibilities. Stephen King cites this work as one of his favorites: he believes that it is this book that brought the gothic novel mainstream.Was there ever a novelist who created more memorable characters than Dickens? Here, we meet perhaps his most intriguing - Miss Havisham. For anyone unfamiliar with the story, I will not spoil it by describing her. The story is similar to parable about the prodigal son - good Pip inexplicably comes into some money and goes off to the corrupting city.AN IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE: Dickens wrote two ending for this book. His friends thought that the original ending was too downbeat and they asked him to come up with a different one. It is the upbeat ending that is the official ending of the novel. However, most critics agree that the original unpublished ending is better. Most modern editions feature the unpublished ending in an appendix. MAKE SURE YOU BUY A COPY THAT CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL ENDING!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens's later novels, a work of his artistic maturity. The narrative is symbolic rather than realistic. Although, as in most of Dickens and in Victorian literature in general, the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is acceptable here because the events are true to the internal, psychological, logic of the story.After writing A Tale of Two Cities, which was unique among his novels in that it had none of his trademark humor, Dickens set out to make Great Expectations rich in comic elements. This despite, or perhaps because of, being in a depressed state of mind himself at the time. The conventional critical view is that he largely failed in this attempt, but I strongly disagree. The book is hilariously funny in parts and the main character, Pip, exhibits a characteristically British humour-in-adversity throughout his adventures. There is also the host of minor comic characters that we expect from Dickens. And he for once manages pathos without spilling over into bathos, so there are tears as well as laughter here, sometimes both at once.If you have not yet read any Dickens, this is not a bad book with which to start, although for younger readers (teens) I would recommend Hard Times or A Tale of Two Cities as their first. Great Expectations demands a mature sensibility to appreciate its symbolism and psychological depth. Perhaps because it chiefly concerns the childhood and youth of the protagonist, it is often given to young people to read and is a set text in some High School classes. This is a pity because, in its dark complexity, it is more likely to turn youngsters off, rather than onto, Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've never read any Dickens of my own free will. I was forced to read &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; in high school and I thought that was enough for me. However, one day, on a whim, I bought a copy of Great Expectations. I'm not sure what I expected, but I certainly didn't expect to love it as much as I did.Dickens is not a writer to read at a swift pace. Indeed, this novel was written in weekly episodes from December 1860 to August 1861 and, as it was created to be a serial, each installment is full of varied characters, great descriptions and a lot of action which moves the plot along and leaves the reader yearning for more. Therefore, unlike some books which are easily forgotten if I put them down for a few days, Great Expectations seemed to stick around, absorbing my thoughts in a way that I looked forward to picking it up again. It took me more than a month to read and I savored every morsel.Basically the story is of the self-development of Pip, an orphan boy being raised by his sister and her blacksmith husband in the marshlands of England in 1820.Every one of the characters were so deeply developed that I felt I was personally acquainted with each one of them. There was Pip's roommate, Herbert Pocket, the lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, and his clerk, Mr. Wemmick. And then there was the wicked Orlick. The dialogues were wonderful. The characters often didn't actually say what they meant but spoke in a way that even though the words might be obtuse, there was no mistaking their meaning. I found myself smiling at all these verbal contortions.Dickens' work is richly detailed and he explores the nuances of human behavior. I enjoyed wallowing in the long sentences and letting myself travel backwards in time to a different world. However, even with the footnotes, I found myself sometimes confused by the British slang of 150 years ago, and there were several passages I had to read over several times in order to get the true meaning. Of course I was not in a particular rush. I didn't have to make a report to a class or take a exam about the book. This is certainly a pleasure.I heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read.ting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This review refers to the audio(CD - Brilliance Audio) edition of \\"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickens, read by Michael PageThis unabridged audio edition of Dickens' classic superb chronology of \\"Pip's' journey through life going from a poor boy to becoming a man with \\"expectations\\" is simply marvelous. As Pip comes into a small fortune, and becomes a \\"gentleman\\" he learns the value and true meaning of friendships and life. But the journey is a long one, with many lessons to be learned along the way before he can find his true self. Dickens has given us a wonderful story, with rich details of the setting and characters that grow and are among the most interesting and magnetic to be found in literature.I don't need to go on and on about the book itself(although I could easily go over my allotted word count here), if you haven't read it yet ,just know you are in for one heck of a literary treat. It is a story that will transport you to another time and place, and you may not want to come back. I will however, talk about this marvelous audio edition. Michael Page is the reader, and what a reading he gives. Just curl up and listen to this master storyteller. Every voice, every nuance is captured. There is no doubt who is speaking as he gives each character the personality and cultural characteristics as Dickens intended. He even does the women wonderfully, without going over the top. In my mind Miss Havisham has always sounded just the way Page portrayed her, Estella as uppity as ever,the humble Joe, along with all the rest.The book is an unabridged reading on 16 discs. each discs has 90 very short tracks(about 45 seconds each), I had no trouble starting up where I left off(when I absolutely had to leave off). I just made a mental note(or you could even write it down) of the track number and disc where I stopped it. The sound quality is excellent, and total running time is about 20 hours. Each disc is in it's own paper CD holder with a clear front so you can see the disc number you are looking for.If you are a fan of this book, this audio edition will give you a fresh read and new appreciation of this fascinating book. If you are experiencing it for the first time, you can't help but to become enthralled. Great to take on long drives or for younger readers to be introduced to classic literature in a most entertaining way.Enjoy the read...for the 1st Time or the 50th time!....Lauriemore great audio reads:A Christmas Carolread by Geoffrey Palmer-Carrie(read by Sissy Spacek)Back When We Were Grownups(read by Blair Brown)The Shipping News(read by Paul Hecht)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love this book! This is one of my all-time favorite books ever. I had to read it eons ago when I was in ninth grade, and now (14 years later) I am still enjoying it. Every few years I take this one down from my bookshelf to revisit. This is the story of Pip, a small orphaned boy living in poverty in the English countryside with his much older sister and her husband. Pip meets a convict in a graveyard one damp morning and helps him out in the form of some vittles and an iron file. Later in the story, Pip moves from poverty to being a &quot;gentleman&quot; due to the influence of a mysterious, anonymous benefactor. This book tells of his adventures and how Pip's expectations guide him through life. Towards the end of the story, Pip finds out that reality is sometimes very different from what we expect it to be. The characters are what really make this book stand out. Charles Dickens is a master of character development, and his descriptions of Miss Havisham, Wemmick, Joe, and the others is brilliant! The dialogue is great, with the words written the way a commoner would have spoken in England in the 1800's. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are inter-related to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel.This novel will make you laugh and it might make you sad, but it is always entertaining. If you are in high school and reading this book for the first time for English class, keep at it! It may seem difficult at first if you are not used to Dickens, but this book is well worth it! It is truly a gem."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is not the full version, despite the length. There's no indication of this until you get inside the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens's acknowledged masterpiece, Great Expectations, is rightly considered one of the greatest novels of all-time. It depth and breadth are staggering, as it follows its protagonist, Pip, from his early childhood through his later life. During the course of his life, we encounter a vast catalog of raw human emotions: love, hate, jealousy, hope, sadness, despair, anger, pity, empathy, sympathy -- and on and on. The story is treasured and revered for many reasons. One of its main strengths is its plot: after a somewhat slow introductory section, Dickens puts his story in fifth gear and delivers a fast-paced and exciting story that gallops along without ever losing interest or clarity. The incredibly complex plotline, full of separate stories and incidents that seem totally unrelated to each other, but are then all harnessed together as the book heads straight toward its denouement, is also full of constant plot twists, which continue up until, literally, the last paragraph. But, of course, as with all of Dickens's major works, it is the characters that make the book. Like Shakespeare, Dickens preferred to have the story develop through the characters, rather than having the characters be mere set pieces inside of an overriding story. And what great characters they are: the perennially paradoxical but essentially human Pip; the bitter and mysterious Miss Havisham; the beautiful and haughty Estella; the simple and saint-like Joe; the kind and benevolent Herbert; the very human convict, Magwitch -- and all of the other wonderful characters. Dickens excelled in creating well-rounded, very human characters who harbored very real and very complex emotions -- that is, human emotions. We identify with Pip as he winds through his life, because we have been there, too -- the disappointments, the surprises, the loves, the anger, the sadness. In whatever way his story may differ from our own, it is still essentially human, as is ours. For all of his complex and paradoxical emotions and sentiments, Pip is a recognizably human character -- and that is why we love him and this book. A masterpiece for the ages, which will endure for years yet to come, Great Expectations is a great book that can be loved by one and all, for, at its heart, is that grain of simple truth that says so much about what is human in all of us -- whether we have great expectations or not."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The description of Miss Havisham & her home alone is worth two to three stars. This is unlike any other book in the English language, with the possible exception of Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights?\\" Dickens tells us many things in the begining of the novel that appear out of place or irrelevant, but later those pieces fall into place so that the big picture is revealed.This story runs the gamut of emotions for the reader. Shock, empathy, joy, disappointment, & disdain are all there for the various characters at different times. Multiple plots, detailed descriptions, & ever mutable characters made this a long & entertaining read. This is the story of Phillip Pirrup or Pip. He is a true hardluck case that you root for. His family except for a brother & sister have all passed away. He lives with his sister{a husband beater} & brother in law Joe Gargery in a tiny English village. Oddly for this era, this is one of the few books where fear from a man's perspective is explored. That in itself was refreshing. Along the roller coaster life that Pip finds himself on he meets enigmatic people & gets an anonymous benefactor who helps him reach London to start a better life? Once there life & the nature of Pip himself is radically altered. This is when the title of my review becomes clear. Dickens asks & answers very poignant psychological questions long before Freud was ever heard of."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I chose to write a review of Great Expectations because I wanted to be able to rate a novel &quot;five-stars&quot; without an ounce of hesitation.Context: I'm not by any means some sort of an intellect. Like many people who have read Great Expectations, I was assigned this book in high school. I remember looking to the end of the book, first, to see how many pages there were. I cringed. Then I began to read that first chapter about a boy named Pip who meets the convict looking for vittles.I won't give anything away about the plot. I only want to say that this was the first book that I ever read that I had me truly absorbed. I remember a kid in my class who read ahead a few chapters and had us all in wonder as to what twists transpired. He just smiled and said, &quot;you won't believe how this thing turns out.&quot;After reading other Dickens books I realized that his greatest strengths was populating his books with amazing, odd, likeable, and despicable characters who found there way in and out of his stories.If you haven't read this book, do so."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I got the &quot;cover-to-cover&quot; book on tape for a long road trip, never having heard the story before. I loved every minute of it. The things that Dickens does with the English language is endlessly entertaining, the story he tells fascinating and fast-paced. The highly talented Martin Jarvis reads wonderfully, giving great characterization to the many people appearing in the story, allowing me to see them all as completely distinct.It's a shame that people feel such resentment when forced to read something. Most of the bad reviews this book gets are from young people who were forced to read it for a class. When taken at one's own leisure, and in one's own time, it is quite entertaining. I'm not sure that the teachers who assign the book are pointing out all the things that make the book great, such as Dickens's flair with the language, the point he's making about a society that places birth above worth, and his ability to make abstract arguments that enhance the story. I'd be interested in hearing from literature teachers to find out how they use the book in their classes.One of the best books ever written, this reading is one of the best investments of my time I've ever made."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of the most absorbing novels I have ever read. It is also the best. The plot is complex and exciting, sometimes very funny and sometimes almost unbearably sad, with so many plot twists it is impossible to lose interest. The writing and descriptions are...well they're Dickens': always brilliant and powerful. And the characters in Great Expecations, Pip, Uncle Pumblechook, Miss Havisham, Mr. Jaggers, etc., are colorful and original, and complex and lively. Great Expectations has the suspense of any of today's thrillers (during the last fifty pages I could not put it down) and a wonderful message: that your social standing does not determine what kind of a person you are; aristocracy isn't all it's cracked up to be; what you really need in life are good friends and people that care about you. Great Expectations is a masterpiece of the first order. I cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed it. It is most assuredly a book I will keep reading again and again throughout my life."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When reading this book in high school, I considered myself very fortunate that the copies we had contained the original ending. It was placed at the end, after the ending that was originally published. I much preferred the original ending from the momentI read it, and have since checked every copy I have come across to see if it is in them. Sadly, often it is not.The kindle edition does not contain the original ending. I did not see any reviews of this edition that mentioned it, so I thought I would post one for anyone else who finds that important, as I do."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"GREAT EXPECTATIONS is often the novel used in high schools to introduce students to Dickens. Due to it's length and fairly long and uneventful middle phase, I'm not sure it's the best text to introduce people to Dickens. Still, it is a pretty good story and contains some of the most memorable characters in Dickens' fiction.GREAT EXPECTATIONS is the story of Phillip Pirrip, otherwise known as Pip. Pip's parents die not long after he is born and he is raised &quot;by hand&quot; by his sister. His brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, is the town blacksmith and loves Pip. The two are best-of-friends. One night while looking at his parents' graves, Pip meets a convict and his life is forever changed by that meeting. As the novel progresses, Pip meets Miss Havisham (the wealthiest woman in town) and her beautiful ward, Estella. Pip immediately falls in love with Estella and is haunted by her all the days of his life. Eventually Pip is bond to Joe as his apprentice and sets to work in the blacksmith forge. Several years later, Pip's luck changes when he is informed by a lawyer from London, Mr. Jaggers, that he has become the recipient of &quot;great expectations&quot;. The book then follows Pip's life as he enters this new stage in life and as he develops and becomes a &quot;gentleman&quot;. Everything is brought full circle and just about everyone gets what they deserve by the time the novel ends.GREAT EXPECTATIONS isn't the easiest of books to read. What many writers can do in a sentence often takes Dickens two pages to tell. Also, the book is divided into three phases and the second phase is rather boring (except at the end) and really does nothing more than to fill in a few plot gaps and illustrate to us how much of a prig Pip becomes. Nevertheless, GREAT EXPECTATIONS is still a good story containing some very vivid characters: Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, Magwitch, Jaggers, and Wemmick. The characters in GREAT EXPECTATIONS are as memorable as anyone in DAVID COPPERFIELD, OLIVER TWIST, or A CHRISTMAS CAROL. The first phase of the book is quite interesting and sets up everything that later occurs in the novel. The third part of the novel is full of excitement and contains Pip's repentance and reformation. Overall, it's a great book and even though it was written over a hundred years ago, it has a lot to say about the society in which we live today."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this book when I was in eighth grade. Ever since then, I have been going back to it because even though I know how the events will eventually turn out, this book always retains the magic touch to entertain and keep one hoping that the main character Pip will live a happy life.Upon reading the first page, the reader is drawn into a world of mystery and suspense. The reader is whisked into an English cemetry from olden times and what draws the reader further is the presence of a little boy crying, afraid of the eerie atmosphere. To make matters worse, a very strange looking man appears to frighten the little boy even further. The suspense just begins.As if this wasn't enough for the little boy crying in the cemetry, Pip goes on to face even more difficulties in life. Pip meets with the strange Miss Havisham who forever wears her white wedding gownn. Pip feels forever alienated by the proud Estella, whom he has fallen in love with. The problem is --- Estella doesn't seem to care at all. To her, Pip is a poor, common boy.Excitement builds up as Pip is granted the chance to become a gentleman with prosperity. Will Estella care about him now? Will Pip remain the same kind-hearted young man he was when he was poor or will he change?Even though I have long found the &quot;answers&quot; (there are two different endings in the orginal) I am still amazed at how Dickens creates fascinating characters and fills his novels with mystery, suspense and romance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As an English teacher, I purchased the collection to use in my classroom. We had already started the novel when the cd's came in. Because the cd's were not marked according to chapter, it was difficult to find the starting point each time we used the cd's. I would have liked to have chapters to correspond with the tracks for easy listening. On the up side, it was easier for the kids to follow along once we did find the spot, and the animated voices brought the story to life."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book in high school years ago and just recently read it for the second time. Dickens never disappoints."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is yet another great story by Dickens. Throughout the book I kept thinking, I know what will happen. How obvious. What was obvious was how wrong I was each time. Follow young Pip from boyhood to manhood. See how he goes to become a gentleman (make his fortune in our terms) and what comes of it. This is a story about growing up and learning what is important in life. It is full of Dickens' excellent descriptions and characters and their relationships.If you like any Dickens story you will like this one as well. If you have never read Dickens, you should.For Kindle owners. I only saw two errors. Both words probably had accents on characters as missing characters appeared as question marks (?), so I am not positive what the words actually were (one was French) and to be honest, I never bothered to look them up. But those were the only two. The book contains a table of contents that works fine. I did not see page numbers on this version. Overall, no reason to pay for a copy, this was excellent."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Excellent copy. Clean. New. thank you. Suggestion to reader: look for a copy with BOTH endings! If you read this book in high school, give it another go. Dickens is brilliant and each read brings new insight."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This isnt merely a classic, it is a book that is dear to my heart and inspired me as both a writer and a person. Many of the free classic ebooks have poor formating or other problems but there are none here that I notice. I highly recommend this wonderful book andfor free you cant beat that price."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a book worth reading, and it's a shame my first experience with it was having it force-fed to me 22 years ago as a high school sophomore or junior. I only wish I could find the crappy, soulless joke of a book report I regurgitated from Cliff's Notes to please my teacher and get that all-important \\"A.\\" Suffice to say that if I found it I would not post it here.Having re-read the book, I now can say with certainty that Dickens is a brilliant writer and storyteller. His use of language is phenomenal, and his characters tell a deep emotional tale. I suspect it is the tale of Dickens' own childhood dilemma: an emotionally abandoned boy seeking greatness and knowing at some level that he was born for it---and that fate somehow picked him out for it.Pip is a multidimensional character, with hopes and charm and honesty and flaws. He is utterly sympathetic, as I'm sure little Charles Dickens once was himself.Pip, an abused and undefended boy, is picked out rather randomly by a near stranger (seemingly the idealized parent for whom every child secretly hopes) to become a gentleman---to rise above the meagre expectations for which his limited birth has chosen him. Even his closest childhood ally, Joe the blacksmith, does nothing (read that: nothing) to defend him against Joe's abusive wife, Pip's older sister. To Dickens' discredit, I felt that he over-defended Joe's weakness as a non-defender. But, by the same token, Dickens' rendering of Joe's all-too-realistic weakness is quite honest and common: after all, so few adults really do stick their necks out to defend the child. I am only left to suspect that in Dickens' own childhood none did either. I would guess that like Pip, Dickens was surrounded entirely by adults who were weak, sadistic, self-centered, or manipulative. My guess is that only his talent, hard word, and patience allowed him to rise above.My only real criticism of the book (and it's not a big one) comes near the end, when Pip tries to help Magwitch escape England and thus find safety. Granted, Dickens' treatment of this situation does assist the flow of the novel, and does allow him to show just how much Pip has grown to care for his benefactor, but it still left me shaking my head. (And I'm not spoiling the plot, because in the version I read the editor's footnotes spoil the plot anyway early on in the reading, as clearly the editor assumes that the reader knows the story beforehand. Then again, maybe the editor is spoiling the plot to give himself some power. I felt some of his footnotes, which are otherwise quite helpful for background, suggest that he was in an annoying sort of competition with Dickens to show his own greatness.)So although the plot device works for Dickens' purpose, it just didn't strike me as sufficiently realistic to keep my disbelief suspended. My reason: Magwitch is a hardy, intelligent, cunning world traveler, who suddenly, for no good enough reason, puts all his trust for escape from England (and thus his life) into the hands of a complete novice, Pip, who creates a foolhardy plan for escape that ends up getting Magwitch captured and sentenced to death.In reality, given what Dickens' shows us about Magwitch's character, here's what I think would have really happened had Magwitch heard Pip's plan:Magwitch: \\"Pip, thank you for creating a plan to rescue me, but I think I'll pass. I'll go off into the night on my own, and leave England the same way I came to it: on my own.\\"Magwitch would have traveled onward with less hurrah, more stealth, and far more privacy. And as the result he would have likely left England safe and sound, and continued to keep up his benefactor relationship with Pip.But that wouldn't have suited Dickens' purposes for the plot, so the more realistic ending was avoided.That said, the book was still great. I couldn't put it down. Kudos to Dickens! And to hell with my high school teacher for nearly ruining my regard for this great writer."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Our book group decided to read a book by Charles Dickens in this the bicentenary of his birth. I had read some books by Dickens when at school and found them rather dry so chose Great Expectations because it was one I hadn't previously read.

It arrived promptly and also was in described condition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I know for sure now why Charles Dickens is such a famous author for works other than A Christmas Carol. The reputation of the book and the author speak for themselves. I was overwhelmed with the quality of Dickens' writing, the intricate nuances of the plot and the many surprise twists. The illustrations in the book plus the alternate ending were also bonuses. I could not be more complimentary of this book and plan to read many more Dickens works starting with David Copperfield. Great Expectations is now one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is classic Dickens. It's a winner. It lives up to my expectations. Anyone who loves Dickens will enjoy this book. Again we see a young person growing up on the \\"wrong side of the tracks\\" become a hero in his own right. Pip learns many things in his journey and comes to terms with the folks who shaped his understanding, even though they are simple folk."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dicken's is clearly in a class of his own. Few authors have exhibited and illustrated the breadth and depth of story telling inherent and extant in a Dicken's novel. Dicken's ability to switch tenses and create tension through use of speech and idiom is unparalleled. This is a mature read that requires patience, intellect, and a formidable vocabulary to be fully realized and properly appreciated. Thank you Charles for your formidable and fine effort; well done good and faithful master."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am amazed that it took me 61 years to get around to reading this book. I wish I had read it a long time ago. The Kindle version is great, though. Even though I am a trainer of English teachers, I found many vocabulary words that were unfamiliar. A right click gives an instant dictionary, and I had to use that feature more than I liked, along with a big font.The characters are amazingly well described, even as they develop chronologically, and although some aspects of the story are predictable (i.e Joseph the blacksmith and Biddy's romance) some are completly unanticipated and surprising.I like the ending in this version- it leaves hopeful possibilities!For free, this is the best bargain I ever purchased- hours of joy- so thank you Amazon..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book as a freelance. I really enjoyed this book, especially because it isn't cliche. The events that were portrayed in this book were events that a reader would not typically expect. The old english styled language at first was a bit difficult to comprehend the first few chapters, so it took me a while to read them. However, after a couple chapters, I became adapted to the use of language and sentence structure that it became easier to read and comprehend."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of course, this is a wonderful book, but it is brought to life by the BBC audiobook. I don't know the reader/actor's name, but he is a master at providing individual, dynamic voices for every character - voices with personalities that match the character, as well. It added so much to the enjoyment when compared to other audiobooks read by lesser actors. A MASTERPIECE!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had not read this book since I was at school many years ago. Enjoyed it just as much as then - some of Dickens books are very hard to get through but this one, along with several others such as a Tale of Two Cities, are easy to read and not outdated as a lot of older books are. I would recommend to any one wanting to read some of the old classics."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great story written by a great author!

Loved it this time (35 years later). I Read it on my Kindle."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Something I feared before reading this book was that it would be a terrific story, but full of cliches. Not so.

Not only I didn't find it overly \\"wordy\\" or else, but extremely well written. But that's details. This novel is very intense and has unforgettable characters in it, honestly. It's very emotional and it's a trip. A trip that lasted two weeks for me, and that I will not soon forget, if ever. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for those of you who love literature, and even for those of you who are not literature-buffs, because the novel is very readable so don't be afraid of its length if you're not used to reading classics and such.Dickens, I realised, can be surprisingly funny at times, and this without ever losing his capacity to create strongly emotional moments and images. As there seems to be tons of reviews for this book already I'll stop mine here and just tell you that if you're interested in this book, go for it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I never wanted to read this book, but a friend convinced me when he learned that I loved Pip on South Park (I found the little nerd funny). This was the best advice I'd ever taken. Reading this not only made me love Charles Dickens, but gave me a late start on loving reading in general.Granted, it's a difficult book to read. Dickens packs his book with descriptions and long sentences (yet every word is important and helps with understanding) and he's not easy to get through. Yet Dickens still, with all his flaws, remains a masterful storyteller. His characters aren't deep, but they're relatable and memorable. I love Pip, Estella, Miss Havisham, Joe, Herbert Pocket, Magwitch, and Aged P, and even though I've read this book a long time ago, I love them just as much now as I did then.It's a shame that people have to read this for school (I did so for my second time). It's a wonderful story that should be enjoyed by itself. If you haven't been made to read it, do so now. Push yourself through it and take your time (it took me a month to finish the book myself). You'll be glad you did. Assignments make you rush and over-analyze stories, and Dickens should never be read that way."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was a remarkable book. I really enjoyed it. I didn't really have great expectations before I read it. It was about a little English boy named Pip. Pip is a poor kid who suddenly inherits a bunch of money and becomes rich. When he was poor he hated the way rich people treated poor people, but he finds himself doing treating poor people horribly when rich. He finally learns that everyone deserves to be treated with the same respect, even those less fortunate. This was an interesting book, but a tough book to understand, I would probably recommend it only for adults."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When I was assigned to present a novel for my English class at Mercy High School, I thought of Great Expectations because I had read it five years ago and remembered that I had liked it. I thought that it was rather straight forward and didn't remember having difficulty reading it. When I read it for a second time, however, I realized that it was alot more complex. The reading was simple and getting through the book was easy, but Dickens made his story one worth contemplating by expressing the many sides life with his characters. What made the people he wrote about so wonderful was his ability to make them unique and entertaining, yet so believable as human beings coping with ordinary problems that the reader had no problem sympathizing with them."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts in Great Expectations spectacularly. The characters Dickens develops throughout the story are human and easy to connect with. Pip is the most real to life character, because he exhibits the most human-like qualities. Pip is a very personable character that makes the reader feel sorrow and happiness along with him. As Pip looks to better himself and become a gentleman, he comes to realize a very important life lesson; money cannot buy happiness. As Pip goes through the story, he allows the reader to see and feel exactly what he feels and sees.Estella is described as a beautiful young woman that captures Pip's heart. Estella has a very insensitive personality, and enjoys making Pip cry; something everyone has encountered in a person some time in his/her life.Herbert is a young man with many dreams and aspirations. Herbert becomes Pip's best friend, and Pip realizes that this young man works very hard for what he believes in. This is the kind of friend that will push a person where they would not normally go by themselves.Abel Magwitch is the convict that Pip encounters at the beginning of the story. Magwitch gives Pip a large amount of money to start his life as a gentleman. Magwitch is the kind of person that would give the clothes off of his back to anyone in need. Magwitch is also a very personable character because he is not all good or all evil. He exhibits both of these; he is a convict and he devotes his life's earnings to Pip.Charles Dickens develops an outstanding plot as the novel unfolds. There are many life lessons throughout the novel. Pip realizes that all of the money in the world cannot buy happiness. Pip also finds out that true love is not just the woman he cannot obtain, because love has to be much more. The plot has many twists and turns throughout. There is always something new happening to Pip. It is almost like a soap opera, because there are so many people and events interacting with each other during the novel. When the plot becomes a little thin, Dickens begins to create suspense for the next big event about to occur. Dickens chooses to develop the plot through the character's actions. Not once did Dickens explain what was happening in the story, he let the characters take over, and within a few pages all questions were answered.The novel has many conflicts that develop throughout the plot. Pip and Estella have a love-hate relationship going on. Pip loves Estella, but she could care less about him. Pip and Joe have a conflict, too. Pip wants to see much less of Joe now that he is a gentleman, but Joe just wants to see Pip, period. Pip thinks he is too good for Joe, even though he is still just the same human as he was before. Money changes people's outlook on life. Pip was once a benevolent, caring, young man, but once he fell into money, he changed dramatically in the way he acted towards others. These conflicts provide for some pretty interesting facets in the story. Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts excellently throughout the novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Truly one of the best books I've read.

But unlike most of them I loved the book. It was with in my textbook which made it hard to read but other then that I could not put it down. The themes of the story are so inviting that you can't wait to read about what happens next. Dickens kept the tone inving and I kept going back to read more. I am now a junior and reading the book yet again for a history assignment and even though I know what is happening I still can't put it down.To all the freshman out there that have to read this book: Give it a chance. If you really hat eit and want to watch the movie go to the local library and get Disneys version of it. They did it exactly to the book and it is awesome. Its long but it does get rid of some of the unnecessary backgorund information. It comes in a series of 3 tapes.Other then that I love this book.

True, the book is extremely wordy, and there are many words you'll be getting out a dictionary for reference, and yes it's very slow moving, but it's wonderful.The book focuses on a young boy, who becomes a young man, named Pip, raised by his over dominating sister, and a kind blacksmith, Joe Gargory. For awhile Pip has gratitude for living in the town, but, when he is spurned by the rich Estella and Miss Havisham, he wants to be something greater, someone richer. Being rich falls into his lap, but not without consequences. The book is about the follies of false vanities, of turning ones back on those who loved you, on trying to chase an uncatchable dream from those who don't reciprocate feelings, (in this case Pip's devotion to the haughty Estella) and for neglecting the good values of life for the ostentatious ones. Too often in todays society people (I'm guilty of this too) forget about what's truly important, family and good friends, and associate with only the proud and the, what they deem to be, the important. In the process they get too wrapped up by material wealth rather than the simple beauties around them.Aside from the basic story, the characterization in this novel is wonderful. Dicken's has really created some memorable characters, full of depth and complexity. The dull headed, but kind, Joe Gargory, and the haughty, but lonely, Estella, along with the mournful and bitter Miss Havisham will stay with the reader long after he/she finishes the book.Reading this book is a treat. Peruse it's pages and enjoy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel by Charles Dickens is very well written, although very verbose. The novel has a good plot, but the writting is sometimes hard to follow. It took me one whole month to read the book and fully understand it.

A great book once you give it a fair chance. I am so glad that I stuck to it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Before you reads this book, examine the title, and what great expectations do, so the events seem less shocking.This story is quite bittersweet and ironic, with a lot of interweaven and connected plots-not just of Pip's life. These plots make understanding this book, along with the rich dialect, quite difficult (where it lost the star) but amazing. ADVICE: read the Coles Notes (or other notes) chapter summaries.As I said, it's an extrodinary coming of age (rite of passage) which will not be as distant and farfetched as you might think. Comparable to your own rite of passage if you care to draw parallels with not only Pip, but all other characters too.I found that when you are forced to read this book and too much emphasis it placed on it, it loses it's 'interest', 'luster', and 'magic', (*wink* *wink* high school teachers!).Overall, I liked this book, but the language overwhelmed at times."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens has a very vivid imagination.

My recommendation will probably mean little because if your still in school you will probably have to read it anyways...but I still recommend it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was ok, but there were a few things that the author could have done better. First, in my opinion he shouldn't have changed certain characters names around, which can be confusing for some people. There is also illegal activities on the part of some of the characters. Also, even the abridged version of the book is a bit long. Perhaps Dickens could have wound things up in a tighter package for the reader. Dickens plot can be a bit confusing at times, and the reader sometimes is left to piece together the novel for himself.However, this is not a necessesarily a totally boring read. There are several good things about it. Lying is at least partially looked at in a negative light, and steadfast faithfulness among friends is evident among some of the book's main characters. Justice is done to an man for his wrongdoing.Overall, the book is readable but too long. Also, when considering this book, keep in mind that author's back then, are different from authors today. If you like Dicken's works, you might like this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was disappointed from the fact that I did not finish the whole book when I was in high school.

I really enjoyed reading this book and if you are looking for a fabulous book to enjoy, I strongly reccomend you read this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens has written extrodinary books such as Olivet Twist, David Cooperfield, A Christmas Carol, and of course Great Expectations. You have not read a novel until you have read Great Expectations. It is truly one of Charles Dickens best. In a dramatic story about adventures and drama, Pip faces his greatest adventure.

The book is aslow start but once you are adjusted to the language its actually fast paced reading... especially when Estella returns. My first Dickens and won't be my last. I believe everyone should read the classics"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I got this book assigned to me near the first day of high school this year, and just got finished reading it about a week ago. Let me tell you something, if you know about Dicken's life, this story is kinda based on it. Let me also say this book is extremely boring in the beginning, because you are learning the peices of the puzzle, but the second half is excellent, and all the peices of the puzzle came together, which is why this is an excellent book. My favorite character was definetely Miss Havisham. Don't give up on this book!!! This is the kind of book I think needs a small sequel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think that the character development alone makes this novel stand out as one of the best novels of Charles Dickens. The plot summary is also well-crafted, with so many characters intertwining in the books final chapters. We see a personality change in not only Pip, but other major characters such as Estella and Miss Havisham, as we find out that they are all connected in some way.This book might be seen as a rather long and detailed book. Some of the details are probably overdone and unnecessary. This is definitely a book that takes some getting used to. However, I think that one of the morals of the book-- understanding your roots and accepting them-- make this a great book to read.The many characters contrast each other in so many ways, and there are so many good and bad characters, that it becomes a fun book to read. However, you must have patience to read a book this long and detailed.I think this book is well-written (some of the language is a little tough), and Dickens exposes his great writing ability and his abilty to deal with a complex plot and make it all come together in Great Expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens was one of the most popular writers of all time, creating some of the best-known characters in English literature. In the book \\"Great Expectations\\", the protagonist and narrator, Pip begins the story as a young orphan boy being grown up by his sister. I like this book, because Charles Dickens takes you right inside the Pip's mind and you live through the events and discoveries of his life with him. Pip is passionate, romantic and somewhat unrealistic at heart. That makes the novel interesting. Of course, you cannot forget the great love story (Pip and Estella). The other characters Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Miss Joe, Estella, Mr Jaggers and Mr Wemmick are all unique and special in their way and they add to the novel's richness. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are interrelated to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel. This novel will make you sometimes laugh and sometimes make you feel sad, but it is always entertaining. Latif Dose simplifies the texts. The language is very clear. There are not old English words and this gives the reader much pleasure while reading the novel. I think most young people would like this novel because it's not as hard to read as an other classic books. I recommend Great Expectations to anyone who wants to read a good, classic book because Great Expectations has a little bit of everything in it, mystery, romance and suspense. You cannot easily find all of these properties in other novels, which makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a special and a classic one.. That makes this novel very different. It is probably one of the top ten English novels of the 19th century. Some of the passages are beautiful. I cannot forget Pip's response to Estella when she says \\"You will get me out of thoughts in a week.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The book was a gift and really excited my 10 year old godchild. Good seller."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This audio version is phenomenal...full of lively interpretation all by one narrator. Yet the lack of a chapter guide makes it extremely difficult to use should you be interested in tracking down a particular chapter.

It was the selection for our book club, so I bought it to read again.Although it's very long, it's a wonderful book, rich with detail and timeless for it's social issues and examination of interpersonal relationships.I had forgotten (or perhaps didn't appreciate in high school) how funny Dickens is. His sense of humor, and ability to convey emotion and atmosphere are extraordinary.I got it too late to finish for the book club and had to consult Spark notes (which are great for summary), but I hope to finish it soon.

(6th graders) This copy is the novel but an adapted version. The print size, the text appearance are friendly. The authenticity and truth of the story are upheld. All my expectations have been met. There are questions at the end of the text. Wanted about 20 copies but did not want to pay the top price! Like usual Amazon came to the rescue. Can't wait to introduce the children to a classic but closer to their level. It is authentic to so many of the important quotes. Not too many authors have one of their novel's characters last the test of time, meaning Scrooge. Dickens created him and we know the symbolic Scrooge, one hundred years later...we need to acknowledge his greatness as a writer."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I agree this is a great car book. The only problem is I don't want to get out of my car.The reader does a fabulous job of bringing Dickens many wonderful characters to life. I heartily recommend."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" was Charles Dickens' third attempt at writing semi-autobiography, and his most successful. Poor Oliver Twist barely registers in his own book, while David Copperfield becomes a pasteboard figure after reaching adulthood. Pip only grows richer and more complex, and it's no wonder critics thus see \\"Great Expectations\\" as the best of the lot.We open with the finest sequence in the novel, along a swampy coastline in southern England where a small boy at his parent's grave is threatened by a desperate convict. The convict wants food and a file to help cut him free. The boy, Pip, must wrestle with some serious guilt, not to mention the threat of his sister and guardian's overzealous discipline. Social expectations cut one way, but a rogue feeling of sympathy for the convict guides him another. Which will win out?Pip's a bit of a prat, but he's meant to be. After coming into some mysterious money, the former blacksmith's apprentice abandons those who love him in a doomed attempt to win over Estella, the high-class, heart-challenged ward of balmy Miss Havisham. Estella bothers some people. How could Pip love her? Man, I've been there, and I reckon a lot of others have been, too. Estella is one of the great fictional representations of unrequited love, and in Dickens' hands, becomes something even more potent, a symbol of class division and status-scrambling folly.Dickens' handling of Pip is subtle and worth careful re-reading. By using the device of an older, unseen Pip as narrator, we sense where he fell astray without it being pointed out overmuch. Clashing with a snooty rival for Estella's affections, he sweats the possibility of being discovered as the friend of a guileless village blacksmith, Joe: \\"So throughout life our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.\\"Whenever the focus is on Pip, particularly when dealing with Estella, Miss Havisham, or the mysterious, vaguely creepy lawyer Mr. Jaggers, \\"Great Expectations\\" is both high art and a great read. Dickens' descriptive powers remained in high beam in this, his penultimate novel (completed in 1861). The storyline takes its time, but in such a way that it often feels like a prototype for the stream-of-consciousness narrative authors would employ a century later.If only \\"Great Expectations\\" didn't suffer from one of Dickens' chief bte noires, compounding coincidences. Whether it's the identity of Estella's long-lost father or Miss Havisham's unworthy suitor, too many of the plot strands wind up twisted together to unwholesome effect.Other plot strings, like the tale of a blackguard named Orlick or the romances of Pip's pals Herbert Pocket and Wemmick, do little to merit the lengthy attention they receive. Most annoying is the story of Compeyson, built up as Pip's main adversary. Yet we hardly meet the guy before he vanishes in the black waters of Dickens' top-heavy plot machinations.Except for Jaggers, Estella, and Miss Havisham, \\"Great Expectations\\" suffers from an uninteresting cast of supporting characters. But when you have three such meaty characters, not to mention the noble yet shifting Pip at the center, you have one eminently worthy novel. Add to that Dickens' descriptive abilities, and that harrowing opening, and \\"Great Expectations\\" delivers most of the way on its title's promise."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i enjoy these barnes and noble editions. pocket books make a nice addition to the library."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I do pretty much all my \\"reading\\" on audio books these days and Michael Page is probably my favorite narrator so far. He changes his voice for each character in a way that sounds so natural and undistracting, and his female voices are not annoying (I think the mark of a really great narrator is how undistracting their \\"opposite gender\\" voices are.)The story of Great Expectations deserves to be told by someone of Page's talent. I first read it by accident when I was a kid, not realizing it was a classic (always avoided books I was supposed to read.) I liked it well enough then, but I love it now. The characters are interesting, the morality of the book is not preachy and it's such a substantial book that you can listen to it several times and still pick up some new insight or pleasure. If you're an impatient reader, the book is probably not for you. If you need action on every page, you might get bored. But if you are a people person and you like getting to know the characters of a book, if you like to look for truth in fiction, it's a great story, very well told."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well, I was looking through some of the reviews posted here on amazon just to get an idea of what to write because this is my first review, and saw that a few people said that you need to be an adult to read this book. I kind of understand what they mean because this is a pretty dense novel, as most of Dicken's writing is. However, I don't feel that an individual's determines his maturity as a reader, and so, I dont feel that people should be discouraging teenagers from reading this classic book.Having said that, let me discuss a few key points that are important to keep in mind when considering whether or not to buy the book. Firstly, this is a very difficult read, so unless you are accustomed to reading classical fiction, be prepared to devote more time to reading the book than you generally would to a novel of similar length (450ish pages). Furthermore, the book is a drag at times, especially in during the first part. Often times, I would get lost while reading the book because I couldn't focus on the descriptions which seemed to get in the way of the plot. However, I have to give Dickens credit on doing a remarkable job of writing the dialogue between characters which allows the reader to immerse into the story. Whenever I wasn't lost, I would often feel as if I was right in the center of the scene and could vividly visualize what was going on around the protagonist.As for the theme of the book, I felt that it tried to impart a good, however slightly shallow, message on the reader. By the end of the book, it is very clear what the message is as all of the characters get what they deserve. However, having read a lot of philosophical literature, I feel compelled on extracting deeper meaning from everything around me, which is kind of hard to do from this book.My recommendation of this book would depend on the reader, I feel that if you have read another book of a similar genre or time period, then you would really enjoy this book otherwise it might be very boring. If this is your first time reading a book by a classical writer, might I recommend visiting sparknotes after every couple of chapters to get a clearer understanding of the plot. Also, I would recommend to every single person to only buy this book if they can dedicate significant time to reading it. Don't think this is one of those books that you can just read anytime you have a few minutes here or there because you will be lost and won't understand it at all. I feel it would be best to sit down and just read for an hour or two (depending on your attention span) and delve deep into the world of the characters. Not only does this process make identifying character development easier, it also makes the book more enjoyable.Also, for anyone who finds Dicken's writing style interesting, I recommend looking at David Copperfeild (just read the first paragraph, and you will be hooked)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It was hard to get into for the first 200 pages. The end was nice though. It was not as good as I expected it to be. Not one of Dickens's best. David Copperfield was much better."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"HAHAHHAH696"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I too have been out of school for some time. I decided explore the classics. Mr. Dickens has such a command of the English language so much so that I could not put it down. He expatiated very well throughout the entire pages of the book. I did not read it without my dictionary; which is the reason I read it to expand my vocabulary. After reading this book television became very boring to me. My favorite is Joe Gargery and John Wemmick. Joe because of his stick-to-itiveness. He is the same no matter what. The latter because of his ability to separate work with Jaggers from home. He enjoys life to the max and loves his father so. Pip is also to be appreciated for he does see what is most important in life and the value of love is what is important. After reading this book I have embarked on two others: Much Ado About Nothing (which I have thorougly enjoy) and Silas Marner which is great also. I hope everyone can find the enjoyment of reading for pleasure and learning as I have. Happy reading"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A great book in concept. However, Dickens was apparently paid by the word. Especially the silly ones, like &quot;prithee&quot; and &quot;vittles&quot;. It is time that we stopped attacking freshmen honors students with this pretentious book, which serves only to drive them away from English forever. Nowhere near the best of Dicken's work, the book reads like a 19th century soap opera, without bathroom breaks and Snuggle-bear commercials. By the time the first interesting character returns to the novel, the reader is lucky if he or she hasn't choked to death on tears of frustration. Why is Estelle such a b****? Why is Ms. Havisham such an old hag? Why is Pip so utterly slackjawed that he permits 20 years of idiocy to be perpetrated upon his stale English carcass? Why, after all, doesn't his benefactor take care of business, murder the lot, and turn this into something vaguely enjoyable? Never mind the fact that Dickens couldn't choose an end, he apparently couldn't even choose a plot, wavering wildly between romance and mystery and the sort of English politics that Michael Palin would love to throw his pasty-white Anglo-Saxon hands about and throttle. Especially the politics. Do we really care about how an English attorney carries himself when we're 15 years old? Not bleeding likely. Powdered wigs and leg stockings sum up the bizarre nature of the staying power of this novel. It's about time that High School English teachers stopped telling one another how *good* this book is, and read it themselves, without the Norton Critical Teacher's Edition beside them. Especially when they have the advantage of alcoholic beverages."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm an eighth grade student forced to read this book for English class. Most people would probably assume that the book sucks. Guess what? It does. I'm sorry, but Charles Dickens does not happen to be my cup of tea. He may be a master, but it's impossible to deny that his writing is dry and the story drags in many places. I counted numerous parts of the novel that could have easily been eliminated without affecting the rest of the book. And what the h*** is Pip thinking at the end when he decides to marry (person who I will not name)? Seems to me his only reason for doing this is that he's completely desperate and tired of chasing after Estella all that time. It totally came out of nowhere and wasn't very realistic. The book's really not that bad, but apart from the interesting episodes with Miss Havisham, it's pretty boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Some may call me a classic book snob, but here it goes.Great expectations may be at times tedious and I won't deny that, but it is worth it.Charles Dickens goes into great depth of detail and at times a bit overly detailed and I'm sure that is where many people get lost. But if you get the main plot, then you can get the jiff of it.The characters in this book transcend time.Pip, the poor boy who finds himself wondering if he can love old Joe know that he is rich.Estella who cannot love truly but yet brought up to love and destroy.Miss Havisham, the old rich woman who had her heartbroken and know is trying her best to seek revenge.Joe, Biddy and others also play a pivotal role.The story itself plays on the role of moral and also mercy. It shows a colorful and at times exaggerated array of feelings. From grief to greed, to deceit and happiness.Pip, a lonely orphan and living with his sister, finds and help a criminal. Although it was not completely of his own will.Then Pip is introduced to the sad and luxurious world of Miss Havisham where he met Estella, the girl he loved from then on.From then on he resents his meager living until one day he finds out that he had just inherited a large fortune.Then on Pip goes on a quest to truly become a gentleman and win Estella's heart.But how can he win Estella's heart when she doesn't have one?Can he really forsake his family for money?Who gave him that money?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The kindle text is fine, but please be alerted that the link provided to get the free audiobook takes you to some japanese website that has nothing to do with Great Expectations that I could find."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a really good new book.

But why, for example, doesn't Pip use the Internet to look things up? Stuff like that. Still, it's a good read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" has often been claimed as a masterpiece, a classic, a book hailed through the ages as wonderful. However, I find that while its messages are eternal, Dickens's style is very off-putting. Don't get me wrong, his prose is very, very beautiful, and his characters are layered in a way that many modern novelists seem to forget. Yet his descriptions are extraordinarily, unnecessarily lengthy. It's a novel, not a travel magazine. Considering that Dickens wrote this novel as chapters to be published weekly in a newspaper, it's unsurprising how drawn-out the descriptions are (higher word count = higher profit). Also, by compiling all of his entries into one novel, you find repetition creeping in as you realize he redoes all of the unpleasantly elaborate descriptions from the previous few chapters over again. It's disappointing to read a book that takes you for either a dunce, or someone with short-term memory loss."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Ordered Great Expectations because it has been many years since I originally read it as a requirement for a literature class.

That convict has escaped with another, his enemy convict. They are captured in the end but the convict whom Pip aided gives Pip 2pounds and a shilling by his fellow convict later on.Then, Pip is taken to a rich lady, Miss Havisham&iexcl;s and meets proud and heartless Estella whom he falls in love with. Born in a quite a poor family in the country, he tries to be clever so that Estella does not call him common, and quite succeeds. And plus, fortune lays itself in his way by an unknown rich person. A lawyer, Mr. Jaggers knows the provider of the fortune but does not tell Pip who it is because the provider&iexcl;s wish is to let him/herself known when he/she is ready for it. And Pip goes off to London.In London, Pip is introduced to Mr. Matthew Pocket, a relation of Miss Havisham for Mr. Pocket is to be Pip&iexcl;s tutor. Pip lives with Mr. Pocket&iexcl;s son Mr. Herbert Pocket whom he had met before at Miss Havisham&iexcl;s when a child, and becomes very acquainted with him. His other acquaintance is Mr. Wemmick, who works for Mr. Jaggers. He has a different life at work and at home, that makes him peculiar. All this time Pip thinks that the &iexcl;unknown provider&iexcl; of his fortune is doubtlessly Miss Havisham and thinks that she wants Estella and him to be married. However, he finds out that in fact it is not Miss Havisham who gave him his fortune but the old convict he had helped! That convict had escaped again and fled to Australia where he had worked for Pip and had become an owner of quite some money which was given to Pip. And now he comes to Pip and tells him. So that convict is known to Herbert as well and they live together.Now, when Pip was young, his parents had died so he lived with his sister&iexcl;s family. Joe, his brother-in-law is a good friend of his, a blacksmith, but his own sister is not very nice to him. A man called Orlick, who was Joe&iexcl;s helper, thinks very ill of Pip&iexcl;s sister and one day, hits her on the head and makes her a simpleton and she dies after some years. That man Orlick, tries to murder Pip for false reasons but fails for Pip&iexcl;s friends save him.The convict, if captured, would be hanged, therefore, Pip decides that the convict should be out of England as soon as possible and that Pip should accompany him. They plan it, and it proceeds. Meanwhile, Estella is married to a quite rich man and Miss Havisham is dead. The other convict who had escaped with Pip&iexcl;s that long time ago, Pip&iexcl;s convict&iexcl;s foe, follows Pip and the convict on their way out of England and tries to capture them. There is a fight underwater, Pip&iexcl;s convict is alive but is soon captured by the police and his foe is dead underwater. Pip&iexcl;s convict, named Magwitch or Provis is deeply wounded, and dies in prison. Before he dies, Pip finds out that Estella was adopted by Miss Havisham and that her father is Provis, so tells Provis that and that Pip loves his daughter. After that, Provis dies.Pip has an old acquaintance in the country, his hometown, a lady named Biddy. He decides to propose to her, now that Estella is gone, and leaves to the country only to find that Biddy is already married to Joe! He congratulates them and thinks about another little Pip to be in that house, just like he was when he was young. He then departs abroad to where Herbert works, for when Pip was a possessor of a fortune, he had secretly found Herbert that job, and Herbert, not knowing the provider of such a job had invited Pip to be a clerk. Pip lives abroad for eleven years, meanwhile Herbert marries and Pip becomes their &iexcl;partner in the House&iexcl;.After those 11years, he returns to Joe and Biddy&iexcl;s abode where he finds himself there! Named Pip after Pip was a little boy! Pip is warmly greeted, and after dinner, Biddy, who knows all about Estella for Pip had told her when he was young, asks if he surely does not fret for her? Pip replies that he thinks not, but anyway, revisits Miss Havisham&iexcl;s old house. The buildings are taken down, but among the ruins, stands Estella! Her husband had died most unfortunately because of a horse but even before his death, her marriage was not led to be a happy one. For all Pip knew, she was married again, but she was not. Pip and Estella converse about their interests, and Pip says, &iexcl;We are friends.&iexcl; To which Estella continues, &iexcl;And will continue friends apart.&iexcl; Then there is a nice little paragraph, which, if I am not quite mistaken proves that they are married.When I was reading this fantastic novel, I saw a lot of things. On my reading of pre-20th century novels, I only encountered those which were in third person, or first person, but &iexcl;I&iexcl; as a girl, not a boy. Great Expectations was something new, for I had thought that a boy liking a girl is to be quite different from a girl liking a boy and a boy&iexcl;s thoughts about poverty and being ignorant is to be quite different from a girl but I found out that it&iexcl;s quite the same. I mean, it depends on one&iexcl;s character and personality of course, but I found out that some boys do not like telling lies or stealing as much as girls and adults do not. It is a fantastic novel, an excellent read, and although the ending is not originally Charles Dicken&iexcl;s idea, I think Dickens made a great decision to follow what his friend suggested. For the original ending was a sad one, which would have made the reader very unhappy for Pip, whereas the new ending gives some hope and happiness to the reader. I read from a book on Great Expectations that the title, Great Expectations, meant not only Pip&iexcl;s expectations but the reader&iexcl;s of Dickens&iexcl; novels&iexcl; expectations. I surely think that those expectations were rewarded to perfection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was forced to read Great Expectations in the ninth grade, and i am still in the ninth grade, so yeah.

Of course, the moral of the story is, even when you have everything you want, money still cannot buy you love nor necessarily happiness.Other than that, this is yet another one of Charles Dickens' reads, that is classical, and will help expand on your vocabulary, and build on reading comprehension. My opinion is if we can understand the story that Charles Dickens has created ever so descriptively here, and in other stories, then we will understand present day literature, as it appears much easier to comprehend (from my personal perspective)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Really good book.

The book starts out when he is 8 years old and he is in a grave yard when an escaped convict comes up to him and demands that he get him some food and a file, so he can get out of his ankle cuffs. Pip does as he is asked and doesn't tell a sole like he had sworn too. The story then continues to follow Pips life as he gets older.This book is an English novel written by Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens wrote many books, of which a couple are required reading by English classes. Great Expectations is a well written book in which the surroundings, characters and noises are well described. Although Great Expectations is well written I feel that the story is a little slow to pick up and, it is hard to become engrossed into the book because it seems a little monotone. In later chapters you can also guess at what might be coming next.Great Expectations though slow to pick up, does have a good, solid story line and can be entertaining to read once you pass the first chapter. This would not be a good book for people who like action books or books with a lot of twists and turns that keep you reading to see what comes next. But if you like a slower paced book with maybe a hint of love in it with a less gripping more predictable out come then Great Expectations would be a good pick."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well, unlike the multitudes in America, I was NOT forced to read \\"Great Expectations\\" in high school or at any other time. However, lately it seemed like it was time to pick up this old classic and to dig into its treasures.The story starts out with an unlikely scene in a graveyard in a small English village. There we meet a little boy named Pip, who is visiting the gravesites of both of his parents. There we also meet a desperate convict who is cowardly enough to scare the little boy half to death in order to get some food and other items. Pip - an earnest, battered little orphan being raised by his sister and brother-in-law - anxiously sets out to please this convict. And so starts the tale of Pip's life.After the convict scene, Dickens takes his time in setting up exactly what Pip's life was like as he was groomed to take his brother-in-laws place as the blacksmith in the town. Dickens' genius for wit, along with some very likeable characters, help pull the reader through the endless pages of details and slow action.Soon, however, Pip's fortunes change...and then they change again...and then yet again. Yet, while the storyline somewhat resembles a roller coaster, the pacing is so slow that one is never overwhelmed by the action. In fact, I was rather underwhelmed by the amount of action there was for the number of words I was reading.Even so, I would say that this book is worth the effort. Dickens explores human nature of an average man when beset by a number of unusual situations, each one building on the last. Pip is likeable in these scenarios because he is never obnoxiously perfect or unaffected by his changing fortunes. In some ways, he \\"learns his lesson\\" by the end. In others, he does not.While Dickens tackles some rather weighty issues in this book, he does so in his distinctive, chipper, witty manner. Thus, one never really understands the emotional depths that the characters experience due to either their oppressive or their opulent fortunes. But, of course, one does not go to Dickens for emotional depth. One reads Dickens for explorations of tough circumstances with happy endings. If that is what the reader wants, Dickens is probably as able to handle the issues as anyone."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"* * * * * * * * *&quot;Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of ourtears, for they are rain upon the blinding dustof earth, overlying our hard hearts.

It is in booklet format with 3 ring binder holes for easy transportation. The book starts out by giving instructions on how to notate music which includes exercises on re-writing musical examples. This is unique for beginning materials as it has the student re-write music in different beat levels. This is exceptional as it teaches the student reading skills without them even being told that they are doing just that.The method comes with a companion cd that has recorded musical examples that go along with the written music that is in the text. All exercises in the book are written in large style text for easy reading. There is even a chapter dealing exclusively with the keyboard. Students need these skills so it is best to introduce the instrument as early as possible. In contrast to other texts of this style (workbook based) it does not just give a myriad of exercises, it makes sure that the student fully understands why he or she is completing the work which leads to a concept mastered.The text helps the student to understand how to write notation for themselves on paper. There are examples of correct and incorrect notation. Many texts, I feel introduce the computer based programs too early. They are necessary in this day and age because that is the direction in which society is headed. Paper and pencil; however is still common ground for most educated persons at this point in society. It is for that reason that I favor pencil and paper in the education process at least initially and then allow the student to make up their own mind which direction to proceed. There are many composers today that still favor paper and pencil over computer programs and later have a copyist translate their work into digital format. John Williams (Star Wars) is one that comes to mind.Chapters proceed as with major scales, keys, and the order of sharps and flats. These concepts are presented simply and in a basic format with little expounding of ideas. This appeals to younger students as it is the least confusing. I like how the author assumes that the student does not know concepts until they are taught. Many methods assume the student knows more than they actually do.When intervals are taught, the keyboard picture is always present and then the explanation of how they construct scales. The concept of the circle of 5ths is brought up at the end of the interval chapter rather than the beginning like many texts do. This is helpful as it limits confusion. It is best to not introduce a concept until you are sure everyone understands and then it is best to proceed from there.Minor scales and keys are presented with a look visually at a keyboard. A written musical example is given. The relative major is explained at this time adequately and thoroughlyChapters proceed with information on root position triads, inversions and then diatonic relationships. I feel that diatonic harmony should be introduced before root position triads and their inversions but the instructor could reverse this if they preferred to. The final chapter culminates with cadences, seventh chords and voice leading. Unfortunately, these concepts are merely touched upon rather than explaining in more detail. The information on voice leading amounts to only one paragraph of written information. Possibly, the author intended for this information to be expounded upon in a further volume. If that is the case, one would need to extend the teaching by using another work or to expound upon the material. I like the text and would use it in a high school or possibly in a community college setting. I would not use it in a university except for remediation as it does not explain voice leading and 4 part harmony in any great detail."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Music","review":"I have the 3rd edition of this book and I have to say, it takes a while to get through this book, but it is really went written! I've learnt so much abut music theory from this book that I never could seem to understand from all the other books I have."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Music","review":"Author of the book has done a great job explaining the fundamentals of notations used to read/write compositions."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Music","review":"This book has a very clear and simple approach to music fundamentals and theory. Chapter 7 and onwards is the 'real stuff.' You are introduced to scales, keys, the circle of fifths (don't let the name intimidate you, it's just a neat circle for arranging keys). To put it in very un-musical terms, keys are the \\"holders or masters\\" of scales. Scales are basically a set of notes, that \\"sound good together.\\" Bb is a note (most people know that but i'm still mentioning it for some unknown unknowledgeable reader). Say you have a Bb minor scale, that scale \\"produces\\" sounds that give off a Bb \\"flavor\\" or color. Scales are neat.Chapter 9 and onwards focus on triads. A triad is basically a harmonic arrangement of three notes, stacked in thirds (or 'vertically' for the purpose of this review). Basically, if you have a major triad then it sound \\"good and square.\\" But say you want to make...you know, actual organic music, and not just a happy yellow song. This is where music theory comes in.The next few chapters in the book entertain you with triads. You can do alot of things to traids, you can invert them. Think of a bird, now think of this exact bird if it were smaller. Both the big and the small birds would sing the same notes but the \\"pitches\\" would be different. The smaller bird would produce a higher pitch, or something like that, but the idea is that both birds are singing the same note. This is basically the octave concept.This book has a lot of practical value even if you're not a music person, triads in particular are extremely important. You can invert them, change their quality (sound, dark, happy, etc). If you have a piano or guitar lying around, do this: play a C triad, (C E G notes together). Now flat that e, or \\"play a d#\\"). A single note makes a big difference. if you flat both the E and the G, you get a diminished. There are many other complications & neat stuff (but of course, to musicians this is 'common sense'). Hope this helped. It's a good book."},{"Title":"Taste of Home's Contest Winning Annual Recipes 2005","review":"This is the second set of Contest Winning Annual Recipes from Taste of Home.

Similar excessive detail is given to SQL command syntax (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, etc.) and SQL function references.The first three chapters are essentially how to use Visual Studio, how to use Active Sync, and how to use Query Analyzer. All are covered accurately, but no real insight on any of them.So 311 pages into the book I finally get to something meaningful, Remote Data Access. Sorry, the chapter walks me, with full page screenshots, through the steps of the wizard to set up RDA. It then gives full source code (in C# and VB) to a simplistic example.

Subcategories of research touch upon the transition of China's economy from the failed Maoist experiments to its present \`Socialist Market Economy' hybrid state, the dynamism of China's \`Special Economic Zones,' or the prospects for the collapse of China's financial and industrial sectors. While the bulk of this research represents high scholarly standards, there is a lack of research that looks beneath the systemic features of Chinese economic reforms. China's Provinces in Reform addresses this concern. China's Provinces in Reform analyzes the past, present, and future economic features of selected individual Chinese provinces, with a specific focus on much-ignored provinces, including Guangxi and Zhejiang. The results are impressive, with the assembled researchers doing much to fill in the gaps in recent Chinese economic research. After assessing the future economic prospects of the provinces covered in this book, it becomes quite clear that China's drive toward economic modernization will only become more difficult in the future. The general reader should find this book accessible. Although China's Provinces in Reform was written by specialists for specialists, this volume avoids the temptation of becoming bogged down in overly technical analysis. Editor David Goodman has managed to maintain an even quality standard throughout this volume, avoiding the fate of many volumes containing contributions from multiple scholars. China's Provinces in Reform is recommended for any reader wishing to deepen their understanding of the issues facing China's economic reform drive."},{"Title":"...

Eothen is a wonderfully engaging tale of a traveler and the people he encounters in what was at the time a formidable journey. We are fortunate that it is back in print, bibliophiles treasure the early, leather-bound editions."},{"Title":"... Eothen,","review":"If you've ever had a dream to travel outside of your own backyard, this book will give you the push you need to make that decision. Alexander Kinglake takes you through the exotic east by the most interesting modes of transportation. Horseback, Camels, Dromedaries, and fantastic sea vessels. You'll travel through places such as Stanboul, Constantinople, Cyprus, Galilee, Cairo, the Pyramids, and Jerusalem just to name a few.A brilliant descriptive writer, Kinglake tells you every detail about what he's viewing along the way, along with the emotional side of traveling through history. Standing on a hilltop, possibly the precise spot where Homer did, that inspired his works, Kinglake takes you there with him, describing unchanged landscape and the flood of emotions that will definately touch you. When he arrived at the Holy lands, it left me in tears, and a great yearning to plan my own pilgrimage there.It amazed me that this man made it through his travels safe and sound. He survived the plague which was rampant at that time. It was frightening to read about, let alone live through it! Which he tells about in depth. The extreme fear everyone lived in. Yet despite all the precautions taken, it still managed to seek you out and take you into it's unimaginable numbers. Day after day, he watched cavalcades of funeral processions pass through the streets, from sunrise to well beyond sunset. How he fooled it, I'll never know. He always seemed to be in contact with plague stricken people, and even thought for a time that he too had fallen victim when symptoms began to appear.Through this journal you'll learn about the people of this era and before. The Ottomans, Bedouins, Monks, Jews, Catholics, and Christians. Aristocrats, such as Lady Hester, Sheiks, and Pasha's. Most interesting was Kinglake himself. Just who was this man? He tells little about his own background. But as you read, this intelligent, confident, diplomatic Englishman unfolds before you. With a sense of humor few can match!This book was gifted to me, and sparked the desire to be a part of what Kinglake and others knew about life. Not to let each day pass by caught up in mundane routines, but live each one to the fullest."},{"Title":"... Eothen,","review":"Eothen is a kind of quirky travelogue describing Alexander Kinglake's 1834 tour of the Near East; it was originally published in 1844.Kinglake, like many an English gentleman (and lady) of his era, is full of prejudices and preconceptions about other cultures and races. He takes \\"the natural ascendancy of Europeans\\" as a graven truth, and doesn't scruple at making sweeping generalizations about Arabs, Jews, Turks, Greeks, and everyone else he encounters. The book, for this reason, probably reveals more about Kinglake than it does about the places he travelled. His descriptions of the customs and characters he observes are those of \\"a partial, prejudiced, & ignorant\\" outsider, and for that reason must be viewed with skepticism - but they are wonderfully entertaining all the same.Here is an example of the witty style that makes this book delightful to read:\\"Christianity permits, and sanctions, the drinking of wine, and of all the holy brethren in Palestine there are none who hold fast to this gladsome rite so strenuously as the monks of Damascus; not that they are more zealous Christians than the rest of their fellows in the Holy Land, but that they have better wine. Whilst I was at Damascus I had my quarters at the Franciscan convent there, and very soon after my arrival I asked one of the monks to let me know something of the spots that deserved to be seen... \\"There is nothing in all Damascus,\\" said the good man, \\"half so well worth seeing as our cellars\\"; and forthwith he invited me to go, see, and admire the long range of liquid treasure that he and his brethren had laid up for themselves on earth. And these I soon found were not as the treasures of the miser, that lie in unprofitable disuse, for day by day, and hour by hour, the golden juice ascended from the dark recesses of the cellar to the uppermost brains of the friars...\\"Highly recommended."},{"Title":"...

Eothen,","review":"\\"Eothen\\" is a marvellous source of Victorian \\"Orientalism\\". Completely unconscious, Alexander William Kingsley, projects his British self into alien worlds equipped with such phrases as \\"soft Asiatic\\", and \\"the Oriental\\", or, \\"my poor Arabs being on foot\\", and his \\"dragoman\\" doing his bullying for him (which he feels is utterly necessary in the desert which he crosses partially guided by a Bedouin caravan. Kinglake knows only a few word of Arabic but is full of opinions about the \\"Asian\\" man. The most famous scene in the book is set in the midst of the desert, when after days of travelling alone (with his Arab retinue) another Englishman on camel-back appears on the horizon going into the opposite direction. While the Arabs who are in their employ will not be deprived of the pleasure of exchanging greetings and news, the two Englishmen would have passed one another by simply by doffing their caps and waiving their arms, as they would have in London. In fact they pass one another and only turn around , on second thought, when they had passed each other by forty yards. The other gentleman, an Army Officer, on of the \\"few thousand satrong Englishmen to whome the empire of INdia is committed\\".\\"Eothen\\" then is about British empire, therefore, and travelling enabled by British banks and their global outlets. For the home reader it created the romance of far places, but closed channels of communication rather than opening them, and created the possibility of disrespect based on superficial judgements, failing to see that travelling only puts the traveller in touch with a minute part of foreign society, and only for a short time. We still have to overcome such travel writing, and it is instructive to see the precedents of contemporary attitudes to \\"the East\\"."},{"Title":"... Eothen,","review":"Amazon asked me to review this purchase, however, my review is limited to the purpose for which I bought my second copy of Eothen.I bought the book not to read it, but only for the artwork by Sir Francis \\"Frank\\" Brangwyn one of the greatest painters of his era. I am an architect and painter and exhibit my work worldwide and Brangwyn's work inspired me since boyhood. He is what artist's call, \\"a painters painter.\\" His art is colorful, rapidly painted and with a style that bridged Impressionism and realism and created a style of his own which inspired many painters and illustrators here and abroad. In fact, after many years of being one of America's greatest illustrators, the great Dean Cornwell, \\"Dean of Illustrators\\" put aside his multi-million dollar career as illustrator to move overseas to study with Brangwyn and dedicate himself to Mural painting. He only then illustrated when he needed cash, as mural painting did not pay well.In Eothen, there are twelve full color illustrations. My only regret is that they are reproduced at a very small scale and the reproductions are thus not as clear as I would prefer. Never the less, they are Brangwyn's and any bit of Brangwyn art is a sacred thing for painters/illustrators who specialize in figure painting. I have a large collection of larger, brilliantly colored reproductions of the art of Frank Brangwyn and often have one or more propped up on my easel for inspiration. I rated it only four stars because of the small size and less clear reproductions of the masters work. Brangwyn was the inspiration for several decades of painters and illustrators including Dean Cornwell and at the American Academy of Art the most prized books were anything with prints of Brangwyn in them, especially full color prints. His paintings were recognizable to many students and lovers of art. The brush strokes are lush like smooth splashes of colored butter. He was a wizard at handing the brush, where he appeared to splash the paint on rapidly and yet accurately. The brilliance of color, technique and lavish brush work is a feast for the eyes. Some of the greatly influenced by Brangwyn and therefore away from dry academic photo realism.Most copies of the works of Frank Brangwyn are out of print, as are many of the books he illustrated, as is this version of Eothen. However, even now 50 years after his death at a ripe old age, artists who specialize in figure painting still seek out his work and every now and then a new publication comes forth with excellent reproductions. If you like Brangwyn's brand of Impressionism, which is closer to Italian, Spanish and Russian Impressionism you can search the net for reproductions of his works.EOTHEN OR TRACES OF TRAVEL BROUGHT HOME FROM THE EASTworksEOTHEN OR TRACES OF TRAVEL BROUGHT HOME FROM THE EAST"},{"Title":"...

(They form a loosely-connected trilogy and should be read in order for best effect.) I was worried that they might not live up to the standard of her later works, that they might somehow spoil my appreciation of what I've come to regard as one of the greatest bodies of work of any author.My hesitation was misplaced. These stories bring LeGuin's anthropologist's eye; deft hand for character; and talent to create unknown, fully detailed worlds together as well as any of her other novels. The opener, Rocannon's World, shows what happens when an anthropological expedition to a new planet gets tangled in bureaucracy before going suddenly wrong. Planet in Exile, set 600 years later, follows a tale of two cultures - one alien, one human - forced to meld into one. Finally, World of Illusion closes the circle, showing us the final confrontation between humankind and the mysterious race variously known as the Shing, the Lords of Es Toch, the Enemy, and the Liars of Earth.Like all LeGuin's work, the thrill-ride is subtle; some of the themes hit you late, sort of like the heat from a chipotle pepper that's been simmering in soup for a couple hours. The reward of reading LeGuin is a pleasure not to be missed and I'd recommend this book for any SF fan."},{"Title":"Worlds of Exile and Illusion: Three Complete Novels of the Hainish Series in One Volume--Rocannon's World; Planet of Exile; City of Illusions","review":"There were these 3 books, Ursula Leguin's first science fiction novels.

Leguin's skill as a writer is evident in these books, and while they may lack some of the weight of the &quot;Left Hand&quot;, they also are more concise and exciting. Leguin is a rarity in the sci-fi field, she is such a good writer that you are drawn into the worlds she creates. It is easy to forget that you are reading works of fiction when reading these books; the narratives and characterizations have the force of non-fiction.

As I just rediscovered -- my copy (with an evocative Josh Kirby cover) dates from the early 70's, and I don't recall rereading it since then. I was prompted to do so by a recent reread of her stunning \\"Semley's Necklace\\" (1964), another story in Le Guin's Hainish universe, which she recycled as the prologue to Rocannon's World.While PoE doesn't have the depth or complexity of her best work, this is a grand, mythic story of love and death; fear of the stranger, and the sad consequences; a bitter battle to save one's home; the joys and ashes of victory. And the grey, grinding cold of Great Winter: 5,000-some days of darkness, cold and ice (UKL does winters really well). Strong stuff.My God, this was her apprentice work!The rest of RW, after \\"Semley's Necklace\\", isn't up to PoE, but is quite readable.

First, the publisher's subtitle, Three Complete Novels of the Hainish Series, is a bit misleading. These early novels are set in a very different universe from the Hainish Ekumen--the League of All Worlds, formed to resist the inevitable onslaught of The Enemy, and the aftermath of that onslaught. Hain is barely mentioned in these novels (twice, by my count), and the League is completely different in character from the non-interventionist Ekumen which Le Guin develops in detail in her later work. A key theme of these three novels is telepathy (mindspeech, mindhearing), which plays a very minor role in The Left Hand of Darkness and pretty much drops out of her later Hainish writings, as does the Enemy (the Shing), who are never mentioned again.Second, as an anthropologist, I feel that these novels lack the deep understanding of anthropological fieldwork and the stunning ability to create believable non-Terran societies that characterize her later work, in particular The Left Hand of Darkness, The Telling, and many of her short story collections. These novels are much closer to traditional SF, strong on action and conflict. The \\"enemies\\" in Rocannon's World (the Faradayan rebels) and Planet of Exile (the Gaal) are barely sketched, and even in City of Illusions the Shing are portrayed as simply evil; this is very different from the subtle, complex descriptions of Orgoreyn in The Left Hand of Darkness or the Monitor in The Telling.These novels are \\"good reads\\" for those who like traditional SF, and fascinating as precursors to her later work, but to really appreciate LeGuin's genius, read her later work."},{"Title":"Worlds of Exile and Illusion: Three Complete Novels of the Hainish Series in One Volume--Rocannon's World; Planet of Exile; City of Illusions","review":"Having battled for months just to find LeGuin's City of Illusions, this three-in one edition was a real find! LeGuin is a rare breed in sf, the poetry in her narrative and her powers of description add a compelling truth and depth to her stories. They also make her an accessible author for mainstream readers; particularly as the issues she explores in this book are very human and relevant today, but set in beautifully crafted worlds of splendour or depravity which magnify the topics she explores.

She displays how even early in her career, she could spin facinating stories. Rocannon's World was great fun with trogs, knights, and flying felines. Planet of Exile seems like a place not unlike Mongolia in the time of Ghengis Khan--which just happens to have a village of aliens living near by. Of course the barbarians think the aliens are witches. City of Illusions begins with an alien from the Planet of Exile who is suffering from amnesia and must walk across the USA from the Eastern Hardwood Forrest to a canyon-edged city (Grand Canyon?) to find his lost identity. Well written but this last is the most frustrating because it just stops--there is no conclusion. Did Ursula run out of paper? or typewriter ribbon? What is the 4th book in this series? What ever happened to the characters in City of Illusion? All three are a great read--just a dumb ending. Was that writers' block or is there a 4th book?

These works are ostensibly related to LHoD, dealing with formation and history of the Hainish League.The first novella, Rocannon's World, has virtually nothing to do with science fiction, instead being almost entirely a work of fantasy, and not particularly good fantasy at that. Rocannon is something of an anthropological surveyor on behalf of the Hainish League, attempting to establish technologically advanced civilizations in order to present a line of defense against an anticipated invasion from outside the galaxy.The story presents a collection of life forms which are strikingly similar to Tolkien's elves, dwarves and even classes of men. Again, not particularly original and not very captivating. Two and a half stars.The final two novellas, Planet of Exile and City of Illusions, are really neither fantasy nor science fiction. Each is more about the interaction between intelligent hominid species, and though I was expecting science fiction, I enjoyed these two stories significantly more than the first.In Planet of Exile, we have three vastly different cultures interacting against a highly unusual planetary climate pattern (unusual from our perspective). The World of Werel contains two native hominid species, the Tevarans, of roughly Iron Age technological proficiency, and the Gaal, more Stone Age in sophistication. Add to these, the Farborn, a much more technologically advanced species (from Earth, as it turns out), which has been on Werel for roughly 600 years. Part of an advance party from the Hainish League, they have ostensibly been exiled, supposedly as a result of a successful galactic invasion by the Shing.The planet of Werel has a moon phase of 400 days, and an elliptical orbit of 60 moon phases. Thus, each \\"season\\" lasts roughly 15-20 years. Our story is set at the onset of Winter and the seasonal migration of the Gaal through Tevaran lands. Always warlike, the Gaal have organized this Winter and are a very real threat to the civilizations of the Tevar and the Farborn. Prejudice, jealousy and distrust mark the relationship between the two species as they attempt to cooperate against their much more numerous and savage opponents. Four stars.The final novella, City of Illusion, finally introduces us to the Shing, the galactic invaders who threaten the Hainish League. In fact, the setting for this story is the Earth, far in the future, following its conquest by the Shing. We are introduced to Falk, a non-human hominid who finds himself stranded in a forested region of the United States (seemingly near Kentucky), without any memory of his past, only a desire to travel West to the Shing city of Es Toch, where he hopes to learn of his identity and past.Falk undergoes much hardship and experiences many adventures during his travels through the virtually deserted and depopulated United Sates, which eventually lead to Es Toch (located in southern Utah or northern Arizona). The experiences of Falk upon reaching Es Toch neatly tie up all the loose ends, binding the three novellas together. Four and a half stars.These final two novellas should be required reading for college level Anthropology majors."},{"Title":"Worlds of Exile and Illusion: Three Complete Novels of the Hainish Series in One Volume--Rocannon's World; Planet of Exile; City of Illusions","review":"It's wonderful to have these three related books in one binding.

Written from the viewpoint of a Native American fighting to keep from losing the most important things in his life-his marriage and his land. A lone man fighting greedy businessmen and his own people, who view him as a traitor, to save his resort and his marriage. Not knowing if he can even trust his best friend, he sets on a path to save what he loves most and risks it all in doing so. I loved it, my mother loved it and by brother is reading it now. I was fortunate enough to have met the author's wife in a small book store and was able to get the book autographed. She also told me it was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. Here's hoping the book gets the attention it so greatly deserves. Anxiously awaiting the sequel due out in June, &quot;Six Crooked Highways.&quot;"},{"Title":"Don't Think Twice","review":"Wow. An incredible read with a social conscience. This reminded me in this way of the best of Barbara Kingsolver. Except that there's suspense here, a real mystery--the death of a small boy and a best friend deep in the Minnesota woods. A gorgeous setting--an old resort on a beautiful but sometimes ominous lake. And a real, complicated. and deeply loving relationship between a Native American and a white midwestern woman. There is very good writing here. I wish this one were getting the attention it deserves."},{"Title":"Don't Think Twice","review":"This is a part of the world I was familiar with having visited the North Minnesota woods as a kid. His descriptions of the area were accurate and his spending a large portion of his life there was evident.

Both of these drawbacks are negligible when you consider that it provides an awesome plot in an unforgettable and palpable world -- one you've probably never seen before. And for the first time since JD Carr, a mystery writer is crediting the audience with the kind of intelligence that draws them to mysteries in the first place. On top of that, it moves like a locomotive. You want stupid, read John Sandford's \\"Prey\\" novels.

I don't know, something about it bothered me, too much description, maybe, or was it that the descriptions all came in the form of lists, filled with commas, and really amounted to very little, not ,much?HIDE THE BALL? It's true that in a mystery the author is always keeping a great deal from the reader, it's the nature of the beast. In most mysteries however, whether first person or third, the protagonist is in the dark as well. In this case the narrator, Peter Two Persons (god, is this spelled out for or what?) knows so much more than he's telling, that one gets the feeling not only of being in the dark, but of being teased. Johnson is playing a game with the reader, and I find it infuriating.It's a shame, because I think if he had not worked so hard at being so lyrical , and had been a little more honest with his readers, Johnson would have had a really wonderful book here.By the way, has anybody ever looked at somebody's eyes and seen &quot;Blue with flecks of white&quot; in them?"},{"Title":"Don't Think Twice","review":"Well written, keeps you coming back.

By creating a model of Japan's death, Komatsu deftly exposes the how the Japanese see themselves, how they believe the world sees them, and who they are. As a foreigner in Japan for nine years who has read copiously on this country, this novel is among the most penetrating I've read. For those who aren't interested in dissecting the Japanese, they'll still be thrilled by this compelling tale of an entire nation's doom."},{"Title":"Japan Sinks: A Novel about Earthquakes","review":"I first spotted this book in the late 1990s. I recently got it because of my interest in the release of the recent film version from 2006 called \\"Nihon Chinbotsu\\".Is this book worth it? Yes. It is not only a fantastic work of Japanese science-fiction--which is very rarely translated and brought to the US--but as a disaster novel, it manages to capture the confusion and outright terror brought about by the sinking of Japan. This event, brought about by a major shift of the tectonic plates, causes a series of devastating earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, including the eruption of Mt. Fuji. The book is a fast read, with the last few pages being the equivalent of a punch in the gut as the Japanese struggle to deal with the inevitable outcome. Other issues are brought up, such as, what will the Japanese be without their home country? How will the world react to such an unprecedented disaster? And how does one go about evacuating over 110 million people?Ironically, I finished the book right before a major quake struck Japan recently. To say that I got one hell of a chill down my spine is an understatement. Strangely enough, this 1995 translation has an introduction written by Sakyo Komatsu that spoke about the tragic Kobe earthquake which had occurred earlier that year.In the end, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Japan Sinks: A Novel about Earthquakes","review":"I read this book a couple of months back with pleasure and excitement. It's extremely well written and translated, and its scenarios of disaster are only excelled by what we watched yesterday on the television as the tsunami generated by a real version of this book's events took place. Wikipedia wrote that the novel \\"represented the growing discontent in the minds of many Japanese people during the 1970s, as their cultural, economic, and political identity and stability had become under attack from international pressures\\" -- now, perhaps, we can see that the author was instead engaging with predicting the impact of a literal geological event."},{"Title":"Japan Sinks: A Novel about Earthquakes","review":"The following first few lines were added as of Summer of the year 2012: It is very sad for me to state this, but the author of this science fiction novel, Mr. Sakyo KOMATSU passed away in July, 2011: only a few months after the Great Thohoku Earthquakes and Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant's accidents in March of 2011. I would like to express my most sincere condolences to one of the biggest loss in the Japanese science fiction writers' community and to the Japanese literature cluture as a whole. Please find his ovituraries on any decent international magazines and news papers. It was such a loss for all of us here in Japan. RIP Komatsu Sakyo.Now, please note and understand that the following review was written and placed before my knowledge of the author's passing away happened in July of the same year.As most of you have already known, Mr. Sakyo KOMATSU has been a leader of the very best of those Japanese Science Fiction writers for the last fifty years and is still going strong. This particular master piece has probably been the most wellknown novel of his to Japanese fans. It has sold more than four million, thus 4,000,000 copies in not only in his native country of Japan but also in eleven other nations and languages, including this English translated version, in the world. What amazing things about this novel are: This entier novel of Japan's geological, topo-graphical, social, and historical fate was writen almost fourty years ago, when nobody knew about the real geophysical phenomenon of highly scientific subjects of plate-techtonics and geophyics; in fact, becasue of this science fiction by Sakyo Komatsu every single layman here in Japan know what the mantle crrents or the theory of the continental drifts by Weggener. These ideas were not mentioned or discussed about even in highschool textbooks then. This novel is just that much important to Japanese people's real concerns and knowledge on its erthquekes and tidal waves: The warnings raised herein the novel are still alive and they all seem so real. I do recomend to read this novel and feel how Japanese people felt in 1972 and then how hopeless or helpless we are in front of the great power of the mother nature, yet there are still some selected individuals, who are wise enough and good enough to forseen the changes and movements, would try to save their people and to survive through all these difficlulties their were placed. Just one another interesting, or in a sense, spine-chilling sensation about this novel is that much of its content are still readable and significat after all those years when we try to look at Japan's recent tsunami and nuclear desasters: Unfortunately what Mr.Komastu had wanted Japanese government to know and act on the natural national desasters were not followed or at least those early warnnings were not utelized fully by the real Japanese government. I believe there are only limited or few copies left on the market, so please get one while you can and see and experiance for yourself what they must have gone through for the past few months. I strongly recomend this novel to everyone who likes good and meaningful sciense fiction. Thank you."},{"Title":"Japan Sinks: A Novel about Earthquakes","review":"Strange events trouble Japanese scientists, then politicians and finally the whole populaiton. There is more and more earthquakes, even if most are very weak. A couple of small inhabited islands disappear, then a big bridge collapses without any warning. Migratory birds population on the islands is divided by ten...All of this happen on the first pages of this well written and quite ambitious, although rather short disaster novel by a renowned Japanese SF writer Sakyo Komatsu (1931-2011). And then, in accordance with Hitchock's rule for thrillers (\\"You begin with an earthquake and then you increase the tension\\"), things get more and more intense. At one moment the very survival of Japan becomes uncertain. What will be the result of all the efforts by scientists and politicians.Twice adapted on screen, with various success, this novel is certainly now a classic in disaster SF. The story is mostly shown through the eyes of four people: a batyscaphe pilot named Onodera, Japanese Prime Minister, an extravagant genius scientist professor Tadokoro and an ancient man named Watari, an extremely powerful behind-the-scenes manipulator of political life. Its originality resides in large part in its portrayal of politicians, soldiers and scientists as united in the effort to save Japanese population and react to the cataclysm to the best of their abilities. That really changes from the usual scheme of \\"incompetent politicians and crazy soldiers, who just get in the way of altruist scientists and journalists\\"... And the ending is particularly good.I liked this book. This is a good, solid thing. Maybe not exactly THE masterpiece of disaster SF, but certainly a very honest part of its hall of honor."},{"Title":"Album of Prehistoric Animals","review":"This is a great book to introduce the prehistoric mammals to your kid with.

While it's certainly encouraging that many lesbian and gay writers/producers/et al are now able (thanks to Ms. DeGeneres) to live their lives more openly, the book itself offers little insight other than Ellen DeGeneres and a couple of other passing (gay) cultural moments, such as Howard Ashman's lover's acceptance of his posthumous Academy Award. Being a supposed historical exploration, the book flips back and forth in time and era, never focusing on one person or subject long enough to discover anything insightful. Its coverage of the early part of Hollywood's gay history is slight at best, focusing mostly on Rock Hudson, and offers little to illuminate that situation. It has the depth and tone of a good magazine article, but as a book it doesn't offer enough: it seems padded, and interviews are quoted verbatim with every bit of bad syntax and \\"you know\\"'s intact. I learned nothing from this book that I wasn't aware of through soundbites on entertainment news shows. I really don't like writing a negative review, but reading this was increasingly frustrating and ultimately unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Open Secret: Gay Hollywood--1928-2000","review":"This book may as well be a horror novel in that Hollywood is still the same as it was in the 1920's. Cowardace, politics and money are still keepin celebrities in the closet while teenagers are still taking their own lives because they think they are alone. This book details what can happen to a person in Hollywood when they chose to STOP living a lie (Ellen, Geffen et al), but also how being out and themselves can never equal a dollar amount. Great Book!"},{"Title":"Open Secret: Gay Hollywood--1928-2000","review":"This book lifts a veil on a still rather taboo issue. A lot of well known people are mentioned in it, but I felt that most of the chapters were written more for insiders.Fortunately, this book contains some other important movie items which tell a lot about the Pharisaic mentality of the people who ran the studios.Hollywood's success story is built on its star system. A big panic broke out in the fifties of last century when one of Hollywood's superstars Ingrid Bergman left the US to marry the Italian director Roberto Rossellini. The movie bosses were shattered and thought that they would lose a big part of their public (box office). They launched a big smear campaign against the actress (adulteress...) and forced the movie critics to criticize heavily her new movies. The not so 'orthodox' behaviour of other superstars was left unblemished.The author unveils the real role of Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons as the 'Big Sisters' of Hollywood, spying on the stars and employees on behalf of the studio bosses. If the crew didn't behave as the bosses wanted they 'were called on the carpet and told - Unless you show yourself as a respectable person, you'll lose your contract'.I found this book a decent work on a difficult subject."},{"Title":"Open Secret: Gay Hollywood--1928-2000","review":"I didn't set this worthless book alight in order to save a precious match.Don't waste your time on this drivel.

You will be stunned and amazed...."},{"Title":"Open Secret: Gay Hollywood--1928-2000","review":"A breathless indictment of the hypocrisy that rules Hollywood. It exposes the willingness of the PR people and Studio Heads to hold back the truth about who is and who isn't gay. Moreover, it is a polemic that raises the question, &quot;If it is OK to be gay now, why don't more big stars come out of the closet?&quot; and answers it with clarity and rare insight."},{"Title":"Open Secret: Gay Hollywood--1928-2000","review":"This book talks alot and shows very little for it. Ehrenstein loves to gab and rehash tired rumors, but the point gets lost time and again as you slog thru this poorly written mess that's part trash, part trashy sociology. Really shoddy work. An annoying read."},{"Title":"Open Secret: Gay Hollywood--1928-2000","review":"The author examines Hollywood like it is a set decoration being used in a movie. He shows us the attractive scenery (the Hollywood that middle America sees every day), as well as behind the scenes: the nails, glue, and sandbags that hold the set in place. In this case, however, the nails, glue, and sandbags are decades of deception, denial, and hushed tones that the industry continues to use. Ehrenstein writes with a knowledgeable pen, yet rarely if ever comes across as smug or elitest. His narrative is conversational, but structured. It allows the reader to understand better many individual stories in Hollywood's past and present while showing them in context relative to time and social acceptance. &quot;Open Secret&quot; is well-written and comprehensive."},{"Title":"It's A Home Run, Charlie Brown! (Ready-To-Read: Level 2 Reading Together)","review":"Our grandson requested this book and I wasn't able to find it or even order it at any of the stores in our area. So, after finding it on Amazon an receiving it we were very pleased with the quality of the book. Can't wait to give it to him for Christmas."},{"Title":"It's A Home Run, Charlie Brown! (Ready-To-Read: Level 2 Reading Together)","review":"If you know anything about Charlie Brown as a baseball player then you know that the title of this Ready-to-Read book, &quot;It's a Home Run, Charlie Brown!&quot; has a bit of irony in it. That is because when the cover proclaims that this book is based on the comic strips of Charles M. Schulz it is talking specifically about the ones where the score is tied 3 to 3 in the bottom of the 9th with two outs and the best hitter for the Peanuts gang up to bat. I have never figured out who that particular batter would be, but what matters is that Charlie Brown is on third base and thinking about stealing home. This would involve running really fast towards home, which would be a &quot;home run,&quot; but not a home run. Charlie Brown is thinking that if he stole home and won the game for his team, which has never won a game before, that he would be a hero. But one of the other things we know about the wonderful world of &quot;Peanuts&quot; is that Charlie Brown never gets to be a hero.It is certainly nice to see this classic &quot;Peanuts&quot; story dressed up for a new generation of readers. Old readers will recognize most of what is in here from various comic strips Schulz did decades ago, which will bring just as a much of a smile as you will find on the faces of youngsters reading these stories for the first time. &quot;It's a Home Run, Charlie Brown!&quot; is adapted by Judy Katshke with art by Nick and Peter LoBianco, who have nicely captured the classic look of the Peanuts gang in color. This is a Level 2 Ready-to-Read book, which means youngsters are learning to read independently with stories that are more-complex. Schulz's classic comic strips are ideal for such an endeavor and there are plenty of other &quot;Peanuts&quot; books in the series for kids to turn to next."},{"Title":"Heroes in Hell","review":"This is red meat for fans of genre fiction-- in these shared-world stories, we see how various historical figures deal with being consigned to Hell.

When I got home, I read it in one sitting.This is a fascinating book. It is about character. Think. You've got all of these people. None of them were the nicest people in life. Cram them all together, and sparks fly. Yes, you could write a story where every character was nice. Your readers would be so bored that they'd use it instead of sleeping pills.The writers did a lot of research into the historical characters that they used. I actually had to pull out Josephus Flavius to check some of the background on Mark Anthony, Caesar Augustus, and Kleopatra (correct spelling, she was Greek, a descendent of one of Alexander the Great's generals).I actually fell in love with Kleopatra.

Dead bad guys battling it out in Hell? Who could ask for anything more? Twelve years later, after receiving this book as a gag trip-down-Memory-Lane gift, I am asking for EVERYTHING more! Normally a short story collection that uses a central theme is somehow connected and works towards a final goal or resolution, but this group of tales does neither. The main characters, all once great leaders and/or &quot;heroes&quot; in life, are in this book static and one-dimensional, never giving the reader any impression that they are included for any purpose other than to lend their famous names.

The short stories are linked in a way that implies heavy advance planning - they stand alone, but an overarching plot gives them context.The authors - all of them highly competent professionals in their own right - know their history, and they know how to write good stories. There's a lot of little easter eggs for those who know their history, but it's highly readable and very, very entertaining even with a layman's education."},{"Title":"Heroes in Hell","review":"This is the first volume of a series of shared world anthology books begun in 1986 and scheduled for re-release. In hell, various factions try to either escape or take over Satan's domain with the expected chances of success.

Often humorous and surprisingly thought provoking, I highly recommend this book - as well as the entire series it spawns - to any and all fans of fantasy fiction. And, if you like this book, watch for this summer's release of Lawyers in Hell, the first book in the rebirth of the series."},{"Title":"Heroes in Hell","review":"Janet Morris's best-selling 'Heroes in Hell' begins here. The series contains a Hugo-Award winner and several Nebula Award finalists. The stories and novels stretch over eleven volumes, including several novels such as 'The Little Helliad' by Chris and Janet Morris, and 'The Gates of Hell' by C.J. Cherryh and Janet Morris, two of my personal favorites. The premise of the series is that those remembered by history achieved their goals only by breaking the rules that govern the afterlife.So they're all here: the depraved, the heroic, the embittered and the idealistic.

It is a fascinating portrait of the history of modern acting and also of Russian history. Absolutely key for understanding the Method, and the development of today's theater."},{"Title":"My life in art","review":"Stanislavsky is still the most influential figure in modern or contemporary theater. In this book, he is open about his life especially the rough years in Russia, his first exposure to the theater, his first time at directing. He also writes about his professional relationship with another Russian, Anton Chekhov. He writes about his travels mostly in Russia such as his journeys to Petrograd, the Russian provinces that inspired many of Chekhov's plays, and of course his first journey abroad. The book is really for theater junkies like myself who would have loved to have been a theatrical actress or director but life isn't so bad. He has directed William Shakespeare's tragedies like Othello and Julius Caesar along with Chekhov favorites like The Cherry Orchard, The Three Sisters, Uncle Vanya and The Sea Gull. Stanislavsky also founded and developed the Moscow Theater Company. He did it all for love, not money nor fame. He became rich in so many other ways."},{"Title":"My life in art","review":"For those in the arts, and especially those in dramatic art, this book is a must. It is the account of the father of modern truthful acting and a look into what a life spent towards creating art is about. While at times the book can drag a bit and get wordy, there is too much insight and inspiration in this book to pass it by. It is so wonderful to have an account of this mans amazing life in his own words to read, study and eventually aim for.A must read for those of the stage!"},{"Title":"My life in art","review":"This book is Stanislavski account of his experiences in working at the Moscow Art Theatre that he Co-founded with Vladimir Danthcheko ( who also wrote a similar book from his perspective titled ' My life in the Russian Theatre').

Typically Ace, it doesn't quite live up to its hype. The twenty six stories collected here are not the \\"Best Science Fiction of the Century\\" by anybody's count, even Orson Scott Card's own. Card himself describes his selection process in the Introduction: these are stories he loved at the first reading, enjoys on repeat readings, and \\"[a]bove all, these are stories that I cannot forget.\\"I, however, *can* forget several of these stories - and already have, a mere few days after reading them. Most of the forgettable stories are the more recent ones, which is probably not a coincidence. Early science fiction (pre-1960s, let's say) is almost inherently more worthwhile than most later science fiction, and the stories selected here are cases in point. Terry Bisson's \\"Bears Discover Fire\\" is a meandering inanity. \\"Dog Fight\\" by William Gibson and Michael Swanwick is a drugs and sex tale, \\"appealing\\" only in the way that Trainspotting was \\"appealing.\\" \\"Rat\\" by James Patrick Kelly is similar.There are, however, some truly, truly great stories here, which more than merit four stars. \\"The Tunnel Under the World\\" by Frederick Pohl, for example, ends with a revelation worth the price of admission. \\"Inconstant Moon\\" by Larry Niven is full of emotional impact as two individuals adjust to the thought of the sun going nova. George R. R. Martin's \\"Sandkings\\", despite being relatively recent, is a story that would might expect from Stephen King at the top of his game. Heinlein's \\"All You Zombies-\\" is a time-travel story to make the head spin. James Blish's \\"A Work of Art\\" puts Richard Strauss into the 22d century. Perhaps the most enjoyable of all is \\"Tunesmith\\" by Lloyd Biggle, Jr. Biggle, writing in 1957, the dawn of the television age, predicts a society where commercials have subsumed all other forms of art, until a gifted musician appears to save society. A surprisingly moving story, and finely crafted, skilfully bringing the reader full circle without the reader ever suspecting that he was moving....if you truly want \\"masterpieces,\\" you should pick up Silverberg's Science Fiction Hall of Fame, volume one, or even the Best of the Nebulas edited by Ben Bova. But if you want several excellent stories by talented writers, you would do much worse than this collection of Card's favorites."},{"Title":"Masterpieces: The Best Science Fiction of the 20th Century","review":"Don't be fooled by the title. There are very few &quot;masterpieces&quot; in this book. Even the stories by &quot;masterpiece&quot; authors are not their best (Asimov, Heinlein, Silverberg, Ellison, and Aldiss, for example). Where are Bester, Wolfe, Zelazny, and and Robert Reed? -- writers whose genius was at its best in shorter venues. Almost half of this book (which is &quot;The Best Science Fiction of the Century&quot;) is from the 80s and 90s, much by unheard of authors. On top of that Card's introductions are very sloppy. In one he uses the phrase &quot;science fiction&quot; three times in one sentence. Quite frankly, I'm not sure that Card actually edited the book. It looks like Ace decided to put together an anthology to boost residual sales, putting the focus on more contemporary work and getting a popular author to put his name on the cover."},{"Title":"Masterpieces: The Best Science Fiction of the 20th Century","review":"This latest \\"best ... of the century\\" actually consists of twenty-six tales from the second half of the twentieth century and one story from the 1940s. Either that means science fiction matured considerably after World War II, the editor is too young to appreciate the early years, or the anthology should be labeled differently. In either case, the contributions are all aces and represent the wide gamut of the genre divided into three classifications: \\"The Golden Age, \\"The New Wave\\", and \\"The Media Generation\\". Though I enjoyed the other two periods, my favorite stories are from \\"The New Wave\\" because I cut my molars on several of these including having read some while working on a masters thesis involving science fiction. Regardless of nostalgia or other reasons for personal taste, each entry is powerful and shows how enlightening the genre can be when written by masters like those who rendered entries to MASTERPIECES: THE BEST SCIENCE FICTION OF THE CENTURY.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Masterpieces: The Best Science Fiction of the 20th Century","review":"This review applies to BOTH Science Fiction anthologies I bought at the same time ... all are works from early in SF's history.

Every piece was easy to get into, yet not lacking in depth. Only the Niven and Asimov pieces were even vaguely familiar -- well, I've read absolutely ALL of Asimov. Each author was carefully and, in my opinion, well selected. I was especially impressed by George R.R. Martin's menacing &quot;Sandkings&quot;, C.J. Cherryh's &quot;Pots&quot;, set in yet another invented universe, and by &quot;Dogfight&quot;, the most readable Gibson (written with Michael Swanwick) I've ever encountered, but still illuminated by narrative from within cyberspace. I thoroughly enjoyed every story."},{"Title":"Masterpieces: The Best Science Fiction of the 20th Century","review":"Perhaps any book with the title \\"Masterpieces, The Best Science Fiction of the Century,\\" has to be a bit overblown.You can argue whether every story is a masterpiece, although some clearly are. Heinlein's \\"All You Zombies\\" has to be on any Masterpiece list. \\"Passengers\\" still carries a punch although no one can forget the last line so it's not shocking anymore. A few, such as \\"Bears Discover Fire\\" leave me cold but, overall, the quality is very high, and Card provides a fine and diverse sampling of science fiction of the 20th century. Readers might be amused in judging which section of the century produced the best work.A collection of outstanding writers and outstanding stories."},{"Title":"Masterpieces: The Best Science Fiction of the 20th Century","review":"These twenty-seven science fiction stories are those Orson Scott Card found memorable, enjoyable and influential. Card stratifies his collection by three eras of twentieth century science fiction: The Golden Age (beginning of the century to the mid-1960s); The New Wave (mid-1960s to mid-1970s); and The Media Generation (mid-1970s and onward). Readers interested in the genre's history might consult Adam Roberts'History of Science Fictionfor a definition of these eras--and pre-twentieth-century periods that Card omits from consideration.The Golden Age \\"includes the writers and stories that created science fiction as we know it.\\" Of Card's nine stories, two stand out. Poul Anderson's \\"Call Me Joe\\" explores the psychological connection between a biologically-engineered \\"remote\\" on Jupiter's surface and its human operator in orbit above. The still-current topic contrasts with a retro feel from \\"tubes and circuits\\" technology. Robert Heinlein's \\"All You Zombies--\\" guides us through the now-familiar scenario of a time-traveling police force that guards the timelines and recruits from various eras. The story's recruitment is undertaken with a close-knit cast of characters.New Wave stories are drawn from a period when science fiction was moving beyond the common story structures of the Golden Age. I have two favorites of Card's seven. Ursula Le Guin's \\"The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas\\" reminds us that we pay an almost-hidden price for our happy lives. After reading her story, we cannot claim to have no choice. Larry Niven's \\"Inconstant Moon\\" paces through the long, sleepless night after its protagonist figures out the puzzle of the evening sky's too-bright moon.Media Generation stories come from a less well-defined era, produced by writers who grew up watching science fiction movies and television shows. Here are the best two of Card's eleven. George Martin's \\"Sandkings\\" features a wealthy man who is self-centered, vain and cruel. And yet his alien pets worship him. Terry Bisson's \\"Bear's Discover Fire\\" explores the implications of a slight intelligence increase in a familiar mammal. It is understated, clever, and emotionally rich.The collection is highly recommended, both to experienced fans and to those needing an introduction to this century's science fiction. As Card admits, there are many good stories left out, many important authors not represented. Read for what is here. And enjoy."},{"Title":"Masterpieces: The Best Science Fiction of the 20th Century","review":"This collection of 27 stories, edited by Orson Scott Card, a science fiction writer of acclaim in his own right, is divided into three sections: \\"The Golden Age\\", \\"The New Wave\\", and \\"The Media Generation\\". Many of the giants of the genre are represented here. Mr Card provides a useful general inroduction to the volume and separate introductions for each story. Story selection is good, for the most part. I personally enjoy \\"concept driven\\" or \\"character driven\\", as opposed to \\"technology driven\\", Sci Fi and these stories fit that description. Some of the selections, especially in the first section, have been frequently anthologized and may be familiar to a well-read Sci Fi fan. However, many stories are not so well-known, especially in the two later sections. There is a fairly high proportion of \\"gems\\", worthy of multiple reads, in this volume. (To be fair, there are also a few duds, in my opinion.) Overall, for the money, a great buy."},{"Title":"Masterpieces: The Best Science Fiction of the 20th Century","review":"Sometimes a collection of stories says more about the editor, in this case Orson Scott Card, than it does about the stories' individual writers. At least I hope it does. And having said that, I also hope that Mr. Card gets the medical help that he needs, because the central theme of all of these stories is despair.I understand that only a few authors were and are able to make a decent living writing science fiction, especially in the \\"golden age\\" when they were paid a half-cent a word; and, in fact, H. Beam Piper is said to have committed suicide because he wasn't able to pay his bills. But, in spite of that, most of the science fiction I remember, and would put into an anthology, is uplifting in some sense, with the protagonist better off at the end of the story than he or she was at the beginningI've been reading science fiction since the nineteen-fifties, and I can honestly say that I would have stopped long ago if it all had been as depressing as these stories are. The entries don't dip to the level of what I call \\"Humans as slime mold lost in the depths of the galaxy\\" but some of them are close. With a couple of exceptions -- that might not be exceptions, depending on your point of view -- no one is heroic, no one lives a better life as the story progresses, nothing much good happens at all. And some are depressing when they don't need to be, i.e. the author could have gone a completely different way in the story.The best example of the latter is \\"One\\" by George Alec Effinger. A married couple is sponsored by their university to go out into the galaxy looking for other life. All the planets they find are sterile as they search ever further from Earth. Eventually, the wife dies and the husband realizes he is too far away to make it back before he dies. Much moaning about being alone in the universe along the way. The end. On the other hand, no pesky aliens to contend with. Seemingly unlimited planets that could be seeded with life from Earth. In other words, the galaxy is ours, to do with as we please. And what university would sponsor a one way trip? The whole concept is ridiculous. But it is dismal, until you think about it.I understand that even good authors have a bad day, but a whole book of bad days? Not to say that the stories aren't (mostly) well written, but lock away your gun if you intend to read these in one sitting. You might want to hurt yourself or others."},{"Title":"Masterpieces: The Best Science Fiction of the 20th Century","review":"This title of the book is wrongly chosen, which I don't believe, or some people wanted to betray other people.It's of course a tricky business to choose _the_ masterpieces of the century. I think that Card could/should have invested more time in seeking pieces that actually deserve the title best.I have nothing against Card, but I hope that some editor will soon make a defining best of anthology.Still three stars. Why? Let me explain. This isn't all mediocre.The good: Call me Joe, All You Zombies, Nine Billion Names, Repent, Eurema's Dam, Passengers, Who Can Replace, Le Guin story, Niven story, SANDKINGS, dogfight and Snow of Crowley.That's a lot of good stories. I didn't like the recent ones.Most others were very readable. If this anthology wouldn't have featured such a title it would get four stars.If somebody would lower the price and remove some stories from this book it would get five stars.Now, if I would create an anthology bearing this name your eyes would roll out of their sockets. It would include Cordwainer Smith, Henry Kuttner, Kornbluth, brown etc. My reference book will therefore remain The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, vol. one, ed. by Silverberg. For now.If you really want to own these stories then by all means buy this book. But remember its setup. The editor and publisher lured you to buy this book. Don't stink into it. Look beyond the sausage and go hunt some other best of....Just my thoughts. Hey, just to keep things straight: I didn't buy this book. I know its contents."},{"Title":"Masterpieces: The Best Science Fiction of the 20th Century","review":"Once again Card (or his publishers) has found a great way to make some money and keep his name (and authority) current. Here we have an excellent &quot;primer&quot; for late 20th century science fiction. About half the stories are clear &quot;masterpieces&quot; while those closer to our own time seem merely to be Card's favorites. The Lloyd Biggle Jr. story is an example. Biggle was a fine writer in his time, but is he high enough to have a story listed with the 26 greatest sf stories of all time? I don't think so. The greatest anthology of clear &quot;masterpieces&quot; was Robert Silverberg's SCIENCE FICTION HALL OF FAME, Volume One. It ends in 1964 but captures the very essence of sf in its infancy under the influence of John W. Campbell. Card is less enamored of the 1930s and 1940s. It's the 1980s and 1990s that interest him. That's where all his friends are--and some of them are in this book. (And no one has yet to beat the Asimov/Greenburg Great SF Stories that DAW published years ago.)

The book is divided into three sections, Golden Age, Silver Age, and Modern age. The Golden Age stories include some of the classics in the field by Clarke and Heinlein, as well as truly great masterpiece by Lloyd Biggle Jr, \\"Tunesmith\\". The Silver Age section has a few good stories by Niven and Turtledove, but the modern age section is completely missable without a single worthwhile story in the bunch (including at least one Hugo winner).Where this book really falls apart is in its poor and sloppy editing. The introductions to each story consist entirely of rambling bibliographies of each writer, with nothing from the editor to explain why it is felt this particular story belongs in this collection. Isaac Asimov was one of the preeminent writers of the Golden Age, yet the story used in that section was written in 1986 (and it was not one of his masterpieces). The introduction to Larry Niven's story is riddled with factual errors. One story in the Silver Age section is even pure fantasy, without any attempt towards science fiction at all.I rated this book with three stars instead of two or even one because it does contain a few fantastic stories. Unfortunately, it is just not a very good book."},{"Title":"Masterpieces: The Best Science Fiction of the 20th Century","review":"I'm using this book for a college course, and so far all of the stories have been great!"},{"Title":"Masterpieces: The Best Science Fiction of the 20th Century","review":"Great, perfect collection of short stories by some of the greats!This book made one of my classes signifigantly more fun."},{"Title":"Masterpieces: The Best Science Fiction of the 20th Century","review":"I liked very much the choice of the stories.

But despite its rough edges and the odd passage of interest only to the author, the Life of Henry Brulard is very good indeed, and as moving as The Red and the Black.

The same could be said for Stendhal's own autobiography."},{"Title":"The life of Henry Brulard","review":"I didn't look forward to trying this book---memoirs of childhood seldom do much for me---but there being so little Stendhal out there in translation, I couldn't overlook it.

Written by the Chairman of the Victory Advisory Technical Committee, it contains discussions of the Royal Navy, the Victory's construction and active service, her post-Trafalgar history, and many particular aspects of her restoration. However, the big attraction for many readers will be visual-- the striking photographs, some in color, and especially the 90 pages of drawings by John McKay. While some of the tables and descriptions of the ship's restoration might cause a casual Patrick O'Brian fan's eyes to glaze over, this book is invaluable for those who always wanted to know which rider knees were made of which wood and how they were fastened together in 1759--and in 1959. The effort of the scholars and shipwrights who have maintained Victory as she is today, over 240 years after she was first laid down, is truly awe-inspiring."},{"Title":"HMS Victory: Her construction, career and restoration","review":"Alan McGowan, Chairman of the Victory Advisory Technical Committee, and Canadian illustrator John McKay have produced a truly wonderful book about the greatest of sailing warships, HMS Victory, which serves not only as a tribute to the ship and the men who sailed her, but also to those who saved and restored her to her present grace. Unlike USS Constitution, which truly is a corpse of a once beautiful frigate, a ghost of her lovely War of 1812 self, Victory has been returned to her precise appearance at her moment of greatest fame, October 21, 1805, the Battle of Trafalgar.The first half of the book goes into startling, fascinating detail about the condition of Victory and the many years since her permanent drydocking in 1922 spent repairing and restoring her. The battle against dry and wet rot, death watch beetle infestations, and the odd German bomb (a bomb fell into Victory's drydock in 1941 - by some miracle she didn't catch fire, which would have destroyed her utterly) has gone on more or less continuously, and it is interesting to read how the restorers have learned from earlier mistakes (new repair work has sometimes rotted within a few years) and adopted new techniques and materials. While she appears very authentic, there have had to be compromises, cleverly disguised, and these are described by McGowan - emergency escape doors carefully camouflaged in the hull, her rigging replaced with polypropylene rope, her heavy wooden spars replaced with steel, her wrought-iron lower masts (themselves borrowed from the armored frigate HMS Shah in the 1880s) fastened through her keel into the floor of the dock to relieve the pressure on her 240 year old hull.In the second half of the book, artist John McKay contributes a series of magnificent drawings showing Victory in her Trafalgar configuration, with details of rigging, armament, interior layouts, etc. This portfolio of illustrations will provide almost all the reference needed for anyone interested in building a model of HMS Victory in her prime.I cannot recommend this book more highly to anyone interested in sailing warships in general and HMS Victory in particular. I don't give many books five stars, but this one deserves every one."},{"Title":"HMS Victory: Her construction, career and restoration","review":"In all honesty and simplicity this book is great. It is a substantial sized book with excellent paper quality. The layout is professionally done which makes it very enjoyable to return to on a regular basis. The first half of this book contains very interesting info in the form of tables, charts and text on the Victory's history and career, pictures also help tell the story. The second half of the book is made up of drawings; John McKay once again has done a superb job at preserving the Victory's details. These drawings make a great accompaniment to the drawings in \\"The 100-Gun Ship Victory\\" by McKay. They are of a different style, if one could say that. More of an effort has been put towards conveying detail and workings rather than drawings suitable for reconstruction. In closing I will say that the title explains the contents accurately, and the reviews below are true and accurate. Enjoy.Michael"},{"Title":"HMS Victory: Her construction, career and restoration","review":"Although this book deals mainly with the restoration of the HMS Victory it does delve into the history of the ship in the process. My resaons for purchasing the book relate to a modelling project that I'm doing and knowing what problems are associated with restoring the Victory help in my quest to build an accurate model. The book starts out with a brief history of the ship and then gets stuck into the restoration which does get a bit tedious but I'm glad someone has made the effort to document this aspect of the Victory's career. It is important. The second half of the book is filled with outstanding drawings of every part of the ship you could ever ask for. John McKay has done an outstanding job with the drawings, and I'm of the opinion that this book combined with his other book \\"The 100 gun ship Victory\\" would enable the construction of thr Victory from the keel up. \\"The Anatomy of Nelson's Ships\\" is another must have and I have all three."},{"Title":"HMS Victory: Her construction, career and restoration","review":"For 20 years Alan McGowan worked for the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich where he was the head of a department with responsibilities for ships plans and models before being appointed Chief Curator and Deputy Director. Today he is Chairman of the Victory Advisory Committee. Illustrator John McKay is an architectural draughtsman from Vancouver, Canada with a world-wide reputation for his work with regard to sailing naval ships. His own previous works include books about the Bounty, Pandora and also the Victory. The combined talents of these two men has led to a book which will not disappoint the reader.HMS Victory was never decommissioned and has become, therefore, the oldest and longest serving naval ship in the history of the world. Famous for being Nelson's flagship at Trafalgar, this book reveals all there is to know about this great ship including - as the full title of the book suggests, \\"her construction, career and renovation.\\"This is a large format, hard-backed book which is fully supported by modern, relatively modern and historic photographs and pictures in addition to the many illustrations of every aspect of the ship itself. In short, this is a book which will answer any question the reader might have.Furthermore, speaking as someone who is also just about to embark on making a very large scale model of HMS Victory, I have found the plans, drawings, cutaway sectional drawings (deck by deck) in addition to the minute detail of masts, rigging, sails, guns, pumps, figurehead, ship's boats etc, etc to be so detailed that I could almost throw away the instructions which accompanied the rather expensive model kit.A must for all those with an interest in Nelson and his ships.NM"},{"Title":"HMS Victory: Her construction, career and restoration","review":"Great book, but FYI, this book is now (June 2005) on sale for 9.99GBP (about $19) at the Victory souvenir store in Portsmouth England.

It was money well spent. I am in the process of creating my version of HMS Victory and USS Constitution in 3D. The first half of the book shores up my knowledge of the history of the ship and her ongoing restoration with well written text and great photos. But it is the second half of the book that was worth the purchase. The author has had illustrations included that lend themselves perfectly to rendering the ship in 3D computer graphics: all the drawings are done in exploded isometric perspective views, showing all the parts of deck equipment, masts, rigging, armaments, hull construction, etc. This allows 3D artists to really concentrate on creating very detailed 3D models. The drawings have even helped me create deck objects, etc., for my 3D USS Constitution, that were indicative of all ships from that era, that I couldn't find for her elsewhere.

Ever since, he stares! &quot;Seeking a Spirit&quot; tells of Lassaw's search for a spirit guide. He vision-quests on a mountain and discovers a great buffalo who will be his spirit helper. Imagine a cold winter night by the fire in (present day) northwest Montana where the Kootenai or Kaanka nation live. There were fish, deer, buffalo, roots and berries to eat. It was a hard life but a good one. Storytelling passed the time in the long winters and also communicated traditional values, such as wariness, respect for prey,habits and characteristics of game animals, and values such as respect for tribal community, sharing, and thrift.

Great concept but not worth the expense."},{"Title":"Objects in the Heavens","review":"Peter Birren's _Objects in the Heavens_ is a compact little spiral-bound book and observer's log, jam-packed with information on deep-sky objects which can be seen with binoculars and small telescopes. Organized by constellation, the left-side page lists the objects, their NGC (or other) numbers, type (e.g. galaxy, open cluster, double star, etc.), location (RA and dec), brightness, distance, and a bit of description. The right-side page shows a sketch of where they are in the constellation and has plenty of room for observation notes. It is a very handy book to have at the telescope.I have found that _O*I*T*H_ goes hand-in-hand with the Astronomical League's \\"Urban List\\" of celestial objects visible in modestly light-polluted areas. I keep the book with my standard stargazing tools; my log book, planisphere, and star chart.In the front of the book are convenient notes and information. Several pages list the Messier objects, an index to the NGC objects, the schedule of recurring meteor showers, basic telescope types and uses, and other helpful info for the novice or even the experienced stargazer.I have corresponded with the author, and found Peter Birren to be a personable, likeable guy with a desire to share his knowledge of the sky with others. I recommend this little observer's guide to any amateur astronomer or budding stargazer.Added 10/23/2003:After having used the Second Edition of O*I*T*H for five months or so, I find that I use it constantly, not only in search of the \\"Urban List\\" objects, but also to find some of the most pleasing and fascinating objects in the night sky. This 2nd edition is much more accurate in its charts and descriptions than the first edition. It is a very convenient, concentrated package of information and notes to use at the telescope at night."},{"Title":"Objects in the Heavens","review":"I've been an amateur stargazer since childhood and always wanted something I could toss in my gear bag that would help me locate the bright galaxies and clusters without thumbing through some inappropriate textbook. This small, keenly focused, spiral bound guide works perfect under dark skies. All the important objects are listed with critical, if not extensive, descriptive information in easy to read format. It's a perfect companion to the full sky charts we find in the astro mags and the big sky atlas charts that permit us to narrow in on the obscure stuff. I've bought copies for friends and we all agree, it's as important as anything we carry with us when going out to look at the stars. A great binocular companion, it's filled with a good deal of additional star gazing information as well. The author did a lot of work here and produced a terrific product at a fair price."},{"Title":"Objects in the Heavens","review":"Now in a newly updated and expanded third edition, Peter Birren's Objects In The Heavens is an ideal combination of field book, notebook, and reference work for student and amateur astronomers engaged in \\"real-world\\" viewing of the night sky. This new edition is enhanced with numerous objects not shown in the major atlases (including the Sky Atlas 2000) and offers a complete list of all known objects to a mag10 level of observation. Also new to this substantive addition is the inclusion of star group stories that help bring together larger portions of the night sky in truly memorable ways. 144 double stars are listed and mapped in order to provide useful targets for those nights when deep-sky observation is less than optimum. Spiral-bound to permit this exceptionally practical reference and guide to be laid out flat, special symbols are employed to aid in identifying particular objects, stars, double stars, and asterism. An ideal and enthusiastically recommended reference for novice astronomers, Objects In The Heaven's is sufficiently detailed to be of immense value for even the most experienced explorers of the night sky, and an ideal curriculum supplement reference and resource for introductory astronomy classes for highschool and college level students."},{"Title":"Objects in the Heavens","review":"I have Millenium Star Atlas 2000.0 and Uranometria but this is the book that is constantly in my hand or pocket.

Brighter stars are depicted on charts as bigger dots, making them easier to spot. Also, objects of magnitude 7 and brighter have their own map icon, as do other objects to magnitude 10 and Messier objects to magnitude 10.

From one page to the next, one is amazed (even now) at the viciousness of the Fascists and the humanity, ingenuity, courage of those they oppressed. God and the devil are both in the details and Kruk gives us plenty of all three."},{"Title":"The Last Days of the Jerusalem of Lithuania: Chronicles from the Vilna Ghetto and the Camps, 1939-1944","review":"Herman Kruk was a librarian. Even as the Vilna [Vilnius] ghetto was reduced to inhuman conditions, Kruk risked his life to smuggle books into the public library he set up. While the Nazi regime tried to reduce Jews to a subhuman status, with harsh labor, restrictions, and eventual extermination; Kruk helped to initiate literary contests, plays, and lecture series. His diary reflects the intellectual and cultural activities of the ghetto, as well as the minutiae of the library.Kruk's diary is an overwhelmingly human document. His tears for the destruction of his beloved Warsaw and the personal horror felt when hearing rumors of the massacre of Jews elsewhere in Europe are not diluted or diminished by his desire that his diary become a publicly read record of the destruction of Jewish Vilna."},{"Title":"The Last Days of the Jerusalem of Lithuania: Chronicles from the Vilna Ghetto and the Camps, 1939-1944","review":"After fleeing eastward from Warsaw during the German-Soviet conquest of Poland in 1939, Kruk was at Luck (Lutsk), Volyn (Wolhynia). He saw firsthand the Jewish-Soviet collaboration [Zydokomuna] at Poland's expense, and wrote: \\"The day after the entry of the Bolsheviks, groups of the new militia disarmed Polish soldiers. A Jewish fellow stopped a high Polish officer and challenged him to give him his weapon. The officer gave his revolver, which he carried on his belt. Finally, the young militiaman began removing the medals from the officer. The officer complained that he couldn't take them from him. The fellow threatened him with a rifle. The officer then took another revolver out of a holster and shot the militiaman on the spot. The officer was arrested.\\" (p. 22). After the Germans invaded their erstwhile Soviet allies (June 1941), Jewish youth changed their clothing styles in order to hide their Bolshevization. (p. 46).The Jewish Ghetto police were described by Kruk as being \\"More German than the Germans\\" in terms of their unrelenting confiscations of the Jews' wealth for their own benefit. (p. 187; see also p. 160, 182). Because of this, they lived in relative wealth (p. 115), and spread their corruption to the Jewish people in general. (p. 313).Kruk follows the progressive destruction of the Vilna (Wilno, Vilnius) Ghetto by the Germans, and does the same, from contacts' information, relative to the Warsaw Ghetto. The Germans removed the Polish Blue police from service when it came time for the \\"resettlement\\" of Warsaw's Jews, and replaced them with Ukrainian and Baltic collaborators. (p. 386, 569). Warsaw's Jews eventually realized that they were being sent to their deaths at Treblinka. (p. 350, 519, 530).Kruk's view of Poles soured with time. He considered them generally unconcerned about Jewish deaths, and just waiting to acquire Jewish properties. (April 1943; p. 522). Earlier, in contrast, he wrote: \\"In the street at Maistas, masses of Christians brought packages of meat and distributed them to the Jewish workers marching to the ghetto. The sympathy of the Christian population, more precisely of the Polish population, is extraordinary.\\" (p. 110)(September 1941; p. 110). He also wrote of Christians showing open sympathy to Jews (February 1942), which the Gestapo felt compelled to counter. (p. 210). Poles warned and helped Jews flee the ghetto. (May 1942; p. 289). Ironic to the modern portrayal of Poles being one in spirit (if not action) with the Germans against the Jews, a quoted German directive (January 1943) justified the isolating of the Jews in part because the Jews and Poles were united in opposition to the Germans! (p. 451).Ironic to the current emphasis on Jews and Poles being \\"unequal victims\\" (which in practice means that Poles are hardly thought of as victims at all), Kruk often exhibited a \\"like Jews, like Poles\\" attitude, as in the German mass shootings of both at nearby Ponary. (p. 311, 319). Two million Poles were sent to the Reich for forced labor (p. 154), and Poles hid among Jews to avoid this fate. (p. 172). Poles were among those who faced reprisal atrocities from the Germans for the deeds of Soviet guerillas. (p. 420).Unlike the current selective emphasis upon Poles sometimes killing fugitive Jews, Kruk focused on the overall lawlessness, which included members of all nationalities responsible for individual murders of very sort. (p. 311). For instance, a Jewish bandit is known to have murdered a Russian Orthodox priest during a robbery. (pp. 235-236, 240). The nearby forests were full of bandits of all nationalities. (p. 311, 512, 581)."},{"Title":"The Last Days of the Jerusalem of Lithuania: Chronicles from the Vilna Ghetto and the Camps, 1939-1944","review":"I am so glad the many, many pages of this dairy were collected and put into book form.

The stories range from sweet romance to poignant realism, but always with characterizations that are real, crisp, and three-dimensional-Norman Rockwell could have painted them. The settings are vividly drawn and the dialogues crackle with tension.The title story, \\"Farley Brothers Drugs and Sundries,\\" is a touching tale about a single woman who fears her chances for romance in her small town have reached a dead end, until she finally lands a date with the new owner of the feedstore, and her life begins to turn in a new direction-just not in the direction you might imagine. FBD&S; is filled with keen observation of the townspeople, plenty of humor (the eyelash scene will have you in stitches), and a developing romance or two, but don't expect your typical romance ending.\\"Allie's Daring Adventure\\" shows what lengths a mature woman will go to for love. Hilarious!\\"A Match for a Firecracker.\\" Even the title of this one promises explosive entertainment. A stubborn woman softball player wrangles with a handsome, equally headstrong umpire.\\"Cousin Stan Turns on the Charm.\\" Stan's a charmer of elderly women, enough so they want to do things like bake pies for him and his visiting cousin, Roy. But what happens when charm meets truth? Will Stan get his just desserts? This story reads like an entertaining episode of The Golden Girls.\\"Driving Delbert Lemieux's Second-Best Hearse.\\" Will Studs and Manny get the body to Blackduck on time or will a young hitchhiker named Leanne cause them to lose their way? Chock full of suspense and downright funny!Some of the stories in this anthology take on more serious themes. In \\"Living in the Land of the North Wind,\\" a woman contemplating divorce becomes stranded in a snowstorm with her husband. This is a great character study on how men and women view relationships.\\"My Brother's Wife\\" is a realistic look at a family plagued with drug and alcohol addiction until Dale finds hope through an unexpected source.In \\"A Man of Means,\\" Garner Holsapple is a man who can put Ebenezer Scrooge to shame. Can a man of such means grow as a person or is he doomed to shrivel up in a world of his own making? This is a notable tale about the consequences of making choices in life, no matter the hand one may have been dealt early in life.Kathryn North has woven together a superb story collection, one that's guaranteed to tickle your funny bone at times and give you pause to reflect on the human condition at others.

I liked them all but this one had a far bigger emotional impact on me than any of the other stories. I hope that Sharon Shinn does more in the time period of Angelica or Archangel/Angel Seeker as I have found them the most interesting. The Angel characters and their role in this world are just fascinating."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"I was appalled by the ignorant racists ranting about \\"jew look-alikes\\" in their reviews. Their hatred obviously rendered them unable to even see what was actually written in \\"Angel-seeker\\", rather than what they wanted to see.The Jansai are explicitly described a) as gypsies, repeatedly and b) as blondes, frequently. They are depicted as rapacious, money-loving merchants-isn't that a typical racist stereotype of Jews? And for those lambasting Shinn for \\"abusing a culture\\"-first of all, hate to break it to ya, but this is fiction-Shinn can create any kind of hero or villian, culture, religion or society she wants and it doesn't have anything to do with the real world. Second-Arabic culture IS known for its repression, abuse and outright murder of women and is rightly condemmned by every intelligent human being for it. So-called \\"honour killings\\" are happening in places like India, Jordan and Afghanistan all the time (I have an Afghan refugee friend who could tell you horrifying stories about things that happened to the women in his family)-are you reviewers seriously defending it? If so, why are you not living there with your sisters, wives,and daughters?As far as the Edori=Jew thesis, WRONG! I've read all the Samaria books and the Edori remind me of nothing so much as Native Americans-golden skin, long straight black hair, and a welcome for everyone, even those who would destroy them. These reviewers are reading their own vicious prejuidices into the text.After all this, I have to say I enjoyed the book. Not perfect, but interesting. It's a little hard at first because Elizabeth is unlikable in her heartless ambition, but she learns and grows. The book sets up some intriguing philosophical problems, about angel-seekers, sexual morality and the value of a life that I look forward to Shinn exploring in future books."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"&quot;Angel-Seeker&quot; is the story of two women of Samaria. Elizabeth is a young woman who has lost all of her close family and yearns to recreate the security she knew as a child. At the first opportunity, she moves to new angel hold at Cedar Hills, hoping to attract an angel and bear an angel child, as she will then have a place forever. Rebekah is a Jansai woman who is preparing for her upcoming marriage. She encounters an angel who needs her help, tends him, and, gradually, they fall in love.As other reviewers have mentioned, this story has several familiar themes, especially to &quot;Jovah's Angel.&quot; It was nice to see familiar characters again. The theme of the wild young woman finding contentment with an Edori lover is somewhat overdone, although I found Elizabeth to be much more likeable and interesting than either Miriam (Angelica) or Delilah (Jovah's Angel). In fact, I found Elizabeth to be one of Shinn's more interesting and sympathetic characters, as she seems to grow and change throughout the book. Rebekah seemed a bit more passive and certainly somewhat cavalier regarding her own safety - and the potential disgrace she was bringing upon her family. If she is willing to risk all to take an angel lover, surely it would have occurred what risks she was running. She seems imaginative - I would have liked to see her chafe more at her restrictions and wonder more what it would be like to be born into a different type of family. Her reluctance to leave Breven (and her willingness to honor her betrothal) seem odd to me. Jordan was a wonderful character, one of my favorites - and the freeing of the Jansai women and seeing the Jansai men get theirs was a terrific scene. Delightful.I do hope that Ms. Shinn finds some new and creative ways to keep writing about this world. There are only so many ways one can write about the clash of the Edori with the Jansai, with the angel, or the greedy merchants vs. the righteous angel(s); or the beautiful, innocent pure heroine finding love with the angel (or the more central male character) where the less pure, more worldly-wise woman finds love with the selfless, devoted Edori lover (and perhaps less material success than she wanted or had been accustomed to, but that's all right, because she finds TRUE LOVE). That is a bit hard to swallow.I'm giving it five stars, because it actually is one of my favorite Samaria books, and because of Elizabeth - but probably will get the next book from the library, just in case."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"I've loved all the Samaria books so far, and there were things I liked about \\"Angel Seeker,\\" but it reads more like a Romance novel than a Science Fiction/Fantasy novel, and I much prefer the latter. I love Shinn's strong, incorrigable female characters...my favorite book so far is \\"Angelica,\\" particularly because I enjoyed reading about Miriam's transformation among the Edori. In \\"Angel Seeker,\\" it was good to get a clearer picture of life among the Jansai, to witness Rebekah's eventual escape, and to read about Elizabeth as she finds her calling as a healer and real love with an Edori man (I adore the Edori!) But in my opinion there was way too much emphasis on the agonizing aspects of Romance, and not enough emphasis on the fascinating ways of life on Samaria, which is what I have enjoyed so much about the previous books. Obadiah and Rebekah's relationship is unhealthy in so many ways; their obsessive longing for each other got rather tedious, and unfortunately this is what many people in the real world think \\"true love\\" is. Elizabeth's relationship with David is just as agonizing and even more unhealthy, and it was a relief when she woke up and realized her goals in life were not good.I hope the next Samaria novel has a more balanced plot, and I look forward to more of Sharon Shinn's memorable characters and fascinating Samarian cultures."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"Anyone who hasn't picked this up to read it yet make sure you read Archangel first! Not the cleanest Sharon Shinn book. Defenatly for adults but the love story is one I don't think I'll easily forget. Any author that can keep me remembering a love story long after I have read the book is amazing. There is sex before marriage, a scene where they get naked together. It isn't explicit in the whole love making but not a clean read. But I like a pretty clean book and this just didn't make it. The love story was beautifully written as most Shinn books are but she walks the edge of ok for me with a lot of her books. Just warning the ones out there that care."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"This was a very very very good book that I highly reccomend."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"Ms. Shinn's Arab bias is quite evident, it's something I hadn't realized until I read her last book Angelica...she seems to have absolutely no understanding of the culture she is lambasting. While I understand that writers have the right to create worlds and inhabit them how they please her stereotypes are quite obvious and at second glance disturbing."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"I have read, enjoyed and even highly recommended Shinn's other Angel-series books to others. So, I was stunned by how dreadful this one was. In past novels Shinn thinly veiled two of her planet's tribes -- one group were obviously arabs, and another group gypsy/jews. This novel tells the stories of two young women, one who is suppressed and almost killed by the arab-look-alikes, and the other who finds redemption in the arms of a jew-look-alike. The former is presented as a one-sided, nightmarish, diatribe against everything Arab you can imagine. The men are fat, greedy, self-centered, and oppressive. The women are denied basic human rights, confined to harem-like areas, hidden beyond veils, stoned to death if they disobey. Shinn obviously has a complete lack of respect for cultures other than her own. Rather than using fiction to bring insight into our own world, she uses it to spread bigotry. In this age of global conflict, we need and deserve greater knowledge, not kneejerk, uneducated passions."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"This book makes a great beach book. It follows each of the three narrators for a chapter or so at a time, providing the reader with plenty of places to stop without hurting the suspense. There is significantly less political and religious debate in this book than in the previous Samaria novels; instead, Shinn focused on the differences and similarities between two supposidly powerless women, Elizabeth and Rebekah, and the methods they use to affect their lots in life.GENERAL PLOT:Elizabeth, a pampered Mandavvi daughter turned ignored, embittered servent, takes a laundress job at the Angel hold of Cedar Hills in the hopes that she can catch the eye of an angel. Instead her hard work earns her the attention of a proment doctor who wants to train her as an assistant - a more satisfying and dignifying job than that of angel-seeker but one that has much less job security than that of the mother of an angel.Rebekah is an opinionated Jansai daughter about to be married off. Shinn is not very subtle in her distain for any culture that would cut women off from ouside contact and the Jansai life comes off sounding like Afghanistan under the Taliban. Rebekah's mildly discontent at her lot in life but can't imagine a different one. She rebels in small ways by arguing with her mother, sneaking out of her compound, and raising her younger brother to be kind and respectful to the women he will have complete authority over one day.Obadiah is an angel recently sent to Cedar Falls as an ambassador to the Jansai at Breven. He is lonely and frustrated to find that he has little standing or authority among the Jansai. When he is attacked and injured flying between Breven and Cedar Hills, he makes an emergency landing 3 miles from Rebekah's caravan. She sneaks out to help him and the two begin a secret, dangerous relationship. Back at Cedar Hills, it is Obadiah's injuries that prompt the doctor to request Elizabeth's assistance, also giving her a taste of Samarian politics as the hold leaders meet trying to figure out how to respond to the attack.OTHER THOUGHTS:Angel-Seeker is the 5th book in the Samaria series, for all that it occurs 3rd chronologically. It is a stand alone book in the sense that Shinn offers readers an unending number of characters ready to offer up exposition at every turn. If it has been years since you've read Archangel, you do not need to reread it before picking up this book. If you have never read a Samaria novel, however, I would recommend reading them in publication order. Not because Angel-Seeker needs it but because in it, certain aspects of Samarian life, land, and history are revealed that might lessen the suspense of the previous books."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"Angel-Seeker (2004) is the fifth novel in the Samaria series, but is the sequel to Archangel in internal sequence. In the previous volume, Raphael was the archangel of Samaria. From his hold at Windy Point, he ruled over both humans and angels, changing traditions and corrupting his followers. Raphael married a Jansai women and took other Jansai as followers, even allowing them to enslave the Edori.Finally, Raphael denied any need to sing praises to Jovah and brought his followers to Mount Galo to wait out the entire day which had been appointed for singing the Gloria. After the sun went down, Raphael announced that he was their god and the thunderbolts sizzled out of the sky to destroy him and all who were with him. A great storm blew over Samaria, the skies opened up, rain fell in torrents, and the rivers began to flood.The next day, Gabriel lead the survivors in singing the Gloria and the skies calmed and peace returned to Samaria. Gabriel was chosen as the Archangel as foreseen by the oracles. He even convinced Rachel to marry him and become the Angelica.In this novel, the angels have abandoned Windy Point and have begun to build another city of angels in Jordana. Cedar Hills is unlike any other angel hold, for it is down on the plains, easily accessible by ordinary humans. Gabriel appoints Nathan to rule the new city and so Nathan takes Magdalena, his new bride, and a group of Monteverde angels there to reestablish proper relations with the landholders who have been slighted for so long.Gabriel has banned the enslavement of Edori and freed all the slaves. Now the Jansai are moaning about their economic difficulties. Since Nathan already has enough problems to handle, Gabriel sends Obadiah to handle relations with the Jansai. Shortly after moving to Cedar Hills, Obadiah flies to Breven and meets with Uriah, the acknowledged leader of the Jansai. After concluding his visit, Obadiah is flying back to Cedar Hills when, suddenly, he is shot out of the sky.Obadiah manages to crash into a small oasis, but hasn't got the strength to attend to his wounds. He is found there by a young Jansai woman, Rebekah, and she covertly tends him for several days while he recovers, but eventually she has to leave with her family. Shortly thereafter, Obadiah flies out of the desert, but has a relapse in mid-air and crashes once again, causing additional injuries. He has been seen falling out of the sky and is quickly found and placed in a trader wagon to be taken for treatment in Cedar Hills.Elizabeth is a young women who has come to Cedar Hills as an angel-seeker, a woman trying to become pregnant by an angel in order to bear an angel child. Mothers of angels are very well treated, but most pregnancies between angels and ordinary humans do not produce angel progeny. She has met Obadiah briefly and soon comes to know him rather well after she helps tend his wounds and then is assigned the additional duties of periodically checking his condition and tending his needs.In this story, the lives of these two women are opposed in many ways. Elizabeth is an orphan who comes from a wealthy family who fell upon hard times; she was living with a distant relative and working as a cook before she fled to Cedar Hills. Elizabeth wants to become pregnant by an angel, but has no real affection for her paramour.Rebekah is living with her step-father, mother, two brothers and other family members in a fair amount of comfort. She is leery of Jansai men, but believes that her betrothed is kindly enough. Yet she has begun to develop warm feelings, even longings, toward the angel Obadiah.Elizabeth is a very independent woman who has already proved her willingness to change her circumstances according to her own desires. Rebekah, while is a fairly liberal thinker for a Jansai woman, just cannot convince herself that she could possibly withstand the heartaches of leaving her family and circumstances. What surprises will destiny bring?The author continues her accounts of intercultural conflicts on Samaria and its consequences. As with Archangel, the pairings herein suffer from inadvertent miscues and other misunderstandings, adding a layer of comedy to the actions of the protagonists. While the major characters have entirely admirable personas, they are contrasted with all sorts of unfeeling and corrupted individuals, from Elizabeth's relative James and his wife Angeletta to the angel David to the Jansai men of Breven. Once again, the author has provided an intricate portrayal of an exotic society and its populace, with special emphasis on their romantic involvements.Highly recommended for Shinn fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of exotic cultures and strange ways.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"'Angel-Seeker' is a direct follow-up book to 'Archangel', taking place a year after 'Archangel' ends, and following the angel Obadiah as he lives at the new angel-hold of Cedar Hills. We see the main characters of 'Archangel' - Rachel and Gabriel - but briefly. Here the focus is upon Obadiah and the impact Gabriel's decisions in 'Archangel' have had upon Samaria.We definitely get to see the 'dark side' of angels in this book, since the focus is upon the lives of women involved with the angels, particularly 'angel-seekers': women who desperately seek to seduce angels in the hopes of bearing angel children. So we see many of the male angels at their worst, treating these woman like whores. However, this is a Sharon Shinn book, so the unfaltering belief that True-Love-Is-Attainable-For-Everyone is upheld.There are two women contrasted in this book: The angel-seeker Elizabeth, who comes to Cedar Hills hoping to better her future, and the Jansai woman Rebekah, who within the veiled and cloistered existence of women among the Jansai manages to maintain a relationship with an angel in secret. Both women's lives turn out differently than they expected as they strive to make their future in the new Samaria under the rule of the archangel Gabriel.Since I loved the book 'Archangel', I enjoyed reading this postscript to that novel about the futures of its minor characters. However, without any knowledge of 'Archangel' this book would be of no interest at all. It doesn't stand well on its own, having nowhere near the depth and complexity of 'Archangel'. It reminds me of reading Anne McCaffrey's 'Nerilka's Story' after having read 'Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern'; the first a book about minor characters from the second book. 'Nerilka's Story' was more a postscript to 'Moreta', while 'Moreta' was a science fiction classic. Indeed, with 'Angel-Seeker' I felt like I was reading fan fiction set on the world of Samaria. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing; like I said, it makes good reading for fans of the Samaria novels. However, the book does not stand on its own. If you haven't read Sharon Shinn's Samaria novels, this book will be a waste of your time.I gave the book only '3' stars because, while it is 'okay', it isn't 'great'. For an unknown author, I might have given this '4' stars, but since I know what Shinn is capable of (see 'Archangel', 'The Shape-Changer's Wife', 'Wrapt in Crystal', and 'Jenna Starborn' especially), I find it just isn't up to her best. Light reading, nothing deep, characters predictable... you'll read this once, then probably never look or think about it again. For Samaria fans ONLY."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"This series has always been a spell-binding read for me. The original trilogy was fantastic. From there it became a little repetitive. This latest addition was a welcomed change. One of my problems with previous novels was the extreme description of music. Shinn could spend an entire chapter describing the rise and fall of angel voices in song. Almost all her novels were concerned about the archangel. In this case, she concentrates on two women (not angels at all) and their perspectives. A Jansai woman and an angel-seeker. In both women she shows the trials and tribulations of misunderstood and persecuted women doing what they have to do to survive, truely live, and love. Shinn twines these two women's lives together in an unexpected and touching way.It's a long novel, but you will find it hard to put down. I finished mine in two days.Good reading!"},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"I must disagree with a couple of the reviews I have read here. Though the names of some of the characters in this book are familiar, the focus on the Jansai is fresh - and timely (they do not remind me of gypsies).The characters in this book are not simple-they are flawed, all of them, and the conflict has to do with our halting experiences as human-beings of free choice. The study of the Jansai women, who live in a cultural situation not unlike many in our own contemporary world, was very interesting to me. ( Why does a woman choose to stay in hell? When does safety become imprisonment?) I'm with Sharon - I want to read stories that tell me in the end, we can be honorable, we can work against what is unjust, we can make mistakes and find redemption and real love is worth sacrifice. But the choices in this book are not facile - the conflict not easily resolved. For those who read for meaning, there is much to mull over in this bit of work. I haven't got a whole lot of time, but this story was worth what I invested in it. Besides, I got a kick out of reading it."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"The settlers on the planet Samaria designed it so that the population would be divided into two races: mortals and angels. Just by singing the angels can cause the weather to change and have medicines fall down from the sky. In most cases an angel can only mate with a mortal otherwise the chance of birth defects is increased dramatically. For most women the highest honor is to give birth to an angel child and angel seekers flock to where they live in hopes of catching their eye.Elizabeth, a poor relation in her cousin's home, runs away to Cedar Hills where the angels are constructing a new community. She hopes to catch the eye of an angel, give birth to his child, and live the rest of her life in luxury. Rebekah, a member of the nomadic Jansai tribe, isolated from the males not of her family, stumbles across the injured Obadiah in the desert and nurses him in secret back to health. Although they fall in love, Rebekah refuses to give up her way of life and family for an angel but both she and Elizabeth learn that what they think they want is not really their heart's desire.For readers who follow the Samaria novels, ANGEL-SEEKER should be read after ARCH ANGEL and before JOVAH'S ANGEL'S. The Jansai will remind readers of gypsy clans crossed with women living in Purdah in the mid-east. There is enough romance in this novel to appeal to fans of this genre without disappointing those who prefer a solid science fiction tale. Sharon Shinn is a talented storyteller who makes world building seems so graceful and easy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"I'm a newcomer to the Samaria series. I started with Archangel, but when I looked up the other books in the series, I was disappointed to see that they all took place about 150 years from one another. I was interested in the characters from Archangel, many of whom could have had books telling thier own stories. Instead, the next book picked up long after all my beloved Archangel characters were dead, which was a depressing thought that kept me from continuing the series. So it was with great joy that I discovered Angel-Seeker, which picks up chronologically where Archangel left off. Not all of my lingering questions from the first book were answered, but enough to mollify me. Shinn does a good job of developing her characters, but sometimes seems to sacrifice opportunities for much-needed action in favor of someone's long and (occasionally) illogical inner monologue. Overall, though, the book is an engaging read with characters you'll really come to care about."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"Not since Archangel have I truly enjoyed another novel of Samaria. I actually gave up after Jovah's Angel and haven't even read The Alleluia Files. I gave Angelica a chance and that was okay.However, I've enjoyed other Shinn books like Summers at Castle Auburn. But Angel Seeker is just as good as Archangel, even only a little.One thing I look for in a story is character development. Although completely subjective, my opinion of Rebekah is high. I empathized her rebellious nature and admired her selfless ways. I found her honesty amusing since its coming from an inexperienced girl who doesn't know better when it comes to keeping certain things to yourself. I also found her devoted if not to Obadiah at first, to tradition.Obadiah is an admirable character. He still had to get rid of his loose ways but he was devoted to Rebekah and he treated her kindly.I admire Elizabeth for her selflessness though I didn't quite admire her intentions with Obadiah after he had come back with his excursion with Rebekah. All the same, Elizabeth proved herself and was even given a chance at love with a fellow Edori, Rufus.Perhaps, the only weak parts in the book were one, the ending was not as climactic as Archangel. Much of the story centered on the relationship development between Obadiah and Rebekah despite handling issues such as domestic abuse and promiscuity. There really wasn't a villian in Angel Seeker like in Archangel but the storyline itself makes up for that.Also, another weak point was the dialogue. In certain situations, it seemed almost poetic and too proper. Obadiah would be spitting out something that he probably gotten from a poem somewhere and made a mental note to remeber it for the next time he runs into another pretty lady. Other than that, I enjoyed the story and will one day pick it up again when I've got nothing to do."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"Sharon Shinn's Samaria novels are among the most compelling examples of world building in contemporary science fiction, an intriguing mix of religious faith and technology coexisting uneasily on the human colonized world of Samaria; a world ruled benevolently for centuries by angels, bioengineered humans with wings. Having not read any of Shinn's work before, I was amazed that her world is nearly as richly textured as any I have found in classic works like Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" series and Ursula Le Guin's \\"Ekumen\\" novels, rendered in a most compelling narrative via her fine prose. In \\"Angel - Seeker\\" she has created a most compelling cast of characters, both human and angel. Shinn compares and contrasts the lives of two fascinating young women who will embark on transformative journeys that will change their lives forever; Elizabeth, born into wealth, forced by circumstances to endure poverty, until she realizes economic and personal salvation in the angel capital city Cedar Hills; Rebekah of the Jansai, implacable foes of Samaria' ruling angel elite, taught by her fundamentalist religious elders to hate them, until one day, she aids a gravely wounded angel and nurses him back to health. Eventually their paths will cross, altering not only their lives, but also those of an entire tribe, in unexpected, quite startling, ways."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"Angel-Seeker is the sequel to Sharon Shinn's wonderful novel, Archangel. Shinn's subsequent books in this series, Jovah's Angel, The Alleluia Files, and Angelica were solid reads, but not as satisfying for me personally, so I approached this one with hope but not expectation. Happily, I found it to be almost as good as Archangel and a delightful visit to a fascinating world.Angel-Seeker weaves together the lives of two Samarian women whose futures become entangled with the angels. Elizabeth is tired of being poor, tired of working sunup to sundown on her cousin's farm without any recompense. She believes she is meant for greater things. So she journeys to the new angel hold at Cedar Hills, hoping to attract an angel and fall in love. Though that seems unlikely, considering how exalted the social position of angels are, she would settle for bearing an angel baby - which would therefore entitle her to the luxuries of the angel hold for life.Rebekah, on the other hand, doesn't go seeking an angel; one comes to her. Obadiah, newly arrived at Cedar Hills, has been given the task of communicating with the Jansai in Breven. The archangel Gabriel made many enemies amongst the merchant Jansai when he declared an end to the enslavement of the Edori in Samaria (thus costing the Jansai their slaves), and now there is trouble brewing. Since Obadiah is leagues better at diplomacy than Gabriel, the task falls to him. But on his way back from his first Breven visit, he is shot down from the sky by a weapon that shoots fire. He falls to the desert and is on the point of death when Rebekah, out drawing water for her family's caravan, discovers him. Rebekah knows she should ignore him. She is Jansai and a female, and thus an angel man is no one she should help or even meet, but she can't help herself. This beautiful being is in need, she is there, and soon they are in love. But for Rebekah, this is a deadly situation. If her family ever finds out about Obadiah, they will show her no mercy. Jansai women must be pure, obedient, quiet, and meek. And the ones that are not - die.There is so much to love about Shinn's ancient Samaria. She has created a complex world with fully defined ethnic, socio-economic, and cultural groups. At the top of Samarian society are the angels - the beautiful, supernaturally strong, musically gifted ones. Yet viewing them through Elizabeth's eyes, it's obvious that they are also arrogant, promiscuous, and condescending. The wandering Edori are friendly, warm, family-oriented, and generous, but they are also disorganized and unambitious. The Jansai are everything the Edori aren't: crafty, structured, energetic, and astute. But they are also strictly patriarchal and controlling. Each group has reason to distrust and disapprove of the others, and their interactions are realistic and fascinating. Shinn does let her bias against patriarchal societies show through, however. It would have been nice to have seen a few more positive characteristics of Jansai men. It is understandable, though, given whose perspective this story is told through.Shinn spends the majority of her narrative on Rebekah, who is in the most difficult situation. She's about to be married off to the man of her step-father's choosing. She will not know him at all before the wedding, and after that she will be his chattel to do with what he will. At twenty, Rebekah is old to be unmarried. She has a rather undefined status in her step-father's house. She cares for her baby brother and does household tasks, but otherwise she has a good deal of unoccupied time. Jansai women live in seclusion and cannot travel, even within the city without a male escort. Consequently, Rebekah and her rebellious cousin Martha have a great deal of time to worry about their futures, commit small rebellions, and complain about Jansai rules. When she meets Obadiah and sees that he is gentle, kind, and genuinely interested in who she is as a person, she cannot turn her face away, even if it puts her in danger. His love is likely the only love she will ever know.Obadiah is very appealing. Eclipsed by Gabriel in Archangel, he was nevertheless a bright spot in that book, and it's wonderful to see him get his own story. He falls in love with Rebekah very quickly, for reasons that are somewhat inadequately explained, and then spends the rest of the book trying to deal with the intricacies of Jansai society that he previously dismissed as simplistic, barbaric, and cruel.Elizabeth's story was well done too. Throughout Archangel the angels sneeringly talk about the angel-seekers - the camp followers of the Samarian world. These woman are motivated most often by the wealth of the angel holds but many of them are just angel groupies. Here we get a chance to see what motivates these women to put themselves in this type of situation. Elizabeth goes to Cedar Hills seeking a better life, to be close to art and culture and money. And she does allow herself to be used. But her story is primarily about personal growth and self-empowerment. What she finds in Cedar Hills isn't at all what she was looking for, but it's exactly what she needs.Angel-Seeker is a well-structured, skillfully written novel filled with emotionally brave and generous characters. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Obadiah, Gabriel, Rachel, Nathan, and Magdalena again and was happy to meet Rebekah and Elizabeth. I do hope that Shinn keeps returning to this lovely world she's created.

I skipped ahead fromArchangel (Samaria, Book 1), because I wanted to revisit the characters that I fell in love with in the first novel. This time, Shinn focuses on a young woman growing up in the highly restrictive culture of the Jansai. This setting allows for a very topical social commentary on women's issues in the Middle East, but I was disappointed in the ending, which felt very much like a wishful-thinking, easy-way-out solution to the problem of the Jansai. The ending also spoiled the social-commentary aspect, since such a solution simply is not possible in the real world.The second plot line was far less memorable, and I generally found myself skimming through it to get to the Jansai story.As always with a Shinn novel, romance plays a central role in the plot. You won't enjoy this book if you can't tolerate romance."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"If you loved Archangel (the first book in the Samaria series) then you will LOVE this book.

There are basically 2 main female characters in the book: Elizabeth, the angel seeker, and Rebekah, the Jansai woman. Angel Seekers are like rock groupies, but Sharon Shinn manages to portray Elizabeth's character to be much more complex and much more sympathetic that just a groupie. But the storyline that makes the book for me was Rebekah's story, the Jansai woman. The way the Jansai treats their women reminds me of stories I've heard about how Afghan women were treated under Taliban rule. Rebekah is a strong woman who yearns for a better life for herself and the women of her tribe but also has a strong sense of love and belonging to the very tribe that treats her badly.All in all, I enjoyed this book very much."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"For those who have enjoyed Sharon Shinn's novels of Samaria and wondered \\"Whatever happened to Obadiah?\\" the engaging Angel from \\"Archangel\\", here is the follow-up book that tells his story. It tells the tale of two people from very different cultures wanting to love each other, but encountering prohibitions and even life-threating obstacles to being together. The woman Obadiah falls in love with, Rebekah, is a Jansai. The women of this race are kept in virtual purdah and the affair between the two means a death-sentance for Rebekah should they be discovered. The portrayal of their covert affair was very affecting, much more so than the parallel story line of the \\"angel-seeker\\" that the book takes it's title from. Elizabeth comes to the keep to try to become pregnant with an Angels child, only to find herself as a person instead.

But in addition there is the detailed description of the repression of women in the Jansai culture, which provokes both thought and feeling. A great book."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"The second of Sharon Shinn's post-trilogy novels of Samaria, \\"Angel Seeker\\" sounds the least promising and yet ends up being second only to \\"Archangel\\" in the entire series. In chronology, it's placed right after the first book in the series, tying up some of the loose ends and questions that \\"Archangel\\" may have left you with - namely, what about poor Obadiah?Obadiah, if you remember, was the angel who had a major crush on Rachel, the human woman who ended up marrying the Archangel Gabriel. As \\"Angel Seeker\\" opens, Obadiah, nursing a broken heart, is relocated to Cedar Hills and designated the angelic envoy to the Jansai. The Jansai are thinly veiled (no pun) Arabic/Muslim counterparts, who refuse to allow their women to show their faces or walk unescorted. Naturally, Obadiah falls in love with a rebellious but still loyal to her family Jansai woman, who meets with him secretly yet refuses to leave with him for the angel hold.I found the love story between Obadiah and Rebekah the most poignant, fully realized romance in any of the five books so far published. Maybe it's just that they admit their love and get on with it; Shinn's modus operandi up until now has mostly been for the two protagonists to vehemently deny their attraction to one another until the last three pages. Obadiah and Rebekah have no such qualms, and their love scenes are bittersweet and easily familiar to anyone who's ever conducted a clandestine affair of their own. (Ahem.)As for the \\"angel seeker\\" of the title... The subplot involving Elizabeth, who thinks she wants an angel lover but - surprise! - really doesn't, just ends up bogging the rest of the book down. It could have been a good story, but Shinn just doesn't pay enough attention to it to make it anything new or exciting. I would rather have seen the two stories separated into two separate books, with sufficient attention paid to each. But that's me.Overall, I was very impressed by \\"Angel Seeker\\". It's obvious that Shinn still has a lot to say about Samaria, and I always love revisiting it. I just hope this isn't the end of her fascination with angels!"},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"I liked it, but I think that Sharon focused more on the Romance in this one than the actual plot.

I'm a fan of well written romance novels that have an actual plot and a bit of a spin on the old genre.However, this is a far cry from Shinn's original series. Her Samaria series was interesting, creative, and smacked enough of sci-fi/fantasy to be labeled as such. Ths had just a little too much fluff and all I can really label it as is a comfort book. The book gets extra points for keeping me interested, but it literally dropped the ball in the last four chapters or so. There was so much buildup that it rushed the outomes of these characters' relationships and really cheapened even my beginning interest in the novel. We waited hundreds of pages to see the outcomes of the main characters and this is what you give us? Relationships just fall flat and there's a really lousy wrap up to the end of the novel. A better conclusion would have shown both girls and the new bond they may have formed through all their ordeals. It would have tied the story together very well.Most blaringly is the absence of any of the mystery that surrounded the first books. I realize that the general populous doesn't know the truth behind Samaria, but why make no reference to any of it at all? At one point there is a slight reference to the oracles at Mt. Sinai, and then Shinn runs away from it as though she knows she doesn't even want to go there. Shinn had really spent a lot of effot creating religion and history in her past novels. There is none of this in that. I would go into more detail about this, but I don't want to give away any spoilers to anyone who hasn't read those books yet.I understand that it's easy to give 5 stars to a fluffy romance that might have been enjoyable, but this really wasn't up to par or even in the same category as her previous books."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"I've read all of Sharon Shinn's Samaria books, and enjoyed them all. But Angel-Seeker has to be one of my favorites. I finished it on one day, reading it for about five hours straight and refusing to feed my cats until I was done. I can tell you that they don't like it so much...Angel-Seeker is the tale of two women, Elizabeth and Rebekah. The two are very different -- Elizabeth is an Angel-Seeker, a woman who tries to seek out an angel lover in hopes of bearing an angel child. Rebekah is a Jansai of marriagable age, waiting for her father to find her a suitiable husband.The story is very predictable -- both fall in love and live happily ever after. But Shinn's remarkable writing skills keep the novel moving at a quick pace and hook the reader's attention. Her imagery and description is absolutely breathtaking, especially when she's describing the angel's singing. I'd read any of her novels just to drool over her writing.It was fun reading about old characters, but you don't have to have read any of the other Samaria books in order to enjoy Angel-Seeker. I'd reccomend them all to anyone though, whether or not they're a big fan of fantasy. Sharon Shinn's writing is so amazing that I think anyone could enjoy them."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"I love this series...it is definately on my \\"comfort shelf\\". My least favorite is the third. This one is probably not good for youth readers...it has some serious adult topics. It really gets into the life of angel seekers and the promiscuity of that group of people. The Janasi have a very arabic/muslim feel and the book is pretty slanted against them. Overall the book was much heavier and more...dare I say it...political than the first four. I'd recommend it to those of a stout heart and moderate shock value/life experience."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"This is the third of the Samaria books which I have read and while I still consider Archangel the best, Angel Seeker comes a close second. The characters are similar enough to people we know or know about that they are comprehensible and, in some cases, sympathetic. The plot is well paced, two women from totally different circumstances each learn about love and angels. Shinn made me care about them and want to see them succeed, each in her own way. I am generally hard to please when it comes to romances since I find most to be very formulaic and ordinary, but Angel Seeker stood out and earned my respect. I highly recommend it to anyone who feels even the slightest pull towards this book. It helps if you have read either of the first two books but it isn't essential."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"In this novel of Samaria, author Sharon Shinn revisits the time and place of ARCHANGEL, which in my opinion is her best work to date. We go back to the time of the Archangel Gabriel and follow the story of two very different women. One is an angel-seeker - down on her luck, Elizabeth decides to travel to Cedar Hills in hopes of concieving an angel baby and returning to a life of luxury. Rebekah saves the life of a stranger who just happens to be an angel and romance blossoms. There's only one problem - Rebekah is a Jansai woman who is forced to wear a veil and is kept in virtual captivity. She is forbidden to all men, most of all a hated angel (the Jansai have a strong dislike for angels).I fell in love with ARCHANGEL and was truly disappointed when Shinn's other Samaria novels concentrated on other protagonists and time periods, and delved more into the science fiction element of the Samaria universe. With ANGEL-SEEKER, I really feel as if she's returned to a winning formula."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"Its a wonderful sensual book, it holds all different kinds of love,[soul mate, family love, sibling love] Its great and it also holds betrayel, secrets and other things mixed into one book, Sharon shinn did a wonder job and i hope she writes more."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"This is by far my favorite of the Samaria series. My favorite has always been the first one, so I was very happy to return to the time period in which Archangel is set and reunite with a few familiar characters. Sharon Shinn mentions on her website that Angel-Seeker is also her favorite book of the series, and that is most definitely reflected in the writing. Compared to the others, Angel-Seeker is so full of life. (Not that the others weren't good!) Within pages of meeting Elizabeth, Obadiah, and even Rebekah, I started relating to them.A lot of my favoritism towards this book is probably due to the fact that it tackles an issue I feel strongly about -- women's rights. Rebekah is a Jansai, a group of people who keep their women hidden from all others. Rebekah isn't allowed to show her face in public; in fact, she's hardly allowed to walk out of the house in front of others who aren't her family. Her entire well-being depends on her stepfather, and the man she will marry. As an independent woman, I felt so sorry for her and really wanted her to break out of her prison. It was doubly intense, since she falls in love with an angel, Obadiah, and secretly meets with him. I thought their love story was the most intense. First of all, because they seemed to love each other so much. Secondly, because of all that was riding on it. If Rebekah was caught, she'd be taken into the desert by her family, stoned within an inch of death, and left to die. So she had to be really good at keeping her relationship and midnight trysts a secret, which added a great deal of suspense and drama to the story.In stories with multiple points of view, my favorite character usually ends up being the one the book starts off with. That wasn't true for this one. While I loved Elizabeth's coming-of-age story of growth, I really didn't like her at the beginning. She's very whiny and tries to take the easy way out of life. I really respected her by the end, but her story just wasn't as good as Obadiah's and Rebekah because of all the obstacles they had in their way. Elizabeth just made obstacles for herself.As with most romances, a lot of the draw is from the characters and not the plot line. However, Shinn always does a good job in balancing the two. The individual stories were interesting, and while very much character-driven, this novel made for a good page-turner. Angel-Seeker is 2nd chronologically, but like Shinn, I recommend reading the series by the publishing date. I got a lot more out of this than I would have due to the information I learned in books 2-4.Overall, a good read. Romance fans, angel fans, science fiction fans, and simply fans of a good story and good characters will love this series, especially this novel. This was the end of the Samaria series, and it did not disappoint."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"love love love this book!! Sharon Shinn makes me believe in her world ...and every time i finish one of her books i look for the next one"},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"Read it! Read it! Read it! This series is a fantastic journey through time and space. It brings up all manner of questions about religion and culture. Good stuff."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"This was the fifth and final book in Shinn's Samaria series. It's not that it reached any definitive conclusion to the series, just that it was the last one written and that the author has said she has no plans to write more of them.I enjoyed it. It seemed to have a bit of a political message, but it was one I agree with.All of these Samaria books are interesting blends of SF, fantasy, and romance. The SF bit is that we're living in a world that is specifically not Earth but a distant colony of Earth in some equally distant future. The fantasy bit is that we're living in a world with angels living amongst the mortals of the world, and there is no doubt about the reality of Jovah, their god. They can sing prayers and get results, anything from manna falling from the heavens to lightning bolts blasting at the desired target. And the romance... well, in some ways I would say that they are all romance books merely set in an odd SF/fantasy world.This book has two romances. The first is between an ambitious girl and... well, I won't say with whom. She is determined to marry an angel and give birth to an angel child. I won't say whether or not she succeeds, but I will say that her romance is more about finding herself than whether or not she actually marries an angel. I enjoyed this one quite a bit, mostly for her character arc.The second romance was between an angel and a young Jansai girl. The Jansai are one of the many cultures populating the world of Samaria, and they seem to be remarkably similar to certain Earth cultures, particularly in how they treat their women. They treat their women as cherished property, but they can also be quite vicious to their women if they step outside their defined roles. And sexual promiscuity pretty much carries the death penalty, i.e. stoning and exile to the lifeless desert.Anyway, this second romance dealt a lot with the politics around that kind of culture. Many or most of the men seem to be quite happy to hand out these harsh punishments. Some are disgusted by it but seem powerless to stop the overall harshness. The women are mixed between those who support it simply because it's what they know, those who hate it but find can only fight it in tiny rebellions, and those who would flagrantly flaunt the law of their male masters.Shinn ultimately comes down hard on this culture, so there is some politics here, but like I said, I agree with her position. As for the romance, I mostly found myself shouting at the young Jansai girl to get out while the getting is good, but I confess that seeing her reluctance to leave the only world she knew gave me some insight into how many women on Earth tolerate or even reinforce these cultures here on Earth. So while parts of it made my skin crawl, it did expand my horizons.Now, that's all about how I liked the book for what it was. However, I do have a little complaint about what the book wasn't, and that's no fault of the book. What bugged me was where it fell in the Samarian timeline.The first three books in this series proceeded along in chronological order. Then the fourth book jumped to a time long before the first, and then this one was just after the first. That would be all right except that the third book - the furthest along in the timeline - kind of ended on a cliffhanger. There had been some major change in the world, and I was left wondering what was going to happen next. After two more books, I still don't know because nothing has been written in the time after the third book, and from the sounds of it, nothing will be.As such, the series feels unfinished to me. I don't know if the publisher just gave up on it, or if the author herself doesn't know what comes next. Either way, I'm cranky that I never quite got a sense of resolution to this series."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"SPOILER ALERT: I've enjoyed all the Samaria books, but this one had less meat in it than the others. It is mostly romance, with other conflicts and suspense playing a dim backdrop as two young damsels make missteps in their lives and white knights eventually find them, love them, and carry them away, though it's hard to know why. Each of the women has a counterpart -- a friend who makes the same desperate/foolish choices and pays a terrible price for it. I suppose their fates are supposed to add to the suspense about what will happen to our heroines. It was a good \\"comfort read,\\" but it lacks the larger complexity of the other books in this series."},{"Title":"Angel-Seeker (Samaria)","review":"Five years ago I discovered the most awesome of awesome Sharon Shinn. I'd been walking pastArchangelin the bookstore for ages at that point and passing it up every single time because of the cover. (Will I ever mend my cover snobbery ways??) I remember it was a recommendation by a very trusted Readerville friend that finally pushed me over the edge into buying a copy and giving it a shot. I didn't get past the first page--no, the first line--before falling irrevocably in love.***The angel Gabriel went to the oracle on Mount Sinai, looking for a wife.***The world . . . such a world she creates in that book! And, as I've told you many a time, she is no slouch in the character department either. Rachel and Gabriel are as beloved to me as any characters I've ever read. They're so real to me they transcend the barrier of between book and reader. At the time I had no idea it was actually the first book in a series--the Samaria series. Upon finding out, I immediately dashed to the bookstore and purchased books two and three and glommed my way through them as well, barely pausing to catch my breath despite the fact that hundreds of years passed in Samaria between each book. Then a fourth book--a prequel of sorts--was published and I had the pleasure of finding out what the world was like a couple of hundred years before Gabriel and Rachel walked it. And then I heard tell of a fifth book coming out. And when I heard when it took place and who the main character was, I knew it would rock my world. ANGEL-SEEKER follows a dear friend of Rachel's--an angel by the name of Obadiah who, for various reasons, was left a bit at loose ends at the close ofArchangel. This fifth book was to be his story and, believe me, it is impossible not to love Obadiah. And his story lived up to every expectation I had. Published last of the lot, it often feels to me like some readers never quite make it to this installment and that is such a shame because it is top notch stuff and my second favorite afterArchangel.Obadiah is spoiling for a fight. He's restless at the Eyrie, which has always been his home. He doesn't fit in at Cedar Hills, despite his loving friends who only want the best for him. And to top it all off, he's still carrying a pretty strong torch for a woman he can never have. Then the Archangel sends calls him into his office and sends him on a mission to the last place Obadiah wants to go--Breven. The home of the Jansai merchants, Breven is a bit of a lion's den when it comes to angels. But Obadiah has always had a way with people. Blessed with a light heart and a clever tongue, he is literally the kind who finds music wherever he goes. And since the alternative is throwing himself off a cliff from despair and boredom, he agrees to the Archangel's demand. And for awhile things go fine. But on his way back to Cedar Hills something goes badly wrong and he is stranded in the desert, where a young Jansai woman named Rebekah finds him. Despite the rather large taboo against talking to men outside her family, let alone brazen angels, Rebekah nurses Obadiah back to health and a connection is formed that will spell both the heights of happiness and the depths of danger for the young woman and the angel. Interwoven with their story is the tale of a poor young woman named Elizabeth who makes her way to Cedar Hills in search of an angel to father her a child and thus secure her lasting comfort and safety. Angel children are rare and much prized and Elizabeth is nothing if not practical and determined. And so she leaves the obscure farm she lives on for the big city and the elusive freedom that just may await her there.These two stories interweave in unexpected and very complimentary ways and--as is always the case with a Shinn book--I'm surprised that I am perfectly content to love the ones I'm with, if you will. I look forward to each alternating chapter, to finding out what's going on with the Rebekah and Obadiah and then Elizabeth and her struggles to find the life she's so certain she wants. What constantly amazes me about Sharon Shinn is that she consistently crafts equally strong female and male characters. They call out to me in spades as they are so finely matched in strength of character and determination. I worried so much over how Obadiah would fare out on his own, without the friends he loved. But then he met Rebekah and all the little pieces fell into place. Nothing was easy, but when they were together it felt right and not like it was manufactured just to finish out a side character's story arc satisfactorily for longtime readers. What a blessed relief that is! Their relationship develops in an incredibly sweet manner, unfolding slowly against the backdrop of discrimination and fear that surrounds their two peoples who have been at each other's throats since time immemorial. Because of the nature of their interactions, everything is played out in little snatches of time, brief moments in which they are able to be together. There is quite a lot of tension, but none of the resentment and barely suppressed anger that characterized Rachel and Gabriel's tumultuous relationship. These two are different and very much their own characters. Often in books like this, one storyline out shadows the other, but seemingly terminally single minded and heartless Elizabeth completely grew on me. She grew and became both harder and smarter and gentler, which is, of course, a combination impossible for me to resist. Last but not least, there are just the right amount of glimpses of old favorite characters sprinkled here and there to put a smile on my lips and remind me why each book in this series is a delight and why I will be reading them over and over again all throughout the years of my life. Highly recommended for fans of romantic fantasy and strong world-building.Reading Order (chronologically):Angelica,Archangel, ANGEL-SEEKER,Jovah's Angel, andThe Alleluia Files(in order of publication):Archangel,Jovah's Angel,The Alleluia Files, Angelica, and ANGEL-SEEKER"},{"Title":"The big book of horses","review":"Purchased this book for my 8 year granddaughter who is a horse lover.

No military credentials are needed. The sign of a good storyteller is getting the reader to have the same feelings the author does...I found myself full of pride, anger, frustration alongside Black; sometimes I wanted to cry and sometimes I wanted to pat this guy on the back. Sometimes I just went \\"Phew!\\"This isn't a gung-ho book on \\"How I won the war\\". Its full of frailties, shortcomings, and reality. If you are looking for Gen. Patton's story, its not here. If you are looking for a coming of age story that includes finding identity, a successful path in life, and learning of the larger world around us, that is here. Black simply has the \\"good\\" misfortune of growing up in time that led him down a path to two wars, and his base of battle knowledge -- thick as a rocket launch pad - is the heart of the book.The book includes also includes a fair amount of background of his early years as a farm kid, which is a good laugh. It's when the book takes off into his early training in Army is when this book really runs.Anyone who ever protested the Vietnam War should read this - not to attack an agenda but to understand more about how the war affected us all. (This is coming from someone who remembers Walter Kronkite's reports from Saigon and whose Mom would have taken me to Canada had I been of draft age).I usually don't read these types of military genre books, but I really loved it. This would be a great read on vacation, for anyone of any age. With all the stuff happening in world right now, we need more Blacks in this world to remind us what living is like when someone always wants you gone. Makes me appreciate the simple things in life. Makes me realize that we have heroes amongst us. But like Black, they don't think of themselves as one. It was a simple matter of just trying to be the best, and to come home."},{"Title":"Ranger Born","review":"Dear Readers,To properly praise a book means putting it in context with one's own background and experiences. US Army Ranger Bob Black's new book, A RANGER BORN, talks so well about his experiences in both the Korean and the Vietnam Wars, and has served in so many ways as a vivid reminder of my own Asian experiences, first as a USAF airman assigned to Osan Air Base south of Seoul in 1966, and then to Vietnam in 1967 and 1968.That first tour in Korea was 13 years after the signing of the Armistice Agreement, and conditions were still very rough, with the war remaining very much in evidence.Then, still as a military journalist, I went to Vietnam for a couple of back to back tours in the period before and after Tet 1968, ranging from the Mekong Delta fan to the bunkers of Dong Ha, at the eastern fringe of Leatherneck Square. I spent time at many of the air bases as well as on the ground or in the air above such places as Hue, Khe Sanh, Pleiku, Trang Sup, and Tay Ninh.They were years of so much memory -- of people, events, places, sights, sounds, smells; some things sad, others horrible, some joyful, even proud, others so painful that wiped away would be a blessing.You need to know this background so you will understand how crisp and sure, how factual and descriptive I found Colonel Black's narrative. He is a writer who has been there, done that, and come away mostly intact; first as a Corporal in Korea, up front as a Ranger, carrying a .30 caliber Browning Automatic Rifle in combat; then as a middle aged field grade officer trying so hard as an advisor to beat the politics while simultaneously trying so hard to instill a seed of military survival in Vietnamese units lacking so much while serving in the most terrible of circumstances.Bob Black has a steel trap memory combined with the heart of a warrior. Searching for the words to tell it like it was, he used both heart and mind well, drawing from the well of experience in ample measure. Reading his passages, you can smell the garlic and kimchi, taste the fish sauce, feel the grit on your neck and the dust in your eyes, see the tracers bounce in nights lit only by flare light, hear the crunches, thumps and stutters of weaponry, and catch more than a whiff of cordite on some very hot, very humid, long and headache filled days.It is my assessment that the Colonel, a very skilled writer as his other works so amply attest, has achieved great success in this, his latest endeavor, and this new book has the texture and feel of a classic, in the vein of Platoon Leader, Company Commander or even -- and yes, I believe this -- that great novel that continues to teach so many truths and realities about the military profession, Once An Eagle.I am not a Ranger, though I am blessed to have Ranger friends, but I shared close contact with the Ranger community at Dugway, Utah a few years back, and take it as the strongest article of military faith that Rangers do indeed lead the way for all the rest of us. Back in those days, in the mid-1980s, I was an Army civilian, the installation PAO, and was between tours as the CINC speech writer in Korea.Outside of incoming, that speech writing task held twice in Korea was the toughest job I ever had. Working deep in the shadows for such great soldiers as Robert Sennewald, Bill Livsey, Lou Menetrey and Robert RisCassi, and under friendly, sometimes stern guidance of CSMs Bill Gates, Ralph Phillips, Roosvelt Martain and Sam Smith, meant learning all I could learn about the Korean War, while not ignoring the valuable lessons of Vietnam and so many other conflicts and experiences, then putting it in context with the modern defense of Korea.In the messages these men gave to a multiplicity of audiences, including hostile ones, credibility was a given, accuracy a must. Leadership examples had to be finely drawn. Facts had to be on time and on target, and adjustment of the message shot group continually required team effort in the building of a presentation and great skill by the individual speaker in its giving.Noting the locale and delicacy of the speakers' positions, failure of communication carried grave risks. Designing words of praise intermingled with words of warning required a hefty library of resource materials.Were I still doing that job today, A RANGER BORN, Bob Black's memoir of Asian war, would have a prominent and forward leaning place in my workspace; the book's pages turned and bent, sentences highlighted, paragraphs marked in search of truth about war; so huge and so visceral, so hard to ignore and yet so hard to describe in meaningful and complete language.In a pair of deadly, terrible wars, Bob Black was there. He was the kind of soldier who saw both conflicts for what they were, and minced no words in telling the tale. His thoughts are of value for those who served, and of equal use for those who today protect our freedom in new, strange and deadly struggles.If, in the next decade, you only read one work about the hot campaigns of the cold war, make it Bob Black's A RANGER BORN.Respectfully Submitted for Consideration,Rick Fulton"},{"Title":"Ranger Born","review":"Unlike the technical, detailed Ranger books written by Col.

Because of the short duration of the Korean War and the short life of these elite soldiers of the Airborne Ranger Companies of Korea, much has been forgotten about their service and sacrifices. Ranger Black's book, \\"A Ranger Born\\", revives these memories and educates many who never really knew of the many obstacles and terrible conditions these men fought in. He takes us on a journey through his young life to the man he is today. Through two wars, including his service in the Vietnam War. Once I started reading it, it was hard to put down and that is a true measure of a book, isn't it ?? I read a lot of military history books, fiction and non-fiction, and I would put this book up there with the good ones as easily readable and entertaining. It is quite informative too, for those interested in the inner workings of a military advisor to the ARVN Army. I'd like to thank you Bob for sharing your story and your memories.

RVN , Past President, 75th Ranger Regiment Association (1998-2000)"},{"Title":"Ranger Born","review":"This book is really two books in one. It is a memior of an enlisted Army Ranger in the Korean War and an account of a Senior officer as a district advisor in the Vietnam War. The period about the Vietnam War shows Mr Black to be a true soldier with a heart. An understanding man who even considers putting himslef on \\"burn detail.\\" He writes with a depreciating sence of humor and also discribes in lessons learned. The Publisher's Weekly review of LtCol Black as aloof is far off based and hints at the reviewer's anti military bias.It is the Korean War period of that makes this book historical. It is, I believe the only memoir of an Army Ranger from Ft. Benning Ranger School, through combat as a Ranger. How Pvt Black when from clerk typist in 82d Div HQ to Ranger School is a testimony of both his desire and the aptitude of the \\"talent scouts\\" who selected him for the Rangers.Black's discription of Ranger training at Benning and Mountain warfare training in Colorado has a feel of an outdoor adventure story and brought back fond memories of my own service with the US Marines small boat raid company and training as a USMC mule packer. Black presents a harrowing account of the disparate battles of the Ranger Companies in Korea and rates with some of the best Korean War infantry books, such as \\"About Face\\" \\"Herbert-The Making Of A Soldier\\" and \\"We Called It War.\\"Col. Black is an inductee in the Ranger Hall of Fame. This book provides an example of why soldiers so highly regard the black and yellow arc shoulder patch."},{"Title":"Ranger Born","review":"It gave an excellent description of the action and political misgivings of the Korean and Vietnam wars."},{"Title":"Ranger Born","review":"As a child born during the Vietnam war, I was embarrassed that I knew little about it. I could not have picked a better teacher. Learning about this time in history was decorated with the amazing story of one extraordinary man. I could not have picked a better character to guide me through the US military and Asian conflicts of my childhood. As the words of Robert Black carried me into worlds of the misunderstood, I came out of the the autobiography with an educated understanding of a troubled time in our history. Robert Black is the \\"Dr Phil\\" or our US Armed Forces. He tells it like it is, whether you are ready or not. In A Ranger Born, he writes for all those who care to learn and laugh on a journey that explores an unsafe time in history escorted by a Ranger that will protect and entertain you through the entire tour.I hope Col. Black is deciding who will play him in the movie. I have a few suggestions...does anyone else? Read the book and you will see unforgetable characters come to life. Col. Black is the man everyone wants in their foxhole!!! Reading his book is as close as you will get!"},{"Title":"Ranger Born","review":"First off, let me say I admire Bob Black for what he did for his country. He served in Korea and Vietnam and fought the good fight. I will disagree with him on wheather the war was winnable or not in both places. If we had to go to the Yalu and beyond, we could have triggered WWIII. If we had invaded North Vietnam, we would have faced guerrilla war in the mountains of NVA. Black believes the military was held back and prevented from winning. All of these are disputable areas.That being said, Black related his time in service in both wars. This battle book is no different than many others out there. I enjoyed the war stories. This was an OK read about the U.S. military."},{"Title":"Ranger Born","review":"On page 207 of the paperback edition, Black writes about &quot;sappers believed to have been drawn from a North Vietnamese parachute regiment.&quot; After I inquired to well over 100 Vietnam (in-country) veterans about a North Vietnamese parachute regiment, I was met with blank stares. A high percentage of these individuals served in combat units (i.e. Special Forces, 173rd, 101st, 1st Aviation Brigade). NO ONE EVER HEARD of a North Vietnamese parachute regiment. I was curious, so I contacted the author (Black) via telephone on Saturday (30 May, 2004). Black stated that he obtained the information from the military archives at Carlisle Barracks. When I checked the archives, no hits were obtained on this subject from their site, however they are now closed for the summer due to an ongoing physical location move. As a former combat Special Forces soldier and a retired homicide detective, I smell embellishment on this subject!"},{"Title":"Patti Smith : An Unauthorized Biography","review":"I see that most of these people hate this book. I admit it has its faults. Lots of 'em. The cover is supremely nasty. Not really because Patti has her hands stuck down her pants. The authors manage to mention themselves enough to slightly annoy the reader, and Victor even put a picture of himself in it (of course Patti's in the picture, too, but you get the feeling there were LOTS more photos to choose from, and he just put that one in there to feel all special). More than a few times, we get bombarded with images of Patti enjoying carnal pleasures -by herself. I'm not easily offended, but it was just unnecessary. All of that other stuff already mentioned, it's informative, and it's really the only Patti Smith bio out there. All in all, an okay read. Plus, you can't beat the price- I just happened to see it in a store and was able to buy it with scrounged-up pocket money."},{"Title":"Patti Smith : An Unauthorized Biography","review":"I went to see Patti Smith last night at the Housing Works bookstore in New York City, and I couldn't help but look up the name of the book that turned me into a New York and Patti Smith fan for life. I was surprised to see all the bad reviews, and even though I might not have enough knowledge to know what was wrong with the book, I just want to say that I loved it when I first read it.I bought this book at the FOPP CD and book store in London for 5 pounds and I couldn't believe my luck. I was in my twenties, a huge Patti fan, and couldn't wait to find out more about her.For me, the book did exactly that. It got me hooked. I read about Patti, Robert Maplethorpe, their time at the Chelsea Hotel, and Patti's recordings of her albums. I read about New York City in the 70s, the bands and clubs at the time, and I loved every second of it.This book deepened my relationship with Patti Smith, and when I moved to New York City years later, I couldn't believe I was finally visiting the Church on St. Marks, where Patti did poetry readings, myself. It was not only New York I moved to, it was Patti Smith's New York."},{"Title":"Patti Smith : An Unauthorized Biography","review":"I have been an enormous fan of Patti Smith's since 1975. This book shows that my hero isn't perfect, and that makes me love her even more. She had a dream and was willing to do what was needed to make it happen. She grew, she got married and was happy, and has re-emerged with more to say, and new ways to say it. Patti Smith is beyond a goddess, she is beyond rock star, she is above &quot;punk high priestess&quot;. She is an artist, a poet and a messenger in the purest sense. Read this book if you want an unbiased view. Read &quot;Complete&quot; if you want Patti's thoughts. Read her books if you want to know her inside and out, but even then, how can you catch the wind?"},{"Title":"Patti Smith : An Unauthorized Biography","review":"I confess that when I first browsed through this book over a year ago, I really didn't like it. It seemed like quite a hostile work, and I put down a lot of the apparent bias to Bockris also being Deborah Harry's biographer and the Smith-Harry relationship, such as it ever was, being one of oil and water. However. On rereading, this book doesn't look as bad as all that. Smith won't enjoy reading it, but it certainly does not trash her--the clips and quotes from her most demented phases are kept to a minimum and the balance of what people have to say about her to this biographer is respectful, if somewhat baffled. There is a great deal of overlap between this treatment of Smith and Patricia Morrissey's far more detailed and professional biography of Robert Mapplethorpe, the Diego Rivera to Smith's Frida Kahlo. If one reads it as a supplement to that book, rounding out the picture of Smith as professional acquaintances and non-intimate friends saw her, the result is reasonably consistent. This in itself is an achievement. Bockris does not exactly get inside Smith's head, but that may be an impossibility for anyone other than Smith; she comes across as a powerful but fragmented personality. And this may be the mark of the born performer, the man or the woman with a sixth sense for their effect on others but little cohesive sense of self in private, giving them the talent for battening onto any symbols that project (and supply) their personal subjectivity, and fueling the combination of selflessness and narcissism that allows a person to take the blows on the path to fame. Smith's peculiar genius--the word is not too strong--is that of a long line of American artists who have been able to take this aspect of their personalities and use it to mirror the intense ambition, puritanism, fragmentation, and self-consciousness that typify the American character. She may have been obsessed with foreign influences--what American isn't?--but her unique talent was to be in some measure conscious of the source of this obsession, and use it, at her best, actually to find and channel links between the dementia of all nations and an indigenous spiritual lineage going back to John Brown at least. And as a working-class hero from the Rust Belt, her obsession with transcendence parallels that of a country whose greatest appeal and danger lies in the promise it holds out of being able to transcend one's origins--not to rise above them, but to bring them to a higher level, through a combination of courage, vision, and Napoleonic megalomania. Patti Smith remains dangerous long after punk has ceased to be; she remains dangerous because America does.The trouble is that Smith's fans already know all this, and consequently there is only limited interest in hearing one more anecdote about the artist's eccentricities or one more piece of speculation about how she got that way. This book is not really a biography in the usual sense. It amounts to a superior compilation of stories and press clippings, most of which are not salacious (Smith always wanted you to believe she was bigger and badder than she was). But in the absence of the context provided by testimony from family members and others who know Smith best, and who naturally are not talking, the one or two pieces of interesting information sound like a tease and take on a pejorative quality. This effect can be observed in the little that we get to know about Fred Smith, Patti's late husband and, after Mapplethorpe, the biggest influence on her life and work. There is no doubt that his American populist aesthetic harmonized with hers, and may have rescued her from the manic &quot;Radio Ethiopia&quot; kitsch into which she was disappearing at the time of a near-fatal accident (she danced off a stage) that temporarily stymied her career. But depending on who you talk to, Fred Smith was either a kind and considerate husband, or a creep who stopped his wife's career, crushed her spirit, may have belted Patti around. The anecdotes to either effect are just that, anecdotes, and do not transcend the feeling of being breaches of privacy. And what does anyone mean by charging that the two albums Patti cut in the wake of his death are &quot;careerist&quot; or &quot;professional mourning,&quot; just because he may not always have been good for her and she still misses him deeply? Sheesh.The true biography of Patti Smith remains to be written. As for most important artists, it may need to wait till she is gone: Smith guards her privacy closely and there's no reason why she shouldn't. But by all means, read this one: it will take you back. And the pictures are good."},{"Title":"Patti Smith : An Unauthorized Biography","review":"What a piece of garbage! Bockris and Bayley do here for Patti what Kitty Kelley did for Sinatra. Just about every occurence is Smith's life and work is judged by these two as careerist and manipulative, so unfortunately, this book is in no way the fair or balanced account that Smith fans had hoped for.These two are even shameless enough to admit that the bulk of information provided by the book comes from interviews that Patti did with other people throughout her career. My guess is that one would come away much more informed by searching out the originals and seeing what Patti had to say in the proper context."},{"Title":"Patti Smith : An Unauthorized Biography","review":"Great subject for a bio. Beautiful photo inside of Patti and Robert Mapplethorpe standing on their fire escape. Notice I haven't said anything regarding the quality of the writing?"},{"Title":"Patti Smith : An Unauthorized Biography","review":"Patti Smith has a life story so interesting and compelling that even an account this pedestrian and unispired is interesting at times. But that is because of the story of Patti Smith, rather than the writing here, which is barely above the level of the average People magazine article.The author failed to conduct a single interview with Smith for the book. His entire \\"research\\" consists of reading other people's work- other articles and books. Hence nothing is new here and nothing feels particularly incisive or accurate.The author prefers to list famous people who attended a performance, rather than offer any insight into what made that performance (the art itself) interesting or meaningful. He spends lots of time with catty references and lukewarm sexual gossip, and no time analizing what makes Smith's writing and performance so compelling year after year.There is also an ongoing series of refernces to Patti being \\"mean\\" to Debbie Harry, like the two are jealous high school cheerleaders rather than important women in rock. These refernces are utterly pointless.At the end of the book is the one interview the author ever did with Smith, in 1972 at her first poetry being published. Reading it entertaining, because you realize the author used every single word in the book itself, desperately trying to spread this pr puff piece long enough to make it seem as if he knows Smith and her world. Pathetic.This effort is particularly galling because Patti Smith herself did so much (and does so much today) to stretch boundaries, to make new connections, to reinvent her chosen art forms. How unflattering a contrast then, to have this \\"biography\\" be so utterly dull witted and pedantic. A National Enquirer article would be more insightful.The book also fails to take into account Patti Smith's tremendous sense of humor. Often the \\"source\\" being cited is a pr interview Smith gives as a book is being published or a record released. She says something really funny and facetious(probably to keep herself amused with inane questions). But the author doesn't get the joke and cites what Smith says as if it were some declaration of serious intent from on high, later contradicted by a different answer years down the road.Finally, it takes balls for the author to imply Smith is pretentious while his own book jacket declares himself to be the \\"Poet Laureate of the New York Underground.\\" I would like to see a recount of the election to that post."},{"Title":"Patti Smith : An Unauthorized Biography","review":"This book is poor. The writing is questionable and the design is terrible.Its mainly compiled from articles and interviews-- which you could easily find for yourself on the web.In an effort to try to make the book dramatic or interesting they portray Debbie Harry as P.Smith's most hated enemy and threat? Give me a break.If you're really interested in Patti Smith then you'd be better off buying her books."},{"Title":"Patti Smith : An Unauthorized Biography","review":"From reading some of the comments, I was anticipating a viscious attack on Patti Smith. Yet when I read the book this is not what I found. To be sure the book is critical of Smith at times. Yet so was Patricia Morrisroe's book about Mapplethorpe. So was Please Kill Me, the oral history of the US punk scene, where Patti Smith came across like the Courtney Love of the 1970s. In fact, all three accounts are quite consistent.The fact is that unless people are expecting a whitewash or a hagiography, a biography has to take into account both the good and the bad when discussing a subject. That a person is described in similar ways in multiple accounts makes it very difficult to dismiss these accounts as mere hatchet jobs.What all three accounts reveal is not so much a bad person, just someone with very human personality flaws. While this may not be acceptable to those who want to see Smith in purely heroic terms or as some sort of artistic archetype, it would be dishonest to simply ignore a person's actual personality and behavior. Patti Smith was a talented, captivating performer, something Bockris makes clear repeatedly. She had an admirable drive to achieve and her own artistic vision. But on the flip side, her drive to make it sometimes careened into overweening ambition, and the same personality traits that fueled her desire to be an artist also fueled pretension and a seeming loss of perspective. In her early efforts to achieve recognition-desperately trying to be noticed at Max's Kansas City; talking her way into the Chelsea Hotel-you can see both a laudable power of will but also perhaps an excessive need for fame. And how should the dizzying gallery of lovers she collected be described? Maybe these were simply affairs of the heart, but there was a definite hint of social climbing that can't just be ignored.To me, I have always thought that Patti Smith's greatest strength was not in songwriting (others like Dee Dee Ramone, Deborah Harry and David Byrne were better original lyricists), but in her ability to play roles that catered to the needs of her audience. (As an aside, her historical significance has always been overstated in early accounts of the punk era; bands like the Ramones, Television, Blondie, not to mention the NY Dolls, were well underway before Smith emerged on the scene). In her first public poetry readings, she fully embraced the image of the romantic poet hero; it was a role she was actively playing. When she moved into music she again exhibited the ability and most of all the willingness to play a role: the singer as intellectual hero, a role that found an all too eager audience in the stilted and overheated milieu of 1970s rock criticism. In this way, her musical persona was very much an extension of her ambitions. While it may offend those who overvalue the image, to ignore a full exploration of the personality of a performer whose fame was to a large extent a product of her will and ambition would amount to intentional misrepresentation.In sum, critics of Bockris are free to argue that the focus on Smith's personality was petty and that this should not have been discussed in a biography. But to me, beyond being dishonest, this approach would deprive the reader of an important insight into who Smith was as a person. You cannot understand how Smith became a star and the nature of the stardom she achieved without understanding her personality in full. While perhaps not a great biography, it does not warrant the criticism suggested in many of the reviews. If anything, that criticism illustrates the value of this book."},{"Title":"Patti Smith : An Unauthorized Biography","review":"I bought this book in 2000, shortly after starting to become interested in Patti after seeing her on TV promoting \\"Gung Ho\\". I knew a little of her music up to that point, but nothing of her life, so I immediately sought out a biography; I found this in Barnes And Noble. The cover photo knocked me out right away; unlike most of the people who have posted reviews above, I think it is absolutely gorgeous. (She has the cutest tummy I've ever seen, so seeing it on the cover is a bonus!) I found the book very interesting, since like I said, I really didn't know anything about her so it was a good start to her life story. I realise Mr Bockris did not have access to Patti herself for input, nor did he interview anyone close to her, either family or professional, but at least he does not claim otherwise. He did know her when she was first starting out in NY, accompanied her to a poetry reading in London, and conducted the first official interview with her on publication of her first poetry book, so his first-hand knowledge here makes for fascinating reading, for me anyway :)The only thing I am a little disappointed in is that there is very little included about Patti's life as a mother and housewife in Detroit, not even the dates of birth of her children. As a mom myself, that is the part I like best about the artists and musicians I admire, hearing about them as \\"people\\". I know not everyone shares my viewpoint, and it is quite obvious that that is a part of Patti's life that she chose to keep private, but still as a biography I just feel there is something missing and a large and obviously important part of her life (to her, as she has stated) is skipped over. Maybe that is a book waiting for Patti to write herself :)All in all, I loved this book; it was a great intro to someone I just had a good feeling about, and continue to revere and follow to this day. And the photos are great too :)"},{"Title":"Patti Smith : An Unauthorized Biography","review":"Despite some pretty good biographies of Bebe Buell, Blondie and Keith Richards, Victor Bockris strikes out in a big way with &quot;Patti Smith: An Unauthorized Biography.&quot; Focusing on the snippy, selfish and just plain weird, Bockris creates an unflattering portrait of Smith that doesn't offer any insights.Patti Smith wasn't pretty or graceful, but her strong artistic leanings took her to New York in the cultural swirls of the 1970s. At first she was just a poet, although an outstandingly vivid one, and then she became a punk rocker with a unique look and style all her own. Upon her marriage to MC5 rocker Fresh Smith, Patti Smith vanished from the limelight for many years to be a quiet, obedient housewife... only to reappear when her husband died.At first, Bockris starts off strong with descriptions of Smith's childhood rebellions and love of rock'n'roll (including as her blunt description of her first glimpse of the Rolling Stones). Then she first arrives in New York and becomes enmeshed in the gritty avant-garde gaggle of artists and musicians -- so far so good. But the story starts to unravel when music comes back into the picture.When Smith's music comes onto the scene, Bockris distances himself. He sticks to her eccentricities and naster moments, with little emphasis on her music (such as her rivalry with Debbie Harry, which is never explained in full). The descriptions of Patti's husband, lovers and friends aren't very well-rounded -- we basically get a 2-D picture and that's it.&quot;Patti Smith: An Unauthorized Biography&quot; is mainly patched together from interviews and articles. That's always a problem; it puts a distance between the biographer and subject. And some of Bockris' comments about Smith's marriage seem suspect, almost like he was determined to see it as a failure. He seems disappointed that she opted to be a housewife for awhile rather than a punk goddess.Unbalanced and patched together from previous material, &quot;Patti Smith: An Unauthorized Biography&quot; is a passable starting point, but by no means a good source for info on Smith's life and art."},{"Title":"Patti Smith : An Unauthorized Biography","review":"The fact that Patti Smith's name follows Victor Bockris' and Roberta Baily's on the book catalog listing is misleading and irresponsible. Patti Smith had nothing to do with this book and neither did anybody who really knew or knows her. As said in the above reviews, it is a poor pastiche of periodical articles and conconcted stories by embittered has-beens and hangers on who themselves never created anything of worth. It is obvious that it's 'authors' did little if any real research on Patti Smith the individual or the artist and, sadly, they do not seriously focus on her work. It's as if they cut and pasted huge portions of the book from the internet while sitting at home on laptops doing google searches. In conclusion, this book is a waste of paper and money."},{"Title":"Patti Smith : An Unauthorized Biography","review":"Never dull, if sometimes uneven in quality.

Anything to keep Cat out of a foster home and get a clubhouse for themselves.No one knows the woman is dead until the girls confess it, to save Cat from danger. And here's the funny part. That backyard/graveyard was in Beverly Hills. 90210.Now, here is why you should not read this book. You should not read this book, because it is bad.

Personally, I feel the best of his work was the Cutler series, but the Landry and Logan series were also good. Orphans was okay. Wildflowers was more interesting, and this book isn't a shabby read. But after that, forget it. The Hudson series (Rain and onwards) was bad.Cat tells this story, and I was glad that she did, because she had the most interesting story out of the four girls. I remember being all excited when this book came out, and counting down the calendar days for its release. Overall this book was a fun read (not good or deep, just light and fun, despite the dark themes in here) I wasn't really surprised that Howard came back, and I was glad to learn more of Cat and Howard's relationship (and history)What I didn't understand was Lea giving Cathy to Geraldine. The whole situation was just ludicrous. Yes, parts of it made sense, but Lea should have known better than to give Cat to her bitter adopted daughter and a son-in-law that didn't even want to marry Geraldine in the first place.

I really got into Star's story but I couldn't help but think that Misty was just a whiner. She didn't have it so bad in my opinion. I didn't think she fit in with the rest of the Characters. I couldn't relate to Jade and she was really irritating...which isn't so bad because it made me more passionate about the book.

I couldn't help but laugh, and that's all I'll say about the plot.

But they make some shocking decisions. As soon as you read the book, you feel the chill it contains. I thought the senario was going to be predictable. Kind of like in the first four V.C. Andrews series. But when Geroldine suddenly died, I knew this book would take a wirl of exicitment. The characters are unrealistic, and I am surprised they even got along. But they pulled through the hard times.When Cat and her friends buried Geri, it showed how naive they were to try and cover up the truth.

That is how good this book is! I also HIGHLY recommend you read Web Of Dreams. But do not read the rest of the series because it is confusing and there are way too many characters and you get VERY lost. So many people find out they are related and everything and it is just plain confusing as hell.

The orphans and wildflowers are not as page turning and intriguing as past series have been. I was very disappointed in the ending of this book.

And i can't wait till the next one is published."},{"Title":"Into the Garden (Thorndike Core)","review":"This is a heartwarming story to teach preteens about friendship, parental relationships, and how to commit felonies. Our four characters from the not so terrible miniseries, Jade, Star, Misty and Cat are back and more screwed up than ever.The story is told from Cat's point of view. She finds some secrets about herself and her mother. She does clever things like jumping down from high places and breaking her ankle. So anyway, as numerous reviews before this one have pointed out. Cat finds her mother dead, and for some reason she decides not to call the police, but calls Jade instead.Jade comes over and they determine that her mother is in fact, dead. For some reason, Cat doesn't seem to care very much. They go on about how Cat will have to be an orphan now, and they will be separated, which in my opinion, would not be a bad thing at all. So they bury Cat's mother in the backyard and come up with stupid ideas such as one of them walking around the neighborhood every once and awhile wearing a brown wig.Then they look at the house, and they see a great big house with no parents. Yah! Party time. They entertain their boyfriends there. I guess they decided it would make a good whore house. Cat's father senses something strange about the girl's behavior, so he begins to call more and prowl around, since we know that he is supposed to be the real bad guy in this book.Keep reading for the exciting conclusion. It is also populated with many heartwarming scenes, such as Jade complaining because she has to do the dishes and it will ruin her manicure. I guess she can think of better sacrifices for her manicure, like burying people in the backyard.Anyways, I can't get over how horrible I thought this book was. These characters were not bad at all in the miniseries, but he does a horrible job incorporating their separate personalities when they are together, and they don't seem to act like any normal person would ever act or think."},{"Title":"Into the Garden (Thorndike Core)","review":"This was, perhaps, one of the worst books I'd ever read in my entire life. It started off as good, but immediately went downhill as soon as they buried the mother in the backyard (can't they get into serious trouble for that?). In fact, it was so bad I couldn't even finish it, and usually, I'm the type to finish what I start. It's totally unrealistic, vapid, and the characters aren't even people you can care about.This book makes me cringe just thinking about it.Don't buy, if you know what's good for you, but if you'll read any trash, go ahead and waste your money. Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"Title":"Into the Garden (Thorndike Core)","review":"This book was the best of the all the books in the series. The real VC Andrews &quot;style&quot; showed all through the book, making the pages turn quicker and quicker. I hope they stop doing mini series, becasue it really isn't like VC Andrews would have done it. I hope they go back to large novels for books in a series, instead of a mini series. But for now, I am happy to say I loved this book!"},{"Title":"Into the Garden (Thorndike Core)","review":"Into the garden is really good, in fact one of the best V.C. Andrews novels in a long time. I didn't like the rest of the wildflower series, but this book made up for it. I was also glad because of the variety of characters in this book, there is a black girl and a not so thin girl. All of V.C. Andrews characters are usually the same size six white girls, but this book had some variety. What I didn't like about this book is Jade and her hollier-than thou I'm rich and you're not attitude. Overall the book is good, and the ending is dramatic, sweet, and in a way sad. I recommend this book if you are a true VC Andrews fan. I know a lot of people have stop reading VC Andrews novels because of the drab miniseries runaways and wildflowers, but this book is V.C. Andrews true style. I heard the next series Rain is back to VC Andrews true style too"},{"Title":"Into the Garden (Thorndike Core)","review":"I recently read the book, &quot;Into the Garden&quot; (pub. 1999) by V.C. Andrews. The book was about a group of four friends who call themselves &quot;the orphans with parents&quot; or OWP's for short. In the beginning, the main character's (Cat) mother dies. After she dies, the four girls take over her house and turn it into their headquarters. This book reminds me a lot of another book by V.C. Andrews called &quot;Runaways&quot; (pub. 1997) which was also about four friends. One difference is that in &quot;Runaways&quot; the girls were really orphans, and in &quot;Into the Garden&quot; the girls had parents, and called themselves orphans. The main character, Cat, is very interesting. She is kind of paranoid about everything the girls do. The rest of the girls try to get her to loosen up. They pretty much redo the whole house that they have taken over for their &quot;headquarters&quot;. Then they all take turns staying the night there with Cat, where they plot some pretty decitful things. This story was a very good story about some mischevious young girls, and it was very interesting and held my attention all the way through. The only thing I didn't like about it, was that it was so similar to Runaways."},{"Title":"Into the Garden (Thorndike Core)","review":"This was quite possibly one of the WORST books I have ever read. It was illogical, poorly written, and laughable. First of all, no one can go out, bury their mother in the backyard, and expect no one to know about it. And isn't it oh-so-convenient that Geraldine had no friends and thus, no one knows about her death? I mean, come on. And wouldn't the neighbors notice a freshly dug GRAVE, for Pete's sake?! And then everyone goes and has sex in the house. Is there something I'm missing here, that EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER HAS TO HAVE SEX IN THESE BOOKS?! And the whole scene with Cat's ankle made me laugh because it was so poorly done. The ghostwriter is milking a cash cow that's long since dried up. Heck, that cow is DEAD. Let it rest with Andrews, ghostwriter. Your clich&egrave;d characters, sappy plots, mangled metaphors, idiotic names - I mean, come on. Ice? Cinnamon, Rain?, and continued use of incest, rape, sex in general. It's never completely, utterly asinine, redundant, and bland."},{"Title":"Into the Garden (Thorndike Core)","review":"I think only about 3 chapters in the book were worth reading. The story started out ok, but then it was just page after page of irrelevant nonsense! There was too much going on--half the book could've been edited out without losing the story. I was never able to get a hold of where this book was going. I could see how the writer ATTEMPTED to have readers feel sympathy for the characters...but it just didn't happen.The storyline was ridiculous &amp; towards the last few chapters, I found myself RUSHING through the sentences just to get the book over with!FINALLY, when the ending came, it confirmed my thoughts that this book was a waste of my time."},{"Title":"Into the Garden (Thorndike Core)","review":"Another rip off from the Andrews Family. This is not like V.C Andrews at all! The characters are too shallow and the plodding writing takes you nowhere. The story is too... soap opera-like and predictable.Really dumb!I really loved and enjoyed reading V.C Andrews but things are getting out of hand... don't you think?Skip this."},{"Title":"Into the Garden (Thorndike Core)","review":"OK, I admit it -- I've been reading V.C. Andrews books since I was 13, and I always do have to read &quot;the new one.&quot; Like many other readers, I was disappointed in the Orphans miniseries. It felt as if someone had figured out that teenage girls are drawn to her books, and decided to make them &quot;tamer&quot; because of it.The Wildflowers series started off the same way, but slowly built to being more like the books I remember being glued to in the library after school, the books I read in order to reflect, &quot;Well, my life might suck, but at least nothing like THIS has happened to me.&quot;Into the Garden is that kind of book. The strange coincidences, twisted family relationships, and buried secrets coming unveiled for the not-quite-adult protagonist are classic V.C. Andrews, and about time. Why does the ghostwriter think we READ these things, anyway? :) Jade's strange form of New Age magic makes a nice addition to the classic formula."},{"Title":"Into the Garden (Thorndike Core)","review":"I believe the last series that was true to Andrews' spirit was Dawn. With Ruby it started going downhill, Melody was trash, and now these miniseries! How odd that the Wildflowers books were matched to children's books and juvenile literature on amazon.com. I want the real novels back! Hopefully the next book...."},{"Title":"Into the Garden (Thorndike Core)","review":"I am a V.C. Andrews fan and I think that the Wildflower series was disapointing, but this book made it all seem better. At some point the book was so vivid that I actually had to look away because it felt like I had broken my leg. The book had such a sweet ending and so much happens, but you have to watch out because there is a lot of text and you can easily get lost. It would be ok to just skip the wildflower series and go right to this one. Its a great book and I recomend it to all readers. Especially if you want a can't-put-it-down book. I also recomend the Logan family series. (contact me at: rgdjrxxx@aol.com)"},{"Title":"Into the Garden (Thorndike Core)","review":"Into the Garden has done justice to this series and VC Andrews. I read the whole series and every page of every book was great. Misty, Jade, Star and Cat were about 4 teen girls that are in therapy and each book is each one telling their story. Each book brings them closer. the final book Into the Garden brings them all together outside of their therapy. Where they learn to become friends. They form a club called the OWP's. They all have a surpise packed in this book but the biggest one of all is one of them looses a parent and ask the others for help. What do they do? Who do they turn to? The ending has a suprising twist. you will have to read this book. I feel if you read the whole series you will have a greater satisfaction with this book."},{"Title":"Psychology and Religion: West and East Bollingen Series XX Volume II of the collected works.","review":"_Psychology and Religion: West and East_ is definitely one of the top three most important books in the Princeton/Bollingen series of Jung's collected works. As of now, it is only available in the ...hardcover edition, but you cannot put a price on the life-enhancing knowledge contained in this volume.I will go over this volume one essay at a time:The first essay is entitled \\"Psychology and Religion\\" and is a very useful, readable, and somewhat generalized overview on Jung's opinions on religion, and its usefulness in preventing neurosis. This essay is an ideal introduction.Next comes the esaay \\"A Psychological Approach to the Dogma of the Trinity\\". This is a very complex and profound essay, and deals with some of the most perplexing and mysterious concepts in all of theology. Specifically, it attempts to explain the precise nature of the Holy Ghost. It may be hard to relate to this essay unless you have had a numinous religious experience, such as a connection of coincidences with an underlying Biblical message. But Jung does a remarkable job dealing with this complex subject.Next comes the essay \\"Transformation Symbolism in the Mass\\". This is my least favorite essay in this collection. Jung describes in excruciating detail the painstaking procedures involved in carrying out a proper symbolic mass. This wouldn't be so bad if Jung would have actually given us his interpretation of the symbolic significance of the procedures contained within the mass, but he does not do this. Instead, he simply explains in a very boring and dry manner what is to be done in performing the mass, and does not venture an interpretation of what any of this means. This is the only weak essay in this volume, however, and the rest of the book is classic, vintage Jung. But to avoid getting bogged down and demotivated, I suggest you skip this essay.After a few other short but useful essays, we come to the centerpiece of this volume, Jung's masterwork, \\"Answer to Job\\". This is Jung's single greatest achievement, and one of his longest essays. This essay alone is worth the price of this collection (although \\"Answer to Job\\" is available by itself in paperback). Some critics have accused Jung of blasphemy because of this book, but in my opinion it is the greatest work of theology ever written, by anyone, ever. For more details on this specific masterpiece, refer to my review on the stand-alone paperback edition of this great essay.Finally, we have the section on Eastern religion. Although this discussion on Asian religion comprises only about 1/4 of _Psychology and Religion: West and East_, it is perhaps the best interpretation of Eastern religion ever written by a westerner, eclipsing even the work of Zen masters Alan Watts and Aldous Huxley. First is the discussion on the Tibetian Book of the Dead, which is fascinating (also see Timothy Leary's companion piece to this ancient work). Next is a very poignant discussion on Yoga and the West. It basically criticises westerners for \\"doing\\" Yoga like it is only a type of aerobic exercise, and neglecting the literary, scholarly, and philosophical aspects of Yoga.Next comes the discossion on \\"Zen Satori\\". This is probably the best essay in the section on Eastern religion. Within this relatively short work, Jung provides invaluble insight into Zen enlightenment, and succeeds in showing us the way to a better life, breaking free of fear, hate, negative emotion, and all other sources of neurosis. Words cannot describe the positive and joyous forces which are unleashed by the Zen master Jung within this spectacular essay.Finally, we have a masterful discussion of the I-Ching. This essay, though brief, is a succint and insightful interpretation of this ancient work. It is absolutely essential for anyone who is interested in the I-Ching, and it is also a competent and thorough introdution for those unfamiliar with the I-Ching.Overall, this volume of essays is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL for all Jungians. 5 +++ stars. Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Psychology and Religion: West and East Bollingen Series XX Volume II of the collected works.","review":"This lengthy tome, while not an easy read and including rather detailed analyses of certain Christian processes as well as the less than scientific (but certainly different) Answer to Job, provides a number of wise observations on the psychology of religion, applicable to both Eastern and Western religious traditions. Some of his main areas of cross-religious focus are:Belief vs. Thought:p. 110 \\"People who believe and don't think always forget that they continually expose themselves to their own worst enemy: doubt. Wherever belief reigns, doubt lurks in the background. But thinking people welcome doubt: it serves them as a valuable stepping-stone to better knowledge. People who can believe should be a little more tolerant with those of their fellows who are only capable of thinking. Belief has already conquered the summit which thinking tries to win by toilsome climbing. The believer ought not to project his habitual enemy, doubt, upon the thinker, thereby suspecting him of destructive designs...let the believer rejoice that others, too, seek to climb the mountain on whose peak he sits.\\"p. 449 \\"Irritability, bad moods, and outbursts of affect are the classic symptoms of chronic virtuousness.\\"The Statistical Distribution of Human Development In Terms of Years and Historical Periods:p. 308 \\"There are people who, psychologically, might be living in the year 5000 B. C., i.e., who can still successfully solve their conflicts as people did seven thousand years ago. There are countless troglodytes and barbarians living in Europe and in all civilized countries, as well as a large number of medieval Christians. On the other hand, there are relatively few who have reached the level of consciousness which is possible in our time. We must also reckon with the fact that a few of our generation belong to the third or fourth millennium A. D. and are consequently anachronistic.\\"p. 333-5: \\"It takes about twenty years for the ordinary run of people to begin thinking the thoughts of the educated person of today...it takes about twenty years for the general outlook and problems of the educated to percolate down to the uneducated masses.\\"The nature of human development through neuroses and withdrawal of projections (when a person projects his or her inner perspectives, problems, etc. onto the external world or onto other people, thus denying the internal origin of the projection-and associating it with denial of responsibility for it). Jung's Individuation process involves integrating the split off pieces of one's personality-including projections. The process implies accepting oneself rather than condemning one's faults.p. 43 \\"fairly complete human beings are exceptions. It is true that an overwhelming majority of educated people are fragmentary personalities and have a lot of substitutes instead of the genuine goods.\\"p. 85 \\"the development of consciousness requires the withdrawal of all the projections we can lay our hands on.\\"p. 256 \\"So long as they are unconscious our unconscious contents are always projected, and the projection fixes upon everything \`ours,' inanimate objects as well as animals and people...they are more than what they are in themselves and function as such.\\"p. 339 \\"We cannot change anything unless we accept it. Condemnation does not liberate; it oppresses...if the doctor wishes to help a human being he must be able to accept him as he is. And he can do this in reality only when he has already seen and accepted himself as he is.\\"Psychological problems can result from resisting this process; resulting neuroses and suffering help to spur on the process despite egoistic attempts to derail it:p. 75 \\"neurosis is always a substitute for legitimate suffering.\\"p. 350 \\"A neurosis is never more complicated than the person who has it.\\"p. 335 \\"with the decline of religious life, the neuroses grow noticeably more frequent.\\"Thus, the religions (spiritual) life can be identified with Individuation as opposed to neurosis. Further:p. 283 \\"A concrete event by itself can never create meaning, but is largely dependent for this on the manner in which it is understood.\\"p. 339 \\"simple things are always the most difficult. In actual life it requires the greatest art to be simple.\\"Such an approach (to simplicity and creation of meaning) implies further similarity between psychology and religion (West and East)."},{"Title":"Psychology and Religion: West and East Bollingen Series XX Volume II of the collected works.","review":"i have found this book really interesting and if not for the usuall difficult jargons, i would have rated this a five star book.

Castelli, really nails down the feelings and emotional rollercoaster after a breakup. There a many exercises that will help you see yourself and learn many lessons that you need in order to move on.

Great book for someone who wants to move on fast."},{"Title":"Extreme Breakup Recovery","review":"With the help of this book I was able to see my recent breakup more objectively and in an easy and fast way was able to move on. I chose the fast way and this book provides it. It is not for people who like to suffer for long time. Also I found that I started healing almost immediately and I didn't need to go into self-pity."},{"Title":"Extreme Breakup Recovery","review":"The author presents a method called F.A.S.T., which stands for the four step process to heal a broken heart. As you go through each step you heal a little more. In my experience by the end of the book I felt as if a heavy weight was lifted. The method works and it is very easy, yet deep enough to deal with emotions, feelings and fears. The information is direct and to the point, which makes this book stand out from all the rest I have read in this category. Many books on breakup healing tend to be either humorous or scientific."},{"Title":"Extreme Breakup Recovery","review":"After a breakup I was decided to cut out the pain and I found the best resource for that. What initially attracted me to the book was its title, Extreme Breakup Recovery, which is what I was looking for. The book not only provides a method for a quick recovery, but also focuses on learning lessons and healing completely. As I went through the book the pain started fading and by the last chapter I was ready to move on. The method the author created is called F.A.S.T. and it really is. Thank you for this book!!!! Now I am reading the sequel from Castelli, \\"The Joy Of Dating Again\\" and is great too."},{"Title":"Extreme Breakup Recovery","review":"I have read meny books for dealing with breakup recovery, but this one really helps you to get to the core of the pain. You will not only learn how to deal with breakup pain, but with all emotional issues. The FAST method can be used as a new way of dealing with emotions and unfinished business. I love this book and the exercises are very empowering."},{"Title":"Extreme Breakup Recovery","review":"Don't waste you time or money on this gimmicky and poorly written book. It repeats the same questions and would probably only be about six pages if it were not in huge font with tons of space between lines. Probably, the worst self-help book I have ever read. I would guess that if the author's master's degree is from an accredited university, it is not in psychology or any other area that would qualify her to write a self-help book."},{"Title":"Extreme Breakup Recovery","review":"RIGHT ON TIME... WISH I HAD THIS BOOK WHEN I FIRST STARTED DATING MANY YEARS AGO... IF I HAD, I WOULDN'T HAVE ALLOWED MYSELF TO SUFFER SOOOOO LONG AFTER IT WAS OVER. THOSE DAYS OF LINGERING ON ARE OVER.

It is probably the most useful book I have ever read. I found it very flowing and simple. As a guy I don't want to read a lot and this book is simple and to the point, but oh boy, gets you out of the blues, shows you a few exits and helps you with pain."},{"Title":"Extreme Breakup Recovery","review":"I bought this book in a difficult moment after a breakup because I saw excellent reviews here on Amazon.I have to say it greatly passed my expectations. It is extremely effective both in finding the right words to say and in asking you to do the right \\"exercises\\" (answering questions, thinking about situations etc).I would definitively recommend it for anyone going through a tough time, regardless how and why the breakup happened. It is really a precious source of help and it also helps you to understand more about yourself and more in depth, not just getting over an ex."},{"Title":"Extreme Breakup Recovery","review":"This book is so good. Makes a breakup easier to deal with by making us see it as an opportunity to grow. The simple method F.A.S.T. creates a way for us to see healing as series of steps that we can do and master. Initially I didn't think that the book could help me much, but I liked the title and the idea of simplicity. At the end of chapter 3 I was convinced this book was going to change my life, and it did. I decided to write this review, because I am convinced by the F.A.S.T. method."},{"Title":"Extreme Breakup Recovery","review":"Imagine a breakup as a learning experience that can enrich us and bring us to a new level.

It is empowering to learn to deal with a breakup in a way that can propel us into change and learning in an accelerated fashion."},{"Title":"Extreme Breakup Recovery","review":"I have to share my great experience with this book. It is very helpful after a breakup. It took me about a week after I started reading this book, to feel much better after being depressed for a while.My friend who went through a divorce recently also read it and wants to keep it. It is a special book, with helpful advice and exercises.

There is healing in the method presented in Extreme Beakup Recovery."},{"Title":"Extreme Breakup Recovery","review":"I enjoyed the book a lot. Ate it up and did all the workshops and exercises. Really enjoyed it!Reason for 4 stars is because I was getting annoyed of all the random commas in odd parts of some sentences. I'm not an English major or anything but don't we all want to make sense of things more smoothly without caring about insignificant details???"},{"Title":"Extreme Breakup Recovery","review":"As I write this there are 20 reviews of this book on the Amazon website, all good. I have nothing to add about their comments regarding this book; it gets right to the heart of the subject.The book, however, suffers from something I call \\"random comma disease.\\" The author (or editor?) likes to put commas in inappropriate places in sentences: \\"Now, is a good time to develop a more loving connection with yourself\\" (p. 99), or \\"Accepting responsiblity for what happens in our lives, gives us a lot of freedom and more control, than when we look for someone to blame\\" (p. 54). Occasionally the odd misplaced semi-colon creeps in as well: \\"As you gain clarity on what a positive relationship means to you; you will attract it easily\\" (p. 95).Surely a conscientous proof-reader could have caught these errors before the book went to press."},{"Title":"Knitting With Balls","review":"pretty good intro to knitting book. Difficulty builds with each project. Still there was no project that made me jump up and say, \\"I have to knit this\\""},{"Title":"Knitting With Balls","review":"Finding anything to do with knitting that is remotely geared toward guys is unusual to say the least and this book is both good and geared toward male knitters.It's not terribly complex or deep but gives a more than adequate overview of both the basics and some of the more advanced techniques that will give the guys some idea of what they might be capable of producing.We need more books like this."},{"Title":"Knitting With Balls","review":"This is such a great book---mostly because of the awesome patterns that are geared towards men. Beautiful sweaters, coffee cozies, laptop cases, and lots more. I bought this book because of the funny title and it turned out to be more than I expected."},{"Title":"Knitting With Balls","review":"I bought this book for my boyfriend who is just learning to knit. The instruction throughout the book is excellent for a beginner. Some of the patterns are great while others... well not so much. So I would not recommend this book to an experienced knitter, but for the male beginner, this book is a great starting point."},{"Title":"Knitting With Balls","review":"This book has great illustrations and most of the patterns are easy to understand. The projects are highly varied - traditional (sweaters and scarves) to untraditional (laptop covers and utility cloths). Though I wouldn't wear or use all of them (camoflage coffee cup holder?!), they can be adapted with different yarns and adjustments to the patterns. The last section even delves into that. The best part is the illustrations and the fact that projects are of all difficulty levels. You learn all the basics without ever getting bored or having to commit to a huge project. There are several other books for male knitters besides this one."},{"Title":"Knitting With Balls","review":"Men knit - and have for centuries. From soldiers and cowboys to sailors, men have long made their own garments - so a book offering modern men keys to new patterns and the basics to knit them shouldn't be seen as revolutionary. KNITTING WITH BALLS: A HANDS-ON GUIDE TO KNITTING FOR THE MODERN MAN is an excellent basic instructional for any male who aspires to knit - and any needlework collection for beginners. It provides tips on patterns, instructions for every stitch, and even advice on how to begin a men's knitting group. An excellent survey indeed.Diane C.

Finally there is a knitting book written by a man specifically for men who knit. As if you needed more proof that this is the male version of the highly acclaimed \\"[...],\\" none other than Debbie Stoller herself sings Michael's praises on the book jacket.In his hip collection of patterns, Michael offers something for knitters of every experience level, from simple iPod cozies to elaborate cabled sweaters fit for the fashion runway. There's truly something for everyone in this rich and varied collection. If you are a male knitter, or you know a man who knits, this books is a must-have."},{"Title":"Knitting With Balls","review":"Book was well written and the instructions were easy to follow. The projects were geared toward men instead of the type of projects that are in many knitting how-to guides. Good book."},{"Title":"Knitting With Balls","review":"This book has great patterns for men to be knit by anyone although the book is written for men to learn to knit. Good instructions, too."},{"Title":"Knitting With Balls","review":"I liked the detailed instructions, as well as the illustrations which showed how to do a number of useful techniques (picking up stitches, knitting into row below, etc). Too many knitting books assume you already know every technique there is.The individual projects are hit-and-miss. I looked at them as simply good ways to practice the various techniques that are used. The sweater designs in particular are disappointingly geared toward men with slimmer builds and wilder fashion sense (not to mention lots of $$$ for expensive yarn) than myself.I'd say if you can find it for under $10, go ahead. It's a good basic reference at least."},{"Title":"Knitting With Balls","review":"Overall I would say as a new knitter, this book is nice. It covers the basics, gives you a few project ideas, and in the back of the book there are sources for yarn and male oriented knitting. My only gripe with this (and a lot of other crafting books) is it being printed in China. Maybe it's just I like to \\"buy American\\" but from looking through the book the binding is glued somewhat poorly and I could see the glue and it looked like with heavy use this book could eventually fall apart. Like I said a lot of knitting books that are printed overseas have similar quality issues."},{"Title":"Knitting With Balls","review":"LIKE THIS PROJECT. MY GIRLFRIEND READED FOR ME.

WOW!!!!!!!!!!One of the best knitting books I've ever seen.It has superlative instructions for learning to knit English, Continental AND left-handed: increasing, decreasing, joining pieces together in a variety of ways -- all first class. And he charts. And has schematics.And the patterns. I love almost every one of them. Well thought out and great looking designs -- the hooded sweater with the fold-down cuff which turns into a half-mitten -- fantastic idea! I've never seen it done elsewhere.O.K. I'm not a guy. But I have guy students. They will be REQUIRED to get this. I do have a husband, 2 grown sons, and about a dozen other male relatives. And, of course, most of the designs are classic and would work equally well for women (with appropriate color changes). The wallet, credit card holder, cup cozy and laptop case are going OTN just as soon as I can get to my stash.Not to mention that the patterns are easily adapted for women and children ...WOW!!! I'm in love."},{"Title":"Knitting With Balls","review":"I think there's a great mix of good patterns, resources, and technique, and of course it fills a need in the knitting book world. I wanted this book because I find that there often aren't enough patterns for men, period, no matter the proposed gender of the knitter. On my first quick look-throught the book, I found several projects I want to knit; when I saw the alpaca running sweater, I instantly knew I have to make it for my (very picky) brother. He'll love it. Personally, I think the coffee cozies would be great gifts, and the felted dop kit is so smart; I can see it in all kinds of yarn/fabric lining combos. Several small details of the book - the stitch dictionary (in color) in the back, which gives an easy reference for the projects; the tips on starting a knitting group; the history of men who knit throughout - make Knitting with Balls a good read and reference, as well as a good pattern book."},{"Title":"Knitting With Balls","review":"It's a nice easy book with adaptable patterns. Some of the colors chosen for images aren't very masculine but most of the designs are. I plan to make socks and a hoodie for my husband and a scarf and pullover for myself.

Easy to understand. Make knitting enjoyable, glad to see more men are joing the knitting circles. Seems like more and more men now days are taking up this craft.

Great Thank You."},{"Title":"Knitting With Balls","review":"Very excited to see this book and hasn't disappointed on that front. The basic directions are good and should help a guy get started and it has very good tips. However, the instructions within the patterns are often confusing, incomplete or containing errors. I would supplement this with Stich n Bitch (I know its a 'girls' book, but great instructions) and make friends with someone at the local yarn store to help you sift through the less than stellar instructions."},{"Title":"Knitting With Balls","review":"I too was excited by the subject and title of this new knitting book.Groan!This book missed its mark by a long shot. Male knitters are not effeminate, we just knit. This book is basically an insult.A couple of the patterns are OK, but none are actually inspiring me to pick up my needles. Most of the patterns seem to be geared towards gay men. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it doesn't suit me at all.Many of the patterns are just plain dumb and seem to be there just to fill up space, like the beer cozy, coffee cup cozy, wallet and the \\"utility cloth\\" (aka rag) for example. Why would I spend 2 days knitting a shop rag when I can buy a whole bundle at the store for a couple of bucks? This is also basically the same thing as a large dishcloth or small baby blanket, but the book calls it a \\"utility cloth\\" so it's for a man. Give me a break!One of the other reviewers stated that some of the patterns were \\"fit for the fashion runway\\" Exactly! I don't know any man that wants to wear clothes that are fit for a runway, unless that runway is on an air-force base or something. I just assume leave the house in a blouse and pair of kulats than some of the garments displayed in this book.Frankly the sweater that is on the cover of the book looks great, it was one of the main reasons for buying the book. Unfortunately, to my dismay, this pattern is NOT included in the book! WHAT WHY!? For shame!"},{"Title":"Knitting With Balls","review":"I purchased this book for a guy I used to work with who needed to spend some time at home after an accident. After looking at it in a book store, I decided to get it for him. I was convinced that if I had asked him about it first, he would have said NO, assuming that this was a \\"girl thing,\\" despite the title. Much to his own surprise, he got well into it, actually completing a simple project. Because he had so much fun working on it, I'm sure he'll do many more.If you'd like to open up a gentleman in your circle to the great sense of relaxation and creativity that can be had with a productive craft like knitting, this is a GREAT BUY! Include enough yarn and the needles for one project, so he can get started right away.I already have my next recipient in mind!"},{"Title":"Knitting With Balls","review":"I'm sorry to say, most of the items in the book are not items I can imagine any man wanting, and therefore I won't be making them.

The projects are useful, but also basic enough that they can be easily adjust and altered for other needs."},{"Title":"Double Shift (Novel Devotions)","review":"Double Shift is a wonderful story about Katy, a teenager faced with the same problems many teens face today. Ms. Hergenrader does an excellent job of portraying a sympathetic heroine, who wants to follow God's will, but who must first learn to be humble. The devotionals at the end of each chapter are thought provoking, and I think this book would make an excellent teaching tool for preteens and teenagers who are struggling to maintain their Christian beliefs in a secular world."},{"Title":"Double Shift (Novel Devotions)","review":"I honestly started reading the book as a daily devotional, but at about day 7 I couldn't stop reading and just finished it. I appreciate the value of serving so much more and am very excited about finding news ways in my life to serve others and let God work in my life. A great read for all ages and backgrounds, with an even better message."},{"Title":"Double Shift (Novel Devotions)","review":"Christina Hergenrader's DOUBLE SHIFT has one of the most refreshing heroines I've read in years. Katy is a vegetarian, has her eyebrow pierced, wears thrift-store clothing, and wants to serve God. In DOUBLE SHIFT, Katy is stuck working at a restaurant for the summer, serving grumpy patrons and putting up with the boss's cocky son. Katy has a lot of growing up to do and, in the process, she might just find what God wants of her too.The third in Ms. Hergenrader's series, Katy's book can be read alone or with the other novels. After reading the first two books, I wanted to know more about Katy, and I'm thrilled she has her own story. Katy struggles with questions we all face: whether the work we do is what God wants or we want. This is an excellent book for any age group, any faith."},{"Title":"Somersault (Oe, Kenzaburo)","review":"\\"Somersault\\" by Kenzoburo Oe is an unusual novel for my own reading habits, though one that has a lot of appeal. Being interested in religion and spirituality, I was curious to see what he had to offer and say.The novel follows a few characters, but they are all quickly joined together in the midst of the beginning of the Church of the New Man. Patron, the church's founder and leader, spent 10 years alone with his religious partner Guide, after they had done a \\"Somersault\\" and had claimed their old movement was all a big joke. The rise of a radical faction within that old movement prompted this dramatic event. It is the regathering of old followers and new that occupies much of the narrative of the book.The book is filled with long dialogues and monologues, as characters' struggles and understandings of the Somersault, themselves, Patron, faith and God are all covered in this way. This means that monologues can run for a couple of pages as characters relate their pasts, their hopes, or Patron deals with his view of events.It has been commented that the book lacks detail with the teaching of the movements. While the detail is rather sparse, there is enough content given to form some understanding of the main points of the church's doctrine and teaching. This develops through the book, a good example being the nature of Patron. The theme of repentance, renunciation of the world, trust in Patron, visions, prayer and so on are all there. The use of Biblical texts and some others are also there. For some more theologically minded readers, maybe more detail would have been nice, but the book certainly does not suffer for the lack of it.Oe has dealt with a lot of different themes, and different ones will stand out to different people. Perhaps one that stuck with me was the nature of faith, and how it develops with various events and under differing external stimuli. Patrons 10 years of isolation were interpretted by the Quiet Women and others as his descent into hell, something Patron himself took up. The understanding of Patron's as somehow sacred also comes into view among different followers and their discussions.Permeating the entire story is the Somersault like some shadow, and different groups' responses to it and the new movement come in for some heavy discussion among the various characters. The Technicians, the Quiet Women, Patron, Dancer, Ikuo, Kizu and others all have their own take on it.I enjoyed the book thoroughly, and had a great time reading it. It is a thought provoking look into a religious movement that could be termed a cult, and the way in which people understand and develop their faith according to different events. Oe keeps things moving relatively well, and does not get bogged down in useless detail.The characterisations are remarkably detailed, I found. They all had very distinctive personalities and idiosyncracies, which made them all the more life-like.For something a bit different, \\"Somersault\\" is a fine read and a good story. Enjoyable to the last, I have to say that I recommend it to any who enjoy the themes that it deals with."},{"Title":"Somersault (Oe, Kenzaburo)","review":"I just finished reading Somersault. Several interesting themes emerge.First, on a sociological level, it seems that Oe is fascinated, even obsessed, by groups. Almost all of the characters belong to a group: the Quiet Women, the Technicians, the office staff, the Fireflies. Even the quasi-individualistic Kizu is first and foremost generically \\"a professor.\\" Characters in this novel are always strongly identified with the group to which they belong. Strong individuals such as Gii emerge as leaders of a group. Is this emphasis on groups a Japanese thing, or is it uniquely Oe?Keeping in the sociological theme, I think Oe paints Japanese society as chock full of forbearance. All the characters tolerated each other and tried to understand why all of the other characters did what they did. They all helped each other and were thoughtful to each other's needs. Nobody was mean-spirited. Even the strong-willed characters Gii and Ikuo were, at heart, incredibly nice people. Dancer was very polite throughout. Kizu was a kindly old professor. Ogi, the Innocent Youth, is the archetype example of niceness. Even the folks who tortured Guide were quickly forgiven. Is this emphasis on polite behavior, too, a Japanese or an Oe-centric thing?On the deeper, religious level I think it was always Oe's intent to leave the religious message from Patron deliberately ambiguous. In fact, the ambiguity of spiritualism is the take-home message of the novel.How is this manifested in the book? Well, the vast majority of the principal players: Ogi, Dancer, Kizu, Gii, Guide himself, have no real religious conviction and are just drawn into Patron's inner circle via his cult of personality or (in the cases of Gii and Kizu) for ulterior reasons. Patron himself found his own mystical experiences incredibly ambiguous. Ikuo, a truly religious and earnest man, was not able to properly define his relationship with God, either, and this caused him tremendous stress.The last page of the novel reveals Oe's core belief, but I don't want to give the game away. Let's just say that, if you believe in a traditional God, you might find yourself shaken to the core.There is an exciting conclusion if you can muster up the patience to get there. There is a dramatic exchange in which Patron and Ikuo do the father-son thing, and another interesting scene where 25 women go potty together. But you have to perservere to the mid page-500's before you get those rewards.The relation between Kizu and Ikuo is well-developed. I love the way Oe left the role of Dancer in this relationship ambiguous until the end. The relationship between Gii and Ikuo is also fascinating, and at the end, Oe foreshadows that some very turbulent times are still to come between these two strong-willed characters.The book is as much an existential philosophical treatise as it is a novel. It also offers an important sociological perspective on modern-day Japan."},{"Title":"Somersault (Oe, Kenzaburo)","review":"A Personal Matter continues to be a favorite of this avid reader. Oedecided to try something new and it just doesn't work. In exploringvalues, beliefs he almost drills in some pretty boring characters. Inever put down a book partly read but this one was tempting.Gad, a grind...Oe's strength is his play on words, come back master!"},{"Title":"Somersault (Oe, Kenzaburo)","review":"I get frustrated with reviewers who admit ignorance about Japanese religious beliefs, and Japanese history, then diss a book which requires it. Plus knowledge of the Book of Jonah in the Christian bible. And obscure Welsh poets. Generally people read a Nobelist for something more than they find in Dean Koontz, incidentaly also a religious type of writer. The book is not my Oe favorite ( that one is \\"Changling\\".) But it grew on me as the hints that another religious assasination was in the offing. It seemed to run like a very bizzare dream..quick takes not apparently connected with each other. Professor Kizu is , when I think about it, one of the more amazing characters in recent fiction.Everyone else is joining the religion for what they call philosophical or religious reasons Dealing with \\"god\\" and repentance and the end of the world.He follows someone he loves into what he has a pretty good idea won't turn out well just to be with him. Challenging and requires patience. And some heart."},{"Title":"Somersault (Oe, Kenzaburo)","review":"This book is beautiful. It's not fast-pased; it's not thrilling; it's not edge-of-your-seat exciting. But it is beautiful. The writing is poetic and I found myself, as a writer, inspired and transfixed by the prose."},{"Title":"Somersault (Oe, Kenzaburo)","review":"Kenzaburo Oe gives a thoughtful, occasionally engaging, look at religious fanaticism in his latest novel &quot;Somersault&quot;. It is a dense depiction of the rise, fall, and subsequent rise of a religious cult. It is also an intigruing look into homosexuality in Japan and other types of societal relationships. Told primarily from the perspective of Japanese expatriate artist and professor Kizu, the story slowly unravels, taking us to and from and then back to Japan. Regrettably Oe doesn't spend as much time describing the religious values of the cult or why it had such appeal among its members. Still this is an insightful work of fiction from one of the world's foremost contemporary novelists."},{"Title":"Somersault (Oe, Kenzaburo)","review":"I picked up this book because I am interested in Japanese culture and figure a Nobel Prize winning author writing a novel about a religious movement in modern day Japan would be right up my alley.After about 250 pages I kept telling myself \\"something will actually happen soon.\\" Unfortunately nothing did. You could argue that the ending is climactic, but I argue that by the 400th page or so the reader will be so bored and in such a hurry to just finish this monstrosity that the ending will be of little interest and even less impact."},{"Title":"Somersault (Oe, Kenzaburo)","review":"What really puzzled me after reading the book was: What exactly is Patron's religious movement all about? Aside from preaching that the end of the world is near and people should repent, little else is revealed about the core beliefs of Patron's religion. This is mainly because Patron discusses his religion at a personal level: the deep trances he goes into, his relationship with Guide, the Somersault incident,etc.. Most of the time he talks about his own personal experience rather than putting forth any set of beliefs. So it's hard for the reader to comprehend why Patron can attract so many followers when he expresses his own religion in such vague and abstract terms."},{"Title":"Libation Bearers: The Orestia Parts 1 and 2","review":"Describing the situation in The Oresteia Trilogy as family problems would be a complete understatement. This ancient epic written by Aeschylus has every twist and turn imaginable. Aeschylus was a genius. He wrote epic plays and made important innovations to the theater including a second actor (multiple actors), a reduced chorus, more dialogue, poetic diction, and elaborate staging. Aeschylus lived and wrote in Athens, Greece during the peek of the empire between 525 - 456 BC.The book is a classic. I would encourage anyone to read it because of the content and the history of the work itself. In the beginning the words and content might seem tough. The plot is strong, and the pace is quick. The book has a very entertaining quality. As a reader I felt that the book was captivating and intriguing. There are many plot twists and strange occurrences. The history and curse add more depth and make a stranger story line. At the very least give the book a try. I can understand if it is not for everyone, but I believe many people would enjoy it."},{"Title":"Libation Bearers: The Orestia Parts 1 and 2","review":"Never before have I so resolutely leaped for literature.Upon my first reading, somewhere amidst the bearing of libationsI bounced from the couch clutching the spineand belted-out the mournings of Orestes as on stage.The masterwork is spellbinding;the masterpiece is spineclutching!Too, too cool for school!No single expression of creativity has moved this reader like this work has moved this reader.Unmatched forevermore.This must be read.A life without scylys is unsatisfactory &amp; ugly.Note: Please, please keep this text far, far away from Hollywood's feeble and mollescent hands."},{"Title":"Libation Bearers: The Orestia Parts 1 and 2","review":"This was my first taste of Greek drama and I absolutly loved it! It's probably the easiest book to read of the trilogy the Oresteia because of the easy dialogue and you don't need that much knowledge of the customs of the time to appreciate it. The book is about Orestes' revenge on the murder of his father by his mother. The lanuguage is incredibly powerful and if you haven't read any Greek tragedy before, it could seem a bit weird but trust me, you will grow to love it! Its best to read this once you've read the first part of the trilogy, Agemmenmon, so that things may be a bit clearer. But overall, I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Story Ever Told","review":"I am usually a critic of &quot;Life of Christ&quot; stories. It's easy for me to mount my soap box and say, &quot;If one wants to learn of the life of Jesus, read the gospels.&quot; However, this book was different. Oursler remains faithful to the biblical accounts of the life of Jesus, weaving the material from the four evangelists together to produce a truly great narrative. For those thirsty for some reading on the life of the Lord, I would certainly still point them first (and always) to the Scripture; however, I must admit that, regarding Oursler's narrative, there is some value to be gained from the stirring of the heart this story produces. Highly recommended for all -- both young and old."},{"Title":"The Greatest Story Ever Told","review":"Read this book out loud to your family and use it for discussions about the life of Jesus Christ. I have a 13 year old son who knew very little about Jesus, and now has a simple but deep grasp of the story. It has lead to talk about Jesus' miracles, His inspirational teaching of morality, and His resurrection. This book is accurate in every particular to the gospel of Mark. Oursler does a good job of describing the facts of the gospel in novel form so that the people come alive again. The language is challenging and specific, though not complicated. Oursler knows the definitive meanings of words and uses them well, but puts them in understandable context. One small remark that might be construed as a complaint: the physical descriptions of Jesus are true to the classical western paintings of a brown haired man with light eyes. Small quibble, not important. Oursler captures the spirit of the man and the glory of God in Him. If you need to &quot;read&quot; the Bible story before beginning your study of the Word, this book will give you a clear picture of the life and teachings of the Master. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Story Ever Told","review":"This book is great. It really brings the story to life.

I think it is signficant that during the arrest of Jesus, the Pharisees arresting him were indeed all were fallen down by the whole episode and not by physical means, before Jesus the Lamb of God submitted to their arrest. I do enjoy however, the trial of Jesus by the Sanhedrin in court. I do find this to be a very viable visualization of how such a trial may have taken place.The Nativity narrative may well take some from the Apocrypha, Protovangelium, Infant Gospel of James, whereas, Mary's parents, Joachim and Anne accompany Joseph and Mary during the birth of the Christ-child. I do find the first part of the book thoroughly enjoying in relating those incidences we know best from the Gospel of Luke and some from the Gospel of Matthew. I do understand that Herod probably did have some Arabic blood in him, in part if not totally, but I am not sure if an apt description for Herod is calling him an Arab King as he does two or three times in the book. Still, this is a minor detail.All in all, I am not sure if this is the inspiration for the movie of the same nameThe Greatest Story Ever Told (Movie Only Edition), but the years of Christ's ministry and the parables and the miracles he worked with are well covered here as well, considering this book was written shortly after World War II. It also has made me want to read other biographical type books on Jesus. This book is very much worthy of reading and to then relate one's own knowledge of the Gospels back to it."},{"Title":"The Greatest Story Ever Told","review":"It is an excellent book to visualize every detail of Jesus' life."},{"Title":"The Greatest Story Ever Told","review":"When will \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told \\" be released on Kindle ebook?

What a great insite into the story of Creation and Salvation."},{"Title":"The Greatest Story Ever Told","review":"This book is a narrative of the life of Christ. The author fills in the parts of the story that are left out of the Biblical record of the life of Christ. The account starts with Joseph and Mary and ends with a discussion about Christ's resurrection.Let me first say that I do not enjoy reading fiction and that is what this book is. I prefer reading books that are factual or tell me something, not just a story for entertainment. That being said, the author had some interesting and creative ideas about the unknown parts of Christ's life.I can't say I agreed with how the author portrayed some of the characters. For example, the author seems to make Judas Iscariot look like he was almost tricked into giving up Jesus. Even the end where Annas and Caiphas are sitting around talking, wondering if they had made a mistake seemed a little strange. But it is possible.Overall, I can't say I would recommend this book for everyone to read. I think it serves a good purpose to broaden the traditional thinking of mature Christians. On the other hand, I can see how it might confuse those that are new to the faith.But I can also see the value of this book if it gets someone interested enough to study the life of Christ more closely and deeply with Scripture.That is just my opinion. Billy Graham wrote an introduction in this edition and J. Edger Hoover also wrote a brief statement about the book as well. They seemed to think it is a good book. So I guess you'll have to just read it yourself and come to your own conclusion."},{"Title":"The Greatest Story Ever Told","review":"I have purchaced several things through Amazon and I have never had a better experience withany other place that I have shopped on line... they are great....Thank You Amazon"},{"Title":"Un mundo raro","review":"Esta colecci&oacute;n de cuentos se aleja de la habilidad narrativa caracter&iacute;stica de Serrano en sus novelas.

One set of grandparents lives nearby and are delightful and realistic.Joe and Ruthie come up with the best and most plausible one-liners, the kind that only children can make. Their view of the world is funny, realistic and also poignantly serious. Each character, from Ruthie's friend James, who lives in poverty to her classmate Earl, a boy with Asperger's and an inexhaustible supply of information about vaccuum cleaners is a major contributor to the strip. Even Miss Avis, a pompous, irritating neighbor with a penchant for moralizing and talking down to kids gets a good lesson in why that won't work. Who shows the pompous neighbor by example? Ruthie!

Stick to your hard copy. Thanks for nothing, Amazon. Considering returning my kindle since this was half the reason I bought it!!!!"},{"Title":"Time regained;","review":"A brilliant closing volume to the novel. It brings back the lyricism of the first two volumes. I thought in the volumes in between some of that earlier lyricism was sacrificed to the bitchiness of Proust's tone toward the aristocracy he was doubtless jealous of, and his askew view of love that stemmed from his obvious anxieties about having been homosexual. But the early lyrcism and charm of the first two volumes is largely revived in this final volume. And anyone interested in writing, as anyone who makes it to this final volume doubtless is, Proust's passages on the art of writing make rewarding reading.The obvious flaws are that some characters who'd earlier \\"died\\" show up alive in this volume. Couples who had numerous children in earlier volumes show up in this volume having only one child; Marcel (the narrator) recognizes people and then subsequently, in the same scene, doesn't recognize them. I have NOOO idea why some editor didn't knock out these discrepancies and tighten the text. It really seems silly to me to be SOOO faithful to Proust's final manuscript as to include glaring errors. Proust was rewriting when he died. If he'd lived he would have corrected these errors and I think his intention should have been honored. But I'm still giving it five stars, since overall the experience of reading this last volume is of reading something truly brilliant."},{"Title":"Time regained;","review":"The lists of characters, and of persons and places referred to, at the end are useful even if you are planning to read A La Recherche from page one, so I'd recommend buying this volume first. I am lost in admiration of the immense task of the translators but some comments are in order. They had the problem of translating slang and mispronunciations and the translations of these are often based on British usage of the 1920's. Scott Moncrieff dealt with some of them by leaving them in French. He had a style that was slightly archaic, even for his time (see his translation of the Satyricon of Petronius Arbiter, where he left the dirty bits in Latin). Some of the translations are in British English, with expressions such as &quot;lift boy&quot; and &quot;bowler-hatted&quot; that might need translation of the translation, although I suspect that the sort of people reading Proust and reading a review like this are anglophile as well as francophile."},{"Title":"Time regained;","review":"Perhaps the most exciting publishing event of the century so far is the new translation of \\"In Search of Lost Time,\\" as it is now (and more accurately) called. Finding the last two volumes is a bit of a chore, but search for ISBN 0141180366 or \\"Prendergast Proust\\" or \\"Ian Patterson\\" on Amazon. I haven't read it, but I am impressed enough by the first two volumes in this new translations that I have ordered the final two from England, where they are available in hardcover. Viking has not yet published them in the U.S. (and may not, in my lifetime) but Amazon sells the paperbacks of the British Penguin edition. They are somewhat misleadingly titled \\"In Search of Lost Time,\\" which is the series title. This volume is actually titled \\"Finding Time Again,\\" and the translator is Ian Patterson. (Each book has its own translator, for a total of seven. Vol. 5 contains two books and features two translators.)I give this Modern Library edition only four stars because I am convinced that the new translation is superior. Indeed, it's not entirely clear to me who the translator is, in this case; evidently not Fred Blossom, who did the original English translation when Scott-Montcrief died before finishing the work."},{"Title":"Time regained;","review":"I've been reading Proust's novel off and on since about 2002. Having read the first four volumes consecutively, I got burned out on young M, took a seven year hiatus, and eventually returned to the Albertine volumes and Time Regained in 2012. The particular edition I'm reviewing here, the Modern Library Classics edition, with its extensive list of characters, places, and persons, is a book I wish I'd purchased early in my reading of Proust since it would have helped me in dealing with the vast number of characters that pop in and out of the novel. I always admired those who had managed to read through the entire novel, since I knew that for every one who finally finished it there were probably at least a hundred more who abandoned it at some point. Now that I am one of those weird individuals who did finish the novel, I have a lot of sympathy for those who are fallen by the wayside. At the risk of sounding a contrarian note, I feel like the Time Lost in reading Proust will never be Regained. Was it wasted time? Perhaps all time must be wasted in one way or another. Using the time as money metaphor, which is essentially untrue, a product of our capitalist-consumer culture, I could have \\"spent\\" my time better perhaps by \\"investing\\" it wisely in closely reading market-timing newsletters, Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine, etc., etc. But instead, I wasted my time on M. All those fallen-by-the-waysiders know what I mean. Life is short, and there are a lot of other things one could be doing, besides scaling this monstrosity.And Proust's novel is a monstrous edifice, imposing like the height of a skyscraper seen close up, but fundamentally an imperfect work of art which may still be acknowledged as a masterpiece just as a painting by Jackson Pollock might appear somewhat shoddy and haphazard when viewed close up, while still remaining priceless from a distance. In Time Regained, Proust lets it all hang out. The description of Jupien's brothel and what happens inside it, especially with respect to Baron de Charlus, is probably the part that sticks most in my mind. But the great afternoon party given by the Princesse de Guermantes (the former Mme Verdurin) which occupies the entire last half of the novel is the main event which brings most of the main characters of the novel together again for a final reprise. There is a fair amount of dross scattered about in the text amidst much extraordinary, unforgettable writing. One outstanding example of the latter is the precious description of the Duc de Guermantes in his extreme old age and his pathetic love affair with Mme de Forcheville (Odette), which takes up pages 486-491.Time Regained should probably be considered the climax and the cornerstone of the entire novel, but instead, it is more like an epilogue. The novel does not really end on a positive note either. It's not a whimper exactly but sort of a muffled affirmation that the art of writing down the past and transforming it will in the end make some sort of difference in the grand scheme of things, whatever that might be. The great, obsessional love-affair with Albertine, which seems to be the highlight of the novel, is mercifully over with, and the author is older, wiser, resigned, deeply committed to the realization of his life's work, the great book he has perennially put off writing. Now, as his own death draws near, he realizes that the time has now come to begin the Great Work. No one who reads the entire novel ever seems to say much about how they felt on finally completing the last sentence on the last page. In my own case, there was a touch of sadness in my heart when the novel came to an end, and even a brief, crazy desire to return to Swann's Way and the two paths. But I quickly laid that idea aside. But in the end I'm glad that I wasted so many days in the company of Marcel. Proust's achievement will remain a monument in my own life to lost and happily wasted time."},{"Title":"Time regained;","review":"Reader beware ... the Kindle version of Volume 6 DOES NOT include the Guide to Proust. That was the main I bought this volume in advance because of the guide. Amazon has kindly credited me for the book."},{"Title":"Time regained;","review":"Though it bears the title of Proust's seven-volume masterpiece, this is actually just the final volume, called \\"Finding Time Again\\" in this new translation. This particular book would be the British paperback edition, for the American press run has so far only given us four volumes, all of which are for sale on Amazon in a uniform style.There are small but real differences between the British and American editions. With their greater tolerance for continental foibles, the Brits retained French punctuation, using dashes instead of quotation marks for conversation. They also retained the French wherever Proust makes a literary reference, providing a translation in the notes; in the American edition, this policy is reversed.In reading the first two volumes (\\"Swanns' Way\\" and \\"In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower\\") I noticed typographical errors that might well have resulted in converting the British to the American languages, rather than from French to English. For example, on page 95 of \\"In the Shadow\\" there is the phrase \\"Professor Cottard and his wife were not to partake of the pleasure\\" when the sentence should actually read \\"NOW to partake,\\" since Swann has decided to introduce the Cottards to the Duchesse! Not earthshaking, but it does rather spoil Proust's little joke.In short, these British paperbacks will serve very nicely if the American reader is in a hurry to complete the novel, and they may also be more free of errors. But I will probably wait for the uniform hardcover Viking volumes.I haven't read Mr. Patterson's translation of volume seven, but I give it five stars based on the company it keeps."},{"Title":"Time regained;","review":"Alright, so I'm a cheat. I never thought I'd get beyond admiring the bright spanking six volumes of A la recherche (3700 pages! Phew!) on my bookshelves, but when it was announced that Raul Ruiz had made a film of the last book, I seized my chance. Thanks to this brilliant edition you can, because at the end is an exhaustive guide to Proust, listing every character, historical person, place and theme of the whole work, so that just by referring regularly to this you quickly catch up with what's going on. Of course this isn't the same as living with characters and events through literature, but this volume is so amazing you can't fail to want to begin the whole thing and experience them from the start.This is, as I expected, one of the most beautiful and exciting books I have ever read, as well as one of the most frustrating and irritating. What is most surprising, for a book claimed as one of the two greatest of the century, is how old-fashioned it is (compared to the still startlingly modern and socially relevant ULYSSES).It has two types of narrative. One, about a young middle class boy who penetrates society, is a mixture of social comedy and tortured romance familiar to anyone who has read a great Victorian novel - there is the same social analysis of an outmoded caste, wide range of characters, poetic evocation of place.The language, once you get used to the involved, elaborate sentences, is very accessible in a Jamesian kind of way, intricately psychological and analytical, yet supremely elegant and radiant, with a verve and lightness remarkable for such a heavy book.The translation is, for once, remarkable - it can never be the original, I guess, but you rarely feel that you are getting only half the work like you usually do.The second half is less satisfactory. As is appropriate to a book concerned with time, the book's forward progress is constantly impeded, by degressions, flashbacks, fastforwards, explanations. The book, like those of Anthony Powell (if you loved THE DANCE TO THE MUSIC OF TIME, you'll adore this) is less straight plotting, than a series of monumental set-pieces.This novel is 450 pages long, but has only about three events - the narrator going back to the country to stay with friends; the first world war; a huge party. These are mini-novels in themselves and are extraordinary as social observation, character comedy and amusing incident, as well as profoundly moving meditations on the inexorable power of history and old age.Imagine the narrator has a remote control as he is walking through the film of his life. He freezes the screen every three seconds and discusses in detail the tableaux vivants before him, bending time and experience back and forwards with ease as he does so.In between these are ruminations on the art of writing. This is a remarkably self-reflexive book, the narrator suddenly starts talking about how he came to write it, what he intended to achieve and what tools he was going to use. The volume becomes less the conclusion of a vast work than the record of its inception; you have to go back then and read it again (believe me, 3700 pages won't seem enough).This section, a book-length manifesto, is fascinating and thrilling, but also repetitive, difficult, frustrating, and sometimes obscure - it gets in the way of the brilliant descriptive passages - the meeting with Baron de Charlus is possibly the most extraordinary thing I have read, until the remarkable coup of the closing party, where people the narrator hasn't seen for years have grown horribly old and form a grotesque, funereal fancy dress party - you want him to shut up talking about Time and impressionism and get back to the fun.Two other things: Evelyn Waugh was wrong - Proust is hilarious, both with subtle ironies and more obvious satiric abuse; with risible character traits and wider social events.Secondly, the narrator is not some unbearable omnisicient know-all as those of Victorian novels - he is deeply unreliable - a prig, hypocrite, voyeur, homophobic, intolerant, puritan, snob, deeply contradictory and cripplingly ill; in earlier volumes he is apparently obsessional, jealous and brutal to the point of insanity. No wonder Nabokov adored him - he is, in his ravishingly aesthetic unreliability, the first Humbert."},{"Title":"Time regained;","review":"If you've read the first four volumes of the Penguin Modern Classic, Proust's In Search of Lost Time, then don't let the publication restriction in the US stop you from buying the British text versions.

The only differences (which are hardly a great obstacle to the enjoyment of reading the novel), are the footnotes in back and the original French lyrics which Proust occasionally quotes from in the body of the work -- apparently the British assume we colonial philistines do not know as much French as they do.The introduction to The Fugitive I found hugely welcome -- British translator Carol Clark is unapologetically direct in summing up for us what the previous 4 volumes have been about -- a long wished for insight as I have been dying to know up to this point whether or not I have been truly getting Proust all along.The curse and the blessing is that Proust died before he could give the final sign off on these manuscripts before publication. A curse because he most certainly would have removed or resolved many errors, and extended or rewritten many parts which are its weakest sections. A blessing in that, to be sure, there are in this and the next volume several obvious errors which a good copy editor would have detected and eliminated, but with time have become such a part of Proustian lore that they can no more be removed than say Jimmy Durante's nose shortened or Richard Burton's pockmarks removed or Marilyn Manson's makeup wiped clean.And if one has lasted this long, the addiction to Proust's peregrinations from the plot to discuss seemingly unrelated topics and issues in minute detail - as seen from the other end of binoculars, as Roger Shattuck writes in Proust's Binoculars- one will not be at all bothered about any perceived sloppiness in these last two volumes. On the contrary, one will feel proud to detect them for oneself, and have a private chuckle about it as Proust is forgiven for what would be unacceptable by today's publishing standards.SO don't wait four more years - you'll not care by then or have forgotten much of the threads of the protean plot which keeps all volumes tied into one - for most of what is written in these last volumes is the rich reward the reader deserves after having hung in there until the end, to discover the final fate and full identities of all the rich and lively characters we have come to love - Charlus and St Loup, Albertine and Gilberte, oh, and Mme Potbus' maid - remember her?The Prisoner and the Fugitive translated by Carol ClarkThis is almost a novel within the novel as it deals in two parts with the final resolution of the narrator's relationship to Albertine, this character who, more so than any other, the narrator has kept directly from the reader's curious view and desire to know her in her own voice.Finding Time Again translated by Ian PattersonThe fates of the rest of the characters are revealed, and the narrator in this last volume himself ages (or catches up to the age at which he began telling this long story -- and we will learn why he had to write it all before his death, as the line between fiction and reality between Marcel the narrator and Marcel the famed French writer nearly disappears). This is the volume where, winding down at last from what was always a nebulous plot to one last social scene,like a curtain call, all the characters take their final bows together in old age (either still alive or in the narrator's memory of them). And there are some great surprises left to discover, which hopefully too much reading of Proustian criticism, biographies, and reviews hasn't already revealed to the \`well informed but too reluctant to read A la Recherch&eacute; du Temps Perdu for themselves' lover of literature."},{"Title":"Time regained;","review":"In this final life's work of Proust on the theme of the passage of Time it's clear that the author is riper, near to death and concerned about the lasting impact of his writing. \\"Eternal duration is promised no more to men's works than to men.\\" Yet there is so much beauty and substance and lyricism in his 4,300 pages clearly his volumes are, both individually and collectively, a masterwork for the ages. The novel seems more like an autobiography in which the names of persons and places have been changed to protect the innocent (and the gulity). Because of his theme, Marcel constantly returns to the events of his life to gain some semblance of understanding of them. In this volume he is concerned with the effect of the world war upon Paris. The familiar characters of Gilberte and Bloch happily emerge again to center stage and, as always, Charlus and Morel. Because of his failing health and self-exile from society, he must have known that he had little Time to tie up all the loose ends and that another volume would not be in the offing after this one. Indeed, he never lived to see this volume in print. By virtue of his failing health the pressing nature of his last years lend a poignancy to the themes of this volume so that it stands out among the other works when Time was full of budding possibilities and had not ultimately become a dreaded adversary. In this volume Proust picks up the leitmotifs that thread their way through this remarkable tapestry in his walks down various ways and he brings them all to a meaningful end. The story lines are surprisingly simple and easy to follow and there is so much enduring value in his masterfully articulated \\"impressions.\\" I decided to commit Time a few months ago to read all of Proust's work --it was Time well spent. I can't encourage you enough to make a similar investment. The work is truly a Timeless masterpiece from one of the real geniuses of his day and through it Proust has justly earned his immortality, his worthy prominence among the best literary minds of all Time."},{"Title":"Time regained;","review":"\\"Time Regained\\" is a dark ending to the \\"In Search of Lost Time\\" cycle, as Proust, sickly like his fictional narrator, unknowingly nears the end of his own life but senses its imminence. France, like the most of the rest of the world, is now a very different place. The Dreyfus affair is receding into the past under the shadow of the new war that has descended upon Europe, with Germany having ravaged Belgium and threatening to destroy London and Paris.Many of the people with whom Marcel has associated throughout his life and whom we came to know so intimately through the pages of his chronicle are now dead, whether by disease, accident, old age, or the war. Those among the living include the Baron de Charlus, who sympathizes with the Germans and frequents a hotel that serves as a male brothel; Bloch, who has de-Judaicized his name and has assumed an English chic; and Odette and her daughter Gilberte, the latter now herself a mother, who have not so gracefully weathered the effects of aging.Marcel himself is now an adult of at least middle age, and, as far as he is concerned, still no closer to achieving his goal of becoming a writer as he was in his youth. He has, however, started writing articles and comes to realize, as he reflects on the course of his life, that the intricate web of contacts he has made can serve as grist for his literary mill, should he decide in his waning days to take up a pen and make some contribution to letters. And, of course, over the past four thousand pages that is exactly what his author has done. Marcel muses on Time (capitalization intended), memory, and dreams as necessary elements in the creation of art, a product of so much personal pain and suffering that death can seem like a welcome reprieve.Judging the novel as a whole now that I've finished all six volumes, I affirm that there is nothing like it, or even close to it, in literature; like \\"Moby Dick\\" or \\"Don Quixote\\" it resides in its own impenetrable legendary world of oneness. In my review of \\"Swann's Way,\\" I compared Proust to Henry James, but I see now that I was way off the mark. James writes like he's throwing his weight around, imperiously demanding intellectual respect and forcing his reader into submission with his intentionally inscrutable compositions; Proust's prose, conversely, calmly and warmly invites the reader into Marcel's society and caresses him with the most delicate sensations and deepest emotions. Proust is closer to Henry Adams than he is to Henry James, but even this attempted juxtaposition is buffered by a wide margin.Proust's style is so ornate that it is the most difficult of any writer's to describe, yet paradoxically there is nothing affected about it; he is quite possibly the most unpretentious writer in literature. He never tries to impress the reader with his erudition, even though he evidently has much, or make himself out to be something he's not; one gets the sense that what he writes is exactly what and how he thinks, as incredible as that seems. He uses humor without trying to be a comedian, sorrow without trying to be a tragedian. He is employing language simply to illustrate life and the world, and I think language has no higher calling than that."},{"Title":"Time regained;","review":"The melancholy atmosphere that pervaded the close of The Fugitive is carried over into this final part of Proust's huge work. Whereas, in the preceding part, Marcel laments the loss of Albertine and his changed relationship with his long time friend, Saint Loup, the author's concerns are now much greater. France is in the midst of World War I, Paris experiencing night time air raids; and the distinction between the Guermantes' Way and Swann's Way has become even more blurred as both Gilberte, the daughter of a courtesan, and Mme. Verdurin, the insufferable salon hostess, have become members of the mystic Guermantes family. Furthermore, Saint Loup is killed in action and Marcel's hometown is occupied by the Germans. But in spite of the gravity of the events surrounding him, Marcel becomes even more self-absorbed. He still holds onto his drean of becoming a writer, but this desire begins to wane as he becomes convinced that he has neither the temperament, the knowledge nor the fortitude to follow a literary career. Then the pivotal event of the whole novel takes place: he is invited to a matinee at the new home of the Prince de Guermantes.While waiting in an anteroom for admission to the Guermantes' reception, the author is beset by a series of sensory experiences that bring back several happy memories from his past. These recollections, both powerful and joyous, convince him that he has the ability to undertake a literary career, to be able to communicate those ecstatic moments from the past to readers of the present day. His melancholy lifted, he enters the reception to discover that his recent epiphany is only bolstered by what he finds. All around him are the decaying remnants of a fast fading aristocracy. Many of the characters that have been introduced to the reader throughout the course of the novel are met again, but now in the final years of their lives: the proud Charlus, now an obsequious old man; the Duc de Guermantes, described as a &quot;magnificent ruin&quot;; Gilberte, now confused with her aging mother; even Marcel becomes aware that he, too, is quickly getting old. But now seeing things with an artist's eye, Marcel becomes aware that each of these characters, as well as all those people remembered from his life, are &quot;like giants plunged into the years, [touching] the distant epochs through which they have lived, between which so many days have come to range themeselves - in Time.&quot; Marcel's goal is clear. He will spend the rest of his life carefully bringing these giants back to life. In other words, he is ready to embark on the huge task of writing the book that the reader has just finished reading.This part of the novel was published five years after the author's death and suffers from a lack of editing. There are many ellipses, contradictions, and time and place juxtapostion mistakes, errors that Proust would surely have tidied up if he had lived to see his work published in full. But these are paltry criticisms wthen compared to the brilliance of the total work. Unfortunately, Proust is little read these days, and many of those who attempt to read the novel are motivated by the challenge of a literary marathon more than from an awareness of the intrinsic value of the work (as I was). But regardless of the motivation, the effort (and it is an effort) is totally rewarding as the reader sees in Proust's world reflections of his own. It took me a part of seven years to read the complete novel, a period of time in which Proust's search for lost time and my own reminiscences often became linked together as the author's characters shared my own thoughts regarding things past, the specious present, and the eventual fate that awaits us all.Kilmartin's A Guide to Proust, which is included in this volume is well worth the price of the book by itself. The guide consists of four distinct inexes to Proust's novel: characters, historical persons, places and themes. The scholarship that went into compliling these indexes is outstanding and makes it possible for the reader to spend several years (if he so wishes) in working his way through the novel without losing track of the hundreds of characters and personages included therein. One reviewer remarked, &quot;buy this volume first&quot;; I would only modify this advice by suggesting that the prospective reader get this volume when he purchases Swann's Way."},{"Title":"Time regained;","review":"I attach this review of Proust's cycle of novels to the last novel in the cycle because things are calmer here than over at Swann's Way. The crowd here seems to have thinned out a little. Contrary to what some reveiwers claim, plenty happens in the seven novels comprising In Search of Lost Time. Plenty happens, but it happens \\"over time\\" - as in real life. In \\"Marcel's\\" case, it's a life during which the exalted are brought low and the base are exalted. Proust's novelistic enterprise, which early-on might be dismissed as nothing more than the effete self-absorption of a Parisian dilettante who's \\"not worth the rope to hang him\\" (as one character maintains in Vol. III), turns out, by the final volume, to be a good deal grittier than first appeared.The choice of translation matters. The older, Moncrieff translation comes across as precious and sentimental, while the newer Mayor/Enright/Kilmartin edition seems less so. Compare the title Moncrieff chose, Remembrance of Things Past, (a phrase lifted out of Shakespeare's Sonnet 30) to the literally-translated title used in the newer edition: In Search of Lost Time. Also compare, \\"I would ask myself what o'clock it could be\\" (Moncrieff) with \\"I would ask myself what time it could be\\" (Enright). Though the differences may be minor, I had a much better experience with the newer translation.The cycle of seven novels in six volumes takes considerable TIME to read. I spent the slack year between early retirement and late graduate school reading it. Thus, I modestly propose that every American who has not already done so should quit his or her job immediately and carefully read all seven novels before proceeding any further with thier lives. Not that I'm an enthusiast. My proposal follows from an opinion that we Americans need to spend more time thinking and less time doing. That way we'd do less harm. Even so, readers should be prepared for a certain Proustian indifference to minor matters of proportion. They may find a single sentence that occupies an entire page, or a single paragraph that goes on for eight pages. A chapter of 300 or more pages may be follwed by a chapter of 25 pages. \\"Marcel\\" may go on for fifteen pages about what he experiences while trying to remember a name that's on \\"the tip of his tongue.\\" But if you don't enjoy lengthy examinations of inner experiencings, you probably shouldn't be reading Proust. There were also occasional long stretches of such drek that I wanted to gag. \\"Marcel's\\" sojourn with soldiers in Doncieres in Vol. III was one such. Readers must be prepared to simply forge ahead when encountering these. It gets better.Which leads me to Vol. VI, Time Regained, a tour de force, without a doubt. If the \\"tea and madeleine\\" segment in Swann's Way forms the left bookend for In Search of Lost Time, Time Regained forms the right one. I wouldn't want to give too much away about Proust's final volume. William Empson claimed to have expected an apocalypse and accordingly lamented (or pretended to lament) the apparent insignificance of what Proust actually provided. I'd hate to give away more than Empson did, but I think that by the final volume \\"Marcel's\\" fruitless pursuit of Madame Putbus' maid has been abandoned at last. Even the face of Mme de Guermantes, admired by \\"Marcel\\" through seven novels, has begun to resemble \\"nougat\\" with traces of verdigris and fragmentary shell-work on which grew \\"a little growth of an indefinable character, smaller than a mistletoe berry and less transparent than a glass bead.\\" Volume VI shows \\"Marcel\\" at his funniest, and most misanthropic, as attached as ever to his own follies, yet as quick as ever to dissect those of his friends - a decidedly tragic vision. It made the long read worthwhile. After I finished Time Regained I went back to Vol. I and began all over again."},{"Title":"Time regained;","review":"By the time I reached this final volume of Proust's &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; I was exhausted. I had steadfastly followed the advice given in my college French Literature course: I would go into a quiet room with no distractions and loose myself in the beauty of the language and the images.I did find myself referring to this final volume frequently while reading the others. The &quot;Guide to Proust&quot; is a great tool for remaining focused and maintaining the unity of the work.While I am no scholar, I can say that I do appreciate Kilmartin's Translation. The language is beautiful and musical. As with any masterpiece, the original is beyond compare.&quot;A la recherche du temps perdu&quot; begins with the word &quot;longtemps&quot; (&quot;For a long time&quot;) and ends several thousand pages later with the word &quot;temps&quot; (&quot;Time&quot;). How's that for unity!"},{"Title":"Time regained;","review":"Time Regained is the splendid payoff of Proust's plot development, so carefully built up over the course of thepreceding six volumes of his novel. It is here that it all comes together, and he integrates his concept of involuntary memory with time and creativity, demonstrating the joy of escapingthe coils of time to relive the past unencumbered by the accumulated intervening thoughts and feelings. This liberationenables creativity and suggests metaphors. He describes how this has inspired his vocation, his dedication to writing the book you have been reading, and hands to the reader the same gift of regaining time."},{"Title":"Time regained;","review":"The final installment of Proust's grand \`a la recherche du temps perdu' is a masterful and eloquent meditation on art, on the loss of love, and on the complex and enigmatic quality of experiencing relationships over the course of a lifetime. This is the period, the final breath of literary genius from the great Marcel Proust, who devoted his life to this great novel.In \`Time Regained,' the reader is permitted an extraordinary prolegomena on the writer's craft, a self-reflexive exposition of the literary form that prefigures post-modernity and the works of Brecht, Breton, Beckett, and all the rest of them. Proust creates a work that is more exacting, more precise and perspicacious than any work of aesthetic philosophy in the western tradition. He discloses that the art of writing is, in its essence, an act or translation.The artistic content is already contained within the mind and soul of the artist and the act of writing is an act of transporting the content to form.This is a novel about time, and it requires time to read. In this way, Proust the reader develops a relationship with the work within the register of a temporal horizon, which mirrors the register of temporality internal to the characters and unfolding of the fictional universe that Proust has created. It is a joy to read.Also included in this volume is Kilmartin's guide to Proust, a summation of all the central characters, events, and allusions in a la recherch&eacute; for readers who (inevitably) get lost in Proust's complex literary web."},{"Title":"Lao textiles: Ancient symbols-living art","review":"Written in 1989, this book brings to life the author's obvious love of Lao textiles.

I don't blame the writer or Black Library for putting this book out, they did what they could with the material, but the material was too weak to none existent.First, all the WH40K novels suffers from some restraint of the \\"playing universe that is WH40K\\" then if that's not hard enough, confine it even more to follow a weak story line from a game. (The game is great, but the story line is paper cut out and then some.)The end result, is a bunch of one dimension characters, with empty minds, and as mentioned before, they change their mind at a whim, just making them feel below 1 dimension, I respect that the Eldar are not covered in many book as mentioned before, but Farseer is a much better choice then this \\"novel\\".The big story line are classic and has been done 100 times before in all games, even outside the WarHammer 40K universe, some of the Codex short stories are better then this novel, and that's saying a lot. Characters and setting are bellow one dimension, it feel like reading a small intro to a game that went horribly wrong and long, it would not fit in the box, and decided, let's make a \\"novel\\" with this mess and sell it.I cannot recommend this book to anyone, and I just wish that peoples wont judge the Black Library's book collection with this one book, that would be a tragedy.You want to read :About Eldar's - FarseerAbout Space Marines turning to the dark side - Soul Drinker, Crimson Tears and The Bleeding ChaliceAbout Chaos Marines - Storm of IronAbout Inquisitor - Eisenhorn Trilogy, The Inquisitor War (Draco) and the new Ravenor's.My recommendation - Anything written by Dan Abnett and William King."},{"Title":"Dawn of War (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"Considering that Dawn of War is the novelisation of a computer game, it was fantastic! The writing is powerful and the action scenes are the best I've seen. If you like Black Library stuff, you'll love this."},{"Title":"Dawn of War (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"I don't know what the heck I was expecting when I got this book. I think my buying this particular work of CS Goto occured before I actually made the distinction between the good writers of the Black Library and the ones that are something less. Dan Abnett, Graham McNeill, William King, Ben Counter, James Swallow, Andy Hoare, Steve Lyons, Mitchell Scanlon, and...actually, reading much pretty any other fething writer that the BL uses is better that reading Goto. He's an adequate writer at best, and most of the time worse. Abnett and McNeill are my favorites, in that order.I'm too long-winded, so I'll get to this specific book. It's based on the Relic Warhammer 40K Real-Time Strategy game, Dawn of War. DoW is an excellent game and so are both it's expansion packs, and the plot was certainly good enough for someone to write a good book based on it. True, sometimes it's tough to translate from a game to a good movie or book, but there was enough space to maneuver within the storyline that Goto--if he was a good writer, let's assume for a moment--ought to have been able to do better.First of all, the whole idea of writing a book on this game, it would seem, would be to flesh out the characters a bit and at least make them seem a bit three-dimensional. Not true of anyone in this story. If you played the videogame, you know exactly what the characters of Captain Angelos, Librarian Isador, Chaos Lord Bale, Sindri the Sorceror, Colonel Brom, Inquisitor Whatevertheheckhisnameis are all like. The backstory at the beginning suffers from lethargic writing that manages to make a scene where a giant eldar avatar fights a demon prince seem dull.From there, our man CS is off to the races.The plot is fine, really. The thing is, Goto didn't come up with the plot in the first place. He does an adequate job of telling people what they already know if they played the game. Some of the fight scenes are okay. But seemingly any time he tries to expand a theme, he manages to screw up. A light Eldar, for some reason, is seen shouting \\"blood for the blood god.\\" That is simply not something you'd ever catch an eldar saying outside the weird world of Goto. Other lowlights:-Lord Bale, the Chaos leader, is a piece of cardboard holding a scythe, but the best part is how Goto describes him as \\"rampaging across worlds and galaxies\\" in the past. Worlds: okay. Galaxies: no. Bale has not been to a different galaxy unless you're talking about the warp. Even if that's the case, the poor word choice is an indictable offense anyway.-Colonel Brom, the local PDF leader, is a bizarre character. Most of the time, the Space Marines flat out ignore him and piss him off to the point where he...well, I won't spoil it, but Brom in the game NEVER TURNED TO CHAOS, GOSH DARN IT. Sorry, I spoiled it. But what the hell? It's not even accurate to the storyline of DoW. How hard could it have been to stasy faithful to a frickin' video game storyline made up of a few cutscenes?-Goto is just not very good switching scens constantly, and he chose to try and show this conflict from all four sides (Good, Chaos, Eldar, Ork) and it doesn't work. Too much face time for the Eldar, too much face time for the ridiculous Ork characters he crafts.-The Guardsmen who defend the city of Lloovre Marr have NO senior officer in command of them. Thus, one of them opens the gates when the Eldar come calling while another opens fire on them. They put up pathetic resistance and die. What possible explanation is there that there wasn't even a frakking Lieutenant to watch over the walls of one of the bigger cities on the planet?-Gabriel's duel with Bale is a pathetic fight scene. Awesomely pathetic.There's more, and I could go on and on. Instead I'll just say that Goto gets the second star more because I know it's tough to adapt a storyline from another source. Otherwise, this would get one star. I do not recommend this or any other Goto WH40K book unless you're flat out of WH40K to read."},{"Title":"Dawn of War (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"I came to this book after reading Goto's awesome 'Warrior Brood' and, to be honest, I didn't expect much from it, given that it is a novelisation of a computer game (albeit a dashed good computer game). However, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The plot of the book is much more intricate and interesting than it is in the game -- the author clearly did a lot of work to transform that lame duck into something that could fly (can lame ducks fly anyway?). The result is a storming action romp. It feels a little 'outside' the normal WH40K stuff, as though it exists in a little bubble in a galaxy far far away, but I can forgive that (and enjoy it) given that it is rooted in the computer game rather than the wargame. Don't get me wrong, all the regular 40K elements are there: eldar, space marines, orks, chaos marines ... It just feels like Goto has made them his own rather than slavishly sticking to what has gone on in other books. In many ways, this is great, and it is exactly the kind of creativity that franchise fiction needs.The second volume 'Ascension' is already out in Europe, so I've ordered that already!"},{"Title":"Dawn of War (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"It was decent in overall but unfortunately the author did not know or understand the background of the Alpha Legion so he made so rather basic mistakes in the story regarding them.

Second, all Aspect Warriors are committed to Khaine (the 'Bloody Handed God') ... hence they call for blood in his name. If these things made it hard for him to get into the story, then they must also make it hard for him to get into any WH40K story ...In anycase, the idea of 'facts' in a fictional world is a bit odd.One of the best things about 'Dawn of War' is that it deals with the eldar at all! Hardly any of the books talk about them, and CS Goto has got them EXACTLY RIGHT! I hope he/she writes more. Yes, there are some problems with the plot, but those problems are in the game too.

Later on in the book Gabriel's best friend Isador turns to Chaos and Gabriel then killed his traitorous friend. They later fight a Chaos demon Sindri and successfully save Tartarus.There was many things that I absolutely loved in the book. The best part was that there was tons of action. Almost every page had an awesome fight with huge battles against the aliens. The proof is all in a quote \\"...Tanthius and his squad of terminators were storming towards the felled section of the wall, their storm bolters spluttered with fire...\\"Not only did I love the action I loved the treachery. The treachery of Gabriel's best friend was the best though.Just because th book was great doesn't mean it had a few parts I didn't like. The most annoying thing was the talking parts. There was about 3 or 4 talking parts that were 10 to15 pages long. No action just conversation. For example \\"...What do you think he wants,...\\" And it goes on for 10 more pages.Overall my favorite part was when The Marines and the Guards repel a huge Ork offensive. It is my favorite part for a few reasons. First, the action is intense. Second, there is thousands of Orks in a huge charge against the lines. Overall the book is an action packed book with a great story."},{"Title":"Dawn of War (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"One of the great things about books in the WH40K universe is the strong continuity across titles, series, etc. With that in mind, I was extremely disturbed by the lack of continuity checking applied to this book. It literally swims with inconsistencies and errors. Those problems made it very difficult for me to get decent immersion in the story, unlike the majority of the Black Library's Warhammer 40,000 titles.Even in the prologue, problems crop up that greatly harmed my interest in continuing through the book (and it didn't notably improve on further reading). The portrayal of \\"light\\" Eldar is rife with misunderstandings of their pantheon (hint: no \\"light\\" Eldar would shout \\"Blood for the Blood God!\\"). Those problems in the beginning muddled much of the motivation for the rest of the story. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but such mistakes are like salt on an open nerve once you've read or played (the tabletop game, not the computer game) enough to be familiar with the \\"universe\\" of WH40K.Even the characterizations were less than impressive, relying too much on \\"Warhammer 40,000 typecasts\\" (the portrayal of the Astartes characters in particular fell prey to that problem). Motivations of actions continually seemed inconsistent or outright contradictory to what you'd expect from the story prior to them. It made it hard to believe the characters, and even harder to vest in the story.The action and writing themselves were capable, but anyone who's spent time reading any substantial portion of the Black Library's Warhammer 40K offerings is likely to be disappointed by this book. It wouldn't have taken _that_ much to fix the problems, but it seems too likely that things were rushed to try and get the book out near the game's release (and in so doing compromised the quality of the work). For a novelization of a computer game, it's about par, but that puts it FAR below most of the other WH40K books in the Black Library.It's a shame given the overall excellent quality and continuity GDW mandates in the rest of the Black Library to see this book slip out. I'd recommend most of the other WH40K books in the Black Library, but this one just fails too frequently and too severely to recommend it to fans of that universe."},{"Title":"Dawn of War (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"This novel follows the actions of Brother Captain Gabriel Angelosas he fights and puzzles his way through the mysteriouspresence of Xenos breeds as well as that of his allieson the battletorn fields of Tartarus.The novel was filled with nonstop action and mayhemwith a healthy dose of guilt ridden angst and was a bit betterthan expected, at least from an action standpoint.Most novel adaptations are atrocious andDawn of War doesn't veer too much from that.I did find some things that I had major problems with;A bit of logic and intelligence in the characters.The novel needed a much better depiction of themotivation and spiral towards Chaos.The corruption the reader has to accept is far toosimple in explaining how and why certain characters becomecorrupt. It is difficult to accept Librarian Isador'sconversion to Chaos because of his reason for it, andthe logic of his subsequent actions. To accept thathe became corrupt because he wanted more personal poweris to accept that he is a paper cutter cutout withno experience and background which is entirely out of character.The same applies to Colonel Brom. To accept Chaos whenhe knows what Chaos is about, simply because he resentsthe presence of greater authorities is absurd.The novel \\"Soul Drinkers\\" was much more effective and believablein its slow drive towards Chaos.The last story point that I had a problem withruined the novel for me.It is explained to Gabriel by the Inquisitor why and howthe Daemon Prince was imprisoned in a gem by the Eldar.In the end of the novel, he destroys the gem,at the urging of that SAME inquisitor simply because theinquisitor tells him that the gem is the cause of all thetrouble. He thus releases the daemon prince.With his prior knowledge given him by theinquisitor and the Eldar Farseer practically screamingat him that he's making a mistake, why would hesmash the gem as he did??? There is no logic to hisactions and makes absolutely no sense since he knewthat the daemon prince was trapped in the gem. Did heeven question the inquisitor?? Especially since he waspractically at odds with the inquisitor during the entire novel!Even after the conflict is resolved and the Daemon Princepractically tells him to his face what he's done, he stillrefuses to believe and accept that he was a pawn.The writing style of the novel itself is fairly decent butwith the limited scope in the story that is allowed the authorin telling an intelligent story, the reader has to reallystretch the limits of believability to accept alot ofthe character's actions. Pretty much what I expected froma video game adaptation."},{"Title":"Dawn of War (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"Dawn of War is t3h 1337.

On the contrary, &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; is stylishly written, endlessly startling (for example, Veblen analyses religion as an outgrowth of the gambling instinct), and very, very funny. Its expose of &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; (yes, Veblen was the one who invented this famous concept) is as relevant today as it was in 1899, if not more so. Whether or not you agree with all that he says, it's thought-provoking and exciting stuff."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions (A Mentor book)","review":"This opus by Veblen exposes the real meaning of the pecuniary advancement of the working and merchant classes, and the formation of elites based mostly upon money and asset valuation. The transfiguration of the traditional social and individual ethical values that this phenomenon produced, is portraited with clarity and sarcastic intelligence by the author in the book, first published in 1899.Now a classic of economic theory, as well as a text book of social science, it describes the tendencies of consumerism, leisure and the &quot;materialization&quot; of the ideals of the aspiring new princes (or noveau rich) of society. Veblen's vibrant satire of the tendency of the modern individual to believe that real accomplishment is all about aquiring a condition of ostentatious wealth and status, and his analisis of the inception of modern class structure in America, still stand, a century after, as recommended reading for historians and economists.If you are a fervent follower of advertisement, fashion, &quot;glamour&quot; and other modern expressions of consumerism , then you will find a surprisingly fresh portrait of yourself in this book. It worries me that the leisure class and its shallow views and values as described by Veblen, may still today represent elites in America and their religion, as analyzed by professor Lash in his last book &quot;The Revolt of the Elites&quot;. I highly recommend Veblen's best book, to scholars and sociologists at large."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions (A Mentor book)","review":"Known by his contemporaries as the only social theorist to apply Darwin critically, in 1899 Thorstein Veblen published The Theory of the Leisure Class: A Economic Study of Institutions, which was to become the basis from which all further American leisure history and theory stemmed. In his study, Veblen is primarily concerned with the &quot;new rich,&quot; whom he regards as social parasites that retard the growth of modern life. Thorstein Veblen wrote The Theory of the Leisure Class from a perspective that was largely isolated from his own culture, which either aided in his understanding of the Leisure Class or perhaps negatively influenced his opinions due to his exclusion from it. In The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen essentially confines man and woman's existence on the planet as a struggle to change and adapt with the growth of their communities. Through this belief, Veblen develops a theme that amounts to the idea of a certain &quot;dominant&quot; type of individual. This individual develops a social structure through dominance in which social advance is sought by others. She/he will feel the discrepancy between the modern life and traditional life during the process. Though Veblen's rhetoric is sometimes anxious, sometimes negative, he actively pursues a specific account of the origins of the Leisure Class through individuals. The struggle for individual advancement eventually expands to include society, and the more individual struggle for advancement in society leads to the accumulation of surplus goods.Surplus of conspicuous consumption by the Leisure Class gives the class license to indulge shamefully in pure conspicuous consumption, where their occupations eventually become leisure itself. These &quot;professions&quot; of the Leisure Class by nature render it closed, and impenetrable by outsiders.Thorstein Veblen wrote the Leisure Class represented the new phenomena of conspicuous consumption compared to pre-Industrialized wealthy communities as well as contemporary working-class ones. But as intellectual inquiry into the topic of leisure has progressed over the past one hundred years, leisure has come to hold a number of definitions and meanings."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions (A Mentor book)","review":"The basic premise of this book is that modern humans have inherited an instinct to compete with each other for material resources. This competition takes place within the context of a small groups that share the spoils of the competition amongst themselves. (Other primates essentially do the same thing). The theory hinges on the question of what happens when a group of people have access to essentially unlimited resources, but still have the competitive urge. Veblen's answer is that they simply compete amongst themselves to see who can afford to be the most wasteful (like the scene in that Woody Allen movie in which two guys start ripping up dollar bills to impress each other). He refers to such waste as \\"conspicuous consumption\\".According to Veblen, the urge to consume conspicuously explains a lot of human behavior, including fashion, sports, and religion. In all cases the consumer wants to demonstrate to his peers that he can't possibly be involved in doing anything useful. A particularly funny consequence of the urge to consume is the notion of \\"vicarious consumption,\\" in which really rich people acquire other people (essentially servants and wives) to do their consuming for them. To emphasize the point they dress up their vicarious consumers in preposterous outfits and require them to perform pointless tasks with high precision (think of a butler in a tuxedo serving a 12-course meal or some such).In this vein, anthropomorphic religions essentially worship the richest guy of all. God is imagined to be so rich that he sits on a throne all day while people in silly clothes (clergy) do nothing but tend to his fabulous mansions (churches). It's an intentionally funny image, although Veblen is careful to say that he's not poking fun at the spiritual aspects of religion, just the form in which modern humans choose to express them.An interesting subtheme is the alliance between the \\"leisure class\\" and the poor, something we see happening today in American politics. In Veblen's theory the alliance occurs because the two classes essentially share the same mindset (obsession with status).Overall the book is fun to read, except for the writing style, which is reminiscent of essays written by high school students who are studying for the SATs."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions (A Mentor book)","review":"This may not be a book to read for recreation, unless you like 1890s verbal locutions, but there are other reasons to read it. The emergence of the economic analysis of Western society might intrigue you. You might discover the origins of such still useful terms as 'leisure class' and 'conspicuous consumption,' among others. You might be curious about author Thorstein Veblen's status-conscious, anachronistic world of working men and idle wives, which reflects upper-class society in his day. Published in 1899, this is a classic in sociology and economic literature, although it is a veritable dreadnought of density. It discusses property, ownership, status and leisure in a turn-of-the-last-century American context. Though scholars call it a 'satire,' the book is neither witty nor ironic. Instead, it is a stolid analytical daguerreotype of a world long gone. We suggest that if you tackle Veblen's old-fashioned, slow-flowing prose, you should do it for the background you may glean and the scholarly satisfaction you may feel when you are done. Instead of Alexander Pope's, 'What oft was thought but ne'er so well expressed,' this book presents what oft was said and usually better, but not as early."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions (A Mentor book)","review":"This is one of the most thought provoking books I have read in a long time.

His theory of the leisure class reachs significance when compared to the rationality which some economists, classics and neo-classics, ascribe to the human being as an economic agent. I was quite surprised by the elegant style of Mr.Veblen and the fine irony (which he does not admit) with which he treats the rich and noble of his time.

It reduces the notion of society to a popularity contest in which fashion becomes the perfect expression of everyone's desire to be praised and noticed.

Herein (though not exclusively) we find Veblen supplying an alternative to Nietzsche, specifically *Beyond Good and Evil*. This is a book about morals, or the lack of them; but coming from a man who all-but-assaulted his estranged wife with &quot;notions&quot; one ought not to expect a rousing defense of bourgeois morality. Rather an unstinting defense of some other way of life (such as is provided in his impossibly rare *Instinct of Workmanship*) what we have here is a Grand-Guignol treatment of the &quot;life-lie&quot; Veblen calls conspicuous consumption, which just might happen to exclude Symbolist &quot;vitalism&quot; (and as to the provenance of the concept &quot;dolicho-blond&quot;, consult Veblen's essay on the American small town).

So it was with Einstien and theoretical physics, and so it is with economics and Thorstein Veblen as described in this book. Mr. Veblen descended from Norwegian immigrants to the US, and lived in the Midwest from the late 1800s to early 1900s. With a keen eye and insightful mind, he took in the huge economic growth of the US and the beginnings of mass consumerism and corporate advertising in the American population. What he saw was the formation of a middle and upper class that had both idle time and money to spare. Together, this created a leisure class that defined respect, social standing, and self-worth in terms of \\"pecuniary emulation\\", i.e. spending money on stuff and entertainment just because one could. Like a zoologist examining wild animals, Veblen picks apart the rituals, clothing, speech, and consumption habits of this newly rich. All of this is recorded and explained in extraordinary and sometimes comical detail in this book. Upon publication, this book became the first great work of economics by an American author, and made Veblen famous.

No doubt he did see ' social phenomenom' that were emerging and succeeded in finding the 'name ' for them. 'Leisure class' and ' conspicuous consumption' are part of the everyday vocabulary of the description and analysis of 'social life'. I know that Veblen was particularly hard upon the nouveau riche, those trying to prove by buying and having more that they were as good or better than ' old money'. However I wonder if in ' work ethic' America there is not also another kind of phenomenom, of people of great wealth feeling a special social obligation, as multibillionaires Gates and whether for good purposes or not, Ted Turner have displayed in recent years. I also have a problem with making the concept of ' leisure' an entirely pejorative one. What about those ' surpluses' at the state of the agricultural age which Lewis Mumford said were so key in creating civilization? Isn't it true that in many societies those who do not have to do productive work were freed for higher work of mind and spirit? I wonder then that is whether Veblen's condemnation of the 'leisure class ' is too ' blanket' a one in many ways. And this without denying the truths that great wealth often corrupts, leads to arrogance, and indolence, folly and waste. For years the conception of the US was of a society in which the middle class element was predominant, a society reflecting an equality of opportunity and the fact that the majority of people had been able to in time and through work raise themselves to a good level of life. The decline of the middle class in the sense of the growing gap between very rich and very poor is a fact of life in America. Perhaps this makes Veblen's analysis of a certain part of American society more pertinent. But again I think that there is a counter- tradition emerging in which many of the very wealthy assume that the way to real respect in the eyes of the public is in doing good for others."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions (A Mentor book)","review":"Conspicuous consumption describes the phenomenon of buying a product or service not for its utility or necessity but because of its prestige factor or impressive social value. Mr. Veblen's book is described as a satire, pointing out the hypocrisy and shallowness of the leisure or wealthy class. I am only partly through this book but I am finding it very thought provoking.If Mr. Veblen thought that consumption had a negative conspicuousness, indicative of a hypocritical nature among the wealthy of his day, I can only imagine what he would think of our entire culture today. It seems to me in our present society we have taken conspicuous consumption, beyond the hypocritical and the satirical and into the realm of the obnoxious, the immoral and even the criminal. This really isn't an economics book, nor would I say that it is scientific or academic in nature.It is more the thoughtful extrapolation of an intelligent, thoughtful and educated individual. Thorstein Veblen is more academic than Mark Twain and not quite as humorous. But he is very entertaining and extremely thought provoking. His style is much like Galbraith's - wordy, circular and humor so subtle that if you are not paying attention you could easily miss it. I am enjoying this book.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions (A Mentor book)","review":"I have found it quite amusing to read Veblen's book is depicted as a classic by those who like it (you know, considering that he, more than once, states that the appeal of classics is due largely to the leisure class scheme). Perhaps the unique, brilliant, at times repetitive and dull, at times invariably amusing, and always surprising tone and ideas Veblen has made their indelible mark, but I think that perhaps he would have said that those who admire his book solely as a classic cannot properly understand its message.From his anthropological analysis of the rise of the predatory and peaceable instincts to his ridicule of contemporary (ca. 1900) institutions and customs (I think his theories on clothing apparel, sports, and religion stand out) to his very serious critique of waste and exploit, Veblen wrote an incredibly interesting, unconventional theory. Undoubtedly, to my apprehension, direct and vicarious conspicuous waste (the most famous variant being direct conspicuous consumption) is the most interesting concept presented in the book, yet this is exclusively associated with the rich and what they do. No doubt, the rich's excesses must have been what prompted Veblen to write the book in the first place, but I think the more universal message is overlooked. He repeats this over and over: the leisure class scheme of life pervades society.I do not know if those who appreciate the book see that Veblen makes the case that conspicuous waste is EVERYWHERE. Those who command the scheme are those who we might identify to be the rich, sure, but how can we deny we are not all part of it? Veblen says that \\"any consumer who might, Diogenes-like, insist on the elimination of all honorific or wasteful elements from his consumption, would be unable to supply his most trivial wants in the modern market.\\" To him, I am sure, stripes on a shirt would have seemed wasteful, and a regrettable vestige of some eccentric attempt at invidious pecuniary emulation. Veblen's notion of waste is constructed to be universal, but in varying gradations (which is why he identifies waste most prominently with the leisure class).All this being said, Veblen is quite far from being perfect. The book does consider that there are motives and actions that are not guided by the leisure class' predatory instinct, but is at times vague in dealing with such things. Moreover, some of his explanations are on occasion convoluted or simplified so as to make them fit his general framework. Notwithstanding, anyone who has any interest in reading a great theory about how the rich ultimately dictate many of society's customs and institutions by inciting the lesser instincts that make consumerism possible, or in being amused by a sardonic critique of how wasteful our society can be, should turn to this book.A word of caution: To make a point, Veblen uses a language that would be today considered tedious and cumbersome, perhaps needless and excessively verbose at times, so be ready to deal with that. (I think that, unless pointed out, the fact that it is inferable that Veblen does this to make a point might go unnoticed. At the end of the book he states that usage of proper, preferably archaic language is observed precisely because it is useful and not up to date; this language is preferred because they \\"argue waste of time and exemption from the use and the need of direct and forcible speech.\\" The way in which he writes his book is the last, perhaps most subtle, sardonic bit of satire he offers us.)"},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class;: An economic study of institutions (A Mentor book)","review":"Some of the most influential and important studies of America and American life have been authored by visitors from other lands. One such example is this political study of economic man, The Theory of the Leisure Class. Authored by Thorstein Veblen, an immigrant from Scandinavia who settled in the Eastern US, this book examines the behavior of the rich and wanna-be rich in the US at the end of the 19th century.Defining the growing upper class of Americans who owned land, dressed nicely, showered daily and read the latest gossip as the \\"leisure class\\", Veblen proceeds to dissect their behaviors and actions and its causes and effects. The author shows how much of this behavior had no practical economic benefit, but instead served to advertise social success instead. As such, this is one of the first major works to apply Darwinian thought to social evolution and human behavior. Terms such as conspicious consumption and consumerism would spring forth from this book and those that followed in its wake.The book itself is quite easy to read for an economics treatise. Few are the numbers, fewer are the equations. Instead the reader gets wit, sarcasm, and lots of dry humor as the author recounts episodes of rich people acting dumb in the name of showing of their wealth status.

Turns out the guy was from Wisconsin, not Sweden, and that he was a master satirist, not an economist or sociologist, and that he died in 1929 at the ripe old age of 72. He gets a special award for using the word &quot;honorific&quot; over and over, and another commendation for making breathtakingly sweeping generalizations about human history and social development, and about contemporary (circa early 1900s) industrial relationships with ZERO (!) reference to data, and a dismissal of any need for any empirical verification of his conclusions. The conclusions themselves loop around themselves like a biplane seriously out of control, and in the end this mainly entertains. And in the propwash, we get new terms that have joined the English language: Conspicuous consumption, conspicuous waste, canons of respectability, and even skiing terms like &quot;traverse&quot; which could also, in our &quot;post-predatory&quot; culture, be a legal term from common law pleading.

And that it was exquisite in scholarship, writing style, and detail. Wrong.Thorstein Veblen - 1857-1929 - and I only checked these details after reading this book - was one of many children of Norwegian immigrants into the USA. They were, or may have been, ripped off, though his father seems to have made money afterwards - I'd guess via a gift of land from the US governement, though if so he seems to have been ungrateful. 'The Theory of the Leisure Class', published in 1899 when he was about 42, caused a stir - or at least that's the story. It precedes Ida Tarbell on Standard Oil by a couple of years.Veblen's writing style is agonisingly plodding, repetitive and dull. He includes a few Latin and other tags. This must have been a deliberate attempt to project an educated image. He took time to explain his use of some English terms (e.g. 'invidious'). Part of his effect is achieved by using words in slightly the wrong sense. He used 'evolution' rather than 'change' - it sounded more up to date. His typescript (or MS) must have been the sort publishers' readers dreaded. I can't quote a sample here for space reasons.----His model of human history is very simple indeed. There *WERE* two types of people and societies:[1] The sedentary village, low on force and fraud. He calls this 'quasi-peaceful'. There's a law of status. (pp 215 & 236). 'Savages' (undefined) have this sort of lifestyle.[2] Barbarians, who hate manual work, and prefer 'exploits'. They are ferocious, self-seeking, clannish, disingenuous. They like hunting. A predatory type. Veblen often calls them 'peace-distubing dolicho-blonds'. (He himself had very dark hair - remember Norway and Sweden separated at about this time.)---------However, *NOW* (about 1900) there is industry.[3] Veblen takes progress as given: 'as populations grow denser..', '.. stage of society..', '.. as the community advances in wealth and culture', are typical phrases. These days, the collective interests of modern industry work against the ferocious or selfish aristocrat type (p 227).4] There is a 'hierarchical gradation of reputability. Ownership on a large scale [is]... the most reputable of economic interests. [then] banking .. law.. the lawyer is exclusively occupied with the details of predatory fraud..' (p.231).-----------Veblen means by the 'Leisure Class' property and company owners, financiers, bankers, lawyers. In other words, anyone not concerned with direct manufacturing. Much of his book is concerned with the way they spend or waste money, and the way other people attempt to follow or imitate their behaviour.What is of value in Veblen?I have to say I was struck by the small number of piquant examples of oddities in spending and consumption; I'd expected more. Dogs as useless deferential mouths to feed; clean clothes uncontaimnated by evidence of work; William Morris's Kelmscott Press. Of men - walking stick, and powdered wig (from Alexander Pope?) On women, bodices, bound feet in China, and general feebleness, were signs of wealth in the husband. He has an odd passage about public parks - men keep the grass tidy, and this is an example of conspicuous consumption, because they are more expensive than cows.He doesn't seem to know about Chinese mandarins' fingernails, British sumptuary laws, rose gardens and knot gardens and huge country houses as statements of things which are attractive, but unnecessary. He doesn't know about follies, or for example the Hell Fire Club and the Parthenon, both of which in their ways offered employment. Moreover he doesn't seem to understand the economics: a US department store would not stock very cheap items - there's not enough money in them and will reduce other sales. They will cater preferentially for richer custiomers - and offer, say, sherry, wine, champagne, brandy and other glasses, just to make more money. Veblen's examples are a mostly natural outcome of normal economics. As further evidence, consider that, if Veblen was right, any conspicuous waste might happen: burning of notes, buying of things just to destroy them.As to the 'leisure class', Veblen, surprisingly, barely considers inherited wealth. New England had many sons and daughters waiting to inherit and the 'leisure class' would seem to fit them perfectly. But Veblen concentrates on other targets. Like Marx, he assumes factory owners just sit back and collect loot - he doesn't seem to realise such people *may* work extremely hard. Similarly, many younger sons of British wealthy families went off to die in various white man's grave parts of the world. For that matter, the 'wolfish earls' in 'Shakespeare' weren't exactly leisurely.Veblen comes across as a man who moved directly from a peasant society into a much more technologically advanced one. (This must be common now, with uncontrolled mass third world immigration into some modern societies.) It's not surprising such people gawp, and feel fear, and boost their egos with cautious contempt. But I don't think ultimately this book delivers very much."},{"Title":"I Had a Dream: Book of Poems and Lyrics","review":"I love this book!

Or, does this sound possibly arrogant and blasphemous? Well it is not!Mr. Murphy's books are far from being sacrilegious (as some conservative critics suggest); they are are beautifully doxological and deeply empowering.There are so many wonderful teaching points in this book I will try to outline a few of the most thought-provoking ones:1) We answer our own prayers through turning to the spiritual power within us all; when you understand that whatever you consciously believe is true is brought to pass through the power of the subconscious mind, you can take all of the guess work out of prayer2) God is not some old guy in the sky that will punish you if you are bad or with whom you can bargain or that requires you to sacrifice the wholesome things in life you desire. As JM teaches, the only thing any of us \\"owe\\" God is , \\"recognition, praise and thanksgiving\\".3) The meaning of the word \\"Christ\\" is actually a title meaning the anointed one. In fact, when we are able to fully comprehend and apply the truth that thoughts are things and whatever we feel to be true is expressed in our life (pg. 237) we gain access to the priceless wisdom of Jesus' (and other great prophets') teachings.This is a book for a person who firmly believes in a spiritual, nonphysical higher power but whose good common sense has led him/her to question literal interpretations of the Bible and has heretofore been left disillusioned with traditional religious teachings.A good test of the efficacy of any theory is the impact it has on one's life. I am a firm believer that anyone who applies the spiritual truths that are simple yet power and described in this work (as well as several other works of the author) shall see for themselves.I also recommend reading this book along side the author's most popular work, \\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind\\". I am writing this view because as JM teaches, whatever you think and feel you create. I feel fortunate to have been led to his teachings and I am writing this review to encourage others interested in the fundamental truths of life to read and profit from his works as well. This is not altruism therefore, but a way to create more experiences in my life that lead to me feeling more grateful and fortunate (smiles).The only thing more I might add is that when you see the tangible results of applying the principles in this book, you share the knowledge with others."},{"Title":"Within You Is the Power","review":"I absolutely adore this little volume of essays by Joseph Murphy.

It is a constant rehashing of the same basic principles over and over again.But here's the thing, are you really living the principles? Are you consciously and deliberately applying them to your life? For the 1,546,987nth time you have heard the statement, \\"God is Love...\\" Do you go, \\"Yeah...yeah...yawn...big friggin' deal...heard that before...so what?\\" Or are you almost in tears with awe and joy, \\"God is Love? Oh, my...you mean I don't have to buy into fear? You mean there is no hell outside of the one I create and even that one isn't real? You mean God loves me? Me? This person who has done so many vile and shameful and regrettable things? God loves me that God is willing to create me new in each and every moment?\\"I don't know about you but that humbles me...it doesn't debase me...it humbles me and leaves me in absolute awe and amazement that the One Life decided to create me in Its Image and Likeness. I am truly blessed to be who I am.This book will leave you with a fresh sense of wonder and amazement. Take an essay and work with it for a week. Try to consciously and deliberately apply the principles. Try to realize at least 1,000 times a day that you are an expression, an extension, an experience of God's Love, God's Life, God's Laughter, God's Light. When you are about to be swallowed up by appearances, when you are just about to think that life is worthless and everyone is against you, try...just try to remember, \\"If God is for me, who could be against me?\\" or \\"Perfect Love casts out ALL fear...\\"There is NOTHING new under the sun and there never will be because Truth is older than the stars and yet in a blink of an eye it is always new. We must constantly make room for Truth and let the Christ be born in a manger of humility and awe and amazement that we are so very blessed in all ways.Joseph Murphy blessed the world with his insights into life and wherever Mr. Murphy is now I'm sure he is doing great and better things.May you shine brightly today."},{"Title":"Within You Is the Power","review":"Dr. Joseph Murphy was a great teacher, lecturer and minister of truths that can change your life.

These lectures are lucid and insightful if a little repetitive. Luther reads Genesis as a true history and often is using his imagination to fill in gaps for his students. Noah and Abraham are presented as preachers who were despised by their neighbors but beloved by God for their adherence to the true faith. Luther's exegetical method is to read the Biblical stories as guides and view the characters as examples. Luther imaginitively reads his own personal experience very deeply in the Biblical texts. But despite this, and Luther's propensity to make claims which can be disturbing, Luther remains an indispensible teacher of how to distinguish what is useful from what is frivolous in the Bible.

Although their presence on American shore presumably began long years before the coming of Columbus, the presence of Muslim in the American public square has only been perceived in the last 50 years. A number of major literatures such as The Muslim of America (1991) edited by Yvonne Y. Haddad, Islam in America: A Sourcebook (1992) edited by Kszegi, Michael A. and J. Gordon Melton, Muslims on the Americanization Path? (1998) edited by Yvonne Y. Haddad and John L. Esposito, Sulayman S. Nyang's Islam in the United States of America (1999), or Jane I. Smith's Islam in America (1999) have explained various aspects of Muslims in America, from the history of the coming of Muslims, to the contemporary issues of theology and the social and political aspirations of Muslims. The research on the topic of Muslim communities itself has became urgent particularly after the unprecedented 9/11 tragedy that impacted not only Muslims and American society in general, but also the whole Muslim world. The questions around hope, fear, and the aspirations of Muslims have been necessary to explain the massive changes in demography and the social circumstance of Muslims in the past few years. This is exactly the purpose of the publication of the book Muslims' Place in the American Public Square; Hope, Fear, and Aspirations (2004).The book, which is edited by Zahid H. Bukhari, Sulayman S. Nyang, Mumtaz Ahmad, and John L. Esposito, is an anthology of research conducted by fourteen scholars from various backgrounds and institutions sponsored by The Project MAPS (Muslims in American Public Square), the research project that is based at the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (CMCU), at Georgetown University, in Washington, DC. The authors of this book, all of them expert in Islamic studies and Muslim society, portray their perspective not only in terms of theoretical analysis but also in critical reflection. As it is also addressed as an effort to synthesize the bulk of literature published by Muslims and non-Muslims, this book has been challenging to read. This is one of the reasons why this book is significant to the on going study of Islam and Muslim societies. In other words, what the authors have expressed in this book is another stage of the development of American Muslim studies, adding up all the efforts and tasks that have been completed by previous literature.The first part of this book, which seems to be the primary message of the book, is addressed to explain the theoretical perspective of Muslims living in America. Four authors, Taha Jabir Al-Alwani, Omar Khalidi, Aminah Beverly McCloud, and M.A. Muqtedar Khan, share their views on how Muslims should live and address their aspirations in the American public square. Taha Jabir Al-Alwani, with his deep experience as a mufti and the president of the Fiqh Council of North America, proposed an idea that Muslims must create new ijtihad (independent reasoning), so that all the basic ethics and theology of Islam may be relevant to the current condition of Muslims. There is no doubt that American Muslims have found themselves under conditions and circumstances that are radically different from what existed at the time of the Prophet and from all the contemporary Muslim societies outside the country. What becomes a demand today is how to resolve the gap between the traditional formulation of Islamic theology and law and the current circumstances of Muslim communities living in America. In answering that question, Al-Alwani describes methodological principles of studying Al-Qur'an that may assist Muslims to understand the exact purpose of the Al-Qur'an. For Al-Alwani, the lives of Muslims as minorities need a new development of fiqh that is fully aware of their environment and their cultural and social surrounding. Al-Alwani does not agree with the reproduction of old fatwa in contemporary language or of using current vernacular. Instead, what is necessary for Muslims today is \\"original interpretations that respond to the problem of minorities in a way that is free of the negative effects that are usually associated with the fiqh of expediency or crises\\" (33).The more specific explanation of Muslims living in a pluralistic society is stated by Omar Khalidi. He elaborates the experience of Muslims living in certain areas such as Spain, India, Russia and the Balkans. After reviewing the classical thought of Islam and Muslim society from various scholars, he comes to the conclusion that Muslims can and should be able to live in harmony with predominantly non-Muslim environments. The old distinction of the land between dar al-Islam and dar al-hard, or the realms of peace and the realms of war, is no longer acceptable, for both are relative in its usage. Thus, in the context of Muslims in America today, there would be no other choice for Muslims except to live peacefully anywhere they have chosen to live in this country. Implicitly, Khalidi states that whatever the situation faced by Muslims, this country is much better to live in, given the unfortunate situation in almost the entire Muslim world today. To Khalidi, the next agenda that Muslims should be aware of is how to formulate their participation and their political program. The fact that American Muslims are diverse in ethnic and national background may, of course, make the task difficult. For this situation, Muslims should struggle in finding a balance between the necessity of their participation on the national agenda and their specific communal issues or local interests.Aminah Beverly McCloud and M.A. Muqtedar Khan, who write the two articles in the last part of the first topic, explore the problem of Muslim immigrants and their new environment in the United States. Restating the main idea of the first two chapters, McCloud urges that Muslims must engage in and involve themselves in their American communities, and at the same time put aside the different self-concerns of each Muslim community. McCloud reminds the leader that the long concern of Muslim immigrants toward their old countries is an unfinished passion, and useless, an activity that separates them from American community. Furthermore, she also argues that failure to understand their new community may create problems, and as a result, they might be considered ineffective citizens in this country.The very question of how to be effective citizens is exactly what Muqtedar Khan means by defining a so-called \`American Muslim identity.' Looking back to the classical antagonism of Samuel Huntington's clash of civilizations, Khan actually wants to build a new consciousness that Muslims in America are not the same condition as Muslims outside the Western world. Muslims living in America are American Muslims who definitely share the same faith with all fellows Muslims (Muslim ummah) but more focus on building community inside America. Khan explains that there are two images of America in Muslim minds today: \\"America the democracy,\\" and \\"America the colonial power.\\" Khan himself, to the best of my knowledge from reading his articles, seems to promote the first image. He is one among Muslims who considers America as their homeland. However, he also does not deny the fact that there is a group of Muslims who reject the idea of assimilation of Muslims into American society. He also laments that this group of Muslims has spent huge energy on harassing their fellow Muslims who try to bridge the gap between Islam and the West. Khan questions, \\"What does it mean to have a balanced view of the West? It means that we do not throw out the baby with the bath water\\" (108). Moreover, he argues; \\"Because Muslims are upset that the U.S. has chosen to be friends with Israel and not with the Arabs, just because the U.S. has committed crimes against Iraqi children, we must not reject democracy, human right, respect for freedom, and the rule of law\\" (108). It is time for Muslims to stop their uncritical prejudices toward America. Instead, Khan argues, American Muslims today should become \`the first hand' in interpreting what the West really is and should not support the opinion of the old divergence between Islam and the West made by the Muslims who have no experience living in American society.Another helpful part of this book is the study of Christian and American Muslim relation written by Jane I. Smith in chapter 7. Her well-known expertise on Christians-Muslims encounters has made this book rich with reflections on the subject. Smith concisely explores models of dialog or engagement that have characterized Christian-American Muslim relations. One model that she mentions in her explanation is \\"the theological exchange model,\\" the model that is feared by some Muslims as another effort of Christian evangelization of Muslims. Although many Muslim leaders tend to avoid it, this model is important given the fact that both Christians and Muslims still do not know the elements of others' faith. Muzammil Siddiqi, the former president of the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) is one of those who support this model. Another fascinating type of encounter between Muslims and Christians is \\"the ethical exchange model.\\" The advocates of this model, most notably Ismail al-Faruqi, believe that the arena for discussion between Muslims and Christians is not theology but ethics. The proponents of this model are convinced that Muslims and Christians can provide the common solution of various ethical problems that haunt American society. In brief, Smith mentions that there is no question that most Muslims who have chosen to participate in dialog have found it beneficial. However, she also explores several crucial problems of which Muslims should be aware. Despite the fact that many Muslims still continue to suspect that Christians have an agenda of converting them away from Islam, Muslims do not seem to have developed a conceptual framework for dialog. Quoting Imam Ahmad Chebli, with whom she corresponded, Smith writes \\"up to today we do not have any by-laws or constitution or guidelines for dialog. We just come together and decide to talk about this and that\\" (178). In addition, another problem comes up because of the lack of understanding among various Muslim communities, and as a result, \\"many Muslims are concerned that the dialogue is dominated by particular groups of Muslims\\" (180). The complex disparity between Muslims from South Asia, Arabs, and African American, Sunni and Shia, has forced the process of dialog to be sensitive to the different perspectives among Muslims, which is actually a good thing. However, this situation often creates another problem, as she notes, referring to Sheikh Ibrahim Nejm, \\"when immigrant and African American Muslims participate together in a dialog session, it often turns into a debate rather than a dialogue, or more specifically a subdebate within the overall conversation\\" (182). Over all, although Smith does not come up with a new idea for the development of interfaith dialog, her reflections in this book may become advantageous in directing where American Muslims must address their concerns and aspirations.What is also distinctive in the study of American Muslims is the relation of Islam to the Black experience that has become an inseparable experience of African American Muslims. In explaining the complex experience of African American Muslims, this book elucidates the matters broadly in the third part, where three scholars from three different backgrounds combine their arguments. One of the scholars, Sherman A. Jackson, an African American Muslim, describes Islam among African Americans and argues that Black religion has a central influence on the heart of African American Muslims. Black religion is the instrument in which the religious message of justice and equality is combined with the radical opposition to racial oppression as the ruin of slavery. This is the exceptional situation that has characterized African American Muslims, when compared to all immigrant Muslims from all over the world. Jackson also notes the general admiration for Noble Drew Ali and Elijah Muhammad who, he argues, rendered a \`psychological space' through which millions of African American would later convert, or specifically, \`reinvented' Islam, this despite the fact that the majority of Muslims would not consider Drew Ali and Elijah Muhammad as preaching the mainstream Islam. Had the Islam introduced to the African American been \`the mainstream immigrant' Islam from which the Black oppressed experience was absent, the African American would probably not have been interested in it.The last part of this book that may lift up its value and make it required reading not only for students, policy makers, or journalists, but also for Muslim leaders is written by Ilyas Ba-Yunus and Kassim Kone. In their research, the two authors questioned the existing literature of demography of American Muslims conducted by previous researchers. What they found and present in this book is fresh data on the social composition of Muslim communities and where they primarily live. They estimate that those of Arab origin are the largest group of Muslims in America, followed by those of African American and South Asian origin. Another smaller composition of Muslims varies among Muslims from Turkey, the Balkans, Indonesia, and Iran. In recent years, they also describe, Muslims are not only living in metropolitan areas such as New York City and Detroit, but are starting to spread into smaller towns and suburban areas. This situation confirms that American Muslims are not only crowding into the corners of metropolitan areas, but are also showing a growing interest in acquiring more professional jobs across the country.At the end of this book, Ihsan Bagby and Iqbal J. Unus, who conducted research on the presence of mosques and Muslim community organizations, conclude that the past majority of American Muslims have already become involved and have fully participated in the American public square and social activities. Iqbal J. Unus, who specifically focuses on the role of Muslims organization, states that the presence of Muslims in community organizations, including the leadership structure of the mosque, has changed what was the traditional organization. Muslim community organizations have transformed their instruments of decision making from unstructured systems to more transparent and accountable organizations, where membership and leadership are more structured.Having explained the content of the Muslims' Place in the American Public Square, it can be concluded that this book has shown how far Muslims have come in playing their role and in forming their identity in the plurality of American Society. As in the foregoing paragraph stated by the authors, the problems and responsibilities of Muslims still need more attention, ranging from the need to explore fiqh or theology of Islam in the context of American society and to grapple with the problem of divergence of Muslim communities, to the need to build a new identity for Muslims living in America. This book has also shown another major fact that Muslims can live and participate in the public square of a secular democratic country without sacrificing their faith as Muslims. Instead, the freedom of religion that is guaranteed by the Constitution has helped Muslim communities and all their religious institutions to flourish, a situation that is far better than what Muslims have experienced in the undemocratic regimes in their old countries. Last of all, this book is necessary, not only for Muslims living in America and the Western countries, but also for Muslims all over the world. What the book has shown is a sincere reflection for all Muslims living in the Muslim world to learn from their fellows living in the West."},{"Title":"Releasing God's Power Through Laying on Hands","review":"This book gives insight to the foundational doctrine of the laying on of hands (Heb 6:1-2).

The author's purpose in this anthology is best described in one of her own poems , &quot;I'd like to tell you about life/ the life of death...I'll tell you about immortal love/ which is sacrificed out of the horizons of hope...&quot; (60)."},{"Title":"Litrosi Lismonias","review":"A continuous love poem full of tendernes and a vibrant enthusiasm that keeps the flame lit up to he last page"},{"Title":"Litrosi Lismonias","review":"A continuous love poem, full of tendernes and a vibrant enthusiasm that keeps the flame lit up to the last page."},{"Title":"Litrosi Lismonias","review":"The poerty contained within these pages makes one reflect on all aspects of human life. Reading this book was truly a pleasurable experience and I would highly recommend it to a friend. I feel this book is an inspirational asset to everyone searching for meaning in life."},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"I am inclined to agree with the other reviewers on the site about the merit of this book. It is very good, rivalling if not surpassing Linda Lee's account of her husband's life. As another reviewer has indicated the reason for this is that Thomas hasn't just recounted the tale of Bruce Lee's life per se but examined in quite some depth the spiritual and psychological motivations which led him to live the way he did. The biography has a special dimension which moves the reader into the actual reality Bruce experienced. I was affected greatly by the empathy Thomas has for Lee, which at times is so compelling, especially in the narration of the events leading up to Lee's death, that I was pressed to tears. There are few books which have such impact."},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"Thomas demonstrates a deep understanding of and empathy for Lee, and gives a great insight into the way he lived. Rather than just cataloging the events of his life, this book goes alot deeper and you certainly come away with as good an idea of what made Bruce Lee tick as you are likely to find anywhere. If you are a Bruce Lee fan, buy this book. You will definately not regret it."},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"This is the best biography of Bruce Lee that I have ever read. It is not a pictorial perspective of the man but gives the most detailed account of his extraordinary life. It is the first book which has documented the relationship between Joe Lewis and Bruce Lee with an example of a kickboxing match (Joe Lewis vs. Greg Baines). Well done."},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"When one comes across a biography purporting to be about the late, great Bruce Lee, one must ask oneself: \\"why is the author writing a book on this man?\\". If you conclude that he has something to gain, say, by revising a history of which he was a part, then you should probably steer clear of such a book. Thankfully, the author Bruce Thomas was not a part of Bruce Lee's life and so he has no vested interest in rewriting this now-legendary past. Rather, in his book, Thomas tells us a little about each important phase of Lee's life: his boyhood in Hong Kong, streetfightin' teenage years, emigration to Seattle, development of his evolving art and philosophy of Jeet Kune Do, struggles breaking into the film business, and eventual mass recognition and appeal as an international celebrity. The book also chronicles Lee's last days, shedding light on his recent out of character behavior (drug abuse, adultery) with brief but insightful speculation regarding what could have killed him. Unlike other books, in Fighting Spirit, Thomas is very respectful of Bruce's memory, yet he does not get caught up in hero worship. The facts are presented as is, with the implicit assumption that the reader is intelligent enough to make what he or she will of them without any embellishment whatsoever on the author's part. This is, to my mind, the best biography in publication on Bruce Lee."},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"I, like most guys who grew up in the 70's, was and am a huge Bruce fan, and I've read just about everything ever written about him. I agree with other reviewers in that this bio is the most informative and heartfelt account of Bruces' life, written by a musician by the way! Bruce Thomas does an excellent job conveying to the reader his views on what made Bruce Lee such an electrifying human being, without it being blind hero worship. Bruce's supreme confidence and his normal human fears are explored. For fans like myself who are interested in Bruce's extraordinary martial arts abilities, Mr.Thomas delves into this aspect better than it's ever been done! Just the BEST Bruce Lee book you can get - get it and \\"Be WATER my friend\\"."},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"This book tries to convey a more human Bruce Lee. It includes his triumphs and his mistakes and allows the reader to judge what kind of man Bruce Lee was. While not everything in this book can be verified as truth Bruce Lee's life is portrayed in a respectful but in my opinion honest manner. I must point out again that the so called facts in this book have not been verified but it what is told here seems to correlate well with what I have been told by meeting and training with people who knew and trained with Bruce. My only complaint is the authors obvious bias for chinese martial arts. He claims to be a Wing Chun Gung Fu student and in certain parts of the book it becomes clear that he feels that this method is superior to others. However this is still a good read and the author is not obnoxious with his opinions"},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"When I was about 15, I was not a reader. I bought this book because I loved Bruce Lee, and everything about Bruce Lee would be in my buying range. I finished the book in 2 days! Excellent book with information you won't find anywhere else!5/5"},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"Very detailed, very insightful, most interesting of all the books on Bruce Lee's life. A must-read for anyone who wants to know (or know more) about Bruce Lee."},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"This is an extraordinary and compulsively readable work. Thomas is obviously an admirer of Lee, but refrains from hero-worshipping. He is a practising martial artist himself and well-versed in the philosophies behind the fighting arts, which means that he is able to write authoritatively about his subject. I believe that this book furnishes one with admiration, respect and compassion for Bruce Lee and his legacy. I recommend this book with all my heart"},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"First off. i want to say that fighting spirit made me realize how special jeet kune do is. Bruce Lee fighting spirit not only covers the greatness of Bruce Lees life but also covers bruce lees spiritual makeup and how he reached his full potential as a martial artist on a philosoghical level.This book too can give you a piece of bruce lees energy and give you the inspiration to achieve your goals in life.On the spiritual level, its very deep as well.Ill say a two significent quotes from the book. \\" Though the martial artist perishes , he will embody a spirit that will not die.\\" \\"What we need now is something far more extraordinary, what we need now is tho share the same insights and understandings the lie at the heart of Bruce Lees experience.\\" If i could publish a list on the internet for one of the best bruce lee books of all time, this would be the book. Also , if you seek to use martial arts as a vechicle for self-awareness or to understand life on a spiritual level, its this book."},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"Nice overview of his life. Also some decent martial arts info, but mostly from the mental side. Decent concepts to apply to life/coaching."},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"A good biography that tells the story of Bruce Lee and the development of his martial art Jeet Kune Do. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the excessive number of grammatical errors in the book."},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"Of all the many books I have read on Bruce Lee I think this biography is far and away the best. The previous reviewer reflected my thought exactly, that the author, Bruce Thomas, is &quot;respectful but not caught up in hero worship&quot;. I would add that this is the only Bruce Lee book I have read that manages to walk that line. Bruce Thomas clearly has a personality and spirituality that is mature enough to have captured and integrated the essence of Bruce Lee. The biography is well-researched and detailed but this is more than a biography...it is a great book."},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"This is far from an official biography. It has not the endorsement of Linda Lee, and it also lacks interviews with some key member of Bruce's life. Also, the excuse given for the total lack of photos was not convincing at all.But you will soon forgive the author for these minor flaws, because once you begin to read this book you will not stop it. Bruce Thomas, a bass player with Elvis Costello's band, writes with passion, but without bias. He tries to be objective all the times, including the \\"conspiracy theories\\" surrounding Bruce's death.This book has a serius side effect: after reading it, you will not watch ever again the movie DRAGON (1993). Although Jason Scott Lee gave a great performance, it is clear that the movie was a total absurd, it's amazing how Linda Lee gave her support to it."},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"In a recent article for The Daily Mirror Tony Parson's wrote that \\"not all the Chinese have a stake in the country's new found prosperity but every single one of them has a stake in the Beijing Olympics\\". A cursory glance in the year-view mirror reminds us that, up until these last few post-empire decades, the Chinese, viewed through these now dimming lens of colonialism, were rendered a nation of waiters, laundry workers and villains; so it's hardly surprising that this global scale event should be embraced so passionately with a view of saying to the world \\"Look how far we've come.\\" But the true genesis of this particular brand of pan-cultural re-calibration had already taken place back in 1971 with a movie called Tang Shan Da Xiong (The Big Boss) and an actor called Bruce Lee.To describe Lee as a cultural phenomenon is an understatement and inevitably legends are built on myths which grow more fantastic with every telling. His four completed works defined martial arts movies for all time and his unfinished opus Game of Death is basically the template for computer gaming which now, of course, informs much of modern action movie making; add \`visionary innovator' to Lee's curriculum vitae.This oft maligned icon has suffered much in death but has been redeemed somewhat by the sober and highly respectful biography \`Fighting Spirit' from Bruce Thomas who is perhaps better known as the geeky and underrated bass player with Elvis Costello's Attractions. Thomas, as it turns out, is also a disciple of Lee's own fluid style of Kung Fu known as Jeet Kun Do (Way of the Intercepting fist) - clearly not a geek to be messed with.Thomas' Fighting Spirit is the story of Siu Lung (Little Dragon) and his metamorphosis from child actor to teenage hoodlum; from martial artist to international superstar and media martyrdom at thirty two. It deals extensively with Lee's personal philosophy and the constant evolution of his art - and on reading Fighting Spirit you do come to appreciate that beyond the \`chop socky' conventions of the movies which defines the form - Kung Fu is indeed an art.Chapters examining Lee's philosophy inevitably verge into \`ah Grasshopper' territory; \\"Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water my friend.\\" But much of Lee's impish humour comes through with the no less insightful \\"A punch in the mouth is a punch in the mouth.\\"As much as that now iconic image back in \`89 of a lone student hindering the progress of a tank in Tinneman Square, the mise-en-scene that we most associate with China is Bruce Lee streaked with blood in a hall of mirrors from Enter the Dragon. As the political sturm und drang of the Tibetan conflict threaten to engulf the event, Parson's assertion that Olympiad 2008 is a demonstration of national pride and a chance to say to the world \\"You can't look down on us anymore\\" - the fact of the matter is - the world hasn't looked down on China since Bruce Lee."},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"I am a martial artist of the Wing Chun style, and Bruce Lee has been a life long hero of mine. This book by Bruce thomas i enjoyed very much. He tells everything one need know of their martial arts hero. Since the author wasnt a personal friend of Master Lee, the book isnt as intimate as Linda Lees' portrait, or the brief articles of Bruce written by Master Wong shun leung. Still, its a very entertaining read and quickly paced. It chronicles Bruce's entire life, from birth to death. check it out."},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"I got an absolutely massive insight into the life of the worlds greatest martial artist revered by millions!

There is much detail here on Bruce's disillusionment with fame, and also his health problems -- stunning to learn that he was taking back-pain injections while filming Big Boss, and had even sprained his ankle at one point. And the unpleasant details of the Enter the Dragon shoot were also somewhat shocking, especially the scriptwriter's obnoxious plan to make Bruce say the letter 'R' as much as possible. There is a lot of text on Bruce's early struggles, and then a way-too-quick zip through his first two movies.But in some ways, this book falls in with the other Bruce Lee tributes. The author is a kung fu practicioner, and as such takes almost all pronouncements of Eastern-thinking or Chinese superstition as having complete validity -- so, for example, you'll be intellectually face-to-face with someone who is describing &quot;chi&quot; as if it actually physically exisits, as lungs do. So he hasn't the sceptic's eye for really talking about martial arts in an objective way, but this won't bother a lot of folks."},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"A good book and a plesant reading by a good writer. There's not so much new information in this book, but it puts facts in perspective a gives a good general body of information for those wishing to begin to learn about Bruce Lee's life. And what a life...Like Bon Scott of AC/DC, for example, Bruce died when he was starting to reach his full potential in movies. It was a shame."},{"Title":"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit","review":"Its a mmmhuh book alright, its about Bruce and his life, very interesting, learn a lot about him and his life.

There's a checklist of all birds at the back of the book and I've enjoyed checking off the birds that I've seen.

The birds are separated by color so it's very easy to look up one just seen in the yard. A good buy that we'll be using for years!!"},{"Title":"Birds of Georgia Field Guide","review":"This is not a real book, and it is not good for identification purposes. It is simply a \\"recipe\\" collection of very generic, somewhat outdated \\"species accounts\\" which are packaged by the state. It is a money making scheme. If you want a field guide, get Sibley, Kaufman, Peterson, American Bird Conservancy... there are so many good ones. Skip this.As another drawback, this uses photography, rather than artwork. Photographs are well-known to be poor for ID purposes. Kaufman is the only photo guide that comes close to usable."},{"Title":"Birds of Georgia Field Guide","review":"This book fits in your pocket, is well organized and has great pictures to help identify that bird in your back yard.

For years I have battled against books that just don't work the way my mind does.This book is a fantastic and simple way to identify bird by color and size, and using it has not only brought the pleasure of identifying the bird, but has also improved my own observation of the birds I'm looking at.For example, initially I might have just noted, say, a 'brown bird with a black bit on it' - and might find that the a couple of options might potentially match (I'd have to look again at the bird to confirm which one it was). After a while using the book, I now find myself looking for the kinds of information that I know will come up in the descriptions - perhaps the chest color, eye color, size and color of the bill, and so on.This book has given me and my family a huge amount of pleasure. Top job, Mr Tekiela."},{"Title":"Birds of Georgia Field Guide","review":"I've owned this book over a year and have yet to find a bird in Georgia that isn't listed. I should probably move up to larger book, if I had one complaint (small one or I would deduct a star) is I wish that every bird mentioned in this book had multiple views, sometimes when I'm watching I'm unable to get the same view as the book is showing and I'm left reading the descriptions of the suspected bird for both male and female. With that said some birds do have multiple views (including male, female, and juvenile if they're different) but not all birds.Overall I love the book and would highly recommend it for any individual in Georgia that's looking to get into bird watching."},{"Title":"Birds of Georgia Field Guide","review":"this is a great field guide!

This is the best birding book I own for identifying GA birds."},{"Title":"Birds of Georgia Field Guide","review":"Well, it is about time a small compact book with full color photos showing male, female, winter and summer plumage was available. Actual bird photos are so much better than a drawing or a black and white shot. So many times, I have seen a strange bird and could not find enough information as to what type it was, now I can.I gave the book a 4 instead of a 5 because the description did not tell where the nests were located, the nesting materials used, nest designs or egg shapes and colors. I found by accident that the Kildeer lay eggs on open ground, are ready to eat and run within a few hours after birth and that the parents carry the broken eggs away from the hatching. This bird lore is very interesting and this type of description should be included for each bird.But overall, a great bird information source and perfect for beginners like me!"},{"Title":"Birds of Georgia Field Guide","review":"I really like this book, especially the way the birds are grouped by size within color-tabbed sections. Also, male & female birds, when notably different, are on different pages. The index has a box next to each named bird so it's easy to record which birds you've spotted. However, I took away 1 star because I think some of the birds need more than 1 view, and I've seen some birds in my yard that are not in the book. Overall, I would recommend this book. The size makes it portable enough to take anywhere, and the organization and indexing make it easy to use."},{"Title":"Birds of Georgia Field Guide","review":"This book is concise and easy to use.

Its goal is to offer comments from the ancient Rabbis whose teachings have been preserved in the Talmud (a massive collection of Rabbinic sermons from shortly after the time of Christ and for several centuries afterward). It is a reference work, not the sort of book one would read from cover to cover.This volume should not be considered a thorough Talmudic commentary on the Torah (it is only 382 pages, and the font is large). Instead, the author chooses a few signficant verses from various Torah chapters and then provides some relevant quotations about that passage from the Talmud.The commentary is arranged in biblical order, It is a real help in understanding the ancient Jewish understanding (or application) of many passages in the Torah, and the choice of passages addressed seems reasonable.The Talmudic comments both highlight the unusual interpretive style of ancient Judaism, yet they sometimes provide reasonable insights along with the allegorizations. Either way, the reader will begin to understand the mentality of Second Temple and post 70 A.D. Judaism.The section addressing the Yom Kippur Service (pp. 174-176) is especially excellent.As an evangelical Christian pastor, I would recommend this book for serious students of the Torah."},{"Title":"The Torah Revealed: Talmudic Masters Unveil the Secrets of the Bible","review":"Book is ho hum. Short little discussions on a few but various selected Torah topics. Nothing really in depth. If you have little Torah background and want to have a taste of short mostly ancient and medieval rabbinic commentary then buy it. Better yet try and find a library copy first."},{"Title":"The Torah Revealed: Talmudic Masters Unveil the Secrets of the Bible","review":"This is a useful book. While the Talmud is not primarily a work of midrash (interpretations of the Torah designed to disclose a hidden meaning, hence the book's title) it contains bits of midrash in the context of its legal and moral discussions. The author has combed the Talmud for these bits of midrash and has arranged them in the biblical order, by parsha (the weekly Torah reading). For this reason, one should not expect a complete commentary. To cite the example of next week's Torah portion, Yayetzei, there are comments on Genesis 28:11, 28:13, 29:12, 29:17 29:25, 29:31, 29:32, 30:1, 30:21, 30:22 and 30:24, in six pages worth of text. In the case of this parsha, all comments are from the Talmud, but elsewhere he augments the Talmudic comments with other midrashim. The format is attractive and easy to read.While this is the most thorough collection of Talmudic midrash that I know of, I assume it isn't a complete collection: I wonder how large such a book would be. The author has emphasized \\"ethical and moral themes\\" (xv) in his selection.Those interested in the development of midrash should consult James L. Kugel's The Bible As It Was (or the more comprehensive Traditions of the Bible), which clearly shows the roots of midrash in pre-rabbinic biblical interpretation, with numerous examples dated 300 BC-70 CE, from sources like Jubilees, Jospehus, The Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, etc. It too is arranged in biblical order."},{"Title":"Sectional Anatomy for Imaging Professionals, 1e","review":"I'm an MRI/CT technologist, and have borrowed this book to study for the CT test. As an imaging professional, this was the most helpful of all the books geared towards cross sectional anatomy. I am now buying it in preparation for the MRI test, because it helped me so much the last time. The pictures are clear, the notes are to the point, and everything is shown in an orderly and easy to read manner. CT and MRI images are equally focused on, and the graphics are clear as to what they're indicating, unlike many other anatomy books. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Sectional Anatomy for Imaging Professionals, 1e","review":"I am a professional speaker in cross sectional anatomy. I have used this book and the accompanying slides for years and I highly recommend it particularly if you need a review of anatomy. The images are clear and well labelled with very few ambiguities. There is also a smaller pocket study book available. Need to learn x-sectional anatomy? Get this book."},{"Title":"Sectional Anatomy for Imaging Professionals, 1e","review":"This was the required text for my Sectional Anatomy course, as part of my radiography curriculum. I found the layout of the book disorganized and frustrating. I felt it would have been helpful and appropriate for the text to address the sequencing of CT/MRI images instead of showing a random shot here or there...I suppose that's difficult to do without a multimedia/interactive presentation, but I still had alot of trouble learning via this text. I found the abbreviated captions virtually useless and ill-concieved. It's one thing if you're tyring to quiz yourself and want a hint, but if you're trying to learn from scratch, it would have made much more sense seeing the long-hand terms written out in the columns so we know what we're looking at. Having to glance down at the caption and search for the abbreviation in question proved very distracting to the learning process. And the written text was...well, not enough text. Instead of offering helpful ways to differentiate and remember the many different body parts and structures, the text follows a very robotic \\"the A bone connects to the B bone which leads to the C artery and supplies the D organ...\\". I felt overwhelmed with similar-sounding descriptions and didn't take much away from the learning experience that wasn't lost in days. If I already had an understanding of cross-sectional anatomy before using this text, it may have served as a succinct review, but given the fact it is assigned to first-time X-sectional learners I felt it was too abstract and devoid of personality. If I decide to go into CT or MRI in the future, I plan on selling this book and doing a little research on finding the best and most current text available at the time. I can tell this one won't age well."},{"Title":"Sectional Anatomy for Imaging Professionals, 1e","review":"I got this book for an online class in Cross-sectional anatomy. Maybe this review is partly my frustration with taking this material online, so take it for what it's worth.The book is nothing but a dry recital of facts. If you are trying to learn the material forget it. If you already know it, then you might find it nice. I don't.The text refers to images that are spread throught several pages (and not the page with the text on it). This is very frustrating. Images are labeled in code, this also frustrating. It would take more space, but I think you could concentrate on an image and explain it, then move onto another image."},{"Title":"Sectional Anatomy for Imaging Professionals, 1e","review":"Has tons of true to life CT images, great descriptions, easy to follow. Also recommend obtaining the workbook that goes along with it. Together they help the understanding process faster and clearer. Don't even need to attend a class with these books!"},{"Title":"Sectional Anatomy for Imaging Professionals, 1e","review":"I am a Radiography Student and took Sectional Anatomy for Imaging Professionals class. I took the online companion of the course. I found the book to be unhelpful. It assumes the student already has an expert knowledge of all human anatomy including venous and arterial structures, as well as the nervous system. If you are a Radiologist or an experienced Technologist you would have an easy time deciphering this book, however, I found it to be unhelpful and not appropriate to a versatile learning style. Some images are not labeled correctly and I feel some were labled lazily. Most of the diagrams were not even in color for a book this expensive. Granted, all CT and MRI images are black and white, however, it would be nice to see some of the diagrams and drawn models in color. The book was very bland and unexciting.This book will not age gracefully with time as many of my other Anatomy & Physiology books have. If I were an instructor for sectional anatomy I would consider using a different text and teaching method for presenting this complex and intricate information."},{"Title":"Sectional Anatomy for Imaging Professionals, 1e","review":"The problem is that the sections are way too big to ever really nail anything down.

It's images are beginning to age a bit, especially the CTs, but it still competes well in the available market. It is well organized to teach anatomy, but in spite of using most images from a few series of scans in each chapter, it makes no attempt to order them in sequential fashion. I don't believe the book organization should be revised for this. I just want the captions to provide a clue to sequencing. Of course, we can figure it out, but for students, that's difficult."},{"Title":"Sectional Anatomy for Imaging Professionals, 1e","review":"Great book!

The images are alright, although some of them are not the best quality. Also, by the time you get to the point of learning cross sectional anatomy you should have a deep knowledge of human anatomy, so I really don't see why the writer wasted so much useful space by writing about structure and physiology. I also didn't like the labeling, because instead of using numbers like most books do, they used abbreviations... kind of a give-away if you try to practice."},{"Title":"Sectional Anatomy for Imaging Professionals, 1e","review":"I needed this book for the Human Crossectional Anatomy class for my ultrasound program.

And his essay \\"Search for the Real\\" was a good read for any artist. Even if you don't really understand it or agree with his ideas, the descriptions of plasticity and push/pull are very enlightening. I'm sure he was an amazing teacher. This book is a good read for any artist, as well as for people who do not make art (to get a better understanding of the mind of the artist). This book was great! I recommend Kandinsky's \\"Concerning the Spiritual in Art\\" as a wonderful companion to this book. Between the two your mind can encompass art and thinking that is related to art in new (maybe even familiar) ways."},{"Title":"Search for the Real, and Other Essays","review":"Hofmann has received more and more attention from scholars and writers on art as time has gone by. This is the essential collection of his lucid and illuminating remarks on art. Hofmann's writings (along with Kandinsky's \\"Concerning the Spiritual in Art\\" and other neglected texts) give the lie to the formal aesthetic analysis of art historians who have pigeon-holed abstract expressionism as the species of disruptive innovation that it was and nothing more, when in reality its practitioners had deeply personal philosophical and spiritual concerns. Hofmann believed that the artist must translate his feelings for nature into a creative interpretation of the medium. In other words, \\"to explore the nature of the medium (i.e., the paint) is part of the understanding of creation, as well as part of the process of creation.\\" So the artist doesn't create a mirror image of nature, but rather the artist communicates an engagement with the essence of things through the creation of art (e.g., a painting) that becomes a shining, transcendent, \\"spiritual\\" object in its own right. He took a Hegelian approach - the artist's interior life, plus the medium, creates a \\"spiritual synthesis\\" that is a new thing in the world.Heady stuff, and not for the faint of brain, but if you're not a stranger to philosophy or otherwise willing to explore the nuances of what happens when an artist approaches the canvas (what Hofmann calls \\"the blending of experience gained in life with the natural qualities of the art medium\\") then you just found the Artist's Bible for the post-representational world of expression."},{"Title":"Search for the Real, and Other Essays","review":"But it turned out to be amazing.

Unless you're a die hard Hans Hoffman fan it's definitely not a must read. The book really shoots all over and is difficult to read I found.

If you're looking for an art theory book \\" The Art Question \\" or \\" Art and Fear\\" are much better books."},{"Title":"The Rise of the Indian Rope Trick: How a Spectacular Hoax Became History","review":"Perhaps you have seen a magician pull a rabbit out of a demonstrably empty hat. You may have seen the classic magical trick of sawing a woman in half. And perhaps you have seen the Indian rope trick: the conjurer, standing in an open field, throws one end of a rope into the air, where defying gravity, it stays, and a boy comes to climb up the rope, reaches the top, and disappears. No, you have not seen that one, perhaps, but it is as famous as the others and has caused a century of wonder, perhaps not from audiences but from those who have tried to see the illusion and tried to learn how it was done. In _The Rise of the Indian Rope Trick: How a Spectacular Hoax Became History_ (Thunder's Mouth Press), Peter Lamont, a magician and an academic researcher on the performance of magic, has written a hugely entertaining book about the most legendary and exotic of magic tricks. \\"A legend is very much like an illusion,\\" he writes, \\"more interesting and invariably more attractive than reality.\\" We need legends, and this one is so colorful and mysterious, Lamont's careful probing and deflating make it even more attractive.The amazing truth is that there never was any Indian rope trick, and it has almost nothing to do with India. It was the invention of a loyal American, a journalist who later went on to become the head of the US Secret Service. John Elbert Wilkie was a reporter for the _Chicago Tribune_, and in 1890 he published an anonymous article describing the rope trick as seen in India, and how it was done. He made it all up. There were those who spoke up, certain that people were seeing the rope trick before 1890, but there are no accounts of the trick before that time. A few weeks later, the _Tribune_ published a confession that the story was a hoax, but newspapers across America and Europe were spreading the story, while the retraction got nowhere. As Lamont writes, \\"A legend does not survive on accuracy.\\" The community of magicians, and those fascinated by their effects, became split between those who were convinced that the rope trick was a real illusion and those who thought it an illusory illusion. The efforts of those who believed the trick to be real have been extensive. A photograph was finally produced of the trick in 1919, but it turned out to be the far more prosaic trick of a boy balancing on a pole. People had seen the trick in India, but they turned out to be people who were reported as seeing it by other people, the familiar \\"friend of a friend\\" basis of countless urban legends. There were those who claim to have seen the trick themselves. Many of them took decades to speak up and say that they had actually seen the trick performed, but a psychologist has found that the memories get elaborated, with fancier versions being recalled the more distant the memory is.One particular elaboration has outdone Wilkie's conception, and has had its own life, supporters, and detractors. This is the version in which the boy climbs the rope and the magician climbs up after him, only to chop the boy up and throw his separated pieces down, whereupon they are magically reunited and the boy brought back to life. As in the original, there are those who claim to know just how this trick is done, but of course it is never done. Throughout this book is documented the human eagerness to believe; skeptics may assure the public with factual assertions about how the trick never existed, but as Lamont writes, the people who keep Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster going are the same types that will keep the Indian rope trick in existence, even though it never had an existence to begin with. With his book, full of arcane facts and documentation presented by a humorous and entertaining guide, Lamont knows that he is only going to strengthen the legend. In fact, in a jaunty epilogue, he tells us he has, indeed, seen the trick himself, and any reader will agree, he tells a good story."},{"Title":"The Rise of the Indian Rope Trick: How a Spectacular Hoax Became History","review":"You wouldn't have thought that a magic trick that never was is the best known magical trick of all time.Peter Lamont uses this trick as the foundation of a search into magic tricks of all kinds, but especially tricks from India. His search has taken him back into history and finally a trip to India doing research.Extensively researched and referenced this is a very interesting trip into the explanation of magic. When I first picked it up, because of the title, I expected to put it down again quickly. Instead I found the writing style and the content to be fascinating and didn't put it down.Every so often I get some kind of story in an e-mail describing something that just makes so much sense that it had to have happened. It's nice to know that such urban legends didn't just start with the Internet, but a long time ago.The Indian Rope Trick - a totally made up story - in Chicago - nothing to do with India at all. Then magicians had to come up with a way to do it. Strange world."},{"Title":"The Rise of the Indian Rope Trick: How a Spectacular Hoax Became History","review":"GuysI have not read this book yet, but I can't resist myself from commenting on this topic.I don't know what kind of research the author has done and arrived at the conclusion that the Indian rope trick was a complete HOAX.The fact is that the Indian Rope Trick does really exist. It's just that very few magicians can do it. The classic Indian rope trick (boy vanishing in thin air and then the master cutting him in to pieces) may be a myth, but the Indian rope trick is very much performed even today.[...].There is an excellent demonstration of the trick in BBC's program supernatural science - Secrets of Levitation where Nishamuddin, a magician from India, who has revived this trick, performs the trick for BBC.There is a professor and a magician in Kerla (southern India) who can also perform this trick.So I don't know what's all this fuss about?"},{"Title":"The Rise of the Indian Rope Trick: How a Spectacular Hoax Became History","review":"According to this magician who looked for what wasn't there, \\"history is not the past, only the historian's interpretation of a very small part of it.\\" Those who write history do not know all the facts, do not deem some of them important or entertaining enough to sell papers, or books. Bare facts are of little use without historical interpretations. He dontinues, \\"Two historians reading the same text choose different facts and write different stories, nothing alike\\" Similar to these reviews, I would imagine.Even in newspapers, \\"facts\\" depend on what editors have decided are important and the tales by the journalist (their personal opinions) are never identical. History will always be a matter of opinion, but one based on evidence, so-called historical facts.In the 17th century, Indian and Persian magicians were called jugglers. Mostly the charmed snakes, but never anything to compare with America's David Copperfield. Magic was a world of enchantment, like Merlin's in Camelot, filled with illusion. The age of technology in late 17th and 18th centuries brought Enlightenment,There is no documentation of the rope trick as originating from India; a shaman from Siberia claimed to have climbed to the sky \\"by the use of a rope.\\" But it was a story about a trick with a rope in India which captured the popular imagination and became the world's most famous hoax,Like 'The War of the Worlds' radio fraud, this is believed to have been a false newspaper article written in 1890 in America; the author admitted it was untrue and had even written that there was no factual verification. But the notion and notoriety prompted people to claim that they had seen it with their own eyes. It is ordinary folks who bring a legend to life.Many photos throughout this book shows how the thing proliferated and could have happened. The best in my opinion is the master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock, contemplating a coiled rope with perhaps five feet up in the air. As we all know, Hollywood was the purveyor of props and rumors. It was a 'charade.'"},{"Title":"A Place of Acceptance","review":"A friend of mine said she no longer reads adult ficition because it's depressing. I want to pass her a copy of A Place of Acceptance. The novel, like the cover, is full of light.

One leaves with the sense that with love, persistence and grace, all things will be well."},{"Title":"A Place of Acceptance","review":"A Place of Acceptance, a story of loving family relationships gone awry, is a powerful novel that not only holds our interest but ties us intimately into a learning experience. We are learning unaware that we are being taught.The characters are portrayed honestly and with tact. How does one handle such a problem? Any such scenario in a family is bound to cause problems especially severe when the members are blind to what is happening. And yet the author walks us through so graciously that we are caught up in the story.We become the jury sifting the facts, even praying about the outcome. The tension builds as we sort the problem ourselves, wondering just how we would handle this if it were our family. The plot is intriguing, honest and down to earth. I would call this book a powerful read, a must read."},{"Title":"The English revolution, 1688-1689 (The home university library of modern knowledge)","review":"Professor G.M. Trevelyan (1876-1962) is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential British historians of the 20th-century. Specializing in the years of Stuart rule over Britain (1603-1714), Trevelyan's books are still considered \\"definitive\\" in the historiography of Stuart England; in fact, Trevelyan's works, such as his multi-volume account of Queen Anne's reign, often document under-examined topics. In 1938, Trevelyan authors the definitive account of England's so-called \\"Glorious Revolution\\" with The English Revolution, 1688-1689. Employing a rich, clear, literary narrative Trevelyan argues that James II is a tyrant whose obstinacy and stupidity leads to James' loss of the British throne. Moreover, Trevelyan argues the Revolution, which raises the power of Parliament at the monarch's expense, sets Britain on a course of relative stability and toward ascendancy in Europe.When one looks at the historiography of the Glorious Revolution, one finds a paucity of books devoted to the Revolution itself. The sixty-six years between the publication of Trevelyan's work and today have not produced another volume so comprehensive and readable. In other works, the Revolution tends to be covered as part of a Stuart biography or mentioned as being \\"important\\" in a survey of England or America in the late 17th-century. All the while, little new information is being collected and published in book form. Oftentimes, the Revolution serves as a line of demarcation, a place to start or end a study of English history. In the past few years, revisionist historians have challenged the notion of James II as tyrant, preferring a portrayal casting James as the victim of scheming daughters and their husbands (as is most notably found in Maureen Waller's popular Ungrateful Daughters, published in 2003 by St. Martins). Nevertheless, most British historians still hail Trevelyan's work as the \\"gold-standard\\" narrative of the Revolution. In fact, the book is still in print some 66 years after its initial publication.Since the book is accessible and clear, and one of the very few books in print devoted solely to the Glorious Revolution, Trevelyan's work retains great importance to British historiography. Trevelyan's interpretation and narrative style may seem quaint and old-fashioned, but the information gathered and presented by his work serves to enlighten the 21st-century mind as to the importance of England's Glorious Revolution."},{"Title":"The English revolution, 1688-1689 (The home university library of modern knowledge)","review":"This slim volume by Trevelyan is one of the most gripping history books I have ever read. In 130 pages, the author succinctly describes the various interest groups involved, and how they interacted during the revolution and its aftermath.If you think you might be interested in the English revolution, but are concerned that some authors' treatment of the topic might be dry and unengaging, I recommend that you start with this book. Trevelyan succeeds in distilling the revolution and its aftermath into 130 pages of economic prose, without ever becoming superficial or glib."},{"Title":"The English revolution, 1688-1689 (The home university library of modern knowledge)","review":"The experiences of English government in the 1600's must be grasped to understand why the Declaration of Independence, and to a lesser extent, the Constitution of the USA contained the words they contained."},{"Title":"The English revolution, 1688-1689 (The home university library of modern knowledge)","review":"Trevelyan's English Revolution provides a good look at the reigns of Charles II and James II and how the Catholics and Protestants were struggling for superiority in England in the 17th Century. Background information and effects after their reigns is also added to give the reader a better understanding of events which are covered in the book.English Revolution is well written and entertaining while educational, a stand alone work or good companion to other books covering this era."},{"Title":"The English revolution, 1688-1689 (The home university library of modern knowledge)","review":"This book was written in the 1930s and is now coming back as a reprint. With all the revisionist history floating around (Ungrateful Daughters), it is good to read something about why James II did lose his throne. Basically James II was an inept leader who attacked his base of support (Tories) and alienated the Whigs. When William I landed and advanced on London, James II gave up and fled. If he would have stayed, he and his son would have ruled Great Britain with the consent of Parliament. Trevelyan does a good job of detailing how James II lost his throne.This is an academic read. There is little dramatic actions in this book. It is simply an explanation of how a leader should not rule. This is also a short read for someone looking to understand the Glorious Revolution."},{"Title":"FIGHTER PILOTS","review":"The author of this book flew in WW2, Korea and Vietnam. This alone should narrow the search for who he was - if you want to know. You should, because this is a very well-written book both as a self-portrait of someone as he ages, following his career through the air force from the thrill and fear and confusion of combat to the drunken boredom of squadron life, and as a study of the times through which he lives.

Several friends have asked me to discuss the differences between the editions, so I thought I'd present a four-way comparison and then talk about which version is best for which audience.For the purposes of the four-way comparison, I will draw text from the opening tale of the two kingly brothers in order to highlight how each popular version handles \\"adult\\" content and racial content.-- The Tale of King Shahryar and of his Brother, King Shahzaman --Now there were in the King's palace certain windows that looked on to the garden, and, as King Shahzaman leaned there and looked out, the door of the palace opened and twenty women slaves with twenty men slaves came from it; and the wife of the King, his brother, was among them and walked there in all her bright beauty. When they came to the pool of a fountain they all undressed and mingled one with another. Suddenly, on the King's wife crying: 'O Masud! Ya Masud!', a gigantic negro ran towards her, embraced her, and, turning her upon her back, enjoyed her. At this signal, all the other men slaves did the same with the women and they continued thus a long while, not ceasing their kisses and embraces and goings in and the like until the approach of dawn.-- Madrus & Mathers edition-- The Tale of King Shahriar and of his Brother, King Shahzenan --One day, Shahriar had started on a great hunting match, about two days' journey from his capital; but Shahzenan, pleading ill health, was left behind. He shut himself up in his apartment, and sat down at a window that looked into the garden. Suddenly a secret gate of the palace opened, and there came out of it twenty women, in the midst of whom walked the Sultaness. The persons who accompanied the Sultaness threw off their veils and long robes, and Shahzenan was greatly surprised when he saw that ten of them were black slaves, each of whom chose a female companion. The Sultaness clapped her hands, and called: \\"Masoud, Masoud!\\" and immediately a black came running to her; and they all remained conversing familiarly together.-- Muhsin al-Musawi edition-- The Tale of King Schahriar and of his Brother, King Schahzeman --Now the Sultan Schahriar had a wife whom he loved more than all the world, and his greatest happiness was to surround her with splendour, and to give her the finest dresses and the most beautiful jewels. It was therefore with the deepest shame and sorrow that he accidentally discovered, after several years, that she had deceived him completely, and her whole conduct turned out to have been so bad, that he felt himself obliged to carry out the law of the land, and order the grand-vizir to put her to death.-- Lang edition-- The Tale of King Shahryar and of his Brother, King Shah Zaman --Thereupon Shah Zaman drew back from the window, but he kept the bevy in sight espying them from a place whence he could not be espied. They walked under the very lattice and advanced a little way into the garden till they came to a jetting fountain amiddlemost a great basin of water; then they stripped off their clothes and behold, ten of them were women, concubines of the King, and the other ten were white slaves. Then they all paired off, each with each: but the Queen, who was left alone, presently cried out in a loud voice, \\"Here to me, O my lord Saeed!\\" and then sprang with a drop leap from one of the trees a big slobbering blackamoor with rolling eyes which showed the whites, a truly hideous sight. He walked boldly up to her and threw his arms round her neck while she embraced him as warmly; then he bussed her and winding his legs round hers, as a button loop clasps a button, he threw her and enjoyed her.-- Burton edition-------For my money, the superior volume by far is the Madrus & Mathers edition. The editor and translator have deliberately worked the translation to be as readable to the English eye as possible, even making judicious choices about where to refrain from using diacritical points (single quote sound points, as in 'ain) in order to ease the reading experience. They've made a concerted effort to retain the adult content without being lewd, the racial content without descending into offensive caricature, the poetic content without overwhelming the reader, and the entire content without condensing the text and losing material. The Madrus & Mathers editions comprise four giant volumes, but the casual enthusiast will be more than satisfied with just volume one, and with over 600 pages of stories in the electronic edition, the reader will have plenty of reading material available.For children, however, the superior volume is probably the Muhsin al-Musawi edition. This edition is condensed, but the editing was done with great care to maintain story structure and content. The adult content has been toned down considerably, the racial content has been handled tactfully, the extra songs and poems have been almost entirely removed, and there are interesting and attractive pictures in the electronic edition. My biggest complain here is that the adult content has been excised to a degree that almost brings unfortunate implications: when adultery is characterized as \\"conversing\\", the angry and jilted husband seems to be seriously over-reacting. Still, if you want a sanitized version of the tales, the al-Musawi edition is almost certainly the way to go.I do not recommend the Lang edition. Lang's fairy tale collections, such as the color fairy tale books, are usually a delight, but his Arabian Nights edition is thin on content and heavily paraphrased. The stories are gutted to remove the adult content and shorten the tale length for children, but in many cases the changes are not carefully glossed over, and huge plot holes and unresolved threads are left dangling. I've never met a Lang reader who didn't ask me what was going on in one tale or other because the translation is so poorly rendered.Neither do I recommend the Burton version. If anything, the Burton version has the exact opposite problems as the Lang version: Burton's edition lengthens the stories with extensively lewd descriptions and offensive racial imagery. The edition was also rendered in the 1800s, and the language within has not aged well -- there are all lot of \\"forsooth\\"s and \\"verily\\"s that bog down the reading. If you're interested in a historical analysis of how these tales have been rendered over the years, by all means become familiar with the Burton version, but if you're just looking for light bedtime reading, give the Burton edition a pass.I hope that this comparison will be helpful. This particular listing here is for the Lang edition which I really cannot recommend.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"The Arabian Nights Entertainments","review":"This is a sanitized childrens version of the classic novel made famous many decades ago. It is missing the critical &#34;adult&#34; thread of why the stories are being told; the woman telling erotic and exotic stories to the king to entertain him and entice him with wanting to hear more so she may live... Without this element, this merely becomes is a nice collection of fairy tails randomly sited."},{"Title":"The Arabian Nights Entertainments","review":"I recently purchased this CD set for my daughters to listen to in the car and at bed time. I was impressed with how much they enjoyed it. Several times we have had to sit in the car for a few minutes after getting home so that they could hear the end of a chapter.Now, as for the stories themselves, be warned. These are NOT polished up, dumbed-down, sanitized disney versions. The language used is age appropriate for young listeners. However, there is a body count, and there is a scene where somebody dumps boiling oil in the jars with the murdering thieves. It is not particularly graphic, but if you have concerns about that kind of thing, you really should listen to the stories yourself before letting your kids hear them. Also, these are stories from the middle east, so there are several mentions throughout the stories to Allah. They are handled in a religiously neutral fashion, and only serve to remind the listener that the stories are from another culture. It is not some back door attempt to convert kids to Islam. All that being said, these are relatively good versions of the traditional stories. They are fun to listen to. I probably enjoyed them as much as the kids did. The narrator is engaging, and his delivery is excellent. I would recommend these CDs to anybody who is interested in introducing kids to the stories of Arabian Nights.-CR"},{"Title":"The Arabian Nights Entertainments","review":"My four children and I loved reading this collection of stories from Arabia.

Presented here are a handful of edited stories, a mere sampling of the complete whole, which, admittedly, is near-impossible to find. Instead of downloading and reading this digital sadness, find a more complete edition and enjoy that.

It includes the beginning, but not the end, of the wrap-around story that is the setting for all the other stories. To find out what happens to Scheherazade after she finishes telling all the tales, you have to get a different version. I was so surprized at this, that I thought at first my Kindle was broken and wouldn't go to the next page. In this version, the next page isn't there."},{"Title":"The Arabian Nights Entertainments","review":"These stories are pure adventure with only superficial attempts at moralizing. They are fantastical and repeat themes of transportation to distant lands, magic infatuating lusts and power. The characters are revealed for you to be good or bad and relationships are intertwined with their worldly desires which focus on lavish gardens and palaces of competing grandeur, sweet water, and rich foods. Motives are simple and straight forward, all focused on love, money and social standing. The subject of physical beauty, infatuation, jealousy, greed is repeated throughout. Stories always resolve fully with the frequent ending being the assumption that peace, love and happiness is forever after.The stories are told succinctly and occasionally abruptly with few attempts at building anticipation or develop the imagination although this may be in part due to the editor (admittedly) screening out the \`dull' parts. Still, an attempt could have been made to soften transition points and somewhat engage the imagination. Because of their format, the tales read like a children's book; short and to the point, explaining needed details, leaving out intermediate parts of the stories so as to be able to jump to the next conclusion. Perhaps this is why I was annoyed with this book throughout. But more so was I annoyed because of the repeated themes of foolishness, lust, vanity, greed, arrogance and the abuse of power.I believe a review should be, as they say, \\"Just the facts, Mam\\". Reviews are not the best place to express your purely emotional response to a story. Still, while reading these stories, I could not rid myself the feelings of irritation for the characters foolishness and abuses. Frequently these tales told of youth, spoiled children entitled and privileged by heredity, who viciously abused their servants, were compelled by their unbridled passions (infatuations & lusts) to undertake some adventure. Instead of their adventures leading them to some moral conclusion or change of character (for which I am accustomed), they eventually had their lusts fulfilled, their lives enriched and lived happily forever after. Perhaps this is why all the Chalifs (kings), really just the grown versions of their entitled spoiled and vicious children, were so eager to cut the heads off of their innocent victims. Could they not consider any other form of justice than death? But, beheadings is a cultural insult, a reference to which I am not wholly familiar.Something distinct in these tales is the impression that the highest aspirations in life are that of power, riches and beauty. Moral imperatives, although insinuated slightly, are almost completely missing from these stories and always secondary and less than consequential to the plot. Critics were easily silenced with gifts and exhaustive explanations of why they (the privileged) were more entitled and deserving than the rest of society, almost to the point of saying that adventure and danger was a right to privilege above that of a good stewardship or humble servitude. Many of the adventures were spurned out of the pure boredom of having everything.The powerful were often cruel and vicious. The powerful always seemed concerned with conspiracies and subterfuge which might dethrone them. This may be why many of the tales deal with the powerful feinting generosity with lavished meals and gifts of money on their detractors in what is obviously a ploy to earn their condolences. But by any true accounting it is clear that they had given away an insignificant bribe to buy a conversion. The stories did not balance the cruelties issues for false conviction with any balance of penance (to which I am accustomed), having their years of base cruelties dispelled in an instance (never needing forgiveness) and without a twinge of stinging (profound) guilt. The powerful where always right (excused) in their actions, even in their severe and cruel injustices.I had to ask a friend familiar with southwest Asian studies to clarify if whether these stories were not a commentary on the cultures of that region. They advised me that they are more an aristocratic view of the poor (they control). I was relieved to learn that these stories are not a true reflection of that society for such a reflection would be a shallow one at best. But, I would extrapolate that these stories may be a means of society manipulation. For those not of these lands, the stories seem fantastical and fun, but the under pinning are that of power and privilege over all other things.I guess I have finally outgrown the silliness and cruelty of childhood fairy tales. The reality of this world compels me to search for more morality than these stories offer. I do not plan on reading these stories to my children without taking great liberties at \`improving' on the morals of these stories. Genis are a world of fun, but I prefer my fun to have meaning; ethical, moral and spiritual consequences which transcend this world, if you will. These are by no means the only fairy tales which are lacking. But these were the ones which stole my innocence away from me. These are fun adventures, but as a parent, I much prefer Aesop's Fables.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Arabian Nights Entertainments","review":"I wanted to reread this, as I had enjoyed it so much as a child. Unfortunately, I found a problem that I am seeing more and more these days. That is the editing. I can't help but wonder if a real, literate person ever reads any of the books published anymore, or if they are just run them through a computer. The word \\"genious \\" is used instead of the word \\"genie\\" throughout the book.

However, I must assure you that all of the innuendoes have been removed from this CD and what is left is a very pleasant story of a gal telling stories to her sister in order to save her own life. I wondered about it myself before purchasing this CD, but since it did indicate it is for children, well, they had to do SOMETHING to make it suitable. We have a lengthy road trip weekly and this CD gets us there and back, completely enthralled with the stories. The narrator, Toby Stephens, is sincerely adept at producing any voice he chooses, and entraps the listener not to even hardly breathe throughout the entire disk. I have to admit, driving can be hard while listening! :) It's hard to beat an English actor narration and this disk doesn't disappoint. Particularly, if you have boys listening: Casseim, Ali Baba's unjust brother, is dismembered into 4 parts, nailed to the inside of a cave, and is sewn together by a tailor before he's buried. Why that's cool, I have NO idea! Please keep in mind, however, that there are still a few graphic scenes like the one I just described and you may have to fast forward over them for younger listeners. Anyway, be SURE to get this CD - it's really awesome and adults really enjoy it too. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Arabian Nights Entertainments","review":"I purchased this to share with my granddaughters. Always loved the stories of the Arabian Nights as a child.

But this edition of Arabian Nights is BEAUTIFUL! It's far better than many other editions I've seen, especially young reader paperbacks that visually seem to dumb-down the content.I know book structure because I build them by hand. The outside has coated bookcloth, a leather spine with gold foil stamping, and screen-printed graphics with embossed foil. Inside pages are text-weight acid-free paper (which means the pages could last for centuries without crumbling - cheaper paperback editions may use newsprint or acidic paper that causes the pages to yellow and turn brittle quickly). The quality paper produces crisp type and sharp, bright images: eighteen color plates and thirteen black plates enhance the groups of short stories.I recommend this edition as a keeper to read for years to come and to pass down to other new readers who haven't discovered these delightful tales yet.

I suspect Dr. Atkins would turn over in his grave. Her free use of white flour, sugar, non-dairy topping, and fruit juices makes me wonder what made her think these recipes qualify as low carb. She calls for using fat free foods, but if one is truly eating low carb, one doesn't need to eat low-fat. Indeed, it's contrary to true low carb eating. I am diabetic and I wouldn't dream of using these recipes. I'm glad I borrowed this book instead of wasting money on a purchase. There are much better low carb dessert books available."},{"Title":"Delicious Low-Carb Desserts","review":"My problem with this book is the amount of flour is in the recipes.

I could have told here where it was hiding...right under her baby that she decided to take to bed with her every night. She may not realize it, but the \\"cure\\" for her libido was her baby getting older than 2 and becoming more independent. No baby in bed, no baby at the breast (ok, any breastfeeding after 1 year old is just asking for issues from both mom and kid), no kidding you can start feeling like a separate person again. As a mom of two who really has been searching for her libido - not just myself - all I have to say to Raykeil about her discovery of her \\"lost\\" naughty self is...duh. I wish the millions of moms out there who feel sexy, love their husbands, want to desire to have sex and DONT sleep with their kids, but still can't muster a sexual feeling found it as easy."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Naughty Mommy: How I Found My Lost Libido","review":"This frank and breezy account of one woman's step by baby step path back to sexy-ville is just what I needed! Since my husband and I had our daughter, our world is focused on this tiny, special person, and sleeplessness has blurred our eyes for any other type of love. I could relate when Raykeil calls her husband, \\"Poppy;\\" pre-baby I vowed never to call mine Daddy, and now do so all of the time, and not as in \\"Who's your Daddy?\\" Reading this book put our on-hold love life back in perspective, reminded me of my sense of humor and inspired me to put just as much emphasis on the naughty me as the mommy me. Give this one to all of your postpartum girlfriends!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Naughty Mommy: How I Found My Lost Libido","review":"I've been through this from the husband's perspective. We had three kids, and despite being physically fine, my wife just checked out sexually. Although she's a decent writer, Raykeil is also, like most mommies, incredibly self-centered. Pretty much the entire world revolves around her and her daughter, and her husband is left to fend for himself, which she even finds sort of amusing. It isn't. I never felt more alone, more lost, more desparate and more in anguish than when I was suddenly reduced to an ATM and an assistant in my own home. She doesn't, in the end, seem too concerned with what kind of damage this did to her husband, how unfair it was, how hurtful or how cruel. And, like mommies everywhere, she uses her status as a potent guilt-weapon. When her husband tells her that condoms reduce some of the sensation and pleasure of sex, she instantly retaliates with that time-honored \\"Well, try CHILDBIRTH buster!\\" She found hundreds of ways to make sure her husband knew she didn't care, she didn't want to be touched, she didn't need him. The dead giveaway for me was the line that she had spent something like a thousand nights with her daughter in bed with them. You cannot find a much clearer way of telling your husband that he is your absolute last priority -- and that how that makes him feel isn't really too important. Hit a nerve."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Naughty Mommy: How I Found My Lost Libido","review":"My husband and I are reading this together. Since the birth of our baby, our sex life has disappeared.

It is a wonderful mix of humor, despair, sexiness, and insight, and left me feeling very motivated to try to reactivate my own post-baby sex life! While having a baby around the house can be the catalyst for some sexual and relational upheaval, I don't agree with the reviewer who said that the issues just magically resolve themselves once the baby is more independent (and no longer nursing or co-sleeping.) I don't think Raykeil comes to that conclusion, either, and I appreciated Raykeil's honesty and her willingness to go deeper in order to really help her relationship grow along with her family. No, it isn't an instruction manual, but I think many couples can be helped and inspired by Raykeil's journey."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Naughty Mommy: How I Found My Lost Libido","review":"Raykeil has written a fun and very readable book about recapturing her libido after childbirth. I expect that this will interest about 99 percent of the adult population. She outlines how having a baby and facing all of the added chores of parenthood diminished her interest in things 'naughy'. Happily for her husband she set out to do something about it. Happily for us she wrote it down. She gives a funny account of how she introduced playfulness, risk taking, and libidinous time management into her marriage.

Many of us just get so overwhelmed with the demands of parenthood that it is impressive how many families actually go on to have more than one child!

How they meshed so incredibly perfectly and found eachother to be sublime after so many other sexual relationships. She goes on and on about these encounters that I wonder whether she really isn't trying to make people jealous. She talks about how \\"just this afternoon I wound up naked on my husband's black leather couch in his office\\". She also mentions in a few places in the book how her husband makes a substantial amount of money and she likes that. She has a wonderful trip to a spa by herself to rekindle her libido... It's hard to relate to unless you are a wealthy Berkley woman from a liberal background with lots of hot sex in your history and enough money in your future to permit some excitement.

And it also showed that even if we are not \\"feeling\\" sexy or great about ourselves, it's still important to try to see our partners point of view. Be honest, but not selfish. Be true to yourself, understanding that your partners feelings are important in that relationship. Also I liked that she spoke of the phases that we have in our lives, that the \\"mommy - prudish\\" stage, is only that.... a stage and that after the children get older, we can get the romance back into our relationship."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Naughty Mommy: How I Found My Lost Libido","review":"This book is an easy read and was exactly what I needed.

Meticulously researched, compellingly told, it will satisfy both the avid WWII reader and the scholar. Engler includes plenty of footnotes at the end of each chapter which demonstrates an unparalled research effort, one done with most care and then crafted into a wonderful narrative.This little-known but critical battle finally gets its due. Engler masterfully recounts the infantryman's-eye view of battle, all the while integrating the street-to-street and house-to-house fighting into the larger context of the American effort in WWII in 1944-1945. Engler elaborates on the condition of the American Army post-Normandy breakout. Everyone expected the war to be in its final stages. But behind the \\"greatest generation\\" was a desperate effort to keep America motivated, and an even more desperate effort to scrape whatever barrels remained of soldier manpower. Engler's research convincingly demonstrates the faults of America's technology over manpower approach which stacked logistics and the machine arms while shortchanging the infantry. It is a conclusion in short supply, but one that sheds light on the battle and the war.The only minor quibble is that the book is physically too large--the pages are 8.5 x 11, and the text can be hard on the eyes. But that is not enough to detract even 1/2 of a star from its top rating."},{"Title":"The Final Crisis: Combat in Northern Alsace, January 1945","review":"The late Dick Engler's The Final Crisis is an essential read.A first-in-print, moving account of major force engagements late in the WWII European Theater, this work recounts savage West Front fighting long overshadowed by the larger fabric of final war months.In winter 1945, what must be assessed as the last of some of the most powerful engagements, Wehrmacht, Luftwaffe, and Waffen-SS units locked horns with Allied forces in the varied terrain of Lower Alsace in eastern France -- from the Vosges Mountains to the river plain of the Rhine -- and, ultimately, lost the initiative.The Gemman \\"Operation Nordwind\\" intended to cut through combined Allied-French lines that had been overextended to support the Battle of the Bulge.Crack SS Panzer units \\"Frundsberg,\\" Goetz von Berlichingen,\\" 21st and 25th Panzergrenadier divisions, and the SS 6th \\"Mountain Division 'Nord'\\" as well as Luftwaffe airborne and German Army ground forces and Volksgrenadier units worked in company to join battle. Ensuing combat was sustained and bloody. Soldiers of the US Seventh Army absorbed horrific enemy blows but held their ground, ultimately blunting the German attack.The author who participated in the fight, shows detailed research and understanding of this part of the war in Europe. He did extensive research at the National Archives and at the US Military History Institute. Mr. Engler's understanding of this often overlooked part of WWII translates into a stunning account that is worthy of historians' high praise."},{"Title":"The Final Crisis: Combat in Northern Alsace, January 1945","review":"The best aspect of &quot;The Final Crisis&quot;, apart from its detailed and powerful memior of combat, is Richard Engler's inclusion of descriptions of the U.S. home front as Army infantrymen pass through training and the voyage to Europe to reach the battefield.Engler descibes the process and circumstances by which many young men who had joined up expecting to take slots in Army aviation or officers' programs, instead found themselves issued rifles and sent into the forests and mountains of the Rhineland. Although Americans generally wanted to be leaders in the war effort and not rank-and-file soldiers, the brutal reality of battle losses swept away many well-laid personal &quot;war plans&quot;."},{"Title":"The Final Crisis: Combat in Northern Alsace, January 1945","review":"Usually relegated to a footnote, the campaign in the Alsace was actually more important than most people realize. Several factors combined to prevent a German victory, but it was still a very near thing for the Allies. Had the Germans broken through with Operation Nordwind, the course of the war would indeed have been very different.The Nordwind Challenge to Freedom chapter opens the story, with background answering questions about why the operation was launched, and why it began when it did. There is information provided that sets the tone for the rest of the book, explaining national attitude in America, manpower situations, and how some units came to be placed in the American lines in the Vosges. This is followed by a chapter entitled The Setting, describes the \\"neighborhood.\\" The reader is introduced to some of the villagers who inhabited the region, as well as a little of the socio-economic impact of the area. The significance of the Maginot Line fortifications is mentioned, along with an overview of the fighting during the 1940 campaign.The third chapter is a discussion of the US Army, from prior to its involvement in the war. The US strategic views are presented, explaining the \\"Germany First\\" strategy. The author has done a good job of explaining how the Americans built there army, where the men came from, and where they went. Quite frankly, I was amazed at how short the numbers were toward the end of the war, and how Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP) was stripped of men who were supposed to be trained as specialists, but who were badly needed in infantry units.Hopes and Illusions of Summer 1944, the fourth chapter, introduces the reader to a group of men who will surface throughout the narrative. Though names are given, and their unit is only referred to as \\"The Company,\\" their story will provide a fox-hole view of this campaign. It is here that the trials and tribulations of moving from the Air Corps to the Infantry begin to emerge. Of course, this is all minor compared to the difficulties of moving from Stateside to the front lines, especially with minimal training.Misfortunes of the Fall gives the reader more information regarding the Allied situation after the Arnhem incident, leading up to Nordwind. Here again, the home front is visited, letting the reader see where the nations thoughts were. Those thoughts were far from the southern corner of France. Still, the Allies were pushing the German lines back. The next chapter refreshes the reader on what is going on in Germany, the faith the German people still had in Hitler, even while Himmler is creating the Volks Armee, essentially a Party Army. Still, we follow Seventh Army, and \\"The Company,\\" as they draw closer to NORDWIND.Vistas of Nordwind is a short chapter, consisting of a discussion of German plans, American deployment, and the terrain they would be fighting on. It is Chapter 8 that the campaign really begins. The German attacks are described, as are the units that are hit by these attacks. An interesting part of this campaign is the political battle fought with General De Gaulle over Strasbourg. Militarily, it was looking as if evacuating was a sound idea. Politically, De Gaulle would not countenance such an action. Had the order been given to pull back from that city, there may well have been a small mutiny within the French forces, whom De Gaulle was prepared to order into the city on their own.The fighting in the Vosges region was fierce. The following chapters have a well-balanced way of showing what went on at different levels during the campaign. Decisions made at SHAEF are just as important to this book as Corps or Division level decisions. \\"The Company\\" provides insight into the ground level action, allowing the reader to dig in, and see the enemy across a field. The battle was certainly not one-sided, as seen when the Americans lose six battalions to the Germans near Reipertswiller. Still another pasting the Americans suffered was near Herrlisheim, when a tank battalion suffered the loss of 23 of 52 tanks in a day.Still, the issue was close. Although the Americans held, it wasn't always a sure bet. Tenacity and pure stubbornness, with a little luck, allowed the Americans to hold their lines. With a breakout prevented, the Germans could do nothing now but attempt to hold back the Allied onslaught. In this, they ultimately failed.A lesson had hit home, though. More units were shipped from the States to Europe. Rear area units were combed through, and non-essential personnel were handed rifles and sent to the front lines. Although the German was retreating, he wasn't beaten yet. He was still a formidable foe.There are no photographs in this book. There are a number of sketches, as well as maps. The book is well footnoted, showing the research that allows the author to literally tell the story from the ground up.This book is an important read. Still, it is my duty to point out that although I am objective as possible, I am associated with this publisher, even though I had no involvement in the production of this book."},{"Title":"The Final Crisis: Combat in Northern Alsace, January 1945","review":"Dear Sir or Madam:The only thing that keeps this book from being a 5 star is that it's softcover and does not include photos. The U.S Army Combat Cameraman, nor Richard Engler or Colonel Bonn can be blamed for this because the U.S 7th Army's combat cameramen, the 163rd Signal Photo Company's records for January of 1945 state clearly that they, indeed, took photos and film of the nightmarish and terrifying \\"Battle of Rittershoffen and Hatten\\"(ofcourse \\"The Battle of 'Rittershoffen'\\" meaning in German \\"The Battle of 'Knight's Hope'\\") and other Battles like the Saar Gap, Vosges Mountains at Wingen and Reipertswiller, Herrlisheim and Gambsheim, and the Moder River were heavily filmed and photograped by the 163rd Signal Photo Company combat cameramen and these photos and films are now 'missing in action' at the National Archives.Gratefully, the 100th Infantry division now recognizes that it was the 117th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron on their eastern flank, an independent VI Corps unit, just attached to Task Force Hudelson, that withdrew on January 1, 1945, the first day of the German Offensive codenamed \\"Operation Northwind\\", without even confirming this by radio or runner, to the U.S 14th Armored Division's 94th Cavalry Reconaissance Squadron to its east, before the 117th Cav Recon Sqdrn took off \\"without orders\\" and ended up in Wingen and Saverne!Also, soldiers must understand mathematically from the U.S Army Statistical Branch Studies that an Infantry Division has to have twice as many battle casualties as an Armored Division to have the same average battle casualties per infantry rifle company. In other words, there are no Infantry Divisions that fought along the Upper Rhine during Operation Northwind that have double the number of casualties of either the U.S 12th or 14th Armored Divisions (see appendix \\"U.S 7th Army History\\").Yes, Armored Divisions had 25% of their battle casualties in tank companies. But they only had 9 armored infantry companies per armored division which would take 65% of the casualties in each armored division (see U.S Army Statistical Branch Studies of casualties in Armored Divisions verses Infantry Divisions.)Finally, the only error the Editor, Colonel Keith Bonn made, is that he failed to connect the 2nd phase of \\"Operation Northwind\\" along the Upper Rhine against the U.S 6th Corps (of Anzio fame) and its 12th and 14th Armored Divisions, the legendary 36th,42nd (Task Force Linden),45th,70th (Task Force Herren),79th, and 103rd Divisions; against the re-equipped German 10th SS Panzer, 21st Panzer, 25th Panzer Grenadier Divisions along with the 7th Parachute Division, the 6th SS Mountain Division and 3 German Infantry Divisions and its real purpose to destroy American VI Corps 6 Divisions and Task Forces forces North of Strasbourg on the Upper Rhine Plain, which the German High Command thought Eisenhower was going to cross the Rhine River and attack towards Frankfurt and Stuttgart, as early as late November 1944! Nothing to do with the Ardennes, the German were pulling out on January 8th, 1945 while the 3 entire German Corps challenged the VI Corps from January 5-26th, 1945. See the book \\"Riviera to the Rhine\\" by Dr.Clarke and a sub-chapter entitled 'A Dubious Decision' and the 400 pages of records captured by Soviet Forces south of Berlin at Potsdam where the World War II German Military Records were archived during World War II about Eisenhower's embicilic decision to not let the U.S 6th Army Group put the U.S VI Corps across the Rhine starting November 24, 1944.Again, other German Military Records, up to German OKW; (\\"German War Machine High Command\\", OKH (\\"German Army High Command\\" down to German Divisional military records; that are not available in the U.S National Archives Record Group 242 of \\"Captured Foreign Military Records\\", because they were captured by Russian Forces in Potsdam, near Berlin, at the end of World War II against Nazi Germany and are now stored and available at the open Russian Central Military Archives in Podolsk south of Moscow. Sincerely, Dan Kneeland"},{"Title":"The Final Crisis: Combat in Northern Alsace, January 1945","review":"This memoir/history of Operation Nordwind fills in a gap in the important campaign in Europe during the winter fo 1944/1945. The author does a good job mixing the memoir aspects with the overall coverage of the campaign. He shifts back and forth from areas of the battlefield, but the transitions are smooth and the maps that are included help guide the reader as well as providing an incredible amount of details surrounding the important battles.The author glosses over several important early key battles, such as the Battle of Wingen Sur Moder early in the campaign. Additionally, the examination of the replacement system during 1944 was enlightening, but hampered the start of the book. Overall, this is an excellent overview of the battle and fills a void in military history. I would recommend pairing this book with the Osprey Campaign Series book covering the battle in order to get a better overall look of Operation Nordwind, the final offensive mounted by the Germans in the West."},{"Title":"The Final Crisis: Combat in Northern Alsace, January 1945","review":"I can't really add much to the other reviews, except to say this is a great book for the WWII history buff.

Short on text, it nevertheless provides a general history of the development of computer games, mostly from a British perspective, though information on U.S. and continental European games is included. The majority of the book consists of graphics from individual computer games, from the Age of Empires to Zelda. This could literally have been titled the &quot;A to Z of Computer Games&quot;! Thank goodness for the Index in the back, which allows the reader to look up each game by name and find text and graphics by page number. A table of contents and introduction would have been very useful; the information on the back cover inadequately serves that purpose. The graphics are well reproduced, but I can understand the other reviewer's frustration. There are more than 400 full-color illustrations and less than 20 pages of text. This is more for the person interested in the art of computer game graphics rather than for someone who wants information about the history or the technique."},{"Title":"Computer Game Graphics","review":"Beautifully designed but no content!"},{"Title":"The Shattered Tower","review":"In this second fantasy novel in his Godfall series, Kevin Morris continues the saga of gods and men begun in THE DAWN CHILD as the goddess Aurora's favored young disciple Shar is abducted by the mad, rage-filled Gihar. At the same time, Necros, god of death, resurrects the soul of the goddess Eldritch in the body of the goddess of love as they continue their plot to rule Twilight, the dwelling place of the gods.Although the core of this installment is the search by Aurora and her followers for the missing child, THE SHATTERED TOWER is a multi-themed book that overcomes the inertia that is a not-uncommon characteristic of second-books-in-a-series. It is truly a transitional work, resolving some of the minor threads left dangling in the first book as it introduces a complex seine of new ones. The Primal Deity here is not Sophia, the shining Dawn Child, but her evil sister, The Entity, thus setting the stage for what will undoubtedly be a final confrontation between the two forces at a later time.This is a solidly written fantasy with interesting and well-defined characters who reflect all the strengths and weaknesses humanity is heir to, even when they are supposed to have transcended them. And despite having a \\"cast of thousands,\\" Mr. Morris keeps them all firmly under control and is careful not to let any disappear long enough to be forgotten. There are some fine moments full of irony and action, and from time to time the dialogue sparks with wry humor.His handling of backstory, however, is a little less successful. It would be advisable for those who haven't read THE DAWN CHILD to do so before diving into this book, as most of the major events that lead to the action described here are given too short shrift.Still, both books are sturdy adventures of sword and sorcery and well worth a look."},{"Title":"The Shattered Tower","review":"This book is an excellent follow up to the Dawn Child!

We want a healthy sexual relatonship as an extension of our love for one another, not S/M, multi-partners, lesbian, etc. Mind you, from the book's back cover, the author was &quot;a former manager of Good Vibrations, the &quot;clean well-lighted place to buy sex toys.&quot;&quot;Contents: 1 Safety, somantics, and Sexual Healing 2 Desire and Pleasure 3 Disassociation 4 Self Denial 5 Sexual Response and Anatomy: Information is Power. 6 Masturbation and Self-Healing 7 Consent and Boundaries 8 Partner Sex 9 Oral Sex 10 Penetration 11 Embracing Triggers 12 The Emotions of Healing 13 S/M, Role Playing, and Fantasy 14 Sex Toys and Accoutrements 15 Spiritual Sexuality [Tantra, Yoni massage, Sacred Masturbation; absolutely nothing Judeo-Christian] 16 Intimacy and Self-Forgiveness 17 Partnering with Survivors of Sexual Abuse 18 Your Powerful Sexual Self 19 Bibliography [42 pages; books, videos, centers]"},{"Title":"The Survivor's Guide to Sex: How to Have an Empowered Sex Life After Child Sexual Abuse","review":"The author had written about having S/M sex. What rape victim would find the thought of being bound sexually arousing? Doesn't she know childhood sexual assault brings about great struggles with trust? She wants the rape survivor to trust a spouse or partner to \\"tie them up\\" for sex, when the survivor can't bring herself to feel intimate compassionate love? I was looking for help to restore a loving relationship, instead I read sections on the unthinkable. The use of the \\"F\\" word was disgusting and her terminology for sexual acts were enough to make me want to throw up and forget sex completely. I am fighting to find enjoyment in one of the most beautiful relationships a husband and wife can share. That relationship was destroyed by a rapist and this book with its ugly choice of words and descriptions has only deepened the scarring with its filth."},{"Title":"The Survivor's Guide to Sex: How to Have an Empowered Sex Life After Child Sexual Abuse","review":"This book has some helpful things in it but I did not care for the majority of the contents.

VERY PLEASED WITH DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU ALL."},{"Title":"The Survivor's Guide to Sex: How to Have an Empowered Sex Life After Child Sexual Abuse","review":"as a survivor of rape and sexual abuse, i have read a bunch of books on the aftereffects of assault, being a survivor, et cetera, but most of the stuff out there is pretty dry and basic and i just didn't find it very helpful. this book is direct, incredibly right-on, it gives you hands on techniques for staying present in your body, it includes an amazing discussion of triggering. it also uses down to earth language and is not too self-help-y, and it acknowledges that certain terms might be alienating and medicalizing for some people.FYI: although it is targetted at female survivors of child sexual abuse, i myself am not a woman, and the sexual assault/abuse i experienced occured during my teenage years, not my childhood. i still found the book very useful. there is also a great chapter aimed at partners of survivors."},{"Title":"The Survivor's Guide to Sex: How to Have an Empowered Sex Life After Child Sexual Abuse","review":"For the past eight years, I have been slowly, painstakingly discovering for myself many of the techniques that Staci Haines details in this book. As far as I am aware, I am not a survivor of child sexual abuse, but I have many of the same difficulties - lack of trust, unclear boundaries, easily triggered, difficulty being sexually present.I looked at books on recovery; they seemed only to tell me that it was OK to not have sex. I looked at TONS of books on sex and none addressed my difficulties - until The Survivor's Guide to Sex. I can say from my own experience that it's not easy to put Staci's suggestions into practice, nor do the rewards necessarily come quickly. But for some of us, this is the only way we're going to reclaim our sexuality.I highly recommend this book if you feel numb, shut-down, or angry during sex, whether or not you are a &quot;survivor&quot;. Chances are you have some deep healing work to do, and this book is the only guide I've seen for doing it."},{"Title":"The Survivor's Guide to Sex: How to Have an Empowered Sex Life After Child Sexual Abuse","review":"When I first found this book I was hoping it would be different, as a healing survior I have read alot of help books, and although comforting, they usually told me why I had the problems I did but didnt give me much advice on how to start living and having fun again in life, this book was amazing at that, it was what I had been looking to read since I started wanting to heal!! It would be a great book for anyone wanting good sexual information in a society that dosnt offer that much, I found it straight forward and honest and funny ..great book!! I loooved it!!:)"},{"Title":"The Survivor's Guide to Sex: How to Have an Empowered Sex Life After Child Sexual Abuse","review":"At some point in their healing, all survivors of childhood sexual abuse should read this book. It is straightforward and to the point, and this style helps the survivor feel that sexual feelings and actions are not something to be ashamed of. Many books for survivors tend to coddle the survivor because of the terrible ordeal she underwent, but this one presents a no-holds-barred discussion of sex and provides exercises to become more comfortable with sex. Very important book for the sexual healing process."},{"Title":"The Survivor's Guide to Sex: How to Have an Empowered Sex Life After Child Sexual Abuse","review":"This is a truly extraordinary book. It picks up where other books leave off by helping survivors move beyond the abuse into a fully satisfying life -- a life that re-incorporates sex without the painful associations of the abuse.This book really has it all. It addresses the systemic problems of sexual abuse and sexism in our society and focuses on the particular intersection of these two forces in our sex lives. Haines provides both the context for understanding why it is so difficult for survivors to have an empowered sex life, and the tools to help create that life. And all this in Haines' caring and empathetic voice.This is also a very practical guidebook designed to help survivors in a real way. I particularly liked the exercises Haines has developed, as well as the quotes from survivors. No woman will feel alone in her experience after reading this book.Haines is an extraordinary woman. All survivors are lucky she is there to help us. I definitely recommend you read this book. Right now."},{"Title":"The Survivor's Guide to Sex: How to Have an Empowered Sex Life After Child Sexual Abuse","review":"This book is a explicit guide to sex focusing on helpful instructions for those who have been sexually abused in their childhood. Possibly the greatest strength of this book is its approach to sexuality as something to be enjoyed to the fullest without shame and guilt. The reclaiming of the one's sexuality, sensuality and pleasure is something that often receives far too little attention in psychotherapy. A care free approach to sex is something that obviously is more difficult to obtain for those who have experienced sexuality as a devastating influence in their life. In my opinion, if this book is going to be used as educational material in clinical practice it is important to be aware of the conflicts that may arise the mind of the client who has been sexually abused. Having said this, a free, explorative, empowered experience of sex is a beautiful thing to be striving for, and this book can be of help achieving it."},{"Title":"The Survivor's Guide to Sex: How to Have an Empowered Sex Life After Child Sexual Abuse","review":"Finally! A book about sexual power for survivors of sexual abuse. A far reaching, fun, and accessable look at sexual healing and reclaiming by a gentle and astute teacher. Staci Haines speaks from the soul of the issue, emphasizing self care and adventure. Most importantly, her reccomended exercises help you get the message into your muscles. Not just your head. Which is where too many of us have lived for too long. Brava to you, Staci. A must read for everyone, survivors or not."},{"Title":"The Survivor's Guide to Sex: How to Have an Empowered Sex Life After Child Sexual Abuse","review":"Staci Haines has given millions of people a new possibility for healing their childhood wounds and experiencing sexuality in the way it was meant to be. It is down-to-earth and choked full of valuable insights and information that will support any survivor (or the people who love them) with discovering the richness of unencumbered sexuality which allows for the freedom of the soul. Considering that 1 in 4 of us has suffered the wounding of child sexual abuse you can safely give this book to anyone and know that it will be relevant for them or someone they love. Staci Haines deserves a standing ovation for her courage and talent in writing this book!!"},{"Title":"The Survivor's Guide to Sex: How to Have an Empowered Sex Life After Child Sexual Abuse","review":"This book was so helpful to me. As a victim or molestation when i had just started adolescence, this book helped me understand my bad feelings towards ex, and how to make a relationship sex-positive.

This book gives information about how to stay present during sex. It also helps you work past the feeling that sex is something to be afraid and ashmed of. This book offers straight answers and helpful suggestions to work through all effects left from rape or molestation. This book gives information from the basics (anatomy) to more advanced topics. This book was what I needed to help me with my triggers. I am working slowly through them, but this book has been essential for me. I started seeing a counselor just over a year ago and it took me about 6 months to tell him that I was molested. I was embarassed that I had been molested and raped later. He suggested this book for me. He suggested that I get it and keep it for when I felt safe enough to work on my own sexuality. I am early in the recovery process but feel that this book will be one that I read over and over. I have learned a lot from this book and it helps me communicate with my counselor because it puts names to symptoms. I never really knew how to explain what happened when I hit a trigger until I read this book and had a name to go with the symptom.

It is written by two retired military members, with input from many more, and it shows, because the book is written very much in the style of a Army Field manual, along with few diagrams and no photographs. Which is a problem, because the book also reads as dry and boring as an FM or Army Regulation. Which begs the question: what does this book have to add over military FMs? It does consolidate a lot of army doctrine in one convenient package, and it has a section listing details about various NGOs and GOs that may be encountered during MOOTW (although by no means an exhaustive listing) so it is a useful tool. But part of the reason for buying a civilian book is that it can give fresher perspectives to issues that Army FMs do not address. For example, along with listing the proper procedures for Humanitarian Assistance, Interagency Coordination, and performing a Cordon and Search, the book could illustrate with actual examples of past MOOTW operations, where those procedures suceeded or failed, and how they could have been done differently.Overall, this book is packed with information and sound advice. However, it is not an easy read, and it is also incomplete. It is good as part of a military library, but it cannot stand by itself as the definitive guide to MOOTW."},{"Title":"Guide to Military Operations Other Than War: Tactics, Techniques, & Procedures for Stability & Support Operations Domestic & International","review":"This book is very helpful, especially for Officers like me.

Melville's translation of the \\"Thebaid\\" is a worthwhile addition to the Oxford University Press' \\"World's Classics\\" series (now appearing as \\"Oxford World's Classics\\"). The Roman poet Statius has suffered in modern estimation for not being Virgil, and classical, or Ovid, and romantic. In addition, his story overlapped with a version by Aeschylus (\\"The Seven Against Thebes\\") and Sophocles' three surviving Theban plays, so in the Greeks versus Romans playoffs, the Latin poet was pitted against two geniuses in a different genre.To the Middle Ages, though, Statius was one of the great poets, with adaptations and sequels in vernacular languages. Readers may be familiar with, for example, Chaucer's \\"Knight's Tale,\\" which assumes the Theban war as a background event. There have been only a handful of translations into modern English, however, and only the uninspiring English in the Loeb Classical Library bilingual version has been very readily available. (I tend to be a little wary of Melville's dismissals of the competition in his other translations, but once having forced myself through part of the 1928 Loeb edition then available, I have to agree in this case.)[It should be added that a NEW Loeb edition of Statius, edited and translated by D. R. Shackleton Bailey, is now available, and is NOT included in this observation. Paolo Asso has treated this two-volume publication (which includes the fragment of an Achilles epic) in the on-line \\"Bryn Mawr Classical Review\\" -- which, as of November 8, 2004, has just issued a \\"correct version of BMCR 2004.11.02, Loeb Statius. Thebaid,\\" replacing an accidental repeat of his review of Bailey's edition of Statius' lyrics, the \\"Silvae\\". Asso -- to whom I am indebted for the elegant descripton of Statius as writing Greek poetry in Latin -- has serious concerns with Bailey's treatment of the Latin text. But he finds the translation, taken with its annotations, readable.]From his early (\\"Allegory of Love\\") to his latest (\\"Discarded Image\\") medieval studies, C.S. Lewis was a great champion of Statius, pointing out how congenial and helpful his materialist (astrological) and allegorical (psychological) treatment of the pagan gods was to medieval Christian readers and writers. His approach suggested that \\"un-classical\\" aspects of the poem should be seen as something new and different, not a failure to be Homeric or Virgilian. Melville's translation seems to have stimulated a similar appreciation in \\"The Encyclopedia of Fantasy\\" (Clute and Grant), which gives Statius an article in which he is treated as one of the precursors of modern fantasy.Statius presents the Theban War more as a catalogue of horrors than an heroic romp, and if treated as modern fantasy the epic would mainly fall on the \\"Dark Fantasy\\" side. Moorcock's Elric would be more at home in Statius' version of Greece before the Trojan War than would Tolkien's Aragorn -- although some of the characters in \\"The Silmarillion\\" might find it all depressingly familiar. It is not light reading, but I agree that it is a great poem, neglected far too long.Addendum: There is a new translation by Charles Stanley Ross, \\"The Thebaid: Seven Against Thebes,\\" from Johns Hopkins University Press, announced for December 2004 (not seen)."},{"Title":"Thebaid (The World's Classics)","review":"What can you say, it's a pretty good poem. Of course, there are those people out there who say either you like Statius or you don't. Frankly, I like Statius. This is a very good book to start out with if you're thinking about reading Statius. Personally, I think everyone should be more familiar with him."},{"Title":"Thebaid (The World's Classics)","review":"This is the best, most moving poem I've ever read.

We first meet Babs and Betty Moss at a dolls' tea party in which they discover the clever show dog Sancho foraging for his master Ben, a runaway from the circus. Ben's father had left the circus for a more promising job, intending to send for his son once he was settled. With his father's protection gone, Ben is harshly treated by the circus master and runs away.Arriving soon after the runaways are Celia and her young brother Thornton, returning to their old home after being gone for years. Thorny is weak from a long illness and is wheelchair-ridden and crabby although he admits that Celia is \\"the best sister that ever was\\". She hires Ben to amuse her brother during his convalescence while allowing Babs and Betty, whose mother takes care of the premises, to continue to play house on the porch and path. The kids occupy themselves with botanical expeditions, ship-building, water wheels and other waterworks play, picnics, baseball and archery. Babs loses Sancho at a circus and Betty finds him again in pitiful shape after accompanying Thorny to the dentist. Celia breaks her arm after a fall from her horse and is rescued by Ben. He is gradually weaned away from the roving circus life although Celia invites the school to a splendid birthday party for him where he shows himself in his former circus glory as Cupid on a galloping horse. There is a little trouble with missing money and false accusations but Ben, who is honest and true, gradually endears himself to the two families. Several joyous unions and reunions take place at the end as well as one intended for the future, although in the midst of preparing for one, the incorrigible Babs almost burns down the house under the lilacs. The tone is quaint and old-fashioned but the simple pleasures of life shine through and Ben is both boy-like and engaging."},{"Title":"Under the lilacs (The Beacon Hill book shelf)","review":"I appreciate this company for making so many classic pieces of literature available on the kindle.

But keep the paperback because you probably can't sell it to anyone anyway."},{"Title":"The party's over; the failure of politics in America","review":"David Broder wrote, \\"our government has suffered from crippled leadership, from a slowdown of decision making, an impairment of its vital processes. The result has been an accumulation of unresolved problems and a buildup of public frustration so great that our quintessential American Characteristics- our optimism and self-confidence- have now been shaken. Millions of Americans now feel they have lost control of the government and that government has lost its capacity to act, to respond, to move on the challenges that confront our nation. In an era of rapid and accelerating scientific, technological, social and cultural charge, our governmental and political systems has been operating in superslow motion. Time has not stood still, but the processes of politics have\\".This statement is a tough assessment of the state of our political system. What makes it more remarkable is that it was written forty years ago!Broder takes a look into the failing of the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon presidency.This book is an interesting read and it rekindles how as our nation deals with our problems we have to take a long term view. It is curious that the one particular issue that does not stand out then that we have today is the deficit problems. Even though this book lays the case for a less than stellar outlook of our nation's future, it also shows that even after 40 years after the words were written our nation keeps moving forward."},{"Title":"Principles of Flat Pattern Design","review":"This book is really nice, very informative, laid-out well and its information is very clear and fairly easy to follow. While it's a textbook, and therefore its primary audience is students of design, a skilled sewer will find this book to be very helpful nontheless. It's definitely for the beginner pattern-maker, and that's why it's successful not only as a text book but as a simple instruction book as well.It outlines a brief (i.e. a few paragraphs) history of pattern making. Then it outlines all the tools (oak tag, pattern paper, french curves, hip curves etc.) of pattern making and how those tools are used. Next the book discusses darts, gathers and other ways to fit and add fullness to garments. After these introductions to pattern-making and fitting, MacDonald addresses the basics of EVERY TYPE of garment you will ever want to make! Seriously.She addresses bodices, variations on bodices, darting for different figures, and then goes on to sleeves (variations on sleeves include cowl, raglan, kimono, lantern, leg o mutton and more!). She addresses variations and fitting techniques for the following: bodices, sleeves, necklines, pants, shorts, skirts (every skirt you've ever heard of and some you haven't!), tunics and dresses, collars, cuffs and closures!While some of the techniques are a little outdated fashion-wise, (lantern sleeves and sweet-heart necklines - yuck!) the important thing is that it teaches you how to make EVERYTHING which is great experience nonetheless. And once you're familiar with pattern making for the various pieces - you can use what you've learned to make EXACTLY what you want!This is, in short, a very thorough and clear book."},{"Title":"Principles of Flat Pattern Design","review":"The above reviewer is absolutely correct. This book was a textbook used in two sewing courses I took. It is clearly written, well explained, and well illustrated. It is also very thorough in going through variations for each type of garment. One nice thing about it is that each chapter builds on previous knowledge and incorporates it into the practice designs featured at the end of the chapter. It also features half-size slopers to work with in the back of the book.I would give it four and a half stars if I could. I think four is too low as it so excellently presented, but there is one problem. It is indeed a book for beginners, and it doesn't cover all types of garments. It goes through bodices, skirts, collars, sleeves, a small section on blouses, and pants. It discusses dart manipulation, seamlines and fullness, pleats and tucks, yokes, closures and facings and pockets.It does not discuss bias designs, knits or stretch fabric. Neither is there a section on drafting jackets or coats, which cannot be derived solely from the lessons in the book. The chapter on blouses and dartless torso designs is brief.In short, it is an excellent and highly recommended book for a beginner, but if you are serious about pattern drafting, it won't be the only book you'll ever need. This is why I have Helen Joseph Armstrong's \\"Patternmaking for Fashion Design\\" in my wish list."},{"Title":"Principles of Flat Pattern Design","review":"Great book. Easy to follow. I'm used to working with cm as opposed to inches (so there is a bit of conversion). This book uses a series of codes for particular measurements which are straight forward.What I would really like to see in this book is a section about adjusting the sloper to suit a body shape which is larger (such as the lower hipline) or adjusting darts for a larger size."},{"Title":"Principles of Flat Pattern Design","review":"This book is a wonderful comprehensive textbook for anyway who wants to know how to do their own design work. I would definitely recommend! I also love that it is ring bound!"},{"Title":"Principles of Flat Pattern Design","review":"I bought this book to use in my Flat Pattern I class. Information and instruction are very clear (laid out step-by-step) and techniques are easy to learn. Comes with slopers you can photocopy to use for practice. Note: this is strictly a pattern making book --you will need a companion sewing book to go with this as there are no instructions for how to construct the pieces you design."},{"Title":"Planning Your Pregnancy and Birth, Third Edition","review":"A one-stop goldmine for new parents! After an extensive survey of pregnancy resources, I was very pleased with the most recent edition of Planning Your Pregnancy &amp; Birth. Coming from one of the nation's top authoritaties on OB/GYN care(ACOG), this handbook is ideal for expectant parents, students, healthcare professionals, or anyone wanting to get solid, current pregnancy details. Easy-to-read, comprehensive - with info. ranging from preconception to postpartum to pregnancy loss - and chocked full of clear illustrations and graphs, this resource contains loads of helpful tips in every section (including checklists) and includes a section on new father issues. Terms with easy-to-understand definitions, more charts, and a fill-in section for you to keep track of your pregnancy, are all included in the back of this book. I also found the smaller size and paperback version (fits easily in most purses &amp; briefcases) to be a handy alternative to many of the larger, bulkier options on the market today. Get this book and you won't need any others!"},{"Title":"Planning Your Pregnancy and Birth, Third Edition","review":"By a friend's recommendation, I bought \\"what to expect when you are expecting\\". As she said, this is a \\"pregnancy bible\\". But I actually like this book -- \\"planning your pregnancy and birth\\" much better.This book is clear, well-organized, and practical. I have a busy schedule. Also my reading speed is fairly slow since English is not my native language. So I appreciate the conciseness and yet still completeness of \\"planning ...\\". On the other hand, \\"What to expect ...\\" book has 130 more pages with smaller prints. It's also hard for me to find related topics in \\"what to expect\\" book, which according to my very personal opinion, has too much information and has too much useless talk."},{"Title":"Planning Your Pregnancy and Birth, Third Edition","review":"This book is perfect for expecting moms. It is free of the ideology of the books by Sears and the &quot;what to expect&quot; crowd. Instead, it is a simple, &quot;just the facts&quot; look at pregnancy, birth, and newborn infancy. If you get only one pregnancy book, this is absolutely the one I recommend. It will put your mind at ease."},{"Title":"Planning Your Pregnancy and Birth, Third Edition","review":"I got this book and \\"what to expect...\\" and the other one was so negative and discouraging that i almost always put it down and it literally drove me to tears a few times. =I found this book to be more useful. This book covers all the essentials and doesn't dwell on all the catastrophes that can strike. It is encouraging, very educational and covered just about every question or concern i had. I don't know why \\"what to expect\\" is such a hit but i'm so glad my doctor's office gave out this one instead."},{"Title":"Planning Your Pregnancy and Birth, Third Edition","review":"More complete and factual information that What to Expect, which is a joke.While I realize that this book was published by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and not Midwives Alliance of North America, it is pretty despicable to focus on a completely medicalized birth situation. It doesn't glorify doctor friendly methods of birth such as c-sections per se, but there seems to be no mention of how a birth with minimal medical intervention would actually work in the hospital. It repeatedly uses the phrase \\"if you choose pain relief...\\" and covers the following events. It never points to what happens or what methods can be used for one avoiding medical pain relief and other types of intervention.If you go into labor and all you have read is this book, you will be familiar with the medical procedure facts and risks (i.e. an epidural can slow down labor, risks of general anesthesia, anesthesia procedures, etc.) but does NOT give any advice about making informed choices about the direction of the birth. It does not say how any of these interventions can be avoided. It barely indicates that you will be making ANY specific choices aside from accepting the vague notion of \\"pain relief\\". It's like you are totally on board for the whole slew of possible interventions or you are not.I do not believe obstetricians are simply medical technicians. They should be familiar with the idea of a woman giving birth without numerous drugs and tools to regulate the mechanical and biochemical functions of her body like some kind of machine.My favorite part of the book:\\"Some fathers do not want to be in the delivery room during labor and birth. Even if your partner's not there for the big event he can still give you support in other ways. He can come with you to prenatal checkups and take you to the hospital when you are in labor, for instance\\"Gee, that's super nice of Dad to cart you off to the hospital when you are about to give birth! That's even better than taking a taxi!But seriously, pease look at The Whole Pregnancy Handbook by Dr. Joel Evans, an OB.It is great because it gives you the same objective factual information about pregnancy and labor Planning your Pregnancy does, while also offering information for those who embrace alternative medicine. If you plan on having a scheduled c-section or an epidural, don't worry about this book making you feel guilty. It won't. The excellent and practical advice about dealing with the many symptoms of pregnancy that has helped me a lot. It is about integrating natural methods and choices into conventional medicine, not rejecting it wholesale. The books subtitle says it all and separates it from other natural birth-aware books: \\"An Obstetrician's Guide to Integrating Conventional and Alternative Medicine Before, During and After Pregnancy\\""},{"Title":"Planning Your Pregnancy and Birth, Third Edition","review":"This book is loaded with great information, but I just wish some of it were more up to date. After ordering it, I did realize there was another edition from 2005 - I'd recommend picking that one up (or an even newer one, if available) instead.It's very easy to read, but sometimes I feel like the intended audience is a kid. I'm not a doctor, but I'm also not a ten-year-old, you know?All in all, I'd still recommend it as a valuable resource."},{"Title":"Planning Your Pregnancy and Birth, Third Edition","review":"I found this book in perfect condition at a Goodwill while browsing through their maternity section, for an entirely different book, and was immediately attracted to it when I opened it and began to read. I'm almost 7 Months pregnant with my first child and I found it to be a breath of fresh air from the \\"What to expect...\\" books.This book takes you on a tour of your own body, with pictures and concise descriptions of how things work and why, even pre-pregnancy drawings - showing exactly how everything comes together to allow one to get pregnant to begin with.It covers all of the common symptoms I've experienced as well as some a haven't and even tips and hints on how to prevent the discomfort from continuing (such as heartburn, nausea, loss of breath during routine activities...ect). The drawings and descriptions throughout this book are simple and yet not at all \\"brushed over\\".It's not about hiding the possibility of bad things happening during pregnancy or labor/delivery, or about accentuating them into worrisome ideas that'll keep you up at night; It simply states what all complications are possible, what are common, and what course of action is typically taken to adjust to a rising complication.I REALLY like how it goes into great detail concerning the different types of pain management available, from breathing techniques to epidurals and types given during c-section. I've run into a lot of pregnancy books trying to find the right one for me but this one REALLY has it all. Even a dummies check-list for 1st timers like me, ppl who have heard to pack & bring a bag to the hospital, but can't think past 3 items what could possibly go into it! I will ABSOLUTELY be getting this book for my best friend when she has her baby and for my cousins who're currently pregnant. Totally worth the $5 I spent on it; I would have spent $30 without batting an eye for how informative and fantastic this book is!"},{"Title":"Planning Your Pregnancy and Birth, Third Edition","review":"I received this book from my ob-gyn at my first pregnancy appointment. I had been reading the What to expect book and wasn't that fond of it. This book is so easy to read and understand. I have learned so much from it and would highly recommend it to other expectant moms."},{"Title":"Now You Care","review":"After seven years, environmental poet Di Brandt has released her fifth book of poetry. She's won numerous awards for her writing including the CAA National Poetry Prize. Now You Care is a poignant piece with its message beginning with the cover: power lines with green skeletons. You can't help but be effected from beginning to end.Now You Care is potent at times but deceptively safe. Brandt doesn't overstep any bounds into the grotesque. The flow of words is unhampered by periods giving it a feel of a conversation. Her imagery is vivid.Brandt words stab at what we know is true but often ignore because we are so unaffected until our bubble is popped and someone we love or even ourselves is put through an ordeal for lives. While Brandt words can sometimes be harsh and distracting from the real issue they are a wake up call to the world around us. The world we all live in.She talks a lot about breast victimization; it makes me wonder if someone close to her has lived through breast cancer for her to catch this topic by its heart. Now You Care isn't all doom and gloom, ok it mostly is.Throughout I kept wondering if she followed her own advice or if she contributes to the breakdown of the environment like everyone else (I didn't see anywhere that the book was printed on recycled paper for instance.) Everything from the conglomerates to politics is fare game. Especially America and Bush (\\"the enemy, their king will release us from her untimelyabandonment, like the Pharoah, like Herod, like Hitler, like Bush...\\")Now You Care is a wonderful read, a reminder of what we've done, what we should do and the cost of ignorance. At times it comes across a preachy but there's no way to approach the subject without that angle. Beautiful words, harsh lessons, worth reading. Reviewed by M. E. Wood"},{"Title":"Blade Runner (BFI Modern Classics)","review":"This is indeed an excellently written &quot;little&quot; book on Blade Runner. I do feel, however, that the material on the film's inception is too drawn-out and that the rather more &quot;interesting&quot; exposition and analysis of the film remains far too cursory. BR deals with a myriad of themes and tropes, such as the recurring EYE theme. Bukatman mentions many instances where EYES occur and mentions a possible significance, but does explore it (or many other themes) in depth, eg. its relation to SCOPOPHILIA or SPECTATORSHIP, etc. Admittedly, it is small pocket-sized book, and it is worth the money, but if you desire an in-depth analysis of the film, this is not the book to purchase IMHO."},{"Title":"Blade Runner (BFI Modern Classics)","review":"Like many movies reviewed in the British Film Institute series, Blade Runner did not start off strong at the box office. Coming on the heels of Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Blade Runner offered movie goers a much bleaker view than they had complacently grown accustomed to in the few years preceding its release. Instead of cute aliens and a disco-inspired cantina, we got rebellious androids who kill humans and bounty hunters who hunt them down in the street of a Los Angeles that looks like the earth split open and vomitted upward.Although this dark vision of the near future might not have resonated with viewers at the time, Blade Runner gained its audience over time as people saw through the surface and started asking some deeper questions. This volume by Scott Bukatman addresses some of these issues as well.This book is broken down into three parts, the first of which is a general overview of the making of the movie. It is the next two sections, however, that are more interesting, although Bukatman has a tendency to digress into typical movie analysis babble that will probably be offputting to most potential readers. Fortunately, this does not undermine the better parts of this book.The second section discusses the role that cities themselves have played in cinema and how Blade Runner taps into and contributes to that history. For much of science fiction, cities were places of potential utopia in the perfected world of the future. Of course, darker versions existed and Blade Runner itself is a return to a more dystopian vision.The best is saved for last as the third section discusses replicants (the androids in the movie) and addresses the issue of what really makes humans human. This is a topic with tremendous potential to devolve into the absurd and laughable at the drop of a sentence. Thankfully, Bukatman's take is more intelligent and accessible. If the rest of the book had been this good, my rating would have been higher and I would recommend this book based on this section alone.I have read enough of the BFI monographs to have seen the gamut, with some being exceptional and others being ridiculous. BLADE RUNNER may not be as good as the best ones in the series I have read. But for fans of the movie, it is certainly worthwhile."},{"Title":"Blade Runner (BFI Modern Classics)","review":"I think that this movie is loaded with symbolism and it takes more than one sitting to catch all of the references. It definitely relays a message about government and religion, as well as human nature. I am certain that there could be an entire college course, just studying this movie. I can't say that the movie is entertaining or pleasant to watch, but it is definitely a classic."},{"Title":"Blade Runner (BFI Modern Classics)","review":"Blade Runner is my favorite movie, and this is one of the best books on a film I've ever read. The comparisons with other sci-fi films and post-modernism are very interesting. There is also a lot of information on how the film was made."},{"Title":"Blade Runner (BFI Modern Classics)","review":"I have only one criticism of this otherwise outstanding exploration of BLADE RUNNER: it is a tad slow in getting to the best bits. While all of it is informative and insightful, the last quarter contains some of the best film criticism I've read in a considerable period of time. I love Paul Sammons's FUTURE NOIR, but it is more about the nitty gritty of making the film, while this is instead on what the movie is about. This book does for BLADE RUNNER what Bukatman's book TERMINAL IDENTITY does for cyberpunk and other novels of the eighties dealing with cyber reality. Bukatman's reflections on BLADE RUNNER are as relevant to Philip K. dick's books as to the film.I want to add a general comment about the target audience for the book. A number of the reviews are by people who are not among the book's target audience. I'm not sure why people would try to review a book that is outside their field. Paul Sammon's book, as excellent as it is, is for a less specialized, more general audience. Someone who recommends that book, as nice as it is, is missing the point of a scholarly assessment of a film. If you aren't in film studies or not comfortable reading scholarly discussions of cinema, you probably shouldn't be reading this book. And it is hardly a criticism of the book in calling it a film studies book when that is precisely what it is. That is like criticizing an atlas because it if filled with maps instead of photographs.This is an outstanding film criticism book. If that is what you want, you will absolutely not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Blade Runner (BFI Modern Classics)","review":"This is an very good resource; I used it to prepare resources for my secondary school students.
