The author really does his homework, and we get a glimpse of that society with many or most of its warts on full display. Here we see the old Soviet Union as what it was; a deeply flawed system under the control of a corrupt bureaucracy made up of, yes, corruptible human beings. We also get a glimpse of how Soviet citizens tended to perceive Americans and Westerners. This achievement is not a negligible one. Incidentally, in this novel Westerners are not portrayed in a particularly favorable light. In fact, the overall theme of this novel could reasonably be said to follow the old aphorism: \\"The problem with Communism is Communism. The problem with Capitalism is Capitalists.\\"As a whodunnit, this one is not bad. Detective Arkady Renko is a sympathetic character. The author's writing style is somewhat murky, but he overcomes this with a wry sense of humor and a gritty realism. If you are interested in the old Soviet Union, or just like an off-beat detective novel, do not pass this one up."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"This is, quite simply, the greatest novel of the last century. Not only is this a work of literary genius, the recorded reading by Henry Strozier is exceedingly well done.Buy this, read it, read it once a year till you die.Jon"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"The author introduces the reader to crime fighting in the USSR. In a land of subversion, and deceit, our hero is an earnest, truthful, and non malleable cop. The book captures the nuances of Soviet, and Russian humor. I was literally laughing out loud in the middle of a crime novel. It was fantastic. The characters are richly drawn, and tell the tales of living in the USSR at the height of the Cold War. I will certainly add him amongst my must reads: Harry Bosch, Lucas Davenport, Elvis Cole, and Jack Reacher."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"The first of Martin Cruz Smith's Arkady Renko series of novels. Renko is a detective in Moscow, and comes across what appears to be a serial killer. This killler removes the faces and hands of victims to prevent identification.This leads to a gripping hunt for the maniac, and Arkady uses the services of a forensic anthropologist to reconstruct a face to help him track down the killer."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Near the end of Chapter 11, Renko experiences a sharp pang of discomfort as the girl he has entangled in his investigation of three murders puts a cigarette out against the bark of a birch tree, &quot;as if the warm stab were being pressed into his heart. He believed her. The truth had gone from her into the tree and into him.&quot; This is the quality of writing that we get from Martin Cruz Smith. His facility with language balances with his storycraft to produce a compelling, dramatic espionage thriller that stands against the best work of Le Carre or Fredrick Forsyth."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Arkydy Renko, an honest hard working, conscientious, public investigator, fights his way through a maze of evil and hostile characters, the cunning, ruthless American entrepreneur, Osborne, his own corrupt boss, Yamskoi and major Preblida, the KGB man. He is after the ruthless killer of three young people, found in frozen Gorky Park, shot at point- blank- range, their faces and fingertips obliterated.. He is helped along the way by the brother of one of the slain men, a young American idealist. Curwell, a New York detective, fluent in Russian, joins hands reluctantly with Arkydy to revenge his brother's murder.Arkydy, by brilliant reasoning and with help from his love, Arina Ossinova, entangles the Sable fur trade, the labyrinth of KGB, and bureaucracy of FBI, tracks down the killer all the way to New York City. Here detective Curwell teams up with him to go after Osborne. But Osborne knows the score and book ends with an unforgettable scene where Arkydy fulfilling his task, limps back to Moscow. He tells Arina, his accomplice and love,who sells her very soul to come to America, to go disappear in America, where she belongs.The book sheds light on dark, Byzantine, bad old days of Soviet Union where every body spied on every body and KGB ruled supreme. I guess peoplelike Arkydy, the optimistic, very human chief investigator, turned the Soviet r&eacute;gime around and created another revolution seventy years after the brutal first, paving the way for democracy."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I found this book, hardback (first edition, second reprinting) in a charity shop for 49 pence (approx 75 cents US). Heard about the book and film, thought I should buy because I was going to the laundry that night.It was hard to put down. The intrigues, the complex plot and a richly expressed tapestry of Moscow and Muscovites.It was rich in Characters, Dialogue, Plot and Sub-plots. I took it on trains, on busses, in laundries everywhere there was an opportunity to read.It was great having a hardbook, it made me appreciate books much more than I usually do.Gorky Park has to go down as a modern classic, in a hundred years time, I guess, people will still be reading this.Check out your local charity shops, you'll never know what you may find. In the meantime, buy this book here."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I've read this book more times than I can count. It possesses an intriguing and complicated plot, extraordinarily well-developed and interesting characters, gives an amazing portrayal of Soviet Moscow, and is exciting and suspenseful. I highly recommend it. Main character Arkady Renko is both brilliant and cynical. He was interesting to read about, and was one of the reasons I liked the book so much. The book has many good elements-love, friendship, death, corruption, greed, suspense, and the violence that comes with the position of Chief Investigator of Moscow, which Renko holds. The KGB is heavily involved, it seems, and Arkady wonders if they are laying a trap for him. (His earlier attempt at arresting Major Pribluda of the KGB for the assassinations of the \\"Kliazma River\\" bodies and his thinly disguised comtempt for the Party and its machinations give them a motive for this action.) The plot has many twists and turns, and by the end of the book, the KGB, Moscow Militia, FBI, and an NYPD officer are all involved, in a complicated and satisfying plot stretching all the way around the world to the U.S. Two other books I have read and enjoyed are \\"The Monkey House\\" and \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\". I also enjoyed other books by John Le Carre (Gorky Park was every bit as good as \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" and as good as le Carre's astounding \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\", though Tinker Tailor was more difficult to understand and required more concentration on my part). In addition, I liked every book I have read by this author, Martin Cruz Smith--Polar Star, Red Square, Havana Bay (all which are in the Gorky Park series) Stallion Gate, and Rose. If you liked any of those books, I'm sure you will like Gorky Park."},{"Title":"The Haunted Computer and the Android Pope","review":"I'm not sure what the other reader was reading, but I think he missed the point.Ray Bradbury is one of the best poets I have ever read"},{"Title":"The Haunted Computer and the Android Pope","review":"I ran across a copy of this collection while just looking around the poetry section at my local library. I was a bit surprised to see it, since so many of the great poets aren't represented (pound leaps to mind). I had to read it to see what kind of poet bradbury is. He's an excellent fiction writer, i think Fahrenheit 451 is one of the better books written. His poetry, on the other hand, is horrible. When he rhymes, he rhymes poorly. He tends to drag his poems on a bit (the only poet i can think of who has a greater fear of ending a poem is ginsberg, but the only howl you'll find in this collection is the one coming from the reader). His \`ode to ty cobb' is a great example. The poem starts off ok, and has a lot of potential, but bradbury beats the idea to death. Too long (reminds me of one of the poems in the book \`too much' \`Too much beauty/Too much delight/ Too much of sun' /Too much did he write). You will find some interesting titles, such as \`Shakespeare the Father, Freud the Son' (ah, the potential that title has) and \`Good Shakespeare's Son, the Typing Ape.' and you'll actually find the line \`Hark, we muttered.' i can only hope that mr bradbury decides to stay away from poetry and stick to fiction for the rest of his career. other bad poets: joey froelich (but his work i like in some sick way) and, oh, leonard nimoy, and jimmy stuart."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I give this book one star, only because I can't give it any less. The reason for the low rating is very much as others have stated, so I won't bother playing that old record. I do however have something new to report.According to Hamilton's PR woman, those who did not enjoyed ID are secretly masochists who loved the book but wanted to hate it.Here is a direct quote from Hamilton's PR woman on Hamilton's own message board:By Ddecember, on Sunday, June 12, 2005 - 08:13 pm:Besides, that minority is really loving the books. Why else would someone read something they state they hate? Perhaps they are masochists and enjoy causing themselves pain or because they don't hate it. They like it, but at some level they don't want to like it and it makes them uncomfortable with themselves. They cannot accept that some part of themselves enjoys it. So they come out and try to trash others, the books and the author, who do not share their self-loathing.(This is me, Corrina, now)So to all those who did not like ID, you aren't fooling anyone. You really do like ID, admit it. You don't want to enjoy it because of the ranchy sex, bad editing, and complete spiral of a once decent series, but we all know the truth, just come out and say it."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was very excited about this book when I read the dust jacket--Anita asks for help to solve a case? Wow! Sounds great.Too bad the book was about something else. The mystery plot is almost nonexistant and is NOT resolved by Anita at the end. The relationships and angst talk take up much of the book. Also, sex. Please be aware that the sex includes bestiality and mentions of vomit. The sex is gross. It is so gross, so frequent, so out of character that it is sordid and boring and icky instead of sexy. (And I read erotica!)I have never seen so many typos in a book before. Mispellings, grammar errors, missing words, even font problems. Did no one read this before it went to press?I read in an interview that Hamilton keeps up the sex because she is being \\"contrary\\" (her own words) because NY thinks women shouldn't write sex from a woman's point of view. I find this insulting--is she unaware that New York has whole publishing divisions devoted to erotica written by women? She calls herself \\"contrary\\" again in her own blog. Is she really petty enough to destroy her own series to get back at unhappy fans, as her blog says? Apparently. I had hoped to give her the benefit of the doubt, and assume Incubus Dreams was so terrible because she had been rushed somehow by her publisher. I no longer think so. Too bad, because these books were really good once upon a time.I will not buy another one of these books."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm fairly certain, at this point, that the \\"arduer\\" killed the series.At first, it seemed like a decent plot twist. I was looking forward to how someone so straitlaced as Anita would deal with having to have sex all the time when she's not in love with anyone at the moment. But since Narcissus in Chains, the experiment has failed. I was slightly guarded at the idea of bringing in ANOTHER guy for Anita in the form of Micah, but he's so absent from the series that he's really just another notch on Anita's belt. IN Cerulean Sins, i was hopeful when we started seeing manifestations of Bella Morte and the Mother of Darkness, and was looking forward to how Anita would deal with 2 new threats who at leasted posed a challenge to her ever growing powers. But, sadly, no, this book was virtually devoid of plot. I hunger for the days when the books would be driven by a police investigation, or a monster crisis, with Anita's personal stuff as the subplot, or at least intertwined in the same plot thread. Her and Richard having sex in Blue Moon served a significant purpose in relation to the plot. Her screwing Byron and Requiem served NO purpose.I guess what angered me most about this book, was that I felt i was sort of misled or lied to. The cover jacket entices us with a description of Vampire Serial killers and dead strippers, as do the advertisements on TV and on websites, but the actual time spent in the book on that plot is next to nill. I think the only reason we were even treated to a scene at Animators, Inc, was so Laurell could have Anita screw at work. Gotta change locations, or else the constant sex might get mundane. At the rate the series is going, Laurell's going to have to start making Anita do girls, she's running out of men. Course, I suppose not, when you run low you can just manifest more Byrons and Requiems.I'd switch over to the Merry Gentry series, but that ones getting no better.I'll purchase the next Anita Blake novel, but if its just more sex scenes and no plot, then I'm done."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Having loved this series, the last two books (Narcissus in Chains and Cerulean Sins) were utter disappointments. So I picked up Incubus to give Anita one last shot. this was the worst of the bunch.I will say that despite the 600+ pages, it is quite a fast read because one can just skip between the repetitive and monotonous \\"audeur inspired\\" sex scenes for the few pages that actually had something to do with the plot.This series started out as something I couldn't put down. Now it's just something to avoid."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams by Laurell K. Hamilton, the latest effort in the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series, is a big disappointment for me. I used to be a rabid fan but not anymore. I expected the author to deliver on her stated intent to fix the series that she damaged with the publication of Narcissus In Chains. Ms. Hamilton acknowledged that she never should have given Anita the ardeur. She also said it was a mistake forcing the events of the book in order to allow her to add a new major character that she admitted she didn't want to take the time to develop. The series has suffered since NIC for those reasons. It should be put out of its misery with Incubus Dreams.Incubus Dreams is no more than sex wrapped around a very thin crime plot. In actuality, the ardeur has become the plot and the minimal pages given to the crime are only justification for leaving \\"Vampire Hunter\\" in the subtitle. When asked about the amount and type of sex in ID, Ms. Hamilton admitted that she was contrary and the more New York told her a woman couldn't write that kind of sex the more she had to do it. Well, guess what Ms. Hamilton. New York was right. You can't write that kind of sex. Not because you're a woman, but because you can't write sex. Period. The sex in this book is cold and lifeless. It falls more into the category of rutting because as much as Anita claims to \\"love\\" most of the men she has sex with, love doesn't enter the equation. The long awaited threesome of Jean Claude, Richard and Anita reads like a sex manual not an act of love and delayed consummation. Anita adds Nathaniel, a character she sees as a damaged boy, to her sex stable because basically, God told her to through her psychic therapist Marianne. If you are looking for hot, steamy sex you won't find it in this book. You'd fare better looking up the \\"Erotica\\" section on this site and choosing blindly.Jean Claude, once the intriguing bad boy and master manipulator, has had his fangs pulled. Anita is his Human Servant and she supposedly loves him but he is continually pushed further down the list of importance in her life. Micah, who waltzed in in NIC and stepped into her affections and life without earning his place, has supplanted Jean Claude as number one. Nathaniel, who lives with Anita and Micah and sleeps in the same bed with them, lands in second place. In addition to being Anita's \\"pomme de sang,\\" Nate is her \\"wife\\" keeping house when he isn't working as a stripper in one of Jean Claude's clubs. Richard, Ulfric of the St. Louis werewolf pack doesn't even make it on the list. He is reduced to begging for Anita's forgiveness every time he opens his mouth and compromising his own scruples by agreeing to \\"feed\\" Anita's ardeur every three days. Asher is only referred to and never seen. The plot endings from Cerulean Sins are totally ignored.The editing is nonexistent. Spelling and grammatical errors abound. YAABIs (an acronym for Yet Another Anita Blake Inconsistency - yes, the inconsistencies are so routine throughout the series that fans have a name for them) are everywhere. The use of certain words and phrases are so repetitive that it is distracting. Ms. Hamilton has also fallen into the habit of writing the same thing three different ways in the same paragraph as well as repeating something 3 times for emphasis. Both techniques I admit to using in school to pad reports and essays but very annoying when used by a professional writer.Do not waste your money on this book. Do not waste your money on this boring book. Do not waste your money on this long, boring book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Too much sex, not enough action.I'm an avid fan and highly disappointed where the series is going.I hope it gets back on track or I can find another series to peak my interest."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Well . . . what has happened here?

If you are a completest, as am I, you will, unfortunately, be unable to pass up the next Blake book no matter how bad we know it will be. We shall suffer together.Beyond the abundance of errors, both editorial and the just plain \\"WHAT?\\" factor, the biggest error of all was the title of the book. Rather than Incubus Dreams, it should have been Succubus Dreams.For those of you NOT paying attention in Sunday school, Incubus: male who feeds off female sexuallity. Succubus: female who feeds off male sexuality. Anita seems to have to feed off every male in the area, that makes her a SUCCUBUS. Get it, psuedo-editors? Where is the male nightmare in this . . . story?Her need for sex has become boring in the extreme. I don't know, can we go perhaps six chapters without sex? Oooo-oooo, I know, how about a book about a vampire executioner named Anita Blake? You know, she could KILL VAMPIRES AND S**T !!??!!I cannot even express how disappointed I am in the direction of this series.

The last novel (Merry Gentry one) was a major disappointment (all sex and absolutely NO PLOT--not an exaggeration, either). She definitely had to have plot in this one. I mean, how could she write 650 pages of nothing but sex scenes? Well, ladies and gentlemen, call Believe It or Not! because she did. Okay, I'll be fair, about 600 pages were nothing but sex, the rest was plot.The story starts off promising. Anita is serving, on the grooms side--tux and all--in Larry's wedding. She gets a phone call at the reception to attend to a murder scene where a stripper was murdered by muliple bites of a vampire. This is where I got really excited. I was thinking to myself, \\"Yea! Plot! The old LKH is BACK! Then on page 30, give or take a few, begins the sex. Then there is more and more, and by the way, MORE sex by multiple partners, places, times. It's not even good sex, just the same old thing-but different partners. Then around page 600, she solves the murders. AUGH!Something has got to change. I want my old Anita BACK!

I like well written sex scenes as much as the next red-blooded woman. I like well-integrated plot sex. Jacqueline Carrey wrote some titillating plot sex in her Kushiel series and knew precisely when it needed to fade into the background and when it needed to come to the fore (pardon the pun).This is a lesson that Ms. Hamilton could stand to learn, that just because Anita Blake can do a thing does not mean she should do a thing... or a vampire... or a wereleopard... or the entire male population of St. Louis, human or other.I found the constant sex dull, truth to tell. It did not titillate in the least. It told me nothing new about the character of Anita or the struggles she is going through. It did nothing to advance the meager plot buried under all that flesh. I'm not sure why a plot was attempted as it was superflous to everything else going on.Yes, Anita Blake is trying to come to terms with her 'otherness'. Yes she is now caught in the grip of this silly 'arduer' and has to struggle against its urges - well, she might try to struggle but she doesn't. The twin states of whinging about her guilt over all the sex she's having and the actual having of the sex all the time are not character growth by any stretch of the imagination.'Character growth', by its very definition, means Anita actually learns something from her experiences and changes, hopefully for the better, not that she finds yet a new position and a new sex partner. Not so much with the learning and changing there, after plowing through 600 odd pages.Ms. Hamliton really is a better writer than this. Not Michael Chabon better or Elizabeth Moon better, but better than Incubus Dreams. As an example, in Obsidian Butterfly she actually flirted with deeper characterizations and motives for Anita and Edward (which were subsequently killed by the fact her editors seem to hide under their desks when one of her manuscripts hit their office in all its first draft glory).The first several books were fun reads - Anita was a snappy, strong woman dealing with a frightening and amoral world. Then it all went to the dump in a soiled handbasket with Cerulean Sins and now Incubus Dreams where the character has apparently worked hard to earn her new soubriquet 'Anita Blake, Vampire Humper'. The 'arduer' is a ridiculous and tedious plot device used to introduce sex because Ms. Hamilton felt she had to live up to some imagined challenge. I would have had a lot more respect if she'd found a different, more interesting and arresting method of answering that challenge. Because you can do a thing does not mean you have to do a thing.If there's going to be sex in my fiction, great! Bring it on. But it should be better than the offerings on the alt.sex news groups and it should be plot related. It should tell me something new and interesting about the character. It should reveal something about the motivations, feelings and emotions of others in relation to the main character. It should not be sex for the sake of sex.Is the sex merely a cover for the fact that Anita Blake is now overpowered and Ms. Hamilton has no idea what to do with her or how to legitimately tone her down? Is it that the Big Bads big enough and bad enough to legitmately threaten Anita are only ancient vampires and gods? That, too, can become boring very fast.Beyond that the spelling mistakes, the continuity errors, the constant repetition of points and metaphors made ad nauseum in previous paragraphs and chapters are egregious and her editors should be ashamed of themselves for not doing a better job. I mean, doesn't one person among them use spell check, for all love?I doubt whether Micah will be an improvement and, like Incubus Dreams, I'll wait until I can pick up the paperback at the used book store.

Don't get me wrong I'm not a prude by any means, if that was what I was planning on buying. This novel rather than being titillating was only irritating.I think a few people got murdered by vampires.... I really couldn't tell you how it ended. 3/4 of the way through (I'm either a little slow or just too stupidly hopeful) I realize there really isn't going to be a plot or at least something that didn't involve Anita having sex with someone.

These books were once filled with suspense, action (of the gorey, non-sexual, kind), mystery, a tad bit of sexual tension and romance, great believable (at least personality-wise) characters who were likable and amazing plots. The series takes a turn for the worst around book 10 (in my opinion) and just keeps going downhill. If you want a book filled with meaningless, boring, unerotic, gross, repetitive sex scenes, this book is for you.The editing in the book is almost non-existent, both story-wise (sugestions to cut this scene here or change that scene there) and technical language-wise (grammar and spelling). Incubus Dreams reads like a rough, rough, rough draft. The \\"main\\" plot line is left unresolved at the end of the book, and for a 658-page book, that says nothing good; especially since the Anita Blake books are supposed to be able to be read as stand-alone novels, with their own individual plots and conflicts. There are new characters galore introduced and many characters introduced in the last couple of books before this aren't even mentioned, one character spends the entirety of the book asleep, and many plot lines from previous books are treated like they never happened (the Mother of All Darkness is one of them that I looked forward to quite a bit, and I don't even remember if she was mentioned or not).I don't like many of the old characters anymore because everyone around Anita is now damaged/abused and dependent upon her for their own happiness. I don't like many of the new characters because they aren't very developed; there are just too many of them for them to be adequately formed as individuals. They're STRANGERS. AND many of these STRANGERS have now had sex with Anita. Just shows you how her standards dropped and her morals disappeared, although she still complains and whines and hates herself - just as Richard still hates himself and his beast, too. The book still deals with a raging ardeur, which was as needless and shameless an example of a contrived \\"plot\\" device as I ever saw. Anita has developed new powers that are ridiculous and make the possibility of suspense in any of the future books nil. For example: the \\"wishing\\" power. Anita \\"wishes\\", it is done. No way will any of Anita's problems ever bother her again because she can just \\"wish\\" them away.I really had to fight myself just so I could finish SKIMMING the book. I could put it down with remarkable ease, because I knew that there wasn't going to be much happening. There just wasn't the usual PULL that the books have. I wouldn't even give this book a one-star rating, but that's as low as Amazon will go."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"For those who are interested, actual plot can be found in chapters 1 through 10 and chapters 61 through 82. That's a grand total of 204 pages out of 658 that contain actual plot and story. As for the other 454 pages...From her dedication, \\"If Jon hadn't sat with me and made me do [the rewrite], you might never have seen this book,\\" it's clear that she had a rough time with ID. The fact that she spent so much time writing sex scenes that did nothing to advance the plot and very little to advance character development tells me that she thought she had a decent idea, but either it petered out on her, or she got socked with a deadline and writer's block at the same time.Worse still, it's clear that this should have gone through at least two more rounds of editing, if for no other reason than to remove chapters 11 through 60 and turn them into a separate book. But there were, in fact other, more compelling reasons for additional edits. In more than one place, LKH would start several sentences in a paragraph with the same word (e.g. just, apparently and so on). There were other places where a sentence should have come out, because she repeated the information soon after, and it wasn't for emphasis. Misspellings abounded (it's d-e-i-t-y, not d-i-e-t-y, and it's s-u-a-v-e, not s-a-u-v-e), and did I mention the fact that over 400 pages could have come out without killing the basic plot?On the plus side, Anita seems to be growing up...I had no desire to slap her throughout the entire book (only during the first 150 pages or so). Also nice is the fact that even in the middle of the sex fest, there is memorable writing and some extremely funny lines. The wit that drew me to LKH's writing in the first place is still very much there, but with each book, she continues to write herself into a corner with regard to Anita's power and abilities."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am a serious fan of the Anita Blake series.

OB was probably the last well-written Anita Blake novel. Since then, we got NIC, CS, and now this.Look, I'm not naive. I'm intelligent and well-read. I do understand the concept of character development. But this is ridiculous. How can you develop a character that you've totally destroyed? Anita was the butt-kicking vampire hunter who was torn between fighting the monsters and loving the monsters. Now she's the Federal Marshal who pretty much sleeps with the monsters and doesn't do a whole lot of Federal Marshalling.I liked the drama and depth of Anita pre-NIC. Yes, Anita had sex. Yes, Anita had sex with JC and Richard. And yes, she was utterly confused. Now we add Micah, Jason, Asher, Nathaniel, and Gods know who else will be next! And the \\"erotic\\" writing isn't even very erotic. I read erotica. If you want erotica that's good, check out Laura Antoniou. If you want good horror/sci-fi writing, look elsewhere as well. This series is failing in both genres, especially with the numerous editing mistakes. GET A PROOFREADER!Anyway, I digress... I never expected Anita to remain static. I never expected Anita to spend her entire life in a state of confusion. But this has gone too far. I am tired of Anita's sex life being the focus of this series, especially when the sex life is written so poorly and used as an excuse for \\"plot\\". The ardeur.. whatever. It's been done twice now. And the third time, not the charm.I could excuse NIC as a transition book. Then we got CS as ANOTHER transition book. Now we have a third transition book. Everything worthwhile (what little there was) from CS was forgotten. Truth be told, anything worthwhile from OB back to the first Anita Blake novel has been forgotten. I wonder if LKH even cares?Most of the folks who have reviewed this book aren't prudes. We've been with Anita through thick and thin, and waited with bated breath to see who she would choose, or at least choose first. We were enthralled by the romance and insanity of the Triumverate, even the sexual tension. Especially the sexual tension, which was well-written. Remember when the guys would get all Alpha, and she'd deny them both? Well, now our loyalty is repaid with bad porn. If this is even good enough to be called that. What happened to Edward? Dolph? The drama of her human friends? Y'know, the ones who don't sleep with every supernatural creature in Saint Louis? The ones who Anita so desperately clung to in an effort to keep her humanity? Oh, wait, they aren't worthy of her bed, so they fall by the wayside. Nice.Many of us, here and on the LKH message boards, are just tired of badly written novels with contrived plots, if there even is a plot in the book to speak of. We're tired of the downward spiral Anita is going through being called \\"character development\\". It's sad when such a great writer sinks so low. I don't think LKH even cares about Anita the character anymore; she only seems to care about Anita the Cash Cow.I did not buy this book. I will not buy this book. I got it from the library. Wasn't worth the wait. Don't buy it before reading it. Save the cash and the aggravation of banging yourself in the head with the book because it's so bad. LKH described the book as a \\"door stopper\\" in her blog because it's 650 pages. I'd call it a \\"door stopper\\" because that's about all it's good for..."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton's newest Anita Blake novel, \\"Incubus Dreams\\" has further divided her fan base. Fans either loved the book or just plain hated. For many fans there were no in between.In this the twelfth book of the Anita Blake series, Anita is trying to solve a case involving a vampire serial killer who just happens to be killing strippers. She knows it is none of the local vamps or shapeshifters involved for she is the consort of Jean-Claude and in a distance past Richard's significant other. Blah Blah and Blah. Enough of what the dust cover says.For real, \\"Incubus Dreams\\" is an enormously long book intimately describing the up and downs of Anita having sex, talking about sex and thinking about sex. Yes, I did say sex ... again and again and again.In the previous installments \\"Narcissus in Chains\\" and then \\"Cerulean Sins\\" Anita began a downward spiral that has continued to pick up pace with each passing book. After finishing \\"Incubus Dreams\\" it appears that all hope has faded that the series would ever revert back to the lovable Anita we had all grown to love.Big disappointments continue in this book.Okay, I did leave out that there is about less than 10% of the book that actually deals with the hunt for the serial killer that the dust jacket hooks you in with.But lets put the sex stuff aside and talk about the flow of this book.My biggest complaint is the ending of Cerulean Sin had Valentina and Bartolome (the two Children vampires) staying to help Stephen and Gregory with their father problem.\\"Valentina and Bartolome asked Jean-Claude's permission to Kill Stephen and Gregory's father. Jean-Claude said okay, as long as Stephen and Gregory agree. Stephen's therapist thinks it would be healthier if the boys handled it themselves. Gregory's comment had been, \\"Oh, we get to kill him ourselves.\\"\\"That's not what I meant,\\" Stephen said. \\"Cerulean Sin- Anita BlakeWhere were they in Incubus Dreams? Ms Hamilton had Stephen and Gregory's father trying to see them, but no further mention of these vampire children. Time didn't fly that fast between book 11 and 12. So again where is Valentina and Bartolome? For all we know Laurell killed them or \\"punished\\" them for not behaving. Continuity between books has been an on going problem.I enjoyed the earlier books in the series with the murders, the mystery of finding out who the bad guy was, the monsters of the book and of course Anita and her wonderful collection of guns and toys. But for many of us, the direction the last three books have taken has disappointed us and left us with a bad taste in our mouths. The series bares little resemblance to what it started out as and quite reasonably we readers feel betrayed in the sudden change in direction. It's not what we signed on for.Since the current book has been out, fans has voiced their opinions about \\"Incubus Dreams\\" and if one looks statically at the mixed reviews the fan base is split about 50/50. Fans have been passionate about voicing their various opinions and those that have expressed a negative opinion are quickly labeled and called names and yelled at for daring to criticize the book. Cruel and mean-spirited we are christened for our troubles when we wonder aloud - \\"What have you done to Anita and who is this stranger that has taken her place.\\" Prude also seems to be the top title given to those that have criticized the repetitive boring sex that consumes the current book. And for some reason we are refereed to as the lowly \\"minority\\".Well, call me a \\"prude\\" and a \\"minority\\" and keep on deluding yourselves that we are an insignificant number.I have a right as a fan to be vocal and voice whether if I like the book or not. I did not like the book for many reasons ... little to no plot, too much time spent on sex, editing errors out the whazoo and the list could go on and on, much like the book did.I have been a die hard fan of this author, but I'm afraid I am done. I've waded through three long books waiting for Ms. Hamilton to fix the series and restore it to its former glory. But enough's enough.I will let the author continue with her freedom of speech and writing the series as she so chooses and sees fit. But freedom of speech works in both directions.But I also think it is time that we as the \\"minority\\" to come together and to get our message across.How do we the get the message across?Don't pick up the next book. Wait till it comes out in your library, wait till it is in paperback, wait till its in the bargain bin as a remainder or just don't bother picking it up at all. When sales drop, someone will notice.Sorry Laurell, this isn't personal it is just business. I have just so much discretionary funds to spend on entertainment purposes be it books, CD's, DVD's or movies. The Anita series use to be fun and entertaining and provided hours of enjoyment and for that I thank you.But the series has changed drastically and in this once die-hard fan's opinion is racing in a direction I choose not to follow. The ride's just not enjoyable any more. This \\"minority\\" forgave and forgave the little things for so long, but you've gone and put a stake in me. I've taken a stand and I'm walking out the door and my money's leaving with me."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have read every book LKH has ever written, usually in one night, and my thought after toiling through this one is, \\"Did the publishers need a rush job to sell in time for Christmas?\\"Anita Blake is an unrecognizable shell of her former self. Her personal conflicts and moral standards (\\"I don't do furry\\")made her the interesting character that she was -- now the big cop out: the ardeur comes along, and then she can engage in sexual acts with anything that moves and happens to be nearby, no guilt, no emotions, not her fault, the ardeur made her do it. I actually found her to be whiny and tedious in this book.Just a trivial point, but...all through the book it annoyed me to see \\"deity\\" spelled \\"diety\\" -- I thought of food, instead of the powers that be. \\"Voila\\" was \\"viola\\" and we had music. The spelling and typos wouldn't get by a high school English teacher -- what happened to this formerly brilliant, cutting edge series?Anita is now a tramp, and a boring one at that. The character I would once have wanted for my best friend I now wouldn't even want to go for coffee with. The plot gets thrown in between the extended sex scenes as an afterthought -- oh, yeah -- the murder investigation --oh, right -- that's why we're here. Speaking of sex scenes, the ones in the earlier books would leave me turning the pages in anticipation, not answering the phone, ignoring the world. These seem to just get right down to it -- no suspense, no build-up -- much like the rest of the book. It took me five days to struggle through this. The others I stayed up all night to finish and wanted more.It is sad when a book like this comes out and diminishes all the prior releases that were so well done. I hope Laurell Hamilton can save the series."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"If it's possible to be trapped in a horrific nightmarish wet dream, then this is it. I mean, I'm tempted to give the book more stars just because it's Anita Blake, but the fact is, most sadly... It's not.Did Laurell K stop listening to her editor, or did they just want to rush this book out after the last Merry Gentry? Because almost anything between pages 50 and 500 of this book is superfluous. It's like a montage of sex scenes and big, meaningful observations about Sexlife, the Universe and Everything. Jeez, we love you, Anita, but SHUT UP ALREADY.We know the heroine is neurotic. We know all her pet peeves. We do not need to hear them straight from the horse's mouth yet again. Good god, just let the thing with Richard die already. Jean Claude isn't even in there until after page 200, and Jean Claude is the reason for the season. More than that, he's not even badass in this book - he's the wimpiest he's ever been.I don't care how many times you carefully discuss the reason for yet another sex scene - the reason is not good enough. Anita's harem of men is at a pathetically and absurdly high number, and I wish for once some person she randomnly sleeps with would not treat her like she's the best lay on the planet.I'm all for character development, really, but does it have to be so tedious? Give us new insights to Micah and Nathaniel and Jean-Claude and even Richie-poo, but don't shove them at us like the afterthoughts of (or explanations for) Anita's latest metaphysical bedroom romp.At chapter 61 the book really picks up - there's the Anita we know and love. I'm sorry, Ms Hamilton, I really do love your writing up until now, but if I were your editor I would have told you to scrap most of this book - leaving the encounters with Louis and Veronica, Moroven and the Dragon, and then pick up there with The Wicked Truth and The Church of Eternal Life. Now that would have made for compelling reading... Because tacked on to the end of the novel, it isn't worth wading through to unless you're a huge fan like me."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This is a truely pathetic book in (what started off as) one of the best series I have read in a long time. The book is almost 700 pages and roughly 550 of it is sex. Anita cares about little else anymore.I learned almost nothing new about the characters or the political situation going on with Jean Claude. I can, however, tell you how Anita likes to give head. An average sex scene (with foreplay) lasted up to 3 chapters. Compare that to the actual scene where she takes out the bad guy which is a short chapter. WHAT HAPPENED TO LKH?!?!?!Like many of the reviews here I also think she is just plain running out of good catch lines and feels the need to reuse them over and over again. In previous novels I laughed out loud at the conversations. Now I just roll my eyes.Richard, Jean Claude, Nathaniel etc. have become one dimensional characters who roll over whenever Anita wants them to. Yes we get the point that Anita is a hard ass but once upon a time the men in this novel also had a spine.I use to wait in anticipation for the next novel of the series but now I'd rather read something else.Hey if you like oversexed novels with little to no plot this is for you. But if you're like me and loved watching Anita out of the bedroom on her feet instead of her back stick to the earlier books."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Laurell K. has jumped the shark.

The first 8 books were great. Yeah, you had to get past the constant way that her guns are described and every other page having the quote, \\"Like so much raw meat.\\" (You guys know exactly what I'm talking about.) I mean, I was finally getting into the Anita Blake series but this book has got to be the worst. Where's the plot? This whole book was sex on top of sex. It's been about 2 weeks since I read it and now, I can't even remember if there was an actual crime that took place in the book and if it was ever solved. All I can remember is the sex. This has made me so disappointed. Remind me to wait for the paperback to come out next time before I buy another one of the Anita Blake series books."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was reading this book about a dead stripper with vampire bite marks, and then I was reading a book about people's sexual hang-ups. I know that since the audeur, Anita has needed to have sex. This book dosen't have any of the sex we have come to expect form Hamilton's writings. In one scene, Anita pulls up her skirt (literally) for two vampires she has just met. Some fans have been waiting for a three way with Anita, Richard and Jean-Claude. It happens after two chapters of talking and a pretty lengthy explination that it is only happening to save thier individual groups. Not quite the warm up I'm used to from Anita.The murder case takes a major backseat. A few times there is no transition between a sex scene and Anita investigating a dead body. The story line flips, often from chapter to chapter,and I had trouble staying interested. Nathaniel is given nice development in another seemingly unconnected arc. There is a new vamp in town whose power rivals jean-Claude an Anita's. He is barely mentioned, save a few sentances at the end.The book feels smacked together at the last minute. The epologue tries to tidy eveything up, but falls horribly short. The typos make me think alot of this is the fault of the publisher. No company should relase a book as anticipated as this one was with over 200 tpyos. Maybe LKH needs to take a break from writing about Anita, and this was her plea to be allowed time off. As much as I like reading about Anita, I would gladly grant any time off needed to get the old writing style back.In an interview, LKH said she writes about sex because many think good sex cannot be written from a woomans piont of view. It can, but the sex should flow with the book. Good sex happens in the Merry Gentry series, or in Cerulian Sins. Something got lost in the writing of this.LKH, take time to find what you need to write well again. We will miss you until that time comes."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm a huge fan of the Anita Blake series. I was introduced in the pause between the 8th and 9th books, retreated into Guilty Pleasures and emerged three days later after Blue Moon, blinking and reminding myself that natural light doesn't hurt.I did enjoy Cerulean Sins, and unlike many people, while I love the vampires, I am really interested in the wereleopards and have wanted to see more things done with them. I thought it was interesting that a woman with so many hang-ups through the earlier novels, would end up Namir Ra to a ragtag gang of mistreated werecats with a bend to S&M.;I generally don't take exception to sex in books, even of the fun and twisted variety, because it adds spice. Unfortunately, in this one, the spice overwhelmed the course and left sex scenes that were repetitive (how can you make orgies repetitive???) and which lost their meaning. Every one of them seemed to either start or stop with an upsetting metaphysical/emotional discourse that involved revolving mind doors with Jean-Claude and Richard (though favorite part of the book was when Anita was yet again overwhelming Richard through their link and his response was something to the effect of \\"Now what?\\" Now what indeed. Each terminated sexual encounter was due to a sudden emotional overload, punctuated by growling wereanimals, and it just got dull.What was really disappointing is with some trimming of the extra crud, some of the sexual milestones, if you will, would have been really interesting in the development of Anita's character. The relationship with Nathaniel, the dealing with \\"furries\\", the issue of S&M...; all fascinating aspects which show a pronounced deviation from the Anita Blake from Guilty Pleasures. More of a self-reflective response to that would have been wonderful, rather than having Richard burst in physically or mentally each time overwhelming with sexy werewolf angst and/or rage.So, disappointing. Entertaining in it being Anita and friends, but disappointing. I'm hoping the next one will focus more on characterization and plot rather than the Olympic sport of monster-humping."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have been a fan of LKH since I first read \\"Guilty Pleasures\\", any of you that are her fans know how the series is. But the last two books of the series has been a major disappointment. I like sex just as the next person, but there is such a thing as OVER KILL. The major plot of the story of a Vampire killer running lose is completly forgotten. I was busy looking for her to get to the story...LKH was busy with Anita having sex with everyone under the sun! I haven't finished the book yet, because...I am near the end, and still she hasn't looked for the killer! Anita is so busy, having sex with everyone! I enjoyed the old Anita...yes, she had her issues, but she was out for the kill. LKH has also strip the heroes of the story....Jean-Claude, Richard. Jean-Claude is a great vampire,sexy, smart But LKH has put him on a shelf. Richard has the sex and power, and she's made him a wimp.

I adored the books through Obsidian Butterfly, was underwhelmed by Narcissus in Chains, but saw signs of real hope with Cerulean Sins... I loved the idea of the Mother of Darkness and vamp politics... I eagerly picked up this book to see where LKH led.. hmmmm.. how to put this....I am still not sure what she was getting at in this book. Much has been said about the over the top sex scenes. Full of technical detail, but lacking tension or feeling. She is now loves \\"Deeper than anyone else\\" no less than 4 men, rolls eyes, and her orgasms are all screaming,nail scratching, better than candy (in one scene she rips off her fingernails during an orgasm, luckily they grew back 2 hours later so she could mark her next victim (errr, partner).The plot of the book was all but forgotten, but maybe I could have forgiven that, and even voyeuristically enjoyed the sex scenes...but... to my biggest complaint of this book... I couldn't wade through the trully HORRIBLE editing job done on this book... Or should I say LACK of editing..People have had fun for years, spotting the inconsistencies in the Anita books, laughing at certain overused phrases but this time... oh wow....

For a 25 dollar hardback I EXPECT at least a decently edited product where misspelled words didn't scream at me, and the word Spill didn't spill all over me.Sigh.... Another great series shot to heck..."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"First of all, I'm a big Anita Blake fan. I enjoyed how the series was progressing, and liked that it was getting steamier because it really seemed to fit the characters. Having said that, I was drawn to the series because it was a nice mix of supernatural romance and action. In Incubus Dreams, the action gets completely lost. The sex scenes now easily outnumber the fight scenes, and that's just silly. They're also pretty repetative, by the end of the book I was really sick of hearing about how ready Anita's body was for sex. In a good romance story, a little goes a long way. We should always be left wanting more, and that's how I felt at the end of all of the previous books. But after the third or maybe fourth scene, the sex just got boring. So when I reached the most surprising of the erotic moments at the end of the book, it had very little emotional impact. I just didn't care anymore.If my only problem with the book had been too much making out and not enough action, I probably still would have been relatively pleased. But I just don't like how the characters are going. The new developments between Anita, Jean-Claude, Richard, Nathaniel, and Damian are basically just a sloppy excuse to give them all new powers so that whenever they get into a tricky situation some new power can manifest and save them.What's more, I dislike the merging of their personalities that these connections are causing. The characters need to keep their distinct personalities in order to be interesting. Of course they should develop, but it should be more a result of their experiences and breakthroughs. Having metaphysical accidents changing them so deeply isn't good character development, it's a cop-out.The actual mystery solving in this novel was clearly an afterthought. At times, Hamilton actually relied on coincidences instead of investigation (as an example, Ronnie just happens to go to the strip club that a murder takes place at).The end of Incubus Dreams resolved very little. Traditionally, the series has had the main threats wrapped up at the end of each book, and the relationship issues don't get completely dealt with. This book took the opposite approach. They didn't really catch the bad guy. Entire subplots were messily abandoned (presumably postponed until the next book). The erotica would have been much more tolerable if they'd managed to accomplish anything in between all the sex.Another thing that I had a huge problem with was that the first few chapters of the book were trimmed down and published as a short story in a recent anthology. So when I started the book, I had a nasty surprise. I'd already read a good bit of the plot of them, but still had to re-read to get the new moments. Please, Ms. Hamilton, don't do that again. If you present something as a short story, please make it entirely different material. At the very least, the \\"short story\\" should have been called a preview of the new novel.The editing was also terrible, I can't believe that so many spelling mistakes made it in. I also think they could have cut some of the random moments that added nothing to the story or characters.I'm rating this a three for the sake of the characters, but if the next book in this series comes out this poorly, I'm sorry to say that I'm abandoning Anita."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am a big fan of Laurell K.

One sex scene turns into another and another and I found myself wondering when a plot would start to emerge.You won't find anything like Obsidian Butterfly or Bloody Bones here--two of my favorites.I look forward to her next book--where maybe she'll resume the occupation of respected author and use less sex/porn to bring back the Anita Blake we all know and LOVE."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"i got very wrapped up in the Anita Blake series. i couldn't get enough of it.

This book started out promising enough, with a potential vampire serial killer (maybe a gang of them), then it wandered off from one sex scene to another. If this was a movie, they would have a hard time rating it. Although she uses the \\"f\\" word plenty, she can't use the \\"p\\" word (to describe a portion of the male anatomy). Go figure!If I wanted all porn, all the time, I would have bought Hustler's Forum magazine or a subscription to Playgirl (Playboy for the rest of you).I am severely disappointed. I kept hoping Hamilton would get off of the sex and get back to the serial killer plot, but by disc 7 (I bought the unabridged CDs), she still hadn't and there are only 8 discs to listen to.I like to hear sexual parts of books, believe me, it makes them more fun and interesting. In the past, Hamilton has melded the sex and the mystery very well. This time, though, she completely forgot about a plot and wrote the x-rated vampire sex novel of the year.I never finished the book because I was so disgusted and I am no prude. When I read a book, I want substance, I want a plot, and yes, a little sex is nice, but not page after page of orgies, sex on the floor, sex in the shower, sex on a stage, sex on a desk - you name it and main character Anita Blake is having sex on or in it in this book.I'm finding a new author to embrace.Hamilton lost a big fan.I wish I could have given 0 stars, but 1 will do."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book was so disappointing, I am not even sure where to start. The amount of typos was appalling, there was no story line, and hey, I can admit freely that I have no problem reading some sex in a book. SOME SEX. When Anita has seven different partners in one night and the sex scenes continue on for three or four CHAPTERS, there is a problem. I used to love the Anita Blake series. I would start reading one and not be able to put it down. With Incubus Dreams, I had to force myself to finish the book. What happened to the story line from Cerulean Sins? I was expecting Incubus Dreams to continue on with that. And there was no Asher, no Edward, and after the beginning of the book Damian just dropped off into nowhere. And when did she become so wordy?! The whole book could have been summed up in less than half the pages! It's like reading Anne Rice's later work! To anyone who is considering reading Indubus Dreams, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! I am sure you can find something better to do."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"If you are a longtime fan of this series, you will simply not recognize the Anita Blake of Incubus Dreams as the same Anita Blake of Guilty Pleasures. Of course there must be room for character growth. In fact, it is a must for any long-running series. But that growth must be believable. In Incubus Dreams, Ms. Hamilton asks the reader to believe that a woman who once could not kiss a man without an emotional committment can participate in group sex that would be the envy of Jenna Jamison without a second thought. Anita's transformation is the most dramatic since Mary Magdalene's and is just as realistic. Incubus Dreams is simply a pathetic attempt to prolong the series in an effort to maximize profits to the publisher and the author."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I love Anita Blake. I love Laurell K. Hamilton. I can't quite say I love Incubus Dreams. Half the events were just a little too over the top to be believeable.Anita seems to be on the verge of developing an ego that will really ruin her likeability. All that sex with gorgeous men... I like erotica...but that shouldn't be the point of an Anita Blake book. Whatever happened to the old Anita?Richard? My gosh. I never did like him. When is the guy ever going to grow up? For a while I started developing some respect for him...but that went all to Hades.Some of the other characters just aren't themselves anymore. Jean-Claude is just way too nice. Nathaniel...he just doesn't work when he's dominant. What happened to the cuddly kitty? Damien? The vamp is an accident waiting to happen. If I got as screwed up as he is I'd go searching for a stake.At least we still have our lecherous cop in residence- Zebrowski. At least he hasn't changed. I don't know what I'd do if he suddenly became normal... He and Micah were all that managed to hold this book together.I was really hoping for some Asher in here, or maybe a dash of Edward. I love those guys. Eh. I just hope they come back in book 13.Also, I hope I'm not the only person that hopes the next book goes through a spell check. \\"relationhsip\\"?

She is (or was) a big fan of the series but this book finished it. All I heard was \\"This is just full of pointless sex!\\" or \\"All Hamilton has been doing is watching cheap porn videos!\\" or \\"Oh god not another deep throat scene!\\". According to the girlfriend there is little of the characters of old which she enjoyed but plenty of non-plot developing sex. I did the old test of picking up the book and opening it at random at four places. Each time someone was being thrusted hard into something else. Thats a record!Please stop!

Sure, the one before in the series wasn't the best, but I had convinced myself that this one would be better because there were so many cool stories left to tell. I asked for \\"Incubus Dreams\\" for Christmas and then decided to stay up all night to read it. What a disappointment!! I should have slept. Over 600 pages of pointless sex! I don't object to the sex, I just wish that it had a point, did something for the plot! What happened to Anita's ambivalence about her powers and the monsters? Ans: disappeared! What happened to Asher? What happened to Belle Morte? This book is filled with flab, pointless characters in pointless scenes! Nathaniel is the sole redeeming quality. The only solution as I see it is for Laurell Hamilton to kill off a whole bunch of characters at the beginning of the next book, keep a core group and do something interesting. Yes, I will buy the next book because I hope that there is still something left... I hope..."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The Anita Blake series hooked a lot of readers with interesting stories AND tasty character development. Anita has a complex life and ample psychological baggage. The combination makes her worth following from book to book. Her interior monologues have always been interesting, and she doesn't skimp on the self-analysis here. Still, the plotlines were what held the books together, and the plot gets short shrift in Incubus Dreams.For those who thought Cerulean Sins spent too much time on the ardeur... there's that much more here. I don't mind the sex; it's stylishly written, not nearly so hardcore as some reviewers appear to believe, and it does move the character development forward. Alas, the sheer volume of the sexual encounters bloats the book to the point where it becomes disconcertingly difficult to remember the plot.A disappointing lack of editorial polish extends beyond the sprinkling of typos, confusing comma usage, and grammatical errors familiar from Cerulean Sins - the narrative lacks a cohesive structure. More than one plot element is introduced and then disappears. For me, the most glaring omissions concern the nature of the new triumvirate. Jean-Claude tells Anita that he needs to confirm the level of the new marks in person, and he's intensely interested in Damian's daywalking (as he should be!). In the last book, we would at least have gotten a few pages of conversation as the characters puzzled things out and discussed the metaphysical ramifications. Instead, ardeur ensues, and selective amnesia settles over the characters. Someone should have picked up on this sort of continuity sloppiness well before the final draft. Bad puppy. No biscuit.I truly like these characters. I want to find out what happens to them, even when it's messy and I don't like where they're going. But I need the main characters to remember the big picture and grapple with the unsexy, non-ardeur parts of their lives. Perhaps LKH needed a break after the heavy vamp diplomacy of Cerulean Sins, but a 650 page book needs a story that carries its own weight."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm on of those Anita Blake fans that just kept on going, even when others complained that the books had turned into nothing but porn. But even I couldn't get into Incubus Dreams (lack of story!) and ended up returning it to the library before I even hit 100 pages. I'm so disappointed."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"A few months after reading a Jeanine Frost novel, I lost the book and forgot the author and title. Knowing it was an urban fantasy and it had something to do with a cop, I easily mistook my earlier read for a LKH book.Three chapters in and I was wondering why Mrs. Frost made her main character such a whore. Then I got stuck on some long discussion about nothing, and I just stopped reading it. There was no way I could finish the book. It was boring and I absolutely hate two things when it comes to a novel: 1. pointless, easy sex, and 2. when every character lavishes the main one with compliments and undying love.Would I recommend this read? Yes, to an editor who could whip it into shape with plot and character development."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams was the turning point in the Anita Blake series for me. It was when the series started going downhill, and Anita just became a Mary Sue. If there is any doubt about Anita Blake being a Mary Sue, just look at the book cover. The woman on the cover, whom I presume to be Anita very much resembles LKH herself, albeit a thinner and younger version of course.I also felt like a more appropriate title should have been \\"Succubus Dreams\\" since it was all about Anita feeding on sex, talking about sex, whining about sex. Sex, sex and more sex. Very tiresome. Second worst book in the series right after Danse Macabre (which is the worst book ever)."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Ugh. Well I finished this book because I really hate to abandon one but this one sure made it tough. It essentially was 30 pages or so of plot and another 700 of sex. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for some sex but 700 pages gets to be a bit much. And can there be a character introduced that Anita doesn't end up with some metaphysical connection with? Her characters are so magically incestuous. And now sexually intertwined and only one, Richard, shows any sort of jealousy over it? Yeah, that sounds likely. I know LKH said in her blog she doesn't read reviews, but I'm thinking it might be to her benefit to start doing so."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"All the die hard Anita fans know that her demise was after Cerulean Sins, so enough said on that. What makes this book incredibly bad is...that it is plain just not well written. There is no proofreading, and after a bit, a very little bit, the mistakes just keep nagging you and nagging you to the point where you look for them instead of paying attention to what there is of the story. The question here would be: how did the book get published with so many mistakes (grammar etc)? A greater mystery and perhaps more worth solving than the purported mystery in the story itself. Anyway if you want to insist and try to read this do it as a seven day mass event to honor the worthwhile, delicious first books in the series, and weep your heart out at what Ms Hamilton has turned our Anita into. There you go, I think I discovered a social use for this book, it is the perfect PMS read, so it deserves 1 star after all!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was hooked from the first line of \\"Guilty Pleasures.\\" Here was a strong, kick-[...] heroine in a fabulous alternate reality where magic and weird creatures really do exist. Anita solves thrilling mysteries while carrying on a sexy love life. Although I hate Richard, the other characters were interesting. The last book left me waiting breathlessly for the epic confrontation with Belle Mere and the Mother of All Vampires.....and instead we get sex, sex, sex and more sex that isn't even interesting sex, just largely lurid and gross. Anita has regressed into a hand-wringing nympho. The murder mystery had great potential that was never explored and seems to be merely something for Anita to do when she's not getting laid! Ms. Hamilton, what were you thinking about???? The book is badly written, badly edited, and a waste of good wood pulp and your money. Let's hope the next one gets it right."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams reads more like three books smashed together into one, which may be why it's getting such poor reviews from a lot of people. It's length (a boggling 658 pages and 82 chapters) is unwieldy; combined with the pace, it makes me wonder if the author has seen an end to the series coming and is pushing the reader there in a hurry.This book isn't nearly as bad as I expected from the reviews. It's true that there's a glut of rough sex, group sex and public sex, but if you can get past the descriptions and see it metaphorically, it's not as graphic as you'd think. I found the book divides up into three main areas that would have worked pretty well on their own as standalone books: Anita recognizing her own monster and accepting it enough to drop most of her defenses and create actual relationships, the consummation of the original triumverate and creation of a second with unexpected powers manifesting themselves and a setup for a final showdown wrapped up in a stripper serial-killer case that's left hanging at the end. All of this takes place in about three or four days; there's very little sleep taking place in this book. Yes, there are major, major characters and plotlines from past books that are unresolved here - but this book covers such a short length of time and already involves so much and so many people, to add them in would have been unmanageable. Asher, Belle Morte, Damien and Jason are all there and I'm sure will factor heavily in the next book based on the setup here.The typos, missing words and one rather disgusting conversation Anita has with Richard all detract from the quality of the storytelling and I'm hoping, the direction the author is pushing her readers. I got the sense that this was a bridge book, one meant not to advance the storyline so much as to set us up for the final couple of stories left to be told. Either Ms. Hamilton has abandoned Anita for her Merry Gentry series and this will all just fizzle out or she's brilliantly building up her characters for a monumental climax. If you read the book carefully, you'll see that the stage is being set for a confrontation with Mother: the addition of warrior vamps, the increase in the triumverate/s and their power, Anita's new ability to raise the dead and the tease of the serial-killing head vamp on the loose with ties to Belle Morte. I thought the sex had begun to get a lot out of hand, but it served to put all of the characters here in line to finish things up in a way that should satisfy loyal readers of the series as a whole.All in all, I don't think this deserves a five star rating, but it's better than a three. In spite of the shoddy editing, Ms. Hamilton has a gift for graphic storytelling, action and dialogue (with the exception of Anita yelling at everyone to *f* her during sex). Without coming out and spelling it specifically, you get the impression that all the characters are headed for a crossroad of their own: Anita is melancholy and a little bitter, Jean-Claude is unsure of himself and Richard is buried under his own (and Anita's) anger and self-loathing. As if that weren't enough, Nathaniel discovers a dominant side, Damien becomes needier than expected, Jason turns out to be more mature than you'd think and Micah is deeper and more tormented than even Anita guesses. There's a lot of emotional upheaval in this book and while I missed the longer hardcore police investigations from earlier books, it would have just been too much to add to this already busy story.Because of its length and dependency on the element of shock, it would be a hard book to read repeatedly, but it does feel like a necessary step to the conclusion that I desperately hope Ms. Hamilton delivers. I wouldn't recommend anyone not familiar with the series start with this book; the best way to enjoy all of Ms. Hamilton's books is to start from the beginning and read through in order. For fans of the series who want to find out how it all ends, as long and tedious as it can be, I still think this is a book you'll need to read in order to follow the characters to the conclusion."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The keystone of my perspective on what has been happening in the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter Novels is that I found Laurell K. Hamilton's first half-dozen books in the series to be some of the best horror stories I have ever read. Book after book Hamilton kept upping the ante, with the graveyard finale of \\"Bloody Bones\\" my absolute all-time favorite horror scene. Time and time again I told people that if they ever made these books into movies they would be rated NC-17 because of the violent horror. But the second half of the series would probably all be rated XXX unless they left a lot on the cutting room floor and with \\"Incubus Dreams\\" that would not be a bad thing.Buried in \\"Incubus Dreams\\" (the title refers to a strip club across the river in Illinois) is what long time fans of the series such as myself would consider an above average old-fashioned Anita Blake novel. Anita is attending the October wedding of Larry Kinkaid and wearing a tux because she is on the groom's side. Micah and Nathaniel are in attendance so it does not take long for Anita to have to start explaining the complicated relationships with the men in her life. But adding several new layer of complication to those relationships is the primary subject matter of \\"Incubus Dreams.\\" However, before Anita Blake's sex life takes the first of several strange turns, she is called away from the wedding reception to check out a dead body. A stripper has been killed by a pack of vampires and Dolph is talking \\"serial killer.\\" However, in the hierarchy of vampires a bunch of bad things have to be happening for that to be the case.One way in which \\"Incubus Dreams\\" is decidedly different from the standard Anita Blake novel is that our necromancer's power upgrade happens early in the novel rather than at the end when it take place conveniently in time to save the day. The \\"arduer\\" continues to make things interesting for Anita on the metaphysical plane as well as in the bedroom (or whatever room or place she happens to be in when it hits), as things are getting more and more complicated in terms of masters, servants, beasts, memories of the dead, and monster politics. Maybe Anita Blake could have business card that says Vampire Executioner, Necromancer, Human Servant to Jean-Claude, Bolverk for the wolf pack, so on and so forth, except it would have to be tiny print to work in all the triumverates in play by the end of this one. No wonder every sex act in the book has to be talked about before and afterwards, because each time it changes things and the characters (and readers) have to try and catch up.Part of me thinks that all the sex in these books is revenge for all the years we begged for Anita to make up her mind in terms of Jean-Claude and then between Jean-Claude and Richard. I can remember announcing I no longer cared whom Anita ended up with as long as she picked somebody before the choice was forced on her. But giving her body to Jean-Claude only seemed to settle things, because Richard is still a part of their triumvirate and her ex-fianc&eacute; is back big time in this story. Richard's fans will be happy, but my problem is that when he becomes a major part of this narrative he is getting in the way of the horror story.That is because 400 pages into this 658-page novel Anita learns something that produces a reaction in Jean-Claude of fear bordering on panic. Murders that Anita Blake investigates always presage something bigger and badder than what anybody is thinking, and anything that has Jean-Claude freaking out is going to be wicked bad. So wicked bad that everybody should drop what they are doing and deal with this nightmare before it escalates into something bigger than the greater St. Louis area. But, no, the \\"arduer\\" has to be fed because powers and impulses are bleeding from one member of the triumvirate into the others (I was going for at least one star higher in my rating until that step backwards; in fact, if those last two parts of the novel were switched I probably would have been happier, such is my disdain for horror interuptus, especially when Hamilton finally gets me to sit up and gasp at the sudden turn of events).Still, in the end we are right where we want to be, with the Executioner heading into another impossible situation trying to save someone and get herself and the rest of the people she is with out alive, which, we all know by now, never really happens. But once she gets up to what I consider the really good part, Hamilton rushes through the scene (at least in contrast to the sex scenes). More importantly, it becomes clear that \\"Incubus Dreams\\" is setting up something bigger and better down the road. Whether this is the prelude (i.e., it will take more than one novel) or the first-half of a story arc to be completed in the next Anita Blake novel we shall have to see. But \\"Incubus Dreams\\" has ample evidence that Hamilton can still write the nightmarish narratives that got me hooked on these books in the first place, she just insists on going in a different direction.I know that one of the reasons I am having such an adverse reaction to the onslaught of sex scenes in these recent books is because I have been down this road before with John Norman. I enjoyed the stories and characters in his Gor novels, which became more and more about female slaves and male masters and I would read book after book in the series, skipping through the sex scenes (which were truly soft core compared to what Hamilton is writing) to get to the parts with the action and the characters. Granted, I am not yet at the point of reading Hamilton's novels that same way because there are important ramifications to both Anita's relationships and her powers every time she has sex. But knowing how she feels about getting her cervix bumped is really more than I need to know about the character.Maybe the explanation for my being more interested in when the characters talk about sex rather than when they have sex is just an indication that I am old (certainly a reasonable working hypothesis). But I still recall how in novel after novel at the beginning of this series Hamilton would produce one chilling ending after another. Stephen King would usually disappoint me with an ending that was never as good of a payoff as the set up, but Hamilton delivered time after time after time. \\"Incubus Dreams\\" gives us a taste, but I want the full course meal. Bottom line: when I finish an Anita Blake novel I want to have trouble sleeping because I am reliving the nightmarish scenes in the novel and not the sex scenes."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"i was introduce to the series by a friend and immediately proceeded to obtain every issue. i purchased incubus dreams as soon as it was available from my local book merchant. after reading it, i loaned it to the owner of the book store who also happens to be a fan and asked her opinion. she returned my money and said that obiviously a mistake had been made and the publisher must have released an unedited draft. hopefully they'll release the copy that has more than 83 pages of relevant story."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have purchased all of the Anita Blake stories and sad to say, this will probably be my last.

OK, I'm not a prude, I can read it. However, I want a plot, I want a little substance to hold all the sexual encounters together.

As impatiently as I awaited this book, I would rather have waited another month so that the grammatical errors and repetitive wording could have been corrected. Many times in my reading I had to pause, re-read, AND re-think what I had read because the sentence structure was so confusing. Definitely wasn't up to the author's usual stellar style.I could have overlooked the grammatical confusion if the plot had lived up to the other books in this series. It seems to me that there should be a book in between 'Cerulean Sins' and 'Incubus Dreams' because all of a sudden Anita is willing to do anything (or should I say anybody?) whereas before she had standards. It's not exactly the loss of those standards that I'm going to mourn but the fact that we don't get to see her rationalization for their loss. What I have come to love so much about Ms. Hamilton's writing is the internal thought processes of Anita Blake. In this novel Anita's willingness to violate her own standards is simply stated rather than analyzed. This is a major problem because that willingness is the basis for almost every sex scene in the plot.The mystery is also lacking in this story. Another aspect of Ms. Hamilton's novels that I enjoyed was the way she could weave the resolution of the crime through Anita's character development so that with each new clue to the crime we reached a new stage in the main character's development. The detectieve story is almost nonexistent throughout this novel. It's set up in the very beginning and then at the very end the old Anita that we all love re-appears. It is because I get to see her kick some butt again that I can forgive the fact that the bad guy isn't killed or brought to justice.Now, there are some things that I enjoyed in this book. These mainly have to do with the development of the characters of Micah and Nathaniel. I was not a major fan of either before their appearance here, so if you are a fan of either one of these characters (especially Nathaniel) you should read this book. We get to see deeper into Micah than ever before - he becomes more three dimensional, giving the reader glimpses into his insecurities about his relationship with Anita as well as his treatment under Chimera. Nathaniel grows a backbone, I'm glad to say. Anita and he have some endearing scenes (not all sexual in nature) that I have re-read several times.If you plan to continue reading the series, this book is a must if simply because it explains the implausible, virtually limitless power that Anita gains. It is this power, in part, that bothers me the most about this book. I see almost no room for my all-time favorite character to grow - both in terms of power and in terms of character. Maybe that's the point. Maybe in the next novel Anita will lose it all and have to begin again thus prolonging what is promised to be a never-ending series. The fact that I'm willing to wait and see says that I haven't lost ALL faith in Ms. Hamilton."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I used to love this series. When this series started it was great. Action/suspense/mystery/bit of sexual tension and now it is basically all sex. I have nothing against sex. If I had wanted an erotic novel though I would have bought one. Now this was not a sudden change, this occurred over time. This book starts right off with a crime and ends with the bad guy getting there's, but the whole middle is just sex. Half way through this series there was a nice balance of sex/action and mystery. Sadly I think Mrs. Hamilton has lost her way."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I think that I might have liked this book a little more if I hadn't read all these reviews first in my anticipation of it arriving in the mail...never make that mistake again. Like some of the others said, I did get kinda sick of the sex scenes...I think I actually got a yeast infection just from reading this thing. How many guys can one woman screw??? It's getting a little harder to keep it in my head that this mysterious ardeur is what keeps Anita bed-hopping (or desk-hopping, or floor-hopping...) so much and not think of her as a slut. I also kinda missed the whole murder mystery plot. It was kinda like: Open at a wedding where Anita has to go and start another murder case, then she comes home and has sex, then she goes to the club and has sex, then she has a threesome, foursome, then-some, has some more sex, then sex, sex, sex, and oh yeah, the strippers are dying in St. Louis, so let's sum that story up in about thirty pages, but not all the way in case we want to bring back the vampire serial killers, and then lets go have a little more sex before the book ends. Don't these people get tired of doing the nasty??? The Good Points: Nathaniel is stepping into some manhood and finally getting what he deserves from Anita, moving to another bed partner for her rather than just the hired help; Richard has maybe stopped being such a whining pain and will suck it up and be who he is; beginnings of an interesting new issue with the other vamps in town from the Church of Eternal Life (will LKH follow it up?). I kinda missed Micah and Jean Claude in this one though. Micah was MIA until Ronnie got drunk (and it was nice to see her back too), and it seemed like the only time Jean Claude stepped on the scene was to whisper something in Anita's head...was he asleep for the whole book? Overall, I hope the next one is better, but it's still a worthwhile read for long-time fans."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was slightly disappointed with this book, but still liked it. Yes, she does draw it out a bit with the ardeur, and has way to many hang ups with it, but it was still as bloody as the others. I am very upset that Asher wasnt in this one as much, and Jason was in the background. She also needs to find a way to bump Richard because he is getting on my last nerve. But i loved the \\"furry scene\\"! = ) Hopefully the next book will be better, less talkative during sex, and she will tell us what happens with the \\"mother of darkness\\" and Belle Morte."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was amazed at how good the condition of the book was and how fast it got here, only two days.

I've read all the previous books of hers and this is awesome. I love how Anita has been changed into a promiscuous man chaser who can't get enough sex. Jean Claude, Asher, Nathaniel, Jason etc. She has bedded them all and total strangers quite frequently. I can only hope that she manages to get it on with Dolph. Wouldn't that be the best!!!! Laurell's imagination and how she grows Anita's character is without equal. I can't wait to get started on the next book. Maybe with the ardeur she might test her sexuality with Ronnie!!!! OMG would that be cool!!!! Go Laurell, You rock!!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I do not recommend this book to anyone!!!!!!! The series started out with so much potential, and failed miserably. If I wanted to read porn, I would buy a dime store hustler rag. A little sex is great, but this author went beyond what I would consider acceptable. The story is lost amidst writhing bodies, and no plot direction. Not to mention the typos. I will not buy nor read another book by this author. Very disappointed!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton is one of my favorite authors - and her books keep getting better! I was introduced to the Anita Blake series about 4 years ago by a friend and bought the first 6 or 8 books to read on my trip to London where I spent a semester. I'll admit I had a hard time getting through the first couple books because they were so incredibly cheesy - but I had to keep reading them since I already had them all, and by the 4th or 5th book, I was hooked, cheesiness and all - they're like an addiction once you start them and now I love all of her books - including the Merry of Faerie series.Most of the reviewers ratings don't match Amazon's rating system of 1=hated it and 5=loved it. In other words, you don't have to only give 5 stars to the National Book Award winners - you rate them based on your own enjoyment of them.I do agree, however, with many of the complaints others have named, but I have to say I like the Anita in this book a lot more than the prude of Guilty Pleasures and the other early books who wouldn't even have sex with her boyfriend without over-analyzing it beforehand. And I got tired of reading about her horrible fashion sense - every other chapter she had to describe her entire outfit, right down to the Nikes with the swoosh matching whatever she was wearing.I also agree there were lots of loose ends and missing characters, but looking back over her other books in the series, a character will go missing for a book or two and then return in the new book, but this is partly because the time frame of each novel is so short - they usually only cover a week or 2 of real time - sometimes less, so everything can't always be resolved and all the characters can't have quality time since there are so many.Overall, despite the flaws inherent in the books, they're still quite addictive and enjoyable - and Laurell K.'s writing has improved tremendously from the first book - her books are a \\"guilty pleasure.\\""},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Well,I must say that while I did indeed enjoy this book, I felt that by having so little of the plot developed in Incubus Dreams, that something was missing. While I understand that characters grow and change, I cannot help but feel that some of the changes Anita went, and is going through, is not something that I feel her morals and/or character would EVER be comfortable with. This in turn creates (at least for me and several others)a feeling of conflict for the reader. The reader knows intuitivilly that no one would go against the very fabric of their being, and as an Anita fan from the first, several of the things in this book do. I do not speak of the sex scenes, they are good and when in the right place were excellent. I am glad that Hamilton allowed that progression. However, the main character Anita has gone way overboard and really needs a slap back to who she really was. A strong woman who knew, if nothing else, how to handle herself and her situations.Overall, in the end the book was great, but the uncomfortable feeling that Anita just isn't herself anymore will not go away. I guess that in the end I would like to see more of a merging of the secure, great plotline developments of old, with the new development of character lives as well. A bridge between the old and new. Plotlines of old with the new personalities. Now that is a book I would like to read. And of couse, more Jean Claude:)"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"You need to be on it in order to enjoy this travesty of a book. I'm sorry, but I've never read a book so bad, I don't remember what happened in it. What must LKH be thinking if she thinks this book is some of her best work. Makes me wonder who wrote the other books in the series if this is her \\"Best\\".Booooo!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Eh, the sex scenes here are actually part of the entire mystical foundation of the complicated triumverate that Richard, Jean Claude, and Anita have. I think it depends upon your idea of sexual freedom and what you think of as being sensible or \\"dirty\\". I liked it. It was a crazed and wild ride. That is supposed to be what these types of books are for!If readers want literature, they should try reading one of the classics, like \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\". Books that are written to be an epic of their own time - to reflect politics and the human drama of their own age. This is not one of them. This is a fantasy world made up with fantasy people. They get to live with exciting and dangerous elements that most of us do not know and may never know. Welcome to Fantasyland folks. Its awesome and provides an escape from the world that we live in today - heaven knows we all need one!Kisses."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I too felt it was misleading of the publishers to describe this book as a having a main plot revolving around a vampire serial killer. That was definitely a subplot in the book. I believe the purpose of this book was to get resolution for some of the key characters in the Anita Blake books. This book does show that Anita is finally coming to accept that sex is a major factor in her powers because she is tied to Jean-Claude. Richard is finally forced to face a few hard truths about himself. Anita if finally forced to recognize that Nathaniel and Damien are integral to her life.Again although I was disappointed in the weak plot line, I am extremely glad that it seems that LKH has her characters back on line, this in itself made the book a great read for me. I am looking forward to the next book where I believe we will get back to the butt kicking plots that we have all become accustomed to."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book is really the deep examination of Anita's emotions from over the course of the entire series. Though I myself don't really like books that are all about sexual situations, I had to admire the sense of release that Anita gained from finally coming to terms with the problems and people in her life. I thought that the new Richard was more likeable than before, and I appreciated that Anita was finally able to slip more into a comfort zone than from the turbulence that her life has been. Hamilton explores the morals of the diverse sexual life of Anita, and she brings across from Anita's perspective that one way of life may be more comfortable and right for some people, but unique relationships are sometimes better suited to different lifestyles. This book did not contain the amount of mystery and policework that the other novels in the series did...but it resolved most of the emotional tension and hurt that Anita had accumulated over the series. I was satisfied with the solutions and conclusions Anita drew to understand her relationships better, and I felt that Laurell K. Hamilton achieved the purpose she sought to achieve by resolving Anita's emotional and personal troubles. Though you might be disappointed with the lack of the usual straight plotline, I hope you that you feel the same way I did about Anita's coming to terms with herself."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I thought the book would totally suck and that's why I bought it from the half-price bookstore. But it was a decent read. I'm not all that into Nathaniel but I was interested in Micah and Anita's new powers , as well as Damian. I wanted to know more about Wicked and Truth. I'm glad she and Ronnie have patched things up. I could have done with out all the sex with strangers. I liked that she admitted that she loved Micah and Nathaniel. Don't care too much about Richard, just think he's a bit of a punk. Jean-Claude was in the background and that was cool with me too. The four + pages of sex was a little over done. But overall even with the thin almost plotless story it had me reading it and enjoying it because Anita seems to be learning to move on and grow. I thought it was certainly not Laurell's best and it completely dropped previous loose ends but it was better than expected but then what everyone else didn't like about the lack of Jean- Claude I didn't care about and though I missed Asher he wasn't really warranted. But alot of sex and little plot gives this book 2 stars even though I liked it to an extent."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have to say that after being disappointed with the last book in the Merry Gentry series I wasn't expecting much. While I enjoy both characters I definitely feel that sex is over taking the plot in both series. I will say that while Incubus Dreams had a little too much sex it also had an intriguing story line. I started off reading slowly, unsure if I could finish what I think is the longest book in the series. Then at around midway I started getting into the book and ended up finishing it in a few days. I feel that it was good and despite Anita departing from who she was in the beginning of these books I still enjoy the character. Someone else on here said how some of the other characters were completely left out and this is true. But there are so many people populating Anita's universe that there is no way that the stories can remain comprehensible and juggle every one of them. However I would like to see Edward come back, especially now that Anita has changed so drastically. Otherwise I think Laurell K. is still able to write an intriguing and beguiling story."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Have read this book three times now. If you are familiar with the series you will like that Richard finally comes to terms with himself. Anita also seems to come to terms with her powers and is starting to deal with everything rather than worry it to death. LKH touched on Damian and what his life was like and his needs are now. Nathaniel finally got what he wanted. I was so happy to see that. This book deals with all the stuff that has been building up in the last few books and I was glad to see that. The Anita Blake stories just get better and better as they go along. Can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This was an interesting book. I have long been a fan of Ms. Hamilton's work and really anticipated this book. Over the last couple of weeks I reread the entire Anita Blake series to refresh my memories and just for the fun of it.I purchased Incubus Dreams the day it came out and finished it the next day.I literally could not put it down.Much like a train wreck,I couldn't stop looking at it.I have read quite a bit of erotica but never 300 or so pages of it.Not that the sex was bad or a bad thing,just that even with my own version of morality being very open I was quite surprised to find that Anita had sex with Richard, Nathaniel(twice), Damian, Micah,Byron,Jean Claude (sort of), Requiem (sort of)and I just know that I am missing someone in a 24 hour period.It just seemed a little hardcore. The serial killer (sub)plot seemed to me to be wrapped up a little too quickly almost like an afterthought. And like other reviewers I too miss Edward. By the way, how are Donna and the kids? When is Olaf coming to town? Anyway, this book was what an Anita Blake book should be, pure entertainment. If I wanted to read something deep I have Tolstoy in the den.I eargerly await her next book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Even though I had read some of the negitive comments about this book, I like many other love the Anita series. And I for one am glad she is finally finding some peace with the main men in her life, and not fighting it so much. Some times you need to step back and setting some things before you can move on to bigger and better things. This was a more emotional book for Anita, and I think some people read it only for all the action and big baddies. I did miss those, but not that much. All I can say is read this if you liked her previous books and make up your own mind, it also has it's own merit."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I've been scanning through some of the other reviews and I respect much of what they said. From my perspective, I feel that Anita has finally come to accept herself more in this book and it shows. The reader is left which a slight sense of fulfillment that she finally gets over the hang ups in her life that prevent from being comfortable with who she is and the lifestyle she has chosen. Yes, the sex can be a bit random, definitely unexpected, but it defines her wild nature in a way. The series is slowly slumping in the action sections but hopefully that will pick up over time. New powers abound in this book and it really is a good read. There are a few errors that should've been fixed through spell check or what not, but she was in a rush to show us, her fans, her latest work. Despite the errors, the story she weaves produces numerous unexpected twists and turns in the plot. I just don't see how it can get more complicated than this. Overall, the book was definitely well worth the read, overzealous sex and all."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book is not a 5 star book. It's a 4 star book, but I felt compelled to add an extra star to balance out the overly negative reviews, and ratings that are being handed out by dissaffected mystery / romance Anita Blake fans. These fans loved the \\"original\\" Anita Blake novels, and would have loved to have her become a static character that basically does the same thing in each of her novels. Unfortunately for them LKH has different ideas. She's decided she want's all her characters to change and grow. I've found the growth paths she's chosen for many of her characters to be very surprising in many ways.Having said all of this I must admit to having felt resentment when she first started changing the Anita Blake novels. After a few more Novels of constantly changing Anita's world I became a little fed up with the fact that I no longer had \\"my\\" Anita stories as I had come to expect them. So I did the only thing that I thought was fair, before writing a review to condemn this book to the ninth circle of hell where I originally thought it belonged. To remind myself of how \\"great\\" the original stuff was I re-read them recently all at one go, and polished off Incubus Dreams once again. Boy was I wrong! She's done something fantastic with this series, a great character that was doomed to constant repetition of bad thing enters, kills-maims-yada-yada, Anita get's involved, she's hurt friends are taken hostage-mutilated-killed, she swears vengeance and kills it. Don't get me wrong it's a good script for a successful repeat series that will keep people coming back for more, but LKH has decided she wants to expand the horizons of Anita's world as far as she can take them, and has laid the ground work for a larger, richer world in which her characters can grow for many years to come. Huge risk, but if we can stick with her I think we will be rewarded for many years to come with the wonderful bonanza of stories and plots now available in the Anita Blake universe.Sorry for rushing the end of the review here, but basically I just feel she has expanded the series from a simple mystery/romance to a more open type of universe where she ( or other who have the appropriate skills, and feel the need ) will be able to write entire novels to fill in the back stories about many of the Awesome characters that inhabit the Anita Blake universe.Yes it's different, and not what the original series felt like it would be, but change is not always bad, specially if it allows for so many wonderful things to be added to a great series.Thanks for reading this, and I hope you find this review somewhat useful."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I wasn't sure if I was going to buy a book with so many bad reviews. So many people seem to hate Incubus Dreams. I am a big Anita fan though, so I read a few chapters while I was in the book store and it dragged me right into the story. While there is a lot of sex in this book, it is all part of the plot line and moves along the characterization and the developement of various plot points. Frankly, if you've been reading the series as a whole, you should know by now that the Anita Blake books having been becoming more and more sexually charged and there is nothing in Incubus Dreams that hasn't been set up from previous books. It's very much in the same vein as the most recent books of this series, so if someone didn't like those earlier books, it's doubtful they'll like this latest offering. I liked the previous books and I really enjoyed Incubus Dreams. A huge book, but thoroughly entertaining and I felt I got my money's worth and then some.It could have been edited better, because there was a lot of wrong words where a letter has been dropped or in the wrong place which change the meaning. It didn't really bother me because I could tell what it was supposed to be from context, but the publisher should have fixed a lot of the spelling/word mistakes in a simple proof read. That is not Ms. Hamilton's job though, hers is to turn in a full manuscript that is interesting enough to make people buy the book. She has done her job in spades.In Incubus Dreams Anita comes to grips with the Ardeur. THis is not by vanquishing this supernatural sexual appetite that both provides power but demands constant satisfaction as it's price. Anita understands the Ardeur better and finally accepts it is a part of her now, and that she can use it to her advantage if she manages it instead of trying to ignore it. Meanwhile, a master vampire serial killer and his nest/kiss has come into Anita and JC's territory and is leaving a taunting trail of murdered Strippers that is both a challenge to the local supernatural community and enciting anti-supernatural feeling in the human community. Anita tries to track down the rogue vampires, and in the doing so finds out that the mainstream vampire religious organization, the Church of Eternal Life, has been keeping dangerous secrets that could have extremely disasterous and far reaching consequences.There are loose ends left dangling, not so much as cliff hangers as obvious lead ins to future storylines. But the book is complete in itself and can stand alone, but works better as part of the ongoing series. I would recommend new readers to go through the earlier books in their chronological order before reading Incubus Dreams. If you enjoy the later books of the series, by all means continue because this is an excellent continuation of the previous books. If the last few books weren't your thing, this may not be the book for you. It was for me a good read. =)"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Though I understand some of the other reviewers points; I still love this series. Why should Anita stay the same, everyone changes as things change around them. I read this book in three days and am ready to read it again! It is not for the faint of heart, but if you follow the series this book let's you see the developing relationships Anita has under difficult circumstances that will never happen to you or I.Keep up the great work Laurell!!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was dreading reading this book because of the reviews I read here, but I took the plunge set aside this weekend and started reading. I was not disappointed. This is not for the new reader. This is a book for the loyal, a book for those who want to ride this story out to the end. The sex is hot, but not gratuitous. Its role reminds us that whatever monster or power lurks within Anita, she is still human, not a vampire, not a were creature. It reminds us of how complicated we allow things to get in our head, when the solution is simple, and often right in front of us. It also reminds us that love is not easily defined.What I found is that our little Anita is coming into more and more power. She is growing, she is evolving. Laurell K Hamilton did an excellent job with this book. Anita is finding out so much about herself.YES, there is sex. Well, good grief what have we come to expect? I reread the whole series in anticipation of this book, and it has been a steady build up, and I believe we can expect sex to continue to play an ever growing role to the end of this series. After all sex is Jean Claude's headiest power to call."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Was I as an Anita fan satisfied? Yes!!!!!!!!!! Do all questions have to be answered in the next book? No! Did more questions get raised? Yes! Will I keep reading? YES! Why? Because this book was excellent.I get offended reading negative reviews stating that LKH is living out her fantasies while writing and that this is just Porn. If you've bothered to get to know the author you are reading. LKH states that she pushes the envelope in her writing because of the censorship that has been placed on women authors.I won't deny that this book was sexy, or erotic because it was both, but this is a series 12 books in length, the plot is the interaction between the characters. Not just the crime that brings them together. After 12 books if the characters did not become a priority I would have been bored stiff. I enjoy each journey LKH takes me when she writes, and I praise her for having the guts to push the envelope. She is a mainstream author who doesn't have to hide her talent for writing both the serious and the sensual in an e-book.If there is too much sex in the series now, don't read it!The book was engaging and sensual and funny. Yes there was some editing errors, but the plots were well thought out and written wonderfully. It was a book I had to force myself to put down because I just didn't want it to end. For me this is my new favorite because the characters are more alive. I don't read for the plot I read for the characters and they just keep getting better and better. So take a chance and look at the characters, don't count the errors or the sex scenes you might be suprised that Anita is no longer a frigid woman. She has compassion, and sensuality that goes far beyond sex."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm sorry to say this, but it must be said. Sex is a part of life, everyone that ever existed would never have come to fruition without sex. Why is it that people have such a problem with it when it shows up in their favorite books? So Anita found herself having allot of sex in the book...she has the ardeur which happens to feed off of sex...we knew this in Nascicus in Chains...Why must people go out of their way to flame a very talented writer? I don't see them having written 16 going on 18 full sized novels, and I'm sure if they have they wouldn't be getting emaculate reviews about everyone!Now, with that being said, yes there is allot of sex in this book. I happen to also read romance novels as well as LKH and found that she's ruined me to most because she's so good. I loved the character development, especially the focus on Nataniel (always a favorite since Burnt Offerings) I could've done without the developments on the Richard side, cause lets face it, he's a winney ***** but he's also metephysically connected to Anita so LKH had to at least put in a small cameo for him. I felt it was worth the price I paid to buy this product. I'm keeping it, and after i'm done reading through the 4th Merry Gentry novel I'm going to re-read the entire Anita series front to back.In reference to the lack of focus on the crime scene, maybe LKH is focusing more on basic political mysteries than trying to induce nightmares into her readers with graphic discriptions of dead and mutilated bodies...by the way, you flame her on her sex scenes, but you don't have problems with the gorey carnage that has been given in previous books?Anyway, the book is well worth it and I am anticipating the next 2 books (Which look like they're going to be scrumptious LKH!) with baited breath!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I've read all the Anita Blake books. I have a hundred pages left and for the most part I have enjoyed the first 568, regardless of the 1 & 2 Star Ratings. It doesn't have the gut grabbing plot twists & turns or the gory murder scenes. Mostly, Anita moves beyond some of her more stubborn boundries. But then, this character is all about evolving. And to be frank I was tired of the whole \\"this isn't what I was taught\\" thing.Yes it contains a LOT of sex, but if you accepted Micah who dropped out of nowhere in Narcissus in Chains and her sex with Jason then her coupling with Asher and Jean Claude, hasn't the line already been blurred, if not crossed, for multiple partners?Cerulean Sins did leave issues unresolved, all of the books have to some extent. I didn't actually like Cerulean Sins until the last 100 pages. I kept thinking it had to be leading up to the next book and maybe it is. You just need to be a little farsighted.If the events in Incubus Dreams did not take place, all the unresolved issues remained, no new vamps joined the group, and Richard was just negative energy out there trying to commit suicide second hand, then what chance would the Triumvirate have now against the Mother of All Darkness. Yes...Yes where did the two child Ambassadors from Belle go, what of Asher's new powers, where are Belle and the Mother of all Darkness,...ect...ect....ect. No mention of these is why I only gave it 3 Stars.However, had this book tied it all up in a nice tight little package where would the plot go from there? Anita and the gang were over due for a little repair and preparation. Remember, the ultimate goal is Undefeatable Power. Enough power to keep everyone they love safe from Belle or whoever else might come along. This book patches up some of the wholes and builds a larger power base.I really had wanted to see Asher's tortured character embraced by someone who loves him, not just as an adjunct to Jean Claude, but I'll have to wait for that. Anyway Anita is already spread a little thin (no pun intended) So would it really be so unforgivable if he had someone of his own?This book could've had more concise explanations, less wordiness and more detail on new characters and it didn't explain all the whys or whats from Cerulean Sins. Less he said: she said, he did: she did would be wonderful, but isn't that what these conflicted, self-loathing, paranormal characters have been doing all along. In every book, Anita and Richard have gotten more and more neurotic.I'd rather not wait a year for the next installment, but it must take a while to plan, write and execute a volume of complicated characters and plot twists that flow and make reasonable sense. I'll wait, I've read enough that didn't.If you want a monogamous character who grows, but morally doesn't change that drastically, try Eve Dallas in J. D. Robb's (aka., Nora Roberts) \`Something' in Death series. They're great, lots of detail, futuristic scifi, with a main romantic character."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"As a fan of LKH, I absolutely adored this book. As an avid reader of her series, I thoroughly enjoyed the character growth I saw in this book. In addition, I also appreciated the themes of safety and acceptance that I felt were prevalent. Safety, in that everyone needs and deserves a \\"safe harbor\\" in life, and you need to open yourself up to others in order to achieve that. Acceptance, as in who or what you are personally, regardless of societal ideals and constraints.The character growth in this series is wonderful - from Anita growing from her somewhat racist attitude towards Vampires in Guilty Pleasures (\\"The only good Vampire is a dead vampire; it isn't REALLY murder if they're already dead\\"), and her NIMBY attitude toward Lycanthropes (yes, it's not their fault that they were infected, but I certainly wouldn't want to BE one), to being metaphysically and emotionally involved with several Vampires, Werewolves, and Wereleopards.First time readers and continuing readers of L. K. Hamilton's Anita Blake's series can enjoy her always expanding alternate universe, with it's vampires, necromancers, were animals and the occasional fae. I would recommend this series (and LKH's Merry Gentry series) to anyone. A completely satisfying read that left me craving the next book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Faithful readers of the Anita Blake series will find no great surprises in this latest installment of the series. Anita grows into her power, spends more time in supernatural society and increasingly assumes their values... as she copulates copiously.Are the sex scenes worth avoiding? You betcha. Nearly two hundred pages of sex scenes and none of them got a rise out of me. It is far too late to save the trees, but you can save this book by skimming through the sex. Decide for yourself how much you can take. Self-service editing is the wave of the future.There is a lot to like here. Anita continues to develop powers far beyond the ordinary. The rules governing human society correspond to her own experience with disturbing infrequency. Her ironclad certainties rust away. With every book, Anita steps further away from the community of ordinary humanity and into the world of the supernatural. She'll cross the line one of these days; maybe not this novel or the one after that, but soon. And she'll justify herself every step of the way.This kind of character development is worth a few hundred pages of bad sex scenes."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm too devoted to the series to give it anything but 5! I read the books back to back three times before I've gotten my fill. And I was especially happy since this one had so many pages.While there is a lot of sex (and it's all very packed into a consequitive amount of pages), there's also a murder mystery and a plot once more. We get to meet some fun new vamps. Anita discovers new levels to her powers and, best of all, Nathaniel starts growing into his own.It's nice to see the character development there and Anita's starting to get a better feel of her powers by the end of the book, so I was happy."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"it was amazing and couldn't put it down tell i finished it .

She now has the complete set thanks to Amazon. Definitely have to be a reader of vampire stories to enjoy these but they are a great set. We are already looking forward to future releases in this series."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"\\"We're wasting time with all this personal s***.\\"At the wedding of Larry to Tammy, Anita is called to the scene of the crime. Apparently strippers are being killed. She returns to her home and her love life gets even more complicated. Nathaniel wants to be with her, she creates a new Triumvirate, and the ardeur needs constant feeding. In between having sex to feed the ardeur, Anita hops by her office, performs a zombie raising, attends a crime scene, and does some investigating.This is THE WORST Anita Blake book I've read. I didn't like \\"Obsidian Butterfly\\", but I will admit it was because of the misogynistic themes and the child rape. The story wasn't actually half bad. This, ono the other hand, should NEVER have been published. It is a badly written, poorly executed, bloated, boring, dull insipid, whiny teenaged wet dream that ought to have stayed on a fanfiction website instead of making its way into the published world.Let's just get this out there: Anita Blake is a Mary Sue, pure and simple. Any hint that she might not be is completely torn away in this book. She whines about how she doesn't have one single person to call her own - when she has THREE boyfriends. She can say horrible things about other people - but when Ronnie jokingly calls Anita \\"weird\\", Anita bites her best friend's head off Anita is the most unpleasant, unlikable, REPULSIVE character I have EVER read. Sure, Anita likes to pretend she's grown up, that she doesn't bite people's heads off or start fights, but nothing in this book proves to me that Anita has grown up beyond 14 years old.The \\"men\\" in Anita's life have absolutely no personality and almost nothing to distinguish themselves from each other. Jean-Claude calls Anita \\"ma petite\\". Micah is Anita's height and they share clothes (yes, they apparently do this). Nathaniel has long hair and acts like a freakin' 1950's housewife - that is, when he's NOT acting like a 5 year old. Asher has golden hair. Damien is constantly near death. Richard is an @$$. There is no other character to these people. Hell, cardboard cutouts would have more personality than these nameless, featureless, colorless lumps for Anita to have sex with.And boy, does Anita have sex!! I lost track of how many times Anita had sex or talked about sex or whined about sex or gave tips about sex or talked about how she liked to fondle a man's junk in her mouth before it was rigid. It was ridiculous. It was literally like reading some teenaged girl's masturbatory fantasy. Like climbing into bed with Laurell K. Hamilton.And the sex scenes weren't sexy. I would venture to say that 90% of them, Anita HAD to perform or die from the stupid ardeur. All of the sex scenes were so bloated with talking, pre-, post-, and during sex that I wanted to scream, \\"JUST HAVE SEX ALREADY!!\\" And I swear, Anita can never have sex with just one person. Oh no, she has to have two people, even if one is just watching. Awkward much?And the ardeur...I cannot believe how stupid this thing is getting. You know, it could almost be an interesting plot point. I can see it, lurking under the surface. The desire and lust that Anita wants to bring out, but her morals hold her back. But it is done so wrong. Instead of Anita growing up and learning to love sex, Anita just continues to act like a child and whine about it. Instead of having consistent rules, the ardeur basically changes to whatever LKH needs it to at the time. That's why it can be that Anita goes from feeding it every 12 hours to every 6 and then to not at all in a 24 hour period. YOU DO NOT DO THIS. You do not create rules and then violate them. And you don't create rules that make Fizbin look like an easy game to learn.Other characters were equally as laughable. As I've said a billion times before, every single woman in this series is useless or hateful to Anita. Jessica, Tammy, and now my poor, poor Ronnie. Jessica is upset because Nathaniel was single, but now he is with Anita. And of course, who's fault is that? Jessica's. Because Anita is blameless a pure. A woman who wants to resurrect her son turns violent in Anita's office when Anita refuses to raise him. Who's fault is that? Definitely not Anita's! Ronnie feels threatened when Louie tries to corner her and marry her. When the two break up over their differences, Ronnie, in the depths of her despair, goes to a cheap club to get drunk and try to drown her sorrows. She calls Anita, asking for a ride. And what is Anita's response?\\"I'd had enough...of Ronnie dragging our asses down here, enough of her self-destructive indulgence.\\"Aw, what a wonderful friend. I wish I had a female friend as heartless, cold, and selfish as Anita Blake!!What plot there is in this book is boring and dull, a regurgitation of plots from previous books. It's not particularly bad, per se, but it is nowhere near good enough to be able to sludge through 80% of this crap.And then your favorite and mine...the writing! Here are some of the brilliant quotes that LKH got paid to write. She wrote them. An editor read them and approved them. This was published. Places are charging money for you to buy this.Sit back and enjoy the:Top 5 Best (Worst) Quotes That LKH Suckered People Into Paying Money For:5. \\"I watched the vampire come at me like a comet streaking across the heavens, something elemental and otherworldly.\\" I have always been a fan of paranormal celestial beings myself.4. \\"The front of his pants spilled open, and he spilled out. Either he wasn't wearing any underwear or it couldn't keep him contained...the sight of him nude excited me, made me nervous, afraid in that Oh My God, where am I going to put it all sort of way.\\" So much spilling going around in here...someone better'd get a mop!3. \\"You don't fall in love with your steak, because it can't hold you, can't press warm lips in the bend of your neck and whisper 'Thank you' as it glides down the hallway in the charcoal grey slacks that fit its @$$ like a second skin and spill roomy over the thighs that you happen to know are even lovelier out of the pants than in.\\" I think the metaphor is dead, LKH.2. \\"It wasn't my pulse I was choking on; it was as if the terror itself were wet silk, and I was trying to swallow it. Slick, wet, suffocating.\\" Metaphor OVERLOAD!!And my absolute favorite...1. \\"His pulse beat like something alive inside his skin.\\" OMG, he's ALIVE?!?! NO WAY!! Who would have thought something with a PULSE was ALIVE??And from this point on, LKH is never allowed to use ANY of the following words or phrases again:- frown harder- spill- very male- tight- wet- f@#$ me- metaphysics- blue, blue eyes- blush harderI thought I was never going to finish this fecal matter. I cannot believe this is 26 hours long. NOTHING happens in this book. The mystery doesn't matter, Anita grows no closer to figuring out all the \\"metaphysical\\" bullcrap that LKH has invented for her life, Anita still whines about having 6 boyfriends and near constant sex, and to make matters worse, ALL the characters suffer. Larry has disappeared. Ronnie is unrecognizable. Jean-Claude is almost never around. Sure, Nathaniel gets a bit of a plot, but adding him as an official member to Anita's boytoys is not what I call character development.This is the poorest excuse for a book. I've been harsh on this series; I've gotten mad at it numerous times. But this book is a waste of time. Most of the rest of the books have had some redeeming quality. Even \\"Narcissus in Chains\\" and \\"Cerulean Sins\\" fell into the \\"so bad it's good\\" territory with the atrocious writing. This book is so bloated, so boring, so dull that it is nigh unreadable.I don't to read about what gets LKH off. I don't want to read about her Mary Sue proving everyone to be not as much of a tough @$$ as she is. I want to read about a vampire hunter, an executioner that kills paranormal baddies. If there is sex, great. But when a good 80% of the book is about sex, having it or talking endlessly about it, I am gone.Will I be returning to Anita Blake, Vampire Sex Gymnast? I honestly don't know; this book was so terrible, that I am half tempted to call it quits here. Only time will tell.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I've been reading Sci-Fi/Fantasy books for years. This book is misrepresented as such. It should be contained in the porn section. I've read 2/3rds of the book so far, and almost all of is is offensive, raunchy sex, none of it related to any meaningful relationship. Not what I fantasize about! I have tossed the book into the trash. This is my first and last book by this author.Especially offensive is the quote on the cover that \\"what the De Vince Code did for the religious triller, the Anita Blake series has done for the vampire novel.\\" Not by ANY stretch of the imagination. False advertising of the worst kind. (Guess I should have read the Amazon reviews first!)There are a number of better vampire series out there. Do yourself a favor and pick another."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I love the book but theres about 3 chapters that has been misprinted. Half the pages are gone and it starts about half way through the page. Very unsatisfied with the quality of the book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I reached a point in the Anita Blake series where I had to stop reading for a while, read something else and then irrevocably comeback to the series.I have to say that since Narcissus in Chains I wasn't able to follow the same protocol since the series really took a turn for the best right there and then. Ive enjoyed every book since then and this one was by far the hottest one in the series. Forget Fifty shades! Nathaniel teaches in this book what a true submissive gone dominant should really be like.Let's begin: the book starts with a wedding, very cute Halloween themed wedding, very authentic. Then Micah tells a story about his nose and... God it was painful to read.Anita and Nathaniel in the dancefloor. (I'm trying to find a word here that means more than hot) INCREDIBLY HOT! I have waited 10 books for this moment, specially the moment when Nathaniel becomes this totally different character and dominates the heck out of Anita. I was basically squirming in my chair.Ronnie we missed you!!This book was full of emotions, Anita coming to terms with who she is and who she loves. Admitting to her self how much Jean Claude, Nathaniel, Richard even Damian mean to her and actually saying it out loud proved that she is changing. She seemed so selfish at the beginning of the series though she is such a coward in this book. Coward to hear Micah's torments, Nathaniel's needs, Ronnie's issues.End of the book and still no closure for Nathaniel, she just keeps putting him (involuntarily) on the side. Nothing really changed between him and Anita.Revenant Damian and naked Anita fighting was so funny and awkward. Poor Damian keeps suffering because of her, anything she does, or doesn't do affects him and it makes me feel so sorry for him, to see where he ended up and how many changes have been forced into his life.A couple questions at the end of this book: why are most of the intriguing men so short? (Micah, Byron, Jason).And it was almost the end and I was still wondering why incubus dreams? One of the things I love the most about these series is the book titles but this one was explained at the very end which led me to suspicions throughout the whole book because really any character could have been the incubus. Luckily it wasn't a person but a business.The Richard/Anita/Jean Claude triumvirate consolidating was the hottest scene I've read in my entire life."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I've been so disappointed with Incubus Dreams. I thought it was just me, but after reading a few other reviews, I feel better that it's not just me. Laurell Hamilton is a great writer. But I get the feeling that after Obsidian Butterfly, the \\"thriller\\" part of the series vanished and we are left with little more than a book of erotic fiction with a sparse story line. I like seeing Anita's character evolve. I actually skipped two chapters last night. Two or three chapters devoted completely to a new sexual excursion may be a bit of overkill. Even the erotica of it all is getting redundant. I get it, I really do. But it's lost something. I hope Micah starts getting better because I feel committed to this series now. I want the dark humor and excitement back!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"First and foremost, let me say this: I think it is extremely dishonest and inappropriate of Amazon to cull reviews that speak negatively of items they sell. This is the second time I have written this review, and I know from browsing the site that others have had their negative (or at least not-so-glowing) reviews erased.This book wasn't terrible, but it sure as hell wasn't very good. Ms Hamilton needs a proofreader and a better editor. There are words misspelled in this book that should not be. There are grammatical errors and spelling mistakes that even Spell Check would catch. To let these errors make it to the finished product is uncalled for. And there are phrases and expressions that Hamilton uses that do not have the shelf life she imagines they do. For instance, please find proper substitutes for the phrases \\"flat out does it for me\\" and \\"take one for the team.\\"I loved the first 8 or 9 AB books. I couldn't read them fast enough. Even characters I wasn't too fond of, like Richard, grew on me. But with the ardeur comes what so many writers dread, because they aren't easy to write: sex scenes. A properly written sex scene is a glorious thing to behold - if the writer is adept at creating them. Anita's first encounter with J-C was great: it was sweet and hot and the same time. Those of us who wanted them to just do it already pumped our fists in the air and reread that passage several times.Incubus Dreams was just an awkward book, like a pubescent boy that hasn't quite grown into his height or voice. You can see where Hamilton wants to go, but at the same time, you can see that she doesn't quite have any idea how she will get there. Anita gets new powers willy-nilly and seemingly out of nowhere. She no longer comes across as a consummate professional, be it as an animator or as a Federal Marshal. Hamilton is going to have to figure out some way for Anita to further control the ardeur, because having her walk into a place and screw people that she has barely laid eyes on does nothing for her respectability and likeability.Lastly, the Nathaniel situation is not my favorite. Such a damaged boy, and for Anita to decide that to keep him on as a pet/houseboy (because that is what he is, despite anyone's objections) would help him more than hinder him just makes me sad. You would think that as a woman and as a member of the fairer sex, Hamilton would have a little more insight on such enabling behavior.I will finish this series, because I started it, and I will always give it a chance. I don't want to dislike these books, I want nothing more than for them to get better, as they used to be. I will not be purchasing books to come until I have read them first, and until Hamilton has redeemed Anita a little. It's very hard to enjoy a character that you no longer respect."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Remember in _Narcissus in Chains_ that we didn't really find out about Chimaera until the end of the book? Remember in _Cerulean Sins_ how the serial killer seemed to be an afterthought?There's so much happening in Anita Blake's life that she can't keep track of it all. As a result, you're through a third of the book and you realize it's only been about 16 hours. There's a hell of a lot of sex in this one, yes -- probably the most of any of Hamilton's books, Merry Gentry included -- but there's a lot of other good stuff. There's plenty of character development, lots of new and interesting vampires (okay, just a couple, but I like Requiem very much), and the fulfillment of many a reader's fantasy.People who read these books either care about the crime drama part or the relationships-and-supernatural-stuff part. I'm toward the latter myself; I can read crime-and-serial-killer fiction from better authors. But Hamilton draws you in again, makes you care, makes you empathize, and does something I hadn't expected: she makes you remember why you loved each of the protagonists from the moment you saw them.Also, this is by far the funniest Hamilton book I've ever read. Not laugh-a-minute Terry Pratchett funny, but more like \\"wow, that's a great comparison\\" or \\"damn, that's humorous\\" funny. I remember chuckling at least ten times reading the first two-thirds of the book, and that's more than I can remember from any of the Anita stories.I think Hamilton's new marriage has had a lot to do with this. I think she's more comfortable in her own life, and it's coming through in her writing. This book is more hopeful. The more you read, the more you feel that everything's going to work out just fine.On the other hand... there are far too many characters, far too many \\"power-of-the-week\\" moments, and an abominable amount of typographical errors. Dolph's name has been spelled I think four ways since the books began. Semicolons and commas are misplaced, as are apostrophes. Laurell K. Hamilton sells a LOT of books; you'd think the publisher could find a better editor, or at least sit her down and say \\"we're making these changes; deal with it\\". Nothing content-wise, but it's really difficult to suspend your disbelief when every tenth apostrophe is misplaced and the phrase \\"me, too\\" is used with impunity.Hamilton \\"purists\\" must realize they'll never see a \\"Lunatic Cafe\\" or \\"Killing Dance\\" again. Anita has new powers that have to be explained in every book, new characters that have to be agonized over, new police stories (I particularly like the direction she's taken with Dolph and Zerbrowski).Nathaniel and Jason fans will, again, very much enjoy this book. I have to admit, I wasn't a big fan of Nathaniel the first few books he was in, but I always enjoyed Jason. He's always been funny.But do we really need the \\"fine print\\" of the way Animators Inc works? Do we really need Anita to keep dredging up the mother thing and the stepmother thing and the claustrophobia thing to the tune of ten or twelve total pages? Do we really need yet another preternatural boogeyman?I guess we do. We'll see in Anita 13."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I don't know what everyone is complaining about... yep, the zombie-raising & detective work take a back seat in this one, but instead there's lots of hot, steamy sex... and taboo sex has been integral part of vampire lore for a long time, so why should that be dropped or denied now? It only makes sense that the sex scenes are outrageous, filled with S & M themes, and all the other stuff of dark fantasy. I say, leave the vanilla sex for faint of heart, hold me down and keep it coming!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I can describe this book very quickly: the first few books of the series had very \\"PG\\" sex scenes, very graphic violence. With a couple of exceptions, each book in the series has seen the sex get more graphic, while the violence stays pretty static or maybe recedes a trifle. This book continues that pattern, and given that this is book 12 of the series, one would be correct in guessing that the sex is pretty darned graphic; we've gone beyond \\"erotica\\" to XXX porn. Granted, even given that there are a distressing number of typos in this book, (which is why I only rated it at four stars instead of five) the writing is far better than most of what you will see in most hardcore porn, but that doesn't change the fact that it is clearly too hardcore to call it anything else.So -- if you enjoy well-written hardcore sex scenes, with a bit of character development and plot mixed in for good measure, you'll love this book. (I confess, I did.) But if you want more than a tenth of the book to involve plot that is not centered on the main character's sex life, and more than a third of the book to be something other than outright graphic sex scenes, you may want to give this one a pass. This is no longer a mystery-detective thriller; it is, plain and simple, a pornographic adventure. I loved it, but I've a liking for well-written porn. If you like this sort of thing, just jump right in; don't bother reading the previous eleven books; you won't understand all of the background for this one, but it won't really matter. But if you are at all dubious about sexual content, steer clear. There's nothing subtle about the sex in this one."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm sorry, this novel was just horrible. I ended up skipping PAGES because it was so boring, redundant, or just dumb...I definitely would never recommend this book. The writing is bland, confusing and all over the place.

An all around waste of time."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I don't mind sex scenes...even if some are graphic (the first time Anita and JC are together is HOT). However, this book was just a string of graphic sex scenes, one right after another. I love the characters in this series of books.

For Sookie we have Bill and Eric with a dash of Alcide & Quinn. But for the incomparable Anita Blake we have Jean-Claude, Richard, Asher, Nathaniel, Jason, Damien and my personal favorite: Micah. Who says a woman can't have it all? Anita is tortured by norms but she is who she is and the angst of these relationships is powerful. I have loved the entire series and Laurell's vision of these characters. Some readers miss the mystery of the first set of books and don't care for the relationship madness. I personally love it all and trust the authors vision to develop Anita as she needs to be developed. Throw away your 'white picket fence\\" ideals and take a wild ride with Anita Blake. You might just enjoy it...I know I did."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I almost didn't buy this book, based on the reviews I read here. I am glad I got it though. I liked that Anita is no longer under the forced-sex aspect of the ardeur anymore-- she can choose when she feeds, and while that means she is likely to forget, or put it off, that also means that hopefully she can actually choose her own times and partners again, if she pays attention.Yes, she finally has sex-- real sex to Anita-- with Nathaniel. FINALLY. Poor Nathaniel, geez. That at least is all sorted out.Yes, lots of sex, some with people she doesn't know, but it does have a purpose at the time. I actually like that she is becoming more practical in that aspect. Her prudishness has caused problems in the past, and maybe she will relax slightly when it comes to her relationships, sexual or not, with the people around her.I do not like the amount of emphasis that LKH has put on sex in Anita's life, but I am still hopeful that it is to some purpose other than just to be a pain in the ass to her publishing company. I am still hopeful that she is not just ignoring what her fans need just to prove a point.I like sex in books-- I think that anyone who can put those thoughts to paper, so that all can see, is brave. BUT... to let it consume a storyline that has already been based in another genre is a VERY BAD IDEA.I am not as regretful about buying this book as I first thought I would be; it was worth the 8 dollars I paid. But I hope LKH comes to her senses soon, and cleans up her act. If she starts a series, she has to DAMN well finish it, not sneak it away and trade it for something else.Buy the book... at least to watch Nathaniel grow-- he was worth my 8 dollars."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"If you are a fan then it is worth reading.

LK Hamilton's last 3 of the AB series and her most controversial are simply some of the best character development ever! NC, CS and ID have some of most amazing depth of characters revelations in them I have ever read ( did not say they were hard to read sometimes but they were essential to the characters development not just Anita's ) in a long time. The famous desk scene with Jean Claude and Anita this leads up to one of the most important revelations in the whole series ( you will have to read the book). Each character is unique and brings a depth of humanity to the series. I think sometime people do not like change in there main characters but there has to be growth or the character stagnates and LKH really knows how to shake things up !!! I don't know what everyone else read but I read three wonderful books."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"yes this book is full of sex. is that a bad thing i love the anita blake books, but frankly the mystery plots were getting old big bad monster kills lots anita saves day. i think LKH was taking a well needed break from that story line,and decided that nathanal was being a well neglcted caracter. look at this book as a focus on him kinda like the one that revieled more of edward. face it nathanial is a stripper so the book would be full of sex. it was a nice respite and i think LKH is working on some big twists in her next book that are not about anitas sex life. and the upcomming fight with bella will resolve some of anita's slutty ways"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I like her writing, LKH does good sex, really good sex. She also does good ass kicking, which I admire as that seems to be harder to write than sex. But strangely enough the best part of the book to me was Zebrowski and her doing the standard police work. I love their banter and they way they are simply good friends. She also does a good job of showing how Anita still feels the odd man (woman?) during most of her work with the police.I was happy about the closure on her relationship with certain individuals in the books (not spoiling it!!) But where are Shang, Ash, Willie, etc? I miss those guys, some of which she didn't have sex with so I guess there was no room for in this book.I am waiting for the next one, and I will buy it too. Because as some of them have said this book is so so, that is fine, a so so LKH bets a damned best effort by most other authors any old day.

The entire series is a must buy."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The book was fabulous. This is a definate read. I could not put it down. It will have your heart racing (in a good way). I have read all the anita blake books and this is the hottest. I can't wait til the next one Laurell. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book isn't so much about action and death as it is charector development.Anita has grown a lot over the series, and this book shows it! Lines she once thought she would never cross she now finds she can not ignore. If she avoids the issues anymore she will lose the people most precious to her.Another major issue in this book, is a new link is formed between Anita and two of her men. This link could make or break them all and Anita is responsible for all of it.Yes, there is a lot of sex in this one. But your nitpicking if you try to say that the book isn't worth reading just because of that. This book is all about development, and the next one should be ten times better due to that development."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"What makes a great book? To me, it is having the book so well written that the characters come alive within my mind. Laurell K. Hamilton's ability to draw her readers into her stories is remarkable. I won't rehash the story plot as it has been done numerous times here, but I will say that for me, the story once again drew me in and carried me away into another world for its entirety. Character interaction is terrific. The action, although not as prevalent as previous books, is as great as always. The ending did seem rushed and thrown together as an afterthought but it did not detract overall from the rest of the book. Laurell Hamilton's imagination is commendable and I thank her for once again allowing me the chance to see Anita and the gang and hang out with them for a while."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"It's pretty obvious that some of you have not been paying attention, Anita has been headed in this direction since the past few novels and I personally cannot foresee her going back to the character she portrayed in the early novels because like it or not, this is who Anita Blake is now.You either loved \\"Incubus Dreams\\" or you hated it.I chose to love it, regardless of the lengthiness, the sex scenes, typos, or lack of scenes with major characters, Jean-Claude and Richard. I thought the story was a good one, finally the triumverate is beginning to work between Anita, Jean-Claude and Richard but what's even better a new triumverate has formed between Anita, Nathaniel and Damian. Can't wait to see what happens next. I would not have missed \\"Incubus Dreams\\" for the world and am waiting anxiously for the next installation. Anita is gaining more power, more knowledge and more skill and can still kick butt with the best of them. Although at times Anita seems a little conflicted about who or what she is, she is still number one in my book as she usually gets her man.Just because some of you hated \\"Incubus Dreams\\", thought it was trash or not up to par ... well that's your opinion and if anyone writes a review stating that they liked this novel, you're on it like white on rice with the negative voting campaigns, once again your opinion.Laurell K. Hamilton can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned and as long as she writes about Anita Blake, I'll read them and if her novels offend you, save your time and your money - just don't buy her novels but I know that I'll be right there on the release date of her next novel, probably first in line."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"And I am talking about both writer and writee. I love what she can do with words. I loved this book all the different parts. More sex would not have been bad I missed Asher and I would have liked more interaction with Damien but over all 10++++++. I would like to see a few smaller novels like I think the one coming out next year may be, about the smaller plot lines such as what happens to the master vamp that escaped and the couple with the murdered son. Laurrel K is one of the top authors in any field. Anyone that was disatisfied with this novel has too much of a life and you need to limit yourself to newspaper cuz you all must love reality."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"It definitely is a step from the first Anita books and heavy on the sexual aspects (instead of the violence which more people seem to be comfortable with, inquiring mind has to wonder what that tells us), but nevertheless this entry brought progress to the series. Finally, finally after 12 books ( if I count correctly, pardon me if I did not) Anita, Richard and Jean-Claude have their moment together. This alone was worth the entry fee. And the rest was not so bad either."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The reason I did not give \\"Incubus Dreams\\" 5 stars was the horrid job the editor did with regard to catching simple spelling, grammatical and sentence construction mistakes. Very distracting & numerous. As to content, I loved the book, seeing Anita's metaphysical powers continuing to grow and take shape, and her amazing ability to handle all situations. The only other thing the book seemed to lack, was the \\"true\\" supernatural detective/police thriller-type plot line which the previous books have had: very little investigation into the book's murders, just the vampire/pack power struggles and wonderful erotic scenes. All that aside, I will of course be on the waiting list for #13, whenever it arrives."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book is one of the best for developing the cast of the Anita Blake books, and for bringing Anita to grips with the needs and sacrifices she must embrace to fully utilize the powers of the Tri. The Ardeur is part of her, and instead of fighting it she has to learn to use it, because trouble is on the horizon and Anita Blake and her friends, allies, and loved ones must come together as a whole that is stronger than it's parts.The separate parts of Anita's life, her work, her association with the police and RPIT, and her position in the ongoing sea of preternatural power plays among vampires, shapeshifters, and others of supernatural natures begin to spill into each other.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am having a great time discussing it with others who also enjoy the series and find several of the revelations in Incubus Dreams worthy of examination. If anyone wants to discuss the book and other LKH related topics, stop by LKH_IncubusD in Yahoo Groups.I was very happy with the book when I got the ARC of it a few months ago, and now that I have the actual hardback in my hands I'm just floating on cloud nine *^_^*Lots of great stuff with Nathaniel -- he's really growing up.If you liked the recent books of LKH, you will LOVE this latest addition to the ongoing storyline. Buy the book *^_^* Buy one for your friends who like this style of story. It's not for everyone, but if you like a cool, sexy paranormal universe with a strong female lead who is growing into her sensuality and dark powers, I don't think you'll be disappointed. I recommend this series and this book for people who enjoy the Black Jewels Trilogy and Kushiel's Dart.~Mooncat~"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The Anita Blake,Vampire Hunter series is better than fine chocolate and the wait between each one is like suffering withdrawal. Each book is better than the previous one and Incubus Dreams really explores the relationships between the primary characters. Anita is finally accepting herself betterand trying to live the life she's been given. It's not what shewanted but now that she has it, she finally seems to be making peace with herself and others.She and Richard talk and decide to try and make a relationship within the pack work and Richard seems willing to have a try atmaking the Tri stronger and improving their power base. Bad things are coming which will need all their power and strength.True, the major focus of INCUBUS DREAMS is the interpersonal relationships of Anita and the gang, but there is a developing storyline that will be finished in future books. The big bad is a serial killer who has been killing strippers in St. Louis. He had previously killed in Pittsburgh and New Orleans. There is trouble brewing with Malcolm's church and promises a scarey storyline in future books.This was a satisfying and enjoyable book for me. I can't understand previous reviewers who are upset with the sex in thisbook for there has been a sensual flavor all though the series with the heat raising with each successive book. Any one with a hint of logic who hears the title INCUBUS DREAMS and sees the cover should know that this book is going to have some hot, erotic scenes in it. Personally, I liked the sex and thought thatit explains a few very important plotlines. The major source of Jean-Claude's power comes from sex and his abilities to use it. Anita's is too and makes sex necessary.Another complaint a few of the reviewers mentioned is the editing,grammatical errors and seem to blame the author for this.Anyone asscociated with the publishing industry knows that this is something the editors and copy editors are responsible for. This shouldn't be blamed on Laurell K Hamilton. Her responsibility is to write a good story with fascinating characters and turn in a reasonable error free book. From thereresponsibity for the errors goes to someone else.Give this book a try and if you haven't read any of the Anita Blake stories, start with GUILTY PLEASURES. When you get to INCUBUS DREAMS, you'll be addicted like the rest of us."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"While I agree with many of the reviewers who claim that plot threads are still left dangleing I think the readers will find that Incubus Deams is a very important book in the series. Anita is developing her new powers which continue to take on new shape with her second triumverate. She and her friends are gaining some of each others strenths and weaknesses which will probably become very important when Anita has to face the Mother of all Darkness. Anita is also learning to accept herself which is just as important in the control of her power. So while there is more sex than muder mystery development the sex is part of the overall plot development. I enjoyed the read (except for the typos- please get a new editor)and I enjoyed how the characters and their relationships are developing - some in very surprising ways which is also why I like to read this series."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"You can always expect an amazingly seductive story from Laurell K. Hamilton, and this one is no exception. Anita's a busy girl in this one, reconfirming Jean Claude's Triumvirate, opening one of her own, and climbing a serious learning curve on the side effects of both, all while hunting a dangerous Vampire gone mad. (I won't spoil the surprise, but the killer is a character from the past.) The sensual scenes are beautifully written, erotic and mesmerizing. Only Ms. Hamilton does it so well that the reader can fall in love with several male characters at once. I laughed, cried, recoignized a few of my own demons and hardly slept until it was finished."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have just finished reading the book the second time and I read it at a more leisure pace this time. This is a book that left me with a satisfactory feeling - so many times books go too fast over issues and don't develop them enough. The author is awesome in her courage in taking her protagonist in directions that are not always seen as \\"normal\\". There is lot of sex in this book, but most of it is justified and shows the changes Anita goes through, her acceptance of the people around her and herself. This book has developed far from being a simple mystery series, it has so much more. I don't read the book longer just for the mystery, but to meet the people again that are part of the world. Hamilton has managed to create people that feel real and interesting, and that I like to meet again."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This is one sexy book. Frankly, I didn't know WHAT to expect. I'm usually one for some mainstream novel like Angels & Demons or The Bark of the Dogwood, so this was quite a switch for me. Still, for the genre it is, I enjoyed it. Not at all like some novel by Anne Rice, which I was expecting."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams is one of the best out of the Anita series. I like the fact that Anita and Richard come to a sort of *understanding* about their relationship. And of course, I always devour any scene with Jean Claude.But why all the bad reviews??Richard and Anita are finally getting back together again and even though it is in an odd situation, the fact remains that they are trying to move forward. There is a lot of sex, alot of fighting that makes no sense, but I'm a die hard LKH fan andeverything that she has written has been on my book shelf.Jean Claude and Richard also become more amiable to each other in a great scene between Anita and them. Nathaniel and Anita finally get a little thing going, but I still am rooting for Jason!!All in all, I am waiting for the next installment with bated breath. All her novels have been read by me numerous times, and the next one can't come soon enough."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I really enjoyed the latest chronicle of Anita's life. To see how this amazing woman adapts to all challenges thrown at her and still maintains her personal integrity. LKH has introduced more fascinating characters and developed already established characters with surprising outcomes. To read these twelve books back to back is to see a master storyteller at work. Can't wait for the next installment in the lives of Anita, JC, Asher, Nathaniel etc"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"After the stagnation that has seeped into her last few books FINALLY Anita is starting to move past some of her more annoying hang-ups!! I could not begin to tell everyone how happy I am that LKH decided to write this novel the way she did, I was really afraid I was going to have to give up the series because it had come to a stand still! But she has moved on and I am ecstatic that I can continue to look forward to future installments! Some have (and I am surprised to see this) complained about the sex in her books. After all LHK herself admits to doing two things well in her novels 1. Sex and 2. Violence. Well Anita has never had a problem with violence so it makes since that LKH would spend the better part of one book getting Anita through her problems with sex. So many of her books have revolved completely around violence and no one seems to have a problem with that. Kind of scary to think that we as a society are more comfortable with the idea of killing people then a few sex scenes."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book was a great read for me. I like the way Anita's character is being written. The sex some people are complaining about is part of what makes the Anita books fun for me, and I hope it remains part of the rich mix of elements that makes the Anita Blake series unique and fascinating.What sells the book to me are the characters. I love reading about Anita Blake and the people that populate her world. This book really gets into the heads and histories of a lot of my favorites. We learn stuff about lots of the guys, Damien, Micah, Nathaniel, Jean Claude, Richard. We learn personal stuff about Ronnie. We meet some really fun and interesting new characters like Requiem. This is all stuff I like.The plot of the murdered strippers is really just a lead in. The real story is what Anita learns through the book. Besides the really detailed personal stuff, we find out really disturbing news about the Church of Eternal Life. Malcolm has been doing something that could be an incredible danger on a huge scale. This book and it's revelations seem to be a lead in to a huge plotline that will impact not just Anita's personal life but the whole world she's part of.This book felt a lot like the build up in some of the Buffy seasons, when you deal with all the immediate personal stuff in the individual episodes, but it's the building plot in the back ground that is going to be climatically important. There is huge amounts of build up in this book. We get more on the Council members like the Dragon, and another vampire master called Moroven, and the stuff with the Church of Eternal life is really scary if you consider the possibilities.This book was jammed full of plot for me. I'm glad I bought it, and recommend it for those who like all the personal stuff about Anita. If you didn't like the last few books, because of the sex and stuff, this isn't a book for you. However if you DO like the series including the last few books, and the sex (and I like the sex!) then yeah, this is a fantastic book and you should get it.This is the good stuff."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I read all the reviews before I got this book, but I got it any way. It was a slow start, and yes, there was alot of sex. Anita comes into some new powers and has more responsiblities in this book. She does do her job as an animator and executioner. She finally works out her relationship with some people. It answers alot of questions. If you don't want to buy it new, try used or the library."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"OK, so it's not the best Anita book ever. And it was a little bit wordy. But it was good. The sex scenes were not gratuitous, they were part of the plot. Cool new characters were introduced. Quite a few things were explained. Anita slayed vampires, raized a zombie, and helped the police. She figured out some of her relationship problems. Some future things were foreshadowed. And LHK made me care about all the characters....I was rather unhappy that there was so little use of condoms. I mean, is Anita going to be pregnant in the next book?And, what's with the \\"sex is a sin\\" thing?! I do NOT remember this much Christian angst coming up in the previous 11 books :("},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I love the Anita Blake series. But this book doesn't seem like one of them. Where's the action? Where's the crime? Where's the STORY? After reading 300+ pages I realized I was still in the first 24 hours of the story and in those 24 hours Anita had doing nothing more than have sex (real and metaphysical) with just about any male who has ever entered the story line and a few who haven't. If I wanted erotica, I would have bought erotica.Such a disappointment when a great series of books goes sour."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I can't understand why fans are bashing this book, too much sex and not enough crime for some people I guess, I thought it was definitely different from the other crime books of Anita Blake but it was fun just to have the \\"Sex\\", \\"relationship issues\\" and less crime for a change. Can't wait for more!(no pun intended:))"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I admit. I was a little disappointed, but only at first. Yeah, there was definitely more sex than plot in this book (not that I'm complaining or anything . . . :)), but it wasn't until near the end that I'm pretty sure I realized what Ms. Hamilton was doing. This book seems to be setting up for the next one. Anita was doing all these things, crossing all these lines and everything, and it seemed to me that it was all to set up for the next book. I could be wrong--maybe it's just what I'd like to think, but if I'm right, can you imagine the next one? I simply can't wait. So, my initial disappointment aside, that's why I've rated this they way I have. It was awesome in what it was--and what I'm sure it'll become in future novels. :)"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Anita Blake's personal life is the focus of the latest book of her adventures, and numerous exotic sexual encounters are heavily threaded through the story which reveals a surprising amount of detailed history of many of the longstanding supporting characters. Many past relationship issues are brought to a head and resolved, making this particular volume of the Anita Blake series a crucial turning point for the character who finally accepts the sexual nature of her new paranormal powers. Shared leadership of shapeshifters and vampires has made her responsible for many lives in subculture of dominance and submission that she has slowly and with some reluctance become more and more a part of. Now she has moved past personal inhibitions into a more understanding and comfortable acceptance of the people she's made her own, and her own desires.Another treat for fans who enjoy the series evolution into a more erotic and sexually adventurous series."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Some people will tell you this is Nathaniel's book and he certainly has more stage time than in any other book thus far and we finally see him in the light he had always intended. But I would tell you that it is Jean-Claude's book. He also has more stage time in this book than any other. And for the first time he is very clearly a master in ways we have never understood. We see how much he is holding back and just how much it has cost him. Some people will tell you that this book is light on plot. I will tell you that for some time the plots have been character driven, not action driven. There is tremendous character growth in this story. There is a mystery here but the revelations it produces are much more important than the actual crimes. Some people will tell you that the book is just about sex. I will tell you that Laurell K. Hamilton writes the most erotic sex that I have ever read. But I will also tell you that this book is all about love. It is about understanding that we should not be bound by society's strictures of right and wrong when it comes to relationships. Anything consensual between partners is okay, even if what you want to do seems weird by society's straitlaced standards. It's not a crime to like pleasure and pain. It's not a crime to be submissive or dominant. And, no matter how much certain fundamental groups want to make us believe otherwise, it is not a crime to love another of the same sex. Some people will tell you there is bestiality in this book. Somehow bestiality implies a certain amount of non-consensuality and animalistic thought. There are no non-consensual sex acts in this book. Anyone engaged in sex in this book is fully aware of what is happening and has welcomed it. In case that isn't clear enough, Anita does not have sex with an animal.I said earlier that this book is all about love and it is. Anita has finally stopped being afraid of herself and what she wants. Even Richard is making progress doing the same. And for the first time, we understand that Nathaniel is not a child. He is a man who is happy in the traditional role of housewife. He enjoys being a submissive and we no longer see that choice as damaged because Anita finally understands that he isn't broken.We have tremendous metaphysical changes. The revelations come fast and furious. The new characters are surprisingly welcome. The repartee is witty and there are several laugh-out-loud scenes. The sex is hot enough that it isn't just Anita who has to learn how to breathe.Some people will tell you that the books have changed since Guilty Pleasures. I will tell you that anyone who believes that hasn't read the books that closely. We've always been headed here and I, for one, am grateful for it."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book finally brings together a lot of loose ends that needed to be wrapped up. The book is long and emotional, but considering the number of relationships involved in the Anita Blake Universe, it was time to wrap up and move forward on some longrunning story lines. Can't wait to see where LKH goes from here! If you are an LKH fan, keep reading, I couldn't put the book down!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This message is for all the people who have written that this book and the two prior have been nothing but cheap porn. Apparently, you have never heard of character development!The character Anita has been trying to survive as a pure soul in a dark environment. In this book and the previous two she is coming to terms with the fact that life is not always black and white. Something that we all must face. In some areas she has had to adapt to the environment and in others she has stood true to character.I realize that the book may be graphic but it is exploring enviornments that should not be familar to us. It is a world of fiction dealing with animals and vampires. If any of you out there have encountered a vampire or a were-animal..check yourself in!Final note: It seems that no one has mentioned the fact that the character Anita has become more at ease with killing.. I wonder why that is not offensive to the people who seem to think that the sex in the book is a bad thing...Not having any?In order to make the books interesting the characters must evolve. I mean..how many times can Anita kill the master vampire. Go read another series and do not kill it for the rest of us."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm going to strongly disagree with a couple of reviewers. First off, Anita's relationship with Richard is NOT \\"resolved\\" in this book - they agree to work on it, and as any fan of the series knows, that is not any kind of resolution in Anita's world. Secondly, one of the other reviewers clearly wasnt paying attention. there is plenty of plot in this installment, but the plot is unresolved. There are a few things going on - some vampire politics and power plays, some the serial killer line. Neither line is resolved, and you are left with a really kicked (...)set up for the next book. The key to understanding that this is what is going on happens early in the book when Anita receives a reading from Marianne. Anyone with a basic understanding of the characters and paying attention to the fact that a lot of the sex serves a plot purpose will see that we are being set up for the next book - which i dont mind. Think of it like Kill Bill Vol 1 or Empire Strikes Back - the plot in both movies is more designed to get you to the next installment than to stand on its own without resolution. Thats what i see here. And it left me really eager for the next installment."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book is not for the sexually squeamish and unfortunately it appears that many of Ms. Hamilton's so-called fans appear to be so. This book continues the developmental arch of Anita Blake and her developing powers. We see how the creation of another trimuverate allow all the characters to evolve emotionally, sexually and physically and how this increases all their powers. It feels authentically where these stories having been going to for a long time. And although a reader could not truly understand all that is going on without having read the previous books, for those of us who have, it is very satisfying. I think the prudish wimps who did not enjoy this book are so angry about the eroticism that they cannot see what a great story it is. As always, I cannot wait for the next installment"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I loved this book, can't wait to read it again!!!!!!!

The sex scenes were a bit much but they are important to the story line. I felt the book was not long enough, although I feel that way whenever I finish any of her books. She leaves me wanting for more. It took me a day and a half to read this book. Great intertainment. I can loose myself in her story.

Will keep on reading more of Ms. Hamilton in the future."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Ok so I see why people didn't enjoy it and I see why people did enjoy it. Peoples preferences change, as do writers and the characters they write about. If you don't like it fine, if you enjoyed it great. But I enjoyed it alot. Laurell K. Hamilton is a great writer. Her books are the ones that my family gets mad at that I read over and over. I have yet to find someone who writes with the same passion that Mrs. Hamilton does, and I have been searching."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"We have watched Anita become her own person, she is strong and she is dominant and she is so many things that so many women wish they could be. The sex is something she is fighting and it overwhelms her to be in the situations she finds herself in. She was not raised to be the way she has become, can't you relate to that??? Sometimes we become what we fear most. I love the Anita Blake books and have gotten many of my friends hooked on her as well. I love to watch the developement of the characters. If you are not happy with the books, by all means leave them for the ones of us who love them."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Well, like many others who have posted their reviews, I, too, have grown disgusted with this series. I have been faithfully reading these books for a few years now, but I think it's finally time that I part company with Anita & co.This book was terrible. It started off ok, and had me thinking (wrongly) that maybe this time the book was going to stick to the actual synopsis of the story and not veer off the track to flagrant debauchery. Well, so much for that theory.A bare minimum of the book was about Anita's being called in on several cases involving strippers who may have been murdered by a serial killer vampire. And we're talking maybe 150 pages out of 700+.During the beginning of the story, Ronnie makes an appearance and she and Anita talk briefly about Ronnie's crisis with Louie.However, Ronnie doesn't reappear until the end of the book, when Anita has to bail her out of a compromising situation. As if Anita's decline isn't bad enough, it seems that now the same could happen to Ronnie, even though hers was alcohol related. The way this series is heading, next time it could be non-alcohol related.Also in the story, Anita somehow makes another triumverate... what is this, about the third one?The rest of the book, as is becoming customary with this series, is Anita bedding one man after another in some transparent attempt to control the ardeur. It's like there is a turnstile into whichever room Anita happens to be in at the time and admittance is free.And of course, she can't just bed them and be done with it. They have to sit and talk about 'feelings' for umpteen chapters and Anita's supposed reservations in regards to whichever man is up to bat. It's the same discussion she has had with these men for the past 4 books at least. Only the situations are changed around and the dialogue is tweaked every now and again so you're fooled into thinking you're reading original material, or something that might help you see the situation in a new way. When in actuality, you've seen it in about as many ways as you've seen Anita having sex.Then of course Anita's qualms are suddenly gone with the wind, and in the next instant, she's on her back, or launching herself at the nearest man and begging him to well.. you get the point.I think it's amazing that all these men she meets are so miraculously well endowed, or more than well endowed. No one's ever just 'average'. Not to mention that every encounter is more mind blowing than the next and she's always screaming and raking her nails down someone's body. We should all be so lucky.I'd also like to point out that the writing style in this book is tedious. In that, the same phrases and/or wording are used numerous times. This has been happening for a while throughout the series.I'm extremely disappointed with the turn these books have taken. I recently read on Ms Hamilton's website somewhere that she doesn't write gratuitous sex scenes into her books. Something to that effect. I found that laughable, and have to wonder what gratuitous sex is, if what happened in this book wasn't."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Ask me what happened in Incubus Dreams? No, wait, I can't help you. I have absolutely no idea what happened in Incubus Dreams, or Cerulean Sins for that matter because while searching for the plot I was repeatedly kicked in the face by Anita's pornstar antics. What has happened to Anita?I started reading these books years ago and loved them. Anita was the perfect heroine and what made her cool was the fact that she was an ordinary girl. Now she has every superpower going bar flying, (I await the next book)and turned into the equivalent of a male college student with threesomes, sex in public places, sex with multiple partners...did I mention sex? Not to mention the fact that now the chastity belt is in the trash can she's turned into one of the most unlikeable characters in the book!The great range of characters has been destroyed, they all bow down to the wonderful Anita, who will probably in the next book kick Jean Claude out of the city, become master of all vampires and wereanimals, take over the world and then the universe. All the while being a grumpy self righteous brat.Please LKH, turn it all around with the next book!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I so looked forward to this book. Anita Blake had rapidly become one of my favorite character in horror fiction. Strong, hot-headed, self-reliant, she was a breath of fresh air in a genre that had become full of trite vampire romances. Sure, there was the vampire lover (and werewolf lover), but it was so well done and blended with the story that it worked.Not this time.What is promoted as a story of a gang of serial killer vampires gets lost in the teenage girl style angst of Anita's suddenly pornographic sex life. Maybe 1/10 of the book actually deals with Anita doing anything that resembles investigating the crimes. The rest is spent with her bedhopping and beating herself up over it later. AHHHHHHHH!Where is my Anita? Where is the woman who can mentally withstand the powers of powerful vampires? Who doesn't back down from murderous shapeshifters? Who raises the dead to solve crimes? Who is this hooker imposture who has taken her place? Laurell, what have you done?"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Even against my better judgement, I was looking forward to this book. I had struggled through the last two books of the series, Narcissus in Chains and Cerulean Sins, and bought Incubus Dreams hoping there would be some sort of progress. I was wrong. So very very wrong.Like the earlier books, this one had a strong beginning which lures you into a false sense of security. You think that the crime mentioned early in the story will be interesting and key to the overall plot and character development. But again you would be wrong. The crime aspect of these novels has been conviently pushed aside in favour of increasingly boring sex scenes. In truth, I would not mind this if the author could make us actually care about them. But they are so random and pointless and with so many useless characters, that the reader feels like they are reading mediocore pornography.This is to such an extent that I cant even remember what the \\"plot\\" was meant to be focused on. I think it had something to do with strippers being killed...or something.The main characters are a shadow of their former selves. I personally have never liked Anita, even from the very beginning. I have never liked her attitude and bizarre morals, which really do get more and more warped with each passing book. But it was never Anita that I read the books for, so she can devolve as much as Laurell K Hamilton sees fit. I read this series for the other characters which were much more intriguing and likeable than Anita. I grew to actually like Jean Claude after finding him terribly cliched at first. I also like Richard. In fact I still do dispite the butchering he has endured at the hand of the author. This book continues to debase him without much justification other than he had dumped Anita at some point. He even is suicidal(?), which just seems to defy explanation.The rest of the characters have been demoted to nothing more than Anitas \\"scenery\\". Jason, once the most carefree and simplistic of characters, is slowly being turned into another one of Anitas zombie like lovers. Asher was completely absent save for a few unmemorable scenes, which annoyed this reader greatly. Plus there is the continuing mystery of Micah. A character who has yet to do or say anything to justify his place in these books.But the truly sad thing about these novels is that all the wrongs could still be fixed. Yet the author doesnt seem interested in getting \\"back to basics\\". She is apparently going to carry on this strange fashion of throwing in sex scenes like filler material and savaging the characters that she has spent years creating.Of course what is even more saddening is that I will probably still buy the next one. So...go figure. :-)"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"That's about all this book is about. Sadly, not even good porn! Plot? Where? In fact, what little story Ms. Hamilton deigned to include was entirely incidental. This book is 80% sex, 15% repetition and 5% story... for a total of 100% crap.I'm an avid Anita fan. Narcissus was the first of the series that I read. It was a spur of the moment purchase at a drug store. Many say this book was the beginning of the end for Ms. Hamilton, but it was this book that began my love affair with the series. The sex was tasteful, the book erotic, and the plot gripping. Cerulean followed in the same vein. Having read the entire series, I've seen Anita metamorphose from a gun-toting, bad ass into a more convoluted, softer character. I didn't mind the change as the writing was superb. The same cannot be said of Incubus. What a travesty!This book is a waste of paper. Ms. Hamilton could have written it in less than 100 pages if she didn't feel the need to explicitly detail Anita's moral decline. What happened to the heroine who was capable of blushing? The one who had boundaries that couldn't and wouldn't be crossed or compromised. I mean, I love sex (wish I was getting more of it) but beastiality doesn't fit in with my classification of normal, healthy intercourse. And believe me, I'm no prude. Seems to me Ms. Hamilton forgot which heroine she was writing about in this book. Reads more like a Gentry novel, a series I've never been able to appreciate because the plethora of sex eclipses the story. I picked up the first of the Gentry novels and put it down after the first three chapters and have never had an inclination to attempt reading another one.I waited a year and a half for this book. Was so excited by the volume, thinking that it would afford me many pleasure-filled reading hours. It took me a day to read because after the third sex scene I started skimming through the rest in anticipation for the real story to begin. Regrettably, it never did. I started several colleagues on the Blake craze and I was hesitant to pass on the latest.This is the first review I've ever written. Generally, I don't care or have the time to do this, but I was so offended by Ms. Hamilton's offering that I felt it my duty to warn unsuspecting readers. I ordered the book long before its release so I didn't have the benefit of reviews to temper my purchase. If you've just got to read it yourself, I suggest the library or waiting for the paperback. Even then, the cost of the paperback will exceed the value of the book.Hopefully, this will be the last book in the series. Because I'm gullible enough to believe that Ms. Hamilton will learn from this mistake and stupid enough to probably make another purchase. Or maybe, like Ms. Hamilton, I'll con someone into buying it and then just borrow their copy!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have read and loved all of Laurell Hamilton's books - until this one. At least in the other books there was more than just sex going on and you could skip the sex parts and not feel cheated out of your money. If you tried to skip the sex parts in this book, you may wind up with about 20 pages of readable material ( and most of the real plot was rushed). I really hope her next Anita Blake novel is better and that her next Merry Gentry novel does not have the same problem as Incubus Dreams."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"In the latest of the Anita Blake series, \\"Incubus Dreams\\" hits an unfortunate sour note. There is a crime, introduced early, to wet our appetites and tease us with anticipation. However, the anticipation all but disappears while we wade through 600 odd pages of Anita's angst over her sex life and with whom she should or shouldn't feel guilty. Frankly, this is a perfect example of how too much of anything leads to a deadening of interest. By the time we return to the crime, I'm all but ready to let them get away with it just for having to wait around while Anita gets her sexual/magical jollies.Please, let's get back to strengthening the necromancy and fighting crime. Jean-Claude, Richard, and everyone and their brother will just have to wait for Anita to take care of business."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have long been a fan of the Anita Blake series and I continue to buy each installment though the writing gets steadily worse. I love the characters--plain and simple. I'm very glad to see Nathaniel and Damian have more time in Incubus Dreams, but that's the only kind thing I can write about Hamilton's newest novel. The writing is horrible--lines are repeated over and over again. The little plot that there is appears in the last 100 pages. Incubus Dreams reads as though it were written--and edited--in a hurry. I don't appreciate that kind of minimal effort in a hardback and won't be buying another anytime soon. I'm also sick to death of Anita arguing--though, honestly I don't read these books for Anita (I like Asher, Damian, and Nathaniel). I strongly recommend waiting for the paperback version--Incubus Dreams just isn't worth the money."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I've read these reviews and I guess most of it has already been said in many strong and creative ways. I wasn't going to write and just reiterate the same old statements about too much sex, not enough plot. Where has Anita gone? Where is the suspense? Action? True romance? But I just feel so strongly I had to come on here and write something.Let me just say that I have adored the Anita books for years. The thought of not reading one has never even crossed my mind. I've awaited all of them with eagerness. And this one was no different. I could hardly wait to start. And sadly, the start was just so good- the wedding, friendship with Ronnie, the murder and then sex, more sex scenes, who, what, it didn't matter. More new characters having sex with Anita? Sure, why not...Gone is the plot. Gone is any emotion but talk of hot bodies and pulses like candy. Now, dont get me wrong, I've always loved her sex scenes but this was beyond ridiculous. I never thought I could think of her books as boring. I never thought I could think of one of those scenes as boring.You know those authors/books you might have where with every new book, you just sink into it? The experience is so immensely enjoyable that as you near the end of the book, you get almost sad because the experience of reading that book is almost over and then you will have to leave that world and wait FOREVER for a new installment. So you're so conflicted- you're reading fast because you want to know what happens next but you're tempted to read slower just so that book experience doesn't end.Well that was the Anita series to me. I would savor each book.This last one- I hardly got through it. I had to force myself to finish and unlike previously, I could hardly wait until it was over.I think that says it all. I never thought that I'd be impatient to get through a Laurell K. Hamilton book. I never thought I'd feel so completely uninterested. But thats what she's done.Laurell, thank you dear, you've proved your point to the industry that writing about sex from a female protoganist's point of view, can be done and you will do it, over and over and over again. Good for you. You've made your point. But in the process you've alienated your readers and greatly disappointed people who have been your loyal fans for years."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The greatest gift that the divine could have given me would have been if I accidently received a misprint of this book where all the pages were blank. Those blank pages would have given me about as much development to the overall plot arch of the series as existed in my, sadly whole, copy. As it stands, reading this left me thinking about what it must feel like to drown. Like the surface of the water, you know that the substance of the characters and environment is there, and that maybe if you just struggle through to the surface of the sex scenes, MAYBE you'll be able to reach it, but no. You're sucked back down by the next overly endowed man.I picked up this series a month ago, and quickly fell in love with an environment where magic is not only real and accepted, but subject to governmental perview. I swiped up the entire series at the local bookstore, recommended it to my friends as great escapism, and planned to pick up the rest of her work. That enthusiasm started to wane with Cerulean Sins, and by the end of this one, I had dropped my plans to read any of the rest of her work, and actually apologized to two of my friends for the recommendation and advised them NOT to read this book.I pray someone will take the time and edit out the superfluous sex scenes into a blog entry or something. Because really, they're unneccessary. The \\"reasons\\" that set up each new pairing are also completely contrived and ridiculous. Anita has to feed the ardeur. Anita has to heal Damien. Anita has to scare off a night hag. Anita has to help fight an enemy vampire. All the explanations are half-explained, yet insanely wordy. The text seems to be there to seperate each scene and maybe disguise the fact that the main character is being ridden more often than a pony at the petting zoo. Every now and again the plot will shine through like the sun in a cloud break, only to be smothered by the entrance of another partner who we may or may not have given a damn about. Wading through each painfully endowed man and bodily fluid, you think that Hamilton was dared to write a novel where she was forced to include the full text of every erotic fanfiction written about her series in one novel. And boy, did she win that bet.Towards the end, there's a sudden rush to finish the story arc that was sort of set up in the beginning of the novel. This taste of the novels early in the series was only enough to let me realize how much I missed action that involved a girl and a gun fighting against evil. While I was still lamenting that loss, I was reminded of the reality of the book with two sex scenes in a bathtub. A little twist of the knife to remind me not to pick up the next book in the series when it comes out."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Anita Blake used to be interesting. Now she's just a superhuman sex-machine that's laden with Catholic guilt and typoes. At one point I accidently skipped ahead 50 pages and didn't even notice. Nevertheless I will probably still read anything else that LKH comes out with because I'm a completist like that."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Ok at first I actually liked the trend this series was taking...I actually really liked how Anita's views of the vamps were changing, and she's actually facing up to the fact that maybe she doesn't have the right to call them monsters. And hey, I don't mind the occasional raunchy sex scene.But this book just took it way way WAAAAAY overboard. The entire BOOK is just one extended sex scene. I'm 3/4 of the way through the book, and wondering what the whole point of it was to begin with. The whole thing reads like 700+ pages of softcore pornography. The occasional sex scene spices up the book, but this, this was just ridiculous. Is there a male character that Anita HASN'T slept with? The whole ardeur thing has been completely blown out of proportion. Now I'm yawning my way through the rest of the sex scenes and wondering if there's a plot at all anywhere in this book....This book was a complete waste of time....for the rest of you, I suggest you stop at Burnt Offerings, and skip to just Obsidian Butterfly. Only because I love Edward and Richard is just a whiny temperamental prude that I absolutely can't stand and Blue Moon is all about him.And by the way, Ms. Hamilton, I suggest you fire your editor.

Initially I thought that maybe I needed to read another Anita Blake novel to really understand the character..Anita Blake....hunter...angry woman...cop. .lover to a couple of were-humans and a vampire....and who else is available when her craving comes...making alliances and pacts....feeding on and off of people..having sex every couple of pages (over 600 pages total) and trying to solve some vampire killings at the same time..and tons of other meaningless stuff...like a were-leopard who loves her, an angry ex-lover, a sad lover...and so on. And still, the killer gets away...and I asked myself, what in the world possessed Hamilton to write this trash...or perhaps I should ask what made me read it. It was painful to get through....I even got it from the library on CD, so that I could listen to it in traffic, in an effort to help me get through it...unfortunately, everytime I heard them ramble on about nothing important, I wanted to throw-up.

There was about 20% story mixed in with 80% porn. And that's if you could find the story among the typo's and occasional grammatical errors. I've bought every book by this author and have noticed an unfortunate turn in the type of story that is being produced. I am drawn to the strong female character, the romance, and the action, all of which were lacking in this story. I would not recommend buying this book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"OK, I loved this series when it started, but things went suddenly wrong with Narcissus in Chains and despite my devoute hopes to the contrary, it hasn't gotten any better. My problems with this book are the same as the last two books. First, the wonderful characters she developed over a long period of time have suddenly begun acting completely out of character. This began in Narcissus in Chains and she continues to try and throw token metaphysical justifications for these changes, but I find them lacking. Second, the crimes that were the central thread of the early stories have been suddenly reduce to a few token pages throughout the book, and are largely forgotten in every other scene. In this book I don't believe there is one mention made outside the actual crime scenes. Third, her job as an \\"animator\\" had been reduced to much the same status, she makes a token apperance in the office to bicker with her boss and maybe actually deigns to show up at a job, in this book she blows off half her appointments on the one night she works, and thats it for the book. Finally, at least for the points I'll get into here, is the sex. Don't get me wrong, I have no problems with sex in a book, but she has gone way way overboard here. I mean, the sex in the earlier books was suggestive, romantic, subtle and the most recent books read like something found in the letters section of Penthouse. At this point a good three quarters of the book is spent either having sex or dealing with somebodies emotional angst over who she is or isn't sleeping with.I truly felt Cerulean Sins was a tiny step in the right direction after Narcissus, but this book crushed any hopes of the series being redeemed. After years of getting the books the day they were released, I find myself questioning if I will even bother buying the next one."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I discovered Anita Blake when she was on the second novel of the series. I have been an avid reader ever since. No more.Frankly, I do not understand LKH's attachment to the \\"ardeur.\\" This book was over 600 pages. I quit reading at 237. I was sooooooooo tired of Anita's endless self-searching and conscience-stricken monologues about whether she should have sex BEFORE she had sex again. There was only about 20 pages of real plot or conflict in 237 pages. That's less than ten percent. It started to feel like Anita was channelling Richard, a character who has always bored me to tears. The old Anita: morally certain, decisive and action-oriented was nowhere to be seen.If I didn't know that LKH had written this book, its bloated, overly focused sexual approach would have made me think I was reading Anne Rice."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"After \\"Narcissus in Chains\\" and \\"Cerulean Sins,\\" I swore I would never buy another Hamilton book in hard cover. Unfortunately, I was in a bookstore the day this stinker was released and picked it up in a moment of weakness. I should have stuck to my guns and waited until the library got it.\\"Incubus Dreams\\" is a big, bloated monstrosity of a book. Long on sex and short on plot, it weighs in at well over 600 pages. The length would have a wonderful treat if Hamilton had spent more time telling a story and less time writing porn under the guise of \\"relationship building\\" and \\"character growth.\\" I have no idea how many pages were devoted to sex scenes, but there were far too many for my taste. Just when the plot seemed to be actually going somewhere, the ardeur would kick in and need to be fed--time for Anita to have more sex. A little judicious skimming made the book tolerable, but only barely. There were too many places where I found I could skip an entire sex scene and pick up the story without a break several chapters later. Some of the sex may have been necessary to Anita's growth as a character, but a lot of it could have been handled offstage or in less detail. That way, Hamilton would have had enough space to deal with the other elements of the plot. Sometimes less IS more and gynecologic details are best left to the imagination.There were a few glimmers of the old Anita in some parts of the novel. She actually did some work this time around, both as an animator and a vampire hunter. To my taste these were the most interesting parts of the book. The exchanges with Zerbowski were classic Blake. However, even the mystery elements of the plot did not live up to the standard set by \\"Obsidian Butterfly\\" and earlier books. The vampire serial killer plot seemed perfunctory, especially since the identity of the perps was tossed in offhandedly at the end of the book, after they had escaped. Now they're just another loose end, along with the Mother of All Darkness from \\"Cerulean Sins.\\" These and several other potentially interesting plot threads were just left hanging. I hope Hamilton gets back to them next time around.I wish that Hamilton would pay attention to her fans' critiques, but I doubt she will. The more erotic her work has gotten, the better it sells. But it's a shame that the series has taken the turn it has, at least for those of us who like a little plot with our sex scenes. Let the Merry Gentry series be about sex.--that's the way it was set up. But please let Anita get back to being a reasonable facsimile of her former self."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This is LKH's third stinker in a row! I'm tired of spending money on complete and utter trash! So I won't anymore. This is the last book of hers I'll buy unless she does a complete turnaround! I LOVED the first 9 books, but with NIC she went downhill into smutdom. If I wanted erotica books, I'd buy an erotica books. I don't know the characters anymore. Anita is a complete stranger to me, Dolph is becomming a complete jerk, and there are more charcters that were introduced for the sole purpose of having sex with Anita. I HATE what LKH has done to Richard. I loved Richard in the first 9 books. But it seems Richard was getting a fan base and LKH couldn't have readers wanting Anita with Richard rather than Jean-Claude, so she did something with Richard's character that didn't make any sense: she made him a wimp and slightly insane. Meanwhile, we're all supposed to love Jean-Claude for some reason, and I have yet to discover why. Except that he's beautiful. Not good enough for me. (And I haven't been given any reason to love Micah yet, I'm still trying to figure out exactly who he is)Forget my problems with character development, for a moment. There is precious little story here. There is the making for a decent plot but instead 80% of the book is about Anita having sex with every male who crosses her path. 10 pages of story, 30 of sex, 10 pages of story, 30 of sex. It gets very old, VERY quickly. It was all \\"Oh no! So-and-so is dying! Anita we have to have sex to save him!\\" Yuck. Everytime the plot moved forward, I got excited thinking I was finally going to get a story told to me but no. My hopes and dreams were dashed. I started hoping that Edward would show up and put a bullet in Anita's brain to put us all out of our miseries.So I'm done with LKH until she smartens up and returns Anita to what she does best: solve crime and kill bad guys. I'm going to miss Anita. Does anyone know of any book or series that were like Anita in the beginning?"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have to say firstly that I am a huge fan of LKH and of her fabulous character, Anita Blake (R.I.P). Unfortunately for me this story is now dead. What began as something mystical, thrilling and fast paced has now turned into nothing short of a jumped up Black Lace novel.This story has two plots, the one that was forgotten and the one that took over. The details of the one that was forgotten are anyones guess, although a couple of murders and a rogue vampire were in there somewhere. The second plot was based completely on what everyone has come to know as the \\"ardeur\\". This has frankly got boring. I orginally liked Anita for her pushy attitude, her \\"take-no-prisoners\\" approach to life and her sassy way of keeping all the boys in place. Why on earth LKH has decided to turn her into some sort of sex crazed [...] is beyond me. If I wanted to read a book that was based around sex and bondage I would actively find one, but as it stands I actually like reading horror novels. The only thing horrific about this book was its desciptions of Anita deep throating werewolves and whipping strippers on stage. If this is character developement then I am clearly missing something.As many other people have already pointed out, none of the other story-lines have continued from the previous book. It's as though they didn't exist?! The only development has been the writers love of psychoanalysing her characters until she drives them crazy!I am sick to death of Richard and his pansy attitude towards life, its just not believable anymore. This should have been wrapped up books ago. The guy has had threesomes with the undead, he is the Ulfric of a Werewolf Pack and he can \\"bench-press a car\\", yet he is still unsure of himself after 11 books of talking about with Anita. Action has been replaced by the \\"therapy chair\\" that seems follows all of them around. Jean-Claude is little more than a puppet who advises Anita on her now \\"god-like\\" talents. Asher seems to have taken a vacation, and most other characters have faded into the background. Gone are the exciting line-ups between two rival factions. Gone is the big bad vampire who comes to town. Goneis every part of these novels that made them worth reading.If you want to make your own Anita Blake Novel then take the following points and mix them around for each chapter;1) Anita goes to sleep at the club because she is tired2) Anita goes to a murder3) Richard bursts into the room full of anger and self torment4) Anita has sex5) Anita talks to the police and argues with them6) Micah and Nathaniel \\"comfort\\" Anita7) the Ardeur risesAll that has been achieved in this poorly written and badly edited piece of work is for LKH to pour forth her sexual fantasies onto the page. Nothing like a bit of self-loving eh? If you read this Laurell, think on this; If people buy sports cars because they are fast, would you change sports cars so that they drive slowly and handle badly?"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The sad trend that began with \\"Narcissus in Chains\\" seems to have hit a high point here. The book is almost nothing but sex, and to add insult to injury, it is morphing into boring and distasteful sex at that - \\"boring porn,\\" as one reveiwer put it.Anita herself, once one of the most interesting, amusing, and powerful female action figures to hit literature, has become the ultimate victim; forced to have sex constantly by the plot device of the \\"ardeur\\" and by her own (or the author's) seemingly repressed kinky sexual fantasies.The oldest and most beloved characters are reduced to cardboard stereotypes, while the newest don't even aspire to that much dimension. In a series with a massive amount of characters already, yet more are introduced; Anita promptly has sex with half of them, then shares sexually charged bloodletting with the other half.The sole exception to this rule is Nathanial, who is at least given major character development. Sadly, he is still among the most useless and degrading character figures I have ever seen and at this point in the series, is reduced to pulling tantrums - the emotional equivalent of passive agressive manipulation - to force Anita into bed with him.Meanwhile, there is supposedly a murder going on, which is never resolved. There is also an incomparable amount of whining self exploration by nearly everyone. The one thing this Anita still has in common with her old self is to agonize over her bed partners, so that the reader is forced to endure chapters of it before they finally get down to the inevitable, thus robbing it of any enjoyment for anyone.It is, indeed, as if the author is going down a checklist of all the people Anita has not slept with, and then inventing new positions and situations for them to do it in. There is no intimacy and no tension and no enjoyment in nearly any of it.Richard reaches new heights of self absorbed drivel, which makes you wish he would just be killed off. Since Anita is becoming everything to everybody, I am sure she could just take over as wolf pack leader.He is also revealed as a closet \\"sadist\\" - presumably so he can join in the with everyone else and advance the horizon of sex experiences with Anita in unorthodox ways.There is no mention of the plot threads introduced in \\"Cerulean Sins\\" and Asher does not show up.To echo sooooo many others - the book is filled with typos and bad editing. The whole attempt is a supreme disaster and reads as the high point of one of the most effective and incomprehensible character disintegrations I have ever seen.The author spent 9 books setting this character up and in less than 2 has managed to totally deconstruct her.

I felt like I was stuck in some sort of time warp reading this book because everything was so repetitive!The errors in this book was pretty bad, worst I'd ever seen, especially coming from a huge publishing house. But I've read books with errors in them that STILL manage to deliver a phenomenonal plot and realistic characters, take D.N. Simmons's Desires Unleashed for example. Great story, great characters, great new series and that's who I'm going to replace LKH with, a better author!I wanted to keep reading this series, because I liked some of the characters, but the characters have been dying with each new book and I'm not going to stick around to see their final death throes."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I can only concur with previously reviews that summed Incubus Dreams in one word.

Shame, shame."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I agree with most of the reviewers of this book.

I'm freaking 200 pages into it and the murder has not even been touched upon. But AB can have a female ej. Yaaaay! WTF. What the heck happened to this series...it's become a total waste of time."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am sorry, but this book would be better used in the movie 'Day After Tommorrow' as one of the books that were burned to keep warm. For the last several books the Anita Blake series has moved from an action/mystery genre to one sex scene after another. I loved the series and have been a loyal fan through out the series. However, this for me is the end of the Anita Blake Series. When 99% of a book is one sex after another one can only take so much. I mean the books are no longer realistic. (I mean come on, one can not have sex 4 times a day or more and still expect to get anything done.) Farwell Anita Blake the monster never got you, but excessive sex has. Again Rest in Peace. As a side note I only gave this book one star because Amazon requires at least one star. This book does not warrant even one star."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. When I first started reading this series it really grabbed me. A small tough heroine who kicked butt and took no prisoners. She was brave & resourceful and every book up to Narcissus in Chains was excellent. Sadly this is no longer the case. There is way too much sex in this book, and please believe me I dont have a problem with sex in any books but really about 500 pages of vigourous sex with any number of partners is just boring. The only part of the book that relates to her actual work is the last 20 or so pages. I had to hurry and fininsh the book because I thought that if I didnt hurry I would just lose interest in the book. If Laurell K Hamilton ever reads these reviews surely she can take note of them and try to get some of the plot back in these once excellent books. I certainly wont be buying anymore in this series. Conversely I am still enjoying her Merry Gentry story ! So lets hear more about Anita & less about her sex life"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"LKH took a really cool, independent, take charge type of woman and turned her in to some sort of porn star. I have no problem with sex, but the relentless, often distasteful, gratuitous sex in this book is off putting. I'd like to get back to the \\"story\\" and less of the twisted sexual proclivities of of a wannabe porn star."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I started reading Hamilton's novels in middle school, and they progressed into porn faster than I could hit puberty and have any interest in them. What started out as a legitimate fiction novel (plot included) has turned into flat out porn. It seems that these novels are now an outlet for the authors own sexual fantasies, and every once and a while she remembers to add in a little plot. After these last few books I have lost all respect for Hamilton has a fiction writer and wouldn't recommend her novels to anyone who is lacking in sexual perversion."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have purchased every Laurell K. Hamilton novel that has come out, and this is probably the worst. I love the Anita Blake character, but the author is spending more time talking about kinky sex than the plot of the story. Lets go back to a plot like Guilty Pleasures, the Laughing Corpse, etc where there is a little sex in between the action instead of a little action in between the sex scenes."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I love the Anita Blake novels, and part of me feels guilty for giving this novel a bad review. I miss the old Anita though. I am so tired of reading about her having sex. I want to read about the monsters and I want the mystery. What happened to Hamilton? This novel is still a fast page turner and still enjoyable, but it is not up to par with the beginning of the series. I hope there is a vast turnaround in the next Anita novel or I am going to have to stop reading."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am going to see her at a book signing next week. And if I have enough courage I want to ask her why such a huge shift in perspective, purpose, and philosophy. I agree with another reviewer on here that the plot is gone and it's all about sex. Another reviewer said it's now erotic fantasy. Yes, it is. But I won't get over it. Not until I have at least stated to Ms. Hamilton how disappointed I am and offended that she would treat her loyal, die-hard readers with such disregard.If I want porn, I will go buy it. It's not like I have a problem with people reading porn either, btw. I don't get all shocked and offended by that. Because that is its clearly stated purpose. The Anita Blake series did NOT start out as such a genre of writing. It was a detective/mystery/horror series. I love vampire novels. Always have. And my absolute favorite series of all time (Anita series) has been reduced to personal disintegration, not integration resulting from self-exploration. We won't see a woman becoming a whole, complete person who accepts herself, her womanhood, and as a sexual being unafraid of exploring her sexual feelings. Anita has went beyond that, if she even could have gotten there.This is way outside any type of normal psychological development for any human being, even in a fantasy novel. I can't even stretch it that far anymore. It's way outside what could even be realistic. And this series, albeit fantasy for the imagination to ask \\"What if...\\", used to smack of realism enough that you could see her world happening in its own right.Yes, it's over all right. And I mourn the loss. I am going to ask Ms. Hamilton what great and terrible tragedy changed her life so that she has been on such a deep quest to find herself. Because that is really what this is all about. She infers something about a tragic loss in the acknowledgement section of one of the books. So I know there is something there.She has been merging the Merry series with this one and I wonder if the loss didn't occur about the time she started writing that series. You could see the sexual deviance begin with the Merry series and then bleed deeply into this one. Both are consumed with it.Needless to say, I had hoped it would turn in the other direction again- Ms. Hamilton would heal as time passed, and we would get back on track with some great plots. It's become nothing more than a good writing piece to get turned on by."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Not up to snuff. The plot twists, red herrings, and constant energy were missing from this episode. Yes, you learn more about the characters but at what price.Let's hope Ms Hamilton has what ever this was out of her system and either kills Anita off or returns to what made her a crossover favorite."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"After reading the mostly negative reviews of this book, I finally got it from the library and managed to plow my way through it. The reviews I read were pretty well spot-on in describing it as too much of nothing.Anita's job as an animator and her tricky relationship with the volatile groups of supernatural beings around her has devolved from fascinating to farcical. The reasons to love the earlier books have become overshadowed (and in some cases, eliminated) by the relentless sex scenes between Anita and almost anyone who happens to be around. Plot developments from previous books that seemed critical have disappeared as if they never existed; characters have become caricatures. The happy exception is Nathaniel, who shows some real growth and remains interesting.Alas, the reviews for LKH's next book, \\"Micah\\", seem to express the same disappointments as \\"Incubus Dreams\\". I may or may not read it -- and Laurell, if you are out there, take a hint and dump some of the story-killing sex in favor of some solid plotline."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I now know who thinks the outlandish and bizarre clothing that International Male catalog is hot. UGH. Skip the first two hundred pages. Nothing but one long sex rage fear sex/rage/fear /sex/rage/sex/fear cycle. You do get three page breaks every now and then to read descriptions of how this or that man's waist length hair drapes around various and sundry people or pieces of furniture. This must be a hetero female thing cause as a gay man I hate hair on men any longer than collar length.Then when you think that there will finally be a story, client's go psycho and we get another 50 pages of various monsters having sex with Anita. Then when you think you will finally get a story ancient vampire goes psycho and we get 50 MORE pages of NEW vampires having sex with Anita. AND you get pages of description of the new guys' hair and International Male ensembles.WTF? The first 5 Anita Blake novels were great. Then they started to degenerate into Romance novels. This one though is just porn for nymphomaniac women who like long hair and bad clothes."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"For the most part I consider this an average book. I have read every book of Ms Hamilton's that I can get my hands on. An average book of Ms Hamiltons would be above average for anyone else. Because this is just an average book, that means it is below average for Ms Hamilton. I though her best book was Obsidian Butterfly, where the only sex was her making the bad guys lose enough concentration so that she could kill them! I realize that it is difficult to keep trying to trump the bad guys from the previous book, and Ms Hamilton seems to be attempting to add new dimensions to the Anita character, but for my part it is not working very well. The thing that bothered me the most about this book was that Anita's attitude about fighting the bad guys seems to be leading to her retirement as a vampire slayer (or any other kind of monster slayer). She is experiencing big time combat fatigue. She loves so many people that her focus is now more on keeping them out of harms way that it is on getting the bad guys. She no longer seems to care about the plight of normal people (unless she loves them, but she doesn't seem to love any normal people). I think that Ms Hamilton is going to have to pull a rabbit out of her hat to keep Anita rolling. If the current trend keeps up she might as well kill Anita off (put her out of her misery) and concentrate on Meredith Gentry full time."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series is the best series I've read. Incubus Dreams, in my opinion, is the worst in the series. The entire book was one sex scene after the next, and I usually enjoy the sex scenes. This just became monotonous. I was at the point of skipping pages and almost forgot the original story line. Maybe Laurall was having a bad year but she's definately done better."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Let me first say that I absolutely loved Hamilton's early Anita Blake books. They were full of edge-of-the-seat action, fascinating characters and delightfully unbelievable story lines! In the supernatural/fantasy genre, Anita Blake was the best, most enjoyable heroine I'd found. However, in Hamilton's more recent books (Obsidian Butterfly, Narcissus in Chains, Cerulean Sins) graphic sex has filled progressively more pages, and this newest novel, Incubus Dreams, is the worst offender yet.I'm not even going to try to summarize the plot because it only makes up about 10% of this book. Extremely graphic sex scenes occupy the remaining 90%. I do enjoy a little sex with my stories but it has become excessive. Anita Blake is still a fascinating character, but she is no longer a woman I'd want to know! The only direction left for her character is to turn her into a werewolf or a vampire! Which might be interesting, providing the new storylines offer something besides sex on every page.I can't end here without mentioning the publishing quality, or lack of it, in this Berkley Books edition. Has this publisher retired all of its proofreaders? Perhaps they are now relying solely on spellcheck. If so, their software needs a total overhaul. I noticed 3 misspellings before I got to page 23. The number of typos/misspellings in this edition was amazing! One example: \\"deity\\" is misspelled \\"diety\\" every time it appears, and it appears frequently. And that's just one word! Considering the sloppy editing and proofing, the $23.95 retail price is a bit excessive, but at 658 pages, Hamilton's longest book yet, this edition will make an excellent doorstop."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"If you can't rejuvenate Anita back to her former glory, be merciful and just kill her off!!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"After hearing rave reviews about this author I decided to listen to the (libraries copy) audio version while driving to and from work. You'd think for being a 30 hour disc set it could at least be a little entertaining. Too much unnecessary details in my opinion, cussing, and overall horrid violent sex described in the first disc alone. Oh, and there is a murder mystery tucked in there somewhere. Details about rape, rough sex, a lot of \\"F\\" words and other descriptions of a sexual nature discouraged me from moving on to disc two. I might look into her earlier books since so many expressed how bad the new ones have become. Don't waste your time with this one!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am just so disgusted by this book..I had to force myself to finish it just to see how much damage Hamilton could do to her characters. What a disappointment...the incessant sex scenes stuck between the few instances of police work, are just overwhelmingly bad! None of this reads like it was written by the author who penned the earlier books in the series. She writes like she is trying to please some absurd 'male' fantasy version of what women \\"really\\" want...I don't believe I will buy the next book.

I have read this series from the beginning. She used to be a prude. Now she's never having sex with less than 2 other people.

However I believe Laurell needs to hang her head in shame for what she did to her beloved series. Don't read this book if you liked the others, in fact perhaps you should mourn the end of the series. It's over. Hamilton may claim that this book is a continuation of the Anita Blake series, but thats only so she can sell copies to her unwary fans without having to think about doing her job. What is her job, one might ask and rightly so. As an author her job is to sell as many copies as she can, build up a group of people who will continue to buy the series and remain true to the series. This self destruction of the Anita Blake series is a vivid depiction of Hamilton's deterioration as a writer. I can't believe her publisher allowed her to do this, have they no sense of self preservation? Many authors branch out to other genres, but they not within the same series. Hamilton already has a smut series, did she really need to drag Anita into it too? All this book says to me is that Hamilton needs to get laid, badly.Talking about sex, having sex, then talking about it some more is all she does in this parody of a book. There is no tough girl taking down the bad guys, there is no intriging sensuality. But worst of all there is no plot!! It's as bad as having your favorite team play beautifully up until the superbowl and watching them sit in the field, joking with the refs that the fans are so stupid to pay good money to come watch them.I wish I could say I believe \\"Micah\\" is going to be a turn around back to the good plot we've come to enjoy, but the truth is I won't be buying it. As far as I'm concerned Hamilton murdered Anita then burried her under ten feet of concrete and built a skyscraper over her."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Anita is an expert of deep throating, has wild, tumultuous sex several times in one day with several men, is a rainmaker *and* multi-orgasmic without the need of female-centered foreplay? Sounds like every man's pornographic dream come true to me! And that is just the problem. LKH wants to make Anita Blake sound like a such an amazing woman that she has lost track of what this series is supposed to be about. Ms. Hamilton, if you have issues about creating some sort of superwoman in the Nietzsche fashion, go seek therapy, but please bring back the no-nonsense, gun-happy, self-assured heroine that we once knew and loved."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have all of the Anita Blake books by Laurell K. Hamilton. I have loved almost all of them. However, her latest book is a huge disappointment. This book, which is over 600 pages long, has no discernible plot, except the theme of sex with vampires and other wereanimals. The reader is forced to speculate on Anita's sexual escapades--with whom and how many will she have sex with in the next few pages. I can't believe Ms. Hamilton has run out of ideas.

I felt really cheated that I blew good money on the hardcover (that's never happening again). I could have gotten the 98% from a cheap penthouse paperback. Instead of expecting a fun book and a good read I was bitterly disappointed. Save your money. LKH should go back to formula!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I haven't enjoyed reading the Anita Blake books since before Obsidian Butterfly. Each book used to have a plot and had more to it than sex and whining, and Anita Blake came across as strong and capable rather than as petulant and irritable. Erotic writing is one thing, but this book (and other recent ones) sounds as though LKH was being paid for each page on which her characters discuss or have sex. And it isn't particularly interesting sex. I used to look forward to different characters being introduced, but recently so many of them have been one-dimensional and seem to serve only as prospective partners for AB. If people want to read poorly-written porn, there's plenty for free on the internet.If LKH begins to focus more on the supernatural/mystery/adventure/horror/folklore of her earlier books, her books and readers will benefit."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have about twenty pages to go in this book and I don't care if I finish it or not.

When I first started the Anita Blake vampire series, I wasn't a major fan, but still found enough to enjoy. Cue to 11 books later and ID. WTH? How in the world is this garbage still getting published? I'm not anti-sex/erotic writing, but when it's so OTT that I actually find myself getting bored, then there's something seriously wrong. And would someone please tell me how this woman can be so appealing to every creature she passes? Really? We get the lectures of how moral she is and then BOOM! another sex scene that isn't erotic, just lame. Please, you don't need to pull out a trapeze, Crisco, Bonzo, and a blender to be interesting. Threesomes? So yesterday. Furry animals? Step right up. Audience participation? Why not?I WANT A STORY THAT ACTUALLY HAS A PLOT, not the author's attempts at new sexual variations. It gets boring. This series has gone from being about a vampire hunter to how many different ways, and places, the \\"heroine\\" can get stuffed.Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"That's because I set it aside more than once to read something else. Then I made it my bedtime read, and read other books during the day. I just couldn't take much of this book at one time. In fact, I considered not finishing it a couple of times.When I first started this series, I was very enamored of it. Edward, the assassin, quickly became my favorite character, though he wasn't in every book. I was never in love with the Master Vampire, Jean-Claude, but I just personally don't see the appeal of a man who is pasty white, has long girly hair and wears frilly clothing. So when Richard, the Werewolf, came into the books, I was glad to meet him. Unfortunately, he became a little tiring.I'd been hearing/reading that as the books went along the sex was amped up, and by the time I got through Blue Moon, the eighth book, I could definitely see that. But sex in books doesn't bother me and I didn't mind.And then came book 9, Obsidian Butterfly, in which Edward was involved in a major part of the storyline, and I particularly enjoyed that entry in the series.Then came Narcissus in Chains, and it seemed like it was nothing but sex, violence and gore. Micah was a nice addition, I decided I liked him better than Jean-Claude or Richard. But the magic was gone, and the next book, Cerulean Sins, just dragged. It was the first one I'd read where I wanted it to end sooner rather than later.So that brings us to Incubus Dreams. Anita is called on to investigate when a stripper is found dead, the victim of several vampires who appear to be on a serial spree. But that storyline is really in the background. Up front and center is the \\"ardeur\\", which despite having read every book I seriously cannot even begin to explain or understand completely. Basically Anita is becoming less human and more supernatural herself, and the beast within her must be fed.Anita's sexual partners start piling up in this book. Seriously, the first 200 pages were like one long extended sex scene. I don't think in the entire book there were hardly more than five pages in a row that did not have a sex scene. In addition to Jean-Claude, Richard, and Micah, we now have Damian, and Nathanial. And some other random characters who's names I don't even remember who fill in when the ardeur must be fed and the others aren't available. I'm ok with sex in a book, but I want some story around the sex. Not just a bunch of sex scenes loosely linked. That serial killer storyline probably only took up less than a quarter of the book.Am I done with Anita Blake? I don't know. I have the next three books. My understanding is that Edward does not make another appearance until Skin Trade, which comes after those three and which I don't have. I may continue with the series, but not for awhile."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The blurb on the back of this book promises a crime plot- \\"Now there is a vampire serial killer preying on strippers. And I've been called in to help the police.\\" There is no crime plot in this book. Well, Anita attends a crime scene or two, but if I combined all the pages on which Anita actually worked on the crime, I would come up with around 30 pages, the vast majority of which would involve the final scene (which I won't say too much about, but fans of Anita who have read previous books can guess how it works out). If I added up all the pages in which Anita works as an animator, I think I'd be lucky to come up with a dozen pages.So what takes up the other 700 pages? Sex and introspection (largely about sex) and Anita-worship.Surprisingly for LKH's later books in the series, there isn't an insane amount of sex in this book. There is an insane amount of pointless (i.e. does nothing to advance the plot) and boring sex.A few book ago, LKH introduced a very convenient plot device called the 'ardeur', which is a power Anita inherited through Jean Claude. Basically, it means she has to have sex, and the longer she goes without feeding the ardeur, the less picky the power becomes, and she will have sex with people she wouldn't normally, or in places/situations she would normally never have sex.The point of it is that it allows Jean Claude and some other vampires of his line, to feed and gain power in a similar way to when they drink blood. As with most of Anita's powers, it's entirely unheard of that a human would be able to do this, and she's the only one in the world, for centuries, to develop this power.Wow, listening to everyone bang on about how beautiful and ruthless and smart and sexy and unique and powerful Anita is gets really boring. Every new character that comes along is simply in awe of Anita, or, like many cops she deals with, hates her because she is sleeping with the vampires. There is no variation, no middle ground.There is too much convenience in this book. Not only the ardeur, but smaller things, like Anita's friend Ronnie phoning from a strip club because she's too drunk to drive home, and Anita turns up with Nathaniel and Micah, and just happens to stumble across the body of the latest victim of the serial killer vampires.If you ignore the 600-700 pages of sex, and angst (most of which comes from Richard, who is just whiny, and Nathaniel, whose arc in this book is actually interesting and who is the only character in this book who really develops), the crime plot is pretty interesting.It's just a shame that for the last few books, LKH has felt the urge to attempt paranormal erotica, and not the urban fantasy crime/thrillers she wrote at the beginning of the series, which were so brilliant.Even though I pretty much have nothing good to say about this book, I will be reading a few more in the series, though I probably won't buy them (that doesn't mean I'll steal them, darlings, it means I'll get them from the library) because I don't trust LKH to write good books anymore."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This is the last book I bought from Laurell K Hamilton. After this I just ordered it via my local library, I persevered because of those early books but after book 15 I gave up because it certainly felt like LKH had and now she was only writing pulp to satisfy the masses who couldn't seem to stop reading in the hope that she would write a book like those early ones.The last great book in the Anita Blake series was book 9: Obsidian Butterfly, so I recommend books 1-9 from the Anita Blake world, after that you just want to demand your money back.Don't ever buy a Merry Gentry book - waste of time, you will never get those hours or $$ back.As for the book I think Anita had sex with someone, felt bad, had more sex, got a new power that meant she had to have more sex... oh and then had sex again before killing some vampires and making macho human men respect her because she had bigger balls than them... and then more sex."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Really enjoyed the first 9 books.

She couldn't be more redundant. Redundant is how I'd describe her.-I'm tired of skimming whole pages about how Jean Claude is wearing the same outfit he always does but in a different colorThe redundancy is SO much, that I've made an Anita Blake drinking game:-drink when she says \\"completed the outfit\\"-drink when she writes the exact same thing 2+ times in a paragraph-drink when the words \\"leather jacket\\" are mentioned-drink when a bio about someone we've known for 3+ books is repeated-drink when Jean-Claude's eyes are described (its been TWELVE books, I think we know what color they are)(feel free to add to this list if you have any insanely repeated things that annoy you)But, all that aside....who am I kidding? I'm going to keep reading this series. For petesake this is book 12, as if I'm going to check out after all this time! These books go fast, the sexy stuff is usually pretty hot and its getting more and more frequent as the books go on. I don't think Anita has abandoned her ways, she's been changed into a creature that can feed off sex...that would put a spin in anyone's britches. I also think LKH just discovered she enjoys writing the erotica more than the actual mysteries now...Will I delve into any of her other books now that I know what a mediocre writer she is? NOPE.

BYE BYE Richard, please, please go away, you are such a bore"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Sadly, Hamilton's books continue to go downhill, and this one is no exception. Too much talky sex, with a bit of plot thrown in as an after-thought. Hamilton used to research her books by studying police procedure, firearms handling, and mysticism. Now she \\"studies\\" a manual of sexual positions (really, she said so herself!). On her fan site, Hamilton reported that she was \\"studying\\" such a manual looking for a position she hadn't used in a book yet, although she bragged that she and her new husband already knew most of them. Well, whoo-hoo for her. Anita Blake has degenerated from a tough yet likeable character into a vehicle for Hamilton's lame sexual fantasies, and the mystery/suspense/horror that made the books so engaging has gone out the window. Save your money. If you want a good read, go pick up the old books from a second-hand store."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was a huge fan of Laurell Hamilton, But this book is garbage!! It makes no sense & lacks everything that made the first 8 books great.The writing sloppy & incoherent for a good chunk of the timeAnita Blake needs to get back to her day job & quit being a slash whore. I for one will stop reading these books that I had loved so well & will encourage the same people I got to read these books to not buy another book of hers. Just terrible. I am trying to not be mean, but I am really disappointed in the way Laurell Hamilton has let taken these once amazing books. Please do not read Incubus Dreams, you will just hate yourself later."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I, like other reviewers, found this book very disappointing as compared to the earlier (pre-Narcissus in Chains) Anita Blake novels. However, this book was frustrating not so much because of the typos or occasionally annoying catch-phrases, but because it actually has some elements of both the best and worst of the series. For example, the murder investigation was pretty interesting. . . but the story unfolded in fits and starts and it had no resolution, really. Also, some fun/interesting characters were represented (Nathaniel, Damian, Jean-Claude), but really only one develops in an appealing way character-wise. (I'll let you discover which one.) However, other characters that I like and who also seem to be fan favorites are missing completely; a stray mention here or there does not count as that character's presence (Edward, Asher). Still, other characters I view as ancillary (Micah) are still around. And, of course, that brings us to the gratuitous sex scenes. Honestly, many of them weren't even that hot. (Plus, it's gotten a little hard, at this point, to believe Anita is that conflicted about her new sexual freedom.) I just knew that with a book this long, there'd be enough going on to save it, but I was wrong. The early reviews I read when the book was first released were bad enough that I had fairly low expectations. I thank those reviewers, because I picked the book up from the library, and wasn't nearly as disappointed as if I had spent money on it. Hoping for much better next time."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"As you may have noticed by the number of previous reviews that this book evokes strong responses.The author really needs an editor who will speak the truth - this novel is several hundred pages too long. I'm hoping it will be a good transition novel for Ms. Hamilton, enabling her to get back to some of the things that made the early series so good. The pieces are all there, it just doesn't come together this time. However, it is a step in the right direction. There's an interesting story - although it gets short shrift. We see more of Anita at work - back to the office and back to police work. However, it doesn't take up enough of the book. Most of the book is lots and lots and lots of sex. I like sex as much as the next person, but it's over used here. The sad thing is that towards the end we finally get some resolution to the big triangle of the whole series - Richard/Jean Claude/Anita. But by the time it came around I was so bored with thrusting and panting that it had lost all meaning. This should have been a pinnacle, but it turned into \\"okay, okay, can we get back to the story now?\\"I do like the fact that Anita seems to be trying to settle down and resolve her issues. I just wish it hadn't taken up so much of the story. For me, the highlight of the whole book was the intricate dance between Anita and Nathaniel - but even that went on too long. Definitely, this is not a starting place for new readers. I view it as a flawed, but very interesting book. It is worth reading - but get it out of the library, or in paperback."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"First off, this is the lowest review score I have ever given I dont usually do bad reviews...I dont know where to start but to say others arnt exagerrating this book is not up to the standards of the others. I will admit I wanted there to be more sex, more bedroom type fun ;) I had no idea that when it came everything else would suffer a GREAT deal! She screwed everyone and please no more its \\"tight...he's so big\\" please ANITA stopped being tight a while back lol and lucky her all her men are sooo biggg. So is it worth reading, yeah its barely ok, I would try to get it from a library im selling my entires series...I will continue to read it probably im very forgiving but its just not the same she has a Harem of supposably ALPHA males who are complete chumps,sex toys, and weak....WOW...and WOW what the heck is up with Anita the only way I was able to finish it was to Skim."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"If she wants to write what someone on a forum I saw somewhere called Fangfrackers, that is fine.Don't dress them up as monster hunting books though, and call aspade a spade, and throw in the erotica word. Will that hurt sales thatbadly? If she put out a line of books purely focused on women shagging monsters, can't imagine she wouldn't do really well with it, as she seems to have some talent in that area.The plot here is of the thin crust variety, no doubt about it.Personally, in a ghost busting or monster hunting book, I want somestuff to happen."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I understand how some readers are frustrated since Anita truly has changed since the Vampire Hunter novels began. I just started reading them a few months back so I haven't had so much time in between readings like others have had to wait for the next book to be released. Maybe from my perspective, reading a book or two (and sometimes three) a month, I can see how each novel links to one another, how she hasn't just changed entirely overnight, and how she still struggles with her inner demons. She is evolving and I am totally hooked. Jean Claude is the same as ever, just opening up more, Richard is slowly but surely coming to his senses, Micah is Anita's rock, and Nathaniel is a little piece of her innocence. Asher and Damian have yet to develop a real place in her life but I'm sure there will come a time for that development. As far as I can see, each of the men in Anita's life represent a small part of her, and if they were all combined into one person, we'd come up with Anita. I think they balance her each in a different way. As for the police work and zombie raising, I still think the stories are solid. While there is less focus on her work, I don't have a problem with that at all. I didn't start reading these novels for dry crime stories, but for a mix of horror, romance, and mystery. I found of this in these books."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"If you like the romance/sexual aspects of this series best, you will probably like this book. If you have been reading for the mysteries/shoot 'em up scenes, you probably won't like this book.The book follows the progression of the series but things seem to have slowed to a crawl. Some will say Anita has grown up, to me it felt more like she gave up. Nathaniel's character is developing nicely, he was the best part of the book (along with Jason, who has always been the character I relate to the most).Having too much power makes the character of Anita boring. She can take down anyone and to kill her you would need to put her through a sausage grinder. Her struggles against the bigger and badder is part of what made the early stories so great.This book has put me on the fence about the series. I'll read the next one but I won't be salivating as the release date approaches.edit: For those who don't know, chapters 1-3 of Danse Macabre is available on Ms. Hamilton's website."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"the anita blake series is a fantastic series. i couldn't wait for incubus dreams to come out, however, after having read it now,i was dissappointed for the first time by Hamilton. the book was more sex than story telling. i love the drama in anita's life and this time sex prevailed. I am looking forward with great enthusiasum for danse macabre. over all, the series is a five star series, with just that one slip. i recommended it to all my friends, and i recommend it to all of you!!!!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have read a number of Anita Blake series. This is the only one I have ever REread. The sex scenes were off the wall, just what you would hope for with Werewolves & Vampires. What could be worse than tame vampire sex??? I loved that the relationship with Nathaniel finally took off. I look forward to more encounters between theme."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This one was good, but not as good as the other books in the series so far. I liked the new development of the second triumvirate with Nathaniel and Damian (Though I admit I got annoyed that the publishers misspelled the word \\"triumvirate\\" throughout; you'd think that they'd put a little time and effort into editing a novel from an author as successful and prominent as Hamilton), and I like the new character Requiem, and I like the added complications of the London vampires losing their master and the arrival of Wicked and Truth and the flaws in Malcolm's Church of Eternal Life and the mysterious vampire villain, scarred worse than Asher, and the increase in power of the original triumvirate. All of those were interesting, and they all made me want to read the rest of the books immediately, right now, so I can find out what happens -- except I know Hamilton's still writing these books, so there's no way for me to learn everything that will happen. Both good and bad, that.The sex was a bit much. Not that it was too dirty -- I liked the scenes, I liked the way Hamilton described it, I was very happy to see Anita coming to terms with her own preferences, and also to see Richard taking a step toward real reconciliation with Anita and his place in the triumvirate and so on -- but only because there was so much of it. It took up too much of the book. I saw the need for all of it, between the ardeur and the need for more power to fuel the new triumvirate, but I wish there could have been another way to handle the problem, so there could have been more of a focus on the non-bedroom action. But this has never been a series that has shied away from graphic description; Hamilton never does a fade at the climax of an important moment, ending a chapter and then skipping ahead a few hours. It's one of the things I like about this series; it gives it weight and drama, as the gritty, tough moments are all taken seriously. When Anita kills someone, we get to experience every second, every reaction, every thought and feeling she has about it, even the negative ones -- and the scene when she executes a vampire with her pistol is a prime example of that. When Anita has sex with someone, it's the same thing, and it keeps the sexual elements -- which are truly integral pieces of the story, rather than cheap thrills added to cover up weak parts of the plot -- from becoming boring or tawdry. These are important experiences for Anita, and so they should be equally important to the book and the reader, and I'm glad that Hamilton was able to face them squarely and write them as honestly as she writes everything else. Myself, I'd have been blushing and giggling way too much to pull this off, so I have to tip my hat to her for doing what I couldn't.I'm just glad I get to read it."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"First off, I'd like to say that I have no issue with LKH's writing. She tells a great story. But what the heck is going on? She's turned Anita into someone admirable into someone pitiful. Having read the book earlier than its release date, I was extremely disappointed in the turn these books have taken. I am not a prude by any means, but I don't think there is one chapter in this book where the heroine (aka bimbo) is not getting boffed by someone. I think Anita should stake Jean Claude, cut off his head and burn the body until he was nothing but ashes for what he did - turning her into a sexual vampire. All of her mores have been just compromised. Triumverates be damned. The exuses are conveniently the ardeur, which she doesn't even try to fight, and the fact that she \\"loves\\" just about everyone she has sex with.- she loves Jean Claude- she loves Richard- she loves Asher- she loves Micah- she loves and feels sorry for Nathaniel- she loves and feels sorry for Damian.- she likes (sort of loves) Jason.the list goes on from there, as they are not the only guys she has sex with. And then, she doesn't even get the bad guys in this book.I think Anita should pack her bags and tell all of these guys to go screw themselves. Anita loses most of her humanity and self to everything she always fought against.A terrible disappointment. I'll wait the next time and read reviews before I buy the next Anita Blake."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The truth is, this book really wasn't on par with the preceeding books of the series plot wise, but in truth, this book is the true turning of Anita's morals. Before she was wondering if she was just one of the monsters and in this book, she begins to accept it, as well as accepting that some of her infamous rules are pointless. It is fascinating to see just how exactly someone's mind can go from so high on the moral podium to having nearly no lines anymore and this book accuratly shows the mental process of that degration.This book also back tracked a little by pointing out that vampires, while looking like humans and thinking like humans most of the time, are NOT, in fact, human.Sure there's lots and lots of sex (depends, really, on whether you like that kind of thing or not) but most of that really just helps show how Anita is beginning to accept herself and those around her as well as the situation in life she had been thrown."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"After reading the many negative reviews, I went into reading ID not expecting much. I got an awesome story with the development of one of my favorite characters. NATHANIEL!!!!!! Yes there is lots of sex, but there is story. Anita's relationship with Richard breaks my heart in every book, but this one got me crying in record time. I can't wait for the next one, I've read this one 6 times already."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"If you believe in character development you will like this book and the continuation of the series. If, however, you want the series to be written the way you as an individual envision it, then you will probably never be satisfied. I have found each Anita Blake novel to be an extremely rewarding read.Laurell K. Hamilton has managed to create a parallel modern day society where the fantastic is real and, to some degree, accepted. The characters are real and the decisions they make are human. We can see each character as a person and whether we agree with their actions or not, we are able to see the rationale behind them. Hamilton has managed an incredible feat by making such a real world and cast of characters that feel like they walk around in your head.It is clear that there are a number of reviewers who do not agree with the direction the author has taken the series in; that is their prerogative. But if they do not agree with Hamilton's decisions, they have the opportunity to move on or write their own fiction. If, on the other hand, you are a reader that believes in the creative voice and incredible imagination of Laurell K. Hamilton you will always be in for a treat.I have found each Anita book to explore the depths of humanity and to question some of our deepest ingrained beliefs in unexpected and yet acceptable ways. While each novel is certainly fictional, each somehow speaks to the human spirit and the humanity we all struggle with. I think this book challenged or questions some ingrained beliefs, whether about sexual practices, romantic relationships, or self-acceptance, that many people have. I am sure that there are readers out there who found the book to be too graphic or simply too much in what it portrayed. But, if you are willing and able to be challenged in such a manner and you enjoy the ride Hamilton will take you on, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I started reading the Anita Blake series a few weeks ago and have finally finished it. This book is different from her earlier writings. Aftermaking it through the first five books, I was beginning to wonder if the characters were ever go to have sex. Hamilton has brought Blake's character to a whole new level. Anita is ALMOST comfortable with her sexuality. The ardeur may be an excuse for her to have sex (not always intercourse) with multiple partners but she has come to realize that she enjoys it. I for one am glad to see her realtionship with Nathaniel evolve. Richard has done some growing up and does not despise himself or Anita as much as she used to. Anita's powers are growing and I can't wait to see what happens in the next book. Wicked Truth--the two new vampire brothers-- should add alot to the next story. If you are expecting her later books to be as \\"chaste\\" as her earlier ones, then you may be disappointed. Otherwise, sit back and enjoy the read. I did."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I will say what no one else will say. This book is hot!I will not debate the merits of the storyline or complain about typos.I have read every Anita book multiple times and I enjoyed this one on a whole new level. No...it was not even close to what I expected, but again, no complaints. It does, however, make me ache for the next book.This one had Anita accepting her life and learning to function. I have loved her for years but it was nice to hear less moaning and whaling this time and more dealing.I read many reviews that seemed to be defending what this book presents to all of us. Screw that! If you don't like the sex you've been reading about the wrong girl!! Besides, unless you're as dead as Anita's zombies it turned you on as much as me!I only have one complaint, but it is not a new one. All the books seem to take place in about the space of a week, at most. I know she lives fast, but geez. How much can you do in just a few days?Finally, if you have never read an Anita Blake novel... don't start with this one.

Dealing with certain issues so that they don't interfere with the next step, especially since it seems that there are at least 3 master vampires that going to be coming into view in the coming books, and this way there will be less of having to stop and deal with the arduer or other issues. I can't wait till the next book come out."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Hamilton continues to develop her characters and advance the plot of the series with only the necessary amount of sex and violence. We gain furhter insight into the lives and minds of Anita and the other characters. Taking the time to develop the characters further can only add to the aspects the series has become known for (vampire slaying, zombie raising, and action/adventure). I highly anticipate the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Anita grows up a lot in this book, in between shooting bad guys, solving mysteries, and having endless sex. I love her kick-butt personality, but it's nice to see her getting out of her own way a little bit.There's so much happening on the relationship front and on the gaining-and-managing-new-powers front that the mystery in this novel is a bit more perfunctory than those in the earlier books. Personally, I feel that I can get a mystery anywhere; only with Anita can I get these interesting paranormal powers and some sizzling sex scenes. But people who like the Anita books for their mysteries or who expect a conventional vampire novel will be disappointed.I loved this book, but it's not everybody's cup of tea. One must be quite comfortable with many different permutations of sexuality to appreciate this particular work.The first several Anita Blake books stand on their own, but at this point in the series, you really have to know all that has gone before to appreciate what's happening now. If someone has recommended Laurell K.

However, I'm an Anita Blake fan and couldn't NOT read it. Although there were plenty of sex scenes that could have been cut out, and the murder mystery was a joke because it didn't really have any point to the story I enjoyed this book. We see a resolution of sorts in Anita's mind about all of the changes she's undergone. And another resolution of sorts between her Richard and Jean-Claude triumvirate.

I really liked this book. It was so good that I didn't even notice the typos, not even the second time I read it. I've been a long-time fantasy reader and if you want to see an author totally tank a fantastic series, read The Pillars of Creation in the Sword of Truth series. Incubus Dreams may have had a few problems (typos and the fact that the murder doesn't get solved in the end) but its not a bad book by any stretch of the imagination.Here is why I liked it:You got to see a bunch of characters that dropped out of the picture somewhere along the way.Anita begins to face some of the things she's been running away from.I felt like this book had more continuity, more plot, and more murder mystery than the previous two books.But best of all, Anita finally broke free of the stupid constricting morality that has been driving me nuts. I wouldn't like to see her go on a trampage BUT if you have to feed a sexual need two or three times a day and you've driven one of your food sources to exhaustion, one won't feed you, and there are only two others, you're going to have to get over it and take a few more lovers. Pure practicality so quit whining about it. I think that Anita's new freedom was best demonstrated when she saw Jean-Claude feeding the ardeur in Guilty Pleasures and didn't freak out about it. I hope that this (Anita's pragmatism) continues in future books and cuts out a lot of the repetitive arguments that, I will admit, are begining to grow tedious.So basically, this is a good book in a fantastic series, incorporating some of the better elements of earlier books and paving the way for future books in which Anita doesn't argue as much, isn't as angry, copes with her emotional baggage, kicks serious Mommy Dearest butt, and solves some truly puzzling crimes."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I read some reviews before I really got into the \\"thick\\" of it and I have to tell you I think the reviews are too harsh. Yes, there is a lot of sex, detailed sex, nasty sex. Okay? So, how many books have you read of LKH's and you don't know that there will be tons of sex? Anita is not the same old Anita. She is changing and evolving and I think that is what LKH is trying to get across. Is it as solid a book as others? No, but it serves a purpose. One review went on and on about how she didn't solve the crime...okay, the ending was too neatly wrapped for me or un-neatly wrapped. I have never seen LKH peter (no pun) out like that on a story, it was like she lost interest in the crime. A part of me thinks that the character of Anita has so much going on personally that it is hard to concentrate on her job. Although I would have written it differently and added a lot more storyline and killed some of the fluff, it still isn't as bad a book as most of the reviews would have you believe.I must say, though, that the spelling errors and missing words were a bit annoying at times. I would go back and read something and say to myself, \\"what is she trying to say?\\" - there is no excuse at a publishing house of this size for sloppy crap like that."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I personally loved the book. I have read all of LKH books in a matter of weeks. They keep getting better and better. I actually enjoy that Anita is having to feed the ardeur and choose who gets to feed it. I hope that in the next book there is more of Micah and Jason. I believe that Richard is a baby and as much as I wanted Anita to stay with him, it is getting old listening to him complain. Alot of people complain that there is too much hardcore sex in the book but I found it interesting and it fit the character of Anita. Here's hoping that she comes out with another Anita Blake book before the end of the year."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I think most of the negative reviewers have different ideas about what the \\"Anita Blake story\\" is about than I do. To me, it's about Anita and her development as a Power, and how that development affects the world around her. Because of various factors, this has a strong sexual content. Because this is a long story, things don't get neatly wrapped up at the end of every novel. The mysteries are no longer the point of the series- they are just one thread in the plot.I love the way the characters interact. Sure, I want to bang their heads together sometimes- but I want to do that with my friends, too.Oh, and I'm just fine with the sex, FWIW. ;-)This is great good fun. The typos are irritating, but not enough to dock it a star."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"What can I say, I'm an Anita Blake addict. I ate up the new book and enjoyed every bit. Seen a lot of people slam the sex and say Anita has changed. Well, yeah there is a lot of sex, but since Anita's powers for the past four or five books have become more and more sex based, no one can cry they were blindsided by it all. Anita has changed, and it's all based on her experiences from the first book onwards, the character learning and adapting like a real warm blooded person.While the book isn't without it's technical faults, the content pulled me in totally and I was a very happy reader for the several hours long ride that was Incubus Dreams. More details of the characters are revealed, more dangers were uncovered, more relationship foo is explored, more powers, more sex, more pure enjoyment for this girl.If you only want a mystery, go to the mystery section of the book store. If you want hot blooded paranormal erotica and supernatural drama, settle in with this book and and let the real world slip away. It's got a little bit of everything and a whole lot of appeal for those who aren't turned off by sex and don't demand a cookie cutter good girl.Laurell K. Hamilton's writing is unlike any other author's. More audacious, and far more fun than anything else I've read. Anita Blake is an original, who trail blazes through the jungle of the more timid and conventional fantasy to make her own unique and alluring path.Incubus Dreams was fun read and I am wanting the next book already."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I seem to be in the minority, but I enjoyed this book. So many people have been complaining about the abundance of sex in this book, I say get over it! If you have read any of the author's books, you know that sex, whether Anita is having it, not having it, overanalyzing it, etc... is an integral part of her books and their plotlines. OK I do agree that the plot is pretty thin in this book, but does it make it a bad book? I don't think so. I agree with a previous reviewer in that I find it scary that we are more satisfied with Anita as a sociopath and killer who feels nothing when she kills (I mean she shoots a vampire so many times until there was lierally a hole in his chest!!)than we are of her as a sexual being. So she has sex with a lot of guys, what is the big deal? I am sure there are some people out there who share a bit of that fantasy. Not only of having a lot of sex with a lot of beautiful men (although that is a part of it) but of being someone who is openly DESIRED by so many beautiful men."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I just read Incubus Dreams, and I couldn't put it down. I'd pushed it to the back of my To Be Read pile because of all the nasty reviews. Lucky I'm a completest on the series I like, and Anita Blake is still one of my favorite series. I read it, and was surprised. I really liked it. A lot. Anita finally gets a handle on her new powers from the Ardeur and the appetites for blood, meat and sex that it and the Tri have awakened in her.This book is loaded with coming to terms with not just her power but her relationships with the people in her life, romantic and otherwise. Very powerful scenes that grabbed me and dragged me into the book so that I read it almost straight through, only stopping to eat. It was a really good story and I think the characters as a whole grew even more complex and layered in this one book than in all the others. Yes there was lots of sex, but there were solid plot reasons for it and I could see how necessary it was and it wasn't at all the horror show the other reviews I read made it all out to be. I'm very glad I read the book and only wish I'd read it sooner. Thank you Laurell K. Hamilton for another enjoyable ride through Anita Blake's universe.I'm really looking forward to the next book. I hope it's out soon! This time I'll read it without looking at the reviews because it's clear some people are having problems with the direction Anita is taking and they are pretty vocal about it. But I don't have any problems so far and just want to read more."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book was a LITTLE more interesting than all of the other's but they pretty much all have the same story line. She's with a vampire (or is it 2 or 3), and anything else that hits her fancy. She kills the bad guys. The only thing that saves this book is that the Hamilton had A LOT more pages to build up to the few sexual content scenes and this one has only one more than the rest of the books. The first HALF of the series she's trying to decide to sleep with and who to kill and by this book she's \\"sleeping\\" with just about anything that moves and killing it, too. I hope that this series doesn't have to many more books left. Eventhough, I'll have to read them just to see if she ends up with any certain being...I like Hamilton's other series the \\"Meredith Gentry\\" series a lot better. If your looking for a series to read, read that one instead."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Ok, I'm reading that all these people want to old Anita back, but i love what LKH has done with the book. Characters change like people change. Most people arent the same people they were six years ago. All that LKH is doing is trying to make the series more life like. As far as how much sex is in the book, i personnaly enjoy it, but if by the time you got to NiC and you didnt like the six, why did you keep reading? Why did you read CS, and see yet again the more sex, because that was the kind of person Anita was becoming. Like it said in Incubus Dreams, some of Anita's lines that she knew she would never cross, she is crossing. I totally agree with LKH in the way Anita is changing!!GO NATHANIEL, DAMIAN, AND ANITA!!!! (Huggs them all!)"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I can comiserate with many of the reviewers in the sense that yes, there were about 25 very explicit sex scenes in the book, and the whole murder track definately got lost in the midst of it. But at the same time, this was one of the most beautiful books I have ever had the priviledge of reading. The charecters make you want to cry because they are all so flawed, so real. Everyone has their story yet they are finding a way to work together, to change and compromise. Anita has developed so far from her original charecter and I know that these books can only continue to get better and better, with every page being more complex and heartfelt. Hamilton is an amazing writer, and these books are truly more then that."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This is another of Ms. Hamilton's books where you either love it or hate it. I happen to like it. I've read it three times and can see some of the other reviewers points of view. Yes there are typos and other grammar errors. Yes, she is repeating sentences and there are spelling mistakes. But none of this takes away from my enjoyment of the story.There are complaints about the sex. Well, for most of this series, I've had to read about non-stop murder, mayhem, guts and gore everywhere, flaying, entrails spilled, and other weird stuff. So the sex makes a nice change. It also goes with the type of power Jean-Claude has. The book takes place over a 2-3 day period. And it's long. The beginning is slow, but it picks up about page 80. New characters are introduced and she has sex with them. It is one of the ways she gets power. When Anita starts paying attention to her power needs, maybe having sex with unknown men won't happen.There is more talking in this book about relationships. OK, some of the discussions could have been shorter, but her whining is not as irritating as in the last few books. I wish her character could just accept what she is and not talk it to death, but I liked this book. You really have to read some of the earlier books to understand the plot. This book is not a \`stand alone' read."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have read and re-read all the books in this series and in the Meredith Gentry series. I loved the latest installment! The sex scenes were as steamy as usual and the characters were fascinating. People change and do things you didn't think they would do before, but that's what makes LKH such an excellent author. Nothing is stagnant. I can't wait for the next installment in both of the series!!! This book is excellent and you have got to read it."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"this book was awesome!!! i love the different plot lines and all the characters that are introduced!!

I have enjoyed this book and as before, it is hard to put down."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I've read many of these reviews and almost did not purchase Ms. Hamilton's next book in the Anita Blake series (Incubus Dreams) because of them. I am glad I purchased it despite the mixed reviews. I don't understand why so many people are whining about the sex. I found the scenes to be surprising and entertaining. Yes, there were more graphic sex scenes than in previous stories - but, hey - I thought it was a logical direction for the story to go. Anita has been evolving into the person that she ultimately becomes in this novel. I do not think that I could have taken any more of her tip-toeing around serious issues in her relationships (yes, relationships - as in more than one) or anymore of her self-loathing because of her sexual desires. People, just realize a few things: One, this is a book - it is entertainment; Two - vampires, werewolves, necromancers, etc. are not real (see point number one); Three - if you are this far into the series and are surprised and shocked by this turn of events you probably should not read vampire books."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"WOW!! LKH does it again. Each book just gets better and better.Yes there is alot of sex but hello the title is Incubus Dreams what did everyone expect. I have been wishing in the last few in the series for something alittle more on the sex side and boy did LKH deliver. I was getting somewhat bored with all of the blood and gore. This title had some but it was a welcome relief not to read on every other page gruesome details of guts spilling, heads exploding, etc. Come on everyone needs a break from all of the gore. Anita would have lost her mind soon if all she did was go through killer after killer. Don't listen to all the PRUDES Ms. Hamilton keep it up this was a fabulous book. Can't wait for the next one or the next Gentry novel. LOVE YOU. YOU ROCK."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I found it a pleasant read...very sexy...very easy reading...not too many big words...just my style...i like the whole series...don't want it to end...easy, effortless style reminds me of g.l.giles writing"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Just read the book and while I love Laurell Hamilton and her Anita Blake series, This one was a bit disappointing. Not enough crime plot and just a little bit too much sex. Don't get me wrong. I absolutely loves both scenes with Anita and Nathieal and Anita/Nathieal/Jason and the one with Anita and both her trimuvalents. But the bar scene wasn't really needed in my opinion. Still definitely love the author and the series. While this wasn't one of her best, I have read much much much worse books, none of them by Mrs. Hamilton. I get the feeling anita is going through a crisis of spirit and I definitely think one book will not work to handle the whole sceme of what she is going through. I hope Mrs. Hamilton keeps writing Anita Blake books. I plan on telling my grandchildren about them and her wonderful works."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book is a continued evolution of the series and being that it is one in a long series, not all of the answers are going to be revealed if the series is to continue. In every book, she changes and develops more, more power, more personlity, different opinions, and evolving relationships. You have to keep reading the books to find out all the secrets, and when something is fully explained finally, another new change arrives. But that's just how an author has to write to keep a long series going. I for one am still interested in the world of Anita and can't wait for Danse Macabre and the new Meredith Gentry book. She can't write them fast enough for me."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I only recently got into the whole series. I started them all in late July, and by the 2nd week of August I decided I couldn't wait for it to come out on paperback and bought the book.I have found the whole series absolutely spellbinding, and totally disagree with those people who hated it.I can't wait until next year for the next book!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Again, I cannot believe the reviews that these people have given. Maybe I'm not as comparetive as everyone else. As I go, I read each book as a new entity and I am willing to grow with the characters and am willing to except where Hamilton takes me. Yes there was a lot of sex in the book, yes it was a little excessive, but that didn't pull me down.Actually some of it helped me out, because before this book I was feeling that Micah and Nathaniel were not getting their well deserved sex scene time.I know one place that I might differ from some people. I actually liked the ending of this story, because it left it a little open ended and I like that. I felt that some of her stories had took much of a close to it for an enthralling series.I definitely fell in love with this book like I did all of the rest in this series. I was left saying \\"aww Nathaniel\\" and \\"you go Micah\\" and \\"about time, Richard\\"."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"While the title informed me that this book would include more sex than the proceeding books, this is not a point highlighted by many of the reviewers.If you have a definitive view of which direction the three main protagonists should go; you may/will be disappointed by Incubus Dreams. However, if you read to see where characters go through the writing of the author, this is the book for you.All earlier AB books had a main enemy; in Incubus Dreams the enemy is the arduer... this is what she fights throughout the book. It is through the impact of the arduer that all character growth is defined in this book. However, there is a definite dividing line between sex for love and sex for feeding; again those that see any of the characters in a defined way will have problems here - no one character, including Anita from earlier books takes on board the Arduer in the way you expect - for me this is a WAY TO GO LKH! moment.I didn't love, or particularly like, the sex scenes; but within the definitions of the book they were spot on. I didn't like the way some characters moved away from my comfort zone, but it did make me think why I was disturbed ...So I will say again, if you know where the ABVH series and characters should go, you will not enjoy this book. If you read to find out what will happen to the characters... this book is a blinder!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Before I purchased this book I read review after review....all of you putting her hard work down.I personally think that this book was necessary in the telling of Anita's life. Without it we would never understand the way her head works and how much love she actually has inside her.We would never understand the fear, the hurt and the level of her involvment with those she cares about. If Richard and Jean Claude were not prominent, there were reasons; just read it to find out.If you actually care about the characters, then you need to read this book, you need to understand Anita's train of thought and beliefs and how they affect her life.You like the series, then read this book, find out why, who and how the right way with an open mind, and not the negativity of the others who have reviewed this book. If you don't like the way the books are going, then stop purchasing LKH's books and find someone new, I give the book 5 stars because I understood what she was trying to do with it.I loved the book and the story told in it and I anxiously await the continuation of the saga!Way to go Ms. Hamilton!!!!!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have a simple criteria for rating books I have read. If I was unable to finish it; I don't rate it. If I finished it but had to struggle or set it aside for a while; I give it three stars. If I enjoyed the book(as a whole); It deserves 4 stars. If I want to read it again some time in the future; It gets five. When I read INCUBUS DREAMS, I immediately flipped it over and read it again (just in case I'd missed something). There is no listed rating for this.I read through a large number of reviews of this book. Most of the negative remarks center around four things.1)SEX: Too much; Too graphic; Too talkative; Too soul searching; Too repetitive.Anita Blake is not for the squemish or prudish. As Anita's Character has grown, My concepts of pain, sex and gore have grown with it. If you don't understand that statement, you probably won't enjoy the book.2) An unresolved mystery:This bothered me also, but the last few pages set the scene for a very promising continuation. We know who, but how and why??3) Characters: Left out; Stuck in; Undeveloped.Not everyone can be the star of every show. Without extras there can be no depth.4) Editing:My wife goes ballistic every time she runs into an editing faux pas. I find it an irritating distraction that should be deciphered and forgotten like a blemish on a beautiful face.There are only a few series that I feel deserve rereading again and again. Anita Blake is one of the best and Incubus Dreams is near the top of that series. I am sure that the publishers will try to get LKH to conform to the limits of her more conservative fans. Whichever way she goes, I know I will enjoy the next in the series."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book was awesome! I think the series got hotter and better with each book. Main character really evolves in this book. I could not put it down and read through a 6 hour flight! Must like this genre and not mind sex and gore."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Everyone is being so harsh. Calm down people they are just books. This one is great as it is... It IS a slight departure from previous issues and story threads left hanging but it is still a great installment in the Anita Blake saga. LKH writes wonderful books and this one is no different. The changes in the relationship between Anita and Nathaniel and then between Anita/Nathaniel/Micha and between Anita/Richard/Jean-Claude....GRRRR...very nice...and the deterioration of her relationship with Ronnie (who is totally flipping out by the way)...Awesome! LKH writes some great books and they can't all be exactly what everyone else wants them to be...you can't please all of the people all of the time...So don't listen to all the negativity, pick this book up today and don't look back."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm not sure if the people reading this book have read the entire series or not. Anita has developed from a black and white no compromise person where there is only good or bad and no middle ground, into a real person that can see the grey areas and appreciate the fact that there is no absolute good or evil.This book gives more depth to all the characters and lets you know what is going on inside them and why they are doing what they do. I can hardly wait for \\"Micah\\" and \\"Danse Macabre\\" to see even more of what drives the characters.If you're looking for your typical vanilla vampires, were's, and other assorted monsters---human and otherwise, read something else. Anita Blake and company are hot and getting hotter."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was browsing through the reviews of this book, and it looks like many, many other readers are as disappointed as I am. It's not just the sex. It's that we feel like we've lost a character we really enjoyed. That should tell you that Laurell K. Hamilton is capable of extremely engaging writing, but she has alienated a loyal following with this one. See my orignal review below:I so enjoyed the earlier Anita Blake books and have shared them with family and friends. I was beginning to lose interest as the content became more and more about justification for sex and less about story.Well, this one finally reached the limit of what I'm interested in. About 90 pages of story and the rest is justification of why Anita can have sex with, well, about anyone around at the time.Just not interested anymore. Give me 300 - 400 pages of the story line and you'll win me back. Otherwise, it's farewell Anita."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"It was pretty clear to me that this was half a book. Granted at over six hundred pages, one would expect a full book (plot, character development and all) but Laurell K. Hamilton got sidetracked by nearly 500 pages of sex. She could easily have cut the sex scenes down to about three (maybe four) and given us the rest of the story. For example, solved the murder? Developed an actual reason why the serial killer is killing? Allowed us some tension (maybe just a page or so) questioning whether the killer vampire could be one of Jean-Claude's new vampires? But the single thing that annoyed me the most about this book was the plot points that went absolutely nowhere. She introduces Damian's master for about one page then she never shows up again. The Dragon? Two pages and gone.The single hopeful thread in this book was the Church of Eternal life and it's failure to bind it's members. One can only hope LKH will explore that in the next Anita Blake.Will I buy her next Anita Blake? Yes. But if it's the same as this one-number 14 won't make my reading list"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"First and foremost, I have loved the Anita Blake Series. However, Incubus Dreams has almost completely turned me off. It is very hard to like a character that requires and demands all the attention but complains the whole time. She has gotten very \\"all about her.\\" I didn't mind the sex, but c'mon 5 people in less than 24 hrs? Am I the only one who is bored by the various ties and metaphyical explanations that I skip it now? I want the cases and vampire hunter back. Was there even a case in this one? I was so irritated, i can't remember. Why have all the characters become unlikable? Where is Edward? I want the old Anita back!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I can't tell who was more bored...me, reading this book, or LKH writing it! I may be in a minority-- someone who REALLY LIKED Cerulean Sins and all the hot sex, but who HATED this new installment of the Anita series. The sex scenes, as some have mentioned, were broken up by CHAPTER UPON CHAPTER of talking! Turning what should have been a juicy romp into a raging snoozefest.Oh, and I also didn't appreciate LKH's typos, and her repetitive phrasing. If I hear \\"he took one for the team\\" or \\"I made it a question\\" or \\"that just flat out does it for him\\" or \\"I went to that dead place inside myself\\" or \\"eff me!\\" one more time -- I'm gonna throw something! Namely this book, into the trash! Sorry LKH: There's no excuse for lazy writing , particularly after we fans have stuck with you for twelve books. To sum up-- more sex, less talk, more action, less typos, more Edward and Asher, less lazy writing.I've \\"taken one for the team,\\" so you don't have to. Don't buy this book, unless you're having trouble sleeping, or need to practice your copyediting skills."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I see what Laurell Hamilton attempted to do here. At the beginning of the Anita Blake series Hamilton established that Anita had certain lines she would not cross. As the series progressed Anita had to challenge her preconceptions and either stretch those lines, cross them, or redefine them.With \\"Incubus Dreams\\" all bets are off and all lines are crossed. Driven by her \\"succubus\\" that she gained from Jean Claude she needs to satisfy sexual desires in order to feed Jean, herself, and to keep herself from feeding off of her own newly developed triumvirate. This means she occasionally ...okay, often. ...has to have immediate sex with whoever is available. Three ways are better as they don't use up any particular subject. Yes, she uses up life energy of her partner. This also means she can't be monogamous.It all makes sense, but Laurell Hamilton brow beats us with it. \\"Incubus Dreams\\" starts with a murder mystery then leaves it behind to explore Anita's new problems, with erotic scene after erotic scene, ad infin-orgasma. We don't return to the murder mystery until near the end of the book.The book would have worked so much better if Ms. Hamilton cut back on the sex scenes by half and expanded on the supernatural murder mystery, weaving the two plots together. I would have like to have seen Anita dealing with the demands of her succubus while trying to solve the murder mystery rather then being incapacitated by the over active sex drive.Has Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake \\"Jumped the Shark\\"? It's quite possible. I don't know if I'll continue with the series."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Once upon a time Anita Blake books were interesting horror mysteries with a little bit of sex thrown in. Now they are 600 pages of repetitive, overwrought erotica/relationshippy stuff and 100 pages of poorly thought out plotline. Conversations and/or sex and/or conversations about sex span multiple chapters for no apparent reason. Anita has something like 10 sexual encounters with almost as many partners in the span of 48 hours. I got exhausted just reading about it (and not in a good way.)Once she was a necromancer/executioner caught in a bizarre love triangle with a werewolf and a vampire. Now she's a lupa, a nimir-raj, a human servant, master to a vampire servant, more powerful every freaking minute, and oh yeah, everyone wants to have sex with her. There is such a thing as overloading a character.At least Hamilton has updated Anita's nike/black jeans/polo shirt wardrobe, and has Anita living in the present, complete with mentions about websites and the internet.I can't believe how many hours I wasted reading this. Why didn't I just stop reading? I don't know, I guess I just hoped it would get better. At least I bought it used. But I'm not paying so much as a dime for the next one."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams was a long book and it felt even longer. I can barley remember the plot one hour after I finished it, but I wish I could forget the awful sex-scenes. But that I hated the plot and the sex is only a personal opinion. The worst about the book is the editing. There are typos on almost every page. That is simply unacceptable."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I also am (well was) an avid LKH fan. But this one book ruined and entire series for me. Sex, Sex, Sex, Sex, Sex, and more sex, but what really annoyed me is all the hesitation before all the sex. We've pretty much established the this Anita Blake isn't the same Anita Blake from the Guilty Pleasures Days. She's pretty much given up all her taboo's and inhibitions. But after all the sex and and 'not quite' sex in the preceding books.It's just plain hypocritical to bring up all the old argument's, especially when it came to bedding Nathaniel, she's done everyone else, she might as well do him too.My second irritation was the constant bickering between her and Richard, I think it added up to over thirty pages. Hmmmm, I think I understand what most of the 600 pages are comprised of. You might think that of 600+ pages there must be atleast on page of decency, WRONG!!!!!!! And all of the sudo-metaphysical sex scenes and most of the bickering leads to an ultimately empty ending. With a sorry excuse as to why we (the readers) got a sucky ending.Toodles LKH. I will never read another book by this woman again."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Just wanted to add some \\"me too's\\" to the review list. Not that I don't like well written sex scenes, but after the overdose in \\"Cerulean Dreams\\" I decided not to buy this book but got on the hold list at the local library. Glad I did. Instead of all the sex I would have rather read about Dolph's daughter-in-law-to-be and family dynamics, a fight with Moroven (Damien's maker-at least in this book), Barbara & Steve Brown's murdered son who Barbara is going to have animated come hell or high water, Stephen & Gregory's abusive father confronting his now-were boys, the vampire church's problems with no blood oaths, the problems Micah sorts out with the coalition or springing somebody (or everybody) from a lycanthrope safe house. And, of course, more interesting monsters, human and non-human. I hope LKH is not going to dole out these kind of story lines in miserly doses among pages and pages and pages of sex."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"After reading every book in every series LKH has written, I was looking forward to this. After reading happily along for the first 15 pages, the book then slid into a disappointing miasma of side plot lines and (never thought I'd say this), way too much strange sex. I don't think the \\"mystery\\" aspect of solving the serial killings even picked up until perhaps 3-400 pages later. I actually started skimming over the sex scenes, as they became rather rote and boring, to see if the story would pick up again. It did at the end of the book, but about 200 pages of superflous couplings could have been edited out. Am hoping LKH reads some of her fan's reviews, and fixes this in the next book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am truly astonished that some people can defend \\"Anita Does St. Louis\\" as Anita \\"growing as a character\\".How does Anita having sex with men she met less than a chapter earlier deepen her character? How does rainmaking prove the growth of her emotions? How does her \\"doing it furry\\" (something the Anita I USED to enjoy reading about refused OUTRIGHT to even CONSIDER) mean she is becoming a better person?Sure - the old Anita was a bit of a prude, but at least she had standards, morals, a clear and concise sense of where she wanted to head as a person. Having more sex and sexual dialogue than ANYTHING else in the whole book has utterly ruined this series for me.And no - I don't think Anita's growing ease with killing is morally upsetting. Anita has been commenting on \\"entering that quiet, white space\\" while she killed since The Killing Dance. She has been wrestling with whether she was human or one of the monsters since back in Guilty Pleasures. And even if LKH DID start writing thousands of pages about Anita wrestling with her conscious and growing ease with killing, it would at least be a damn sight better than reading about her screwing every single male in sight.LKH - get your head out of whatever dark orifice it is stuck in, come down from that tall ivory tower and maybe try and salvage what ragged pieces of professionalism are left for you. I have a gut feeling that DM with either flush your career for good, or if you listen and give a damn, maybe it will stem the rising flood of ex-fans who are seriously peeved with you.Aussie Gal."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was a fan of the old Anita Blake, the Anita that actually did things outside of the bedroom. It is my firm belief that the whole series lost its footing when Anita lost her virginity and this book only strengthened that in my mind.The only reason I read this was because of how it was described to me by an avid Anita Blake fan. It sounded interesting and I thought that Laurell K. Hamilton might've actually decided to put a bit of plot in the book. But I went through page after page, chapter after chapter, and the plot never really began to take off until nearly the book's end. There were many places where oportunity for an intriuging story presented itself but, sadly enough, Ms. Hamilton seemed to say \\"screw it! Anita needs to bugger someone else!\\"Now, I enjoy books with sex and violence as much as the next person, but I require a bit of plot with my porn. I cannot help but see something wrong when the book is almost half over and one hardly knows what it is about yet, thanks to the time Anita is spending on her back (or her hands and knees, depending on the way the situation presesnted itself).Another thing I require of a book is grammar. Editors exist for a reason, that being to polish a novel before it is published. More and more larger named authors are deciding, however, that they are too good for an editor, and they do not allow their story to be touched by any hands but their own. I find it difficult to read a book that has gone practically straight to my hands form an author who has admitted in the past that she is not good with grammar. She repeats key phrases far too ofter (if you have nothing better to do some time, go through the series and count how many times you read of smiles not reaching one's eyes. You might be suprised)and punctiation is clearly not her strong suit.If you are loooking for a (very) slight bit of titilation in a book without having to wade through several hundred pages full of pesky plot, then this is your book. I, however, am glad that I merely borrowed this book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The murder \`plot' and I use that term loosely, is introduced in Ch. 2 and not mentioned again until Ch. 46. But LKH finds all the time in the world for Anita to have sex, channel her \`beast', gain spiffy new powers (I believe she's gained 3 or 4 new ones in this book alone) and not to mention the endless pages where the characters sit a round and psychoanalyze each other.More new characters in a book that's already overflowing! And surprise, surprise, they're all male and all attracted to Anita.She's the power-center for two triumvirates, pard leader, a lupa, a Federal Marshal, a vampire executioner, the most powerful animator in the world, the most bad ass necromancer ever and yet still finds the time to be intimate with 7 men. There is one point in the book where nothing happens for a 100 pages that doesn't involve Anita's groin. 100 pages! And I don't think it would be so bad, but the sex scenes are so repetitive and lacking tension that I skimmed through all of them.Oh happy day, we find out that Anita is a \`rainmaker,' which is so much more interesting than vampire serial killers...oh, we're also lucky to know that Anita has been practicing her \`technique' and Richard and Micah (why, why does he exist??) are very grateful. Yes, I definitely would prefer to read about that than Evans, the psychic clairvoyant (anyone remember him?) and the couple who are desperate to find out who brutally murdered their son....gee, I'm not a writer or anything, but it seems to me like there could have been a story in there, but wait no, Anita's gone five minutes without sex.There is more than one point where I burst out laughing while reading and not in a good way. Jean-Claude saying he does not lightly share her...no, no of course not, he'll only share her with his buddy, his servant, her servants, her \`mate', the Ulfric oh and the two newbie vamps, they get dibs too...and a threesome scene where a certain something is dangling in front of Anita, just out of reach and she strains like a rabbit going after a carrot on a stick---the sheer stupidity of this scene made me want to burn the book and salt the earth, but I wasn't going to pay the library fine and waste money on another LKH book. Oh and I mustn't forget Anita gyrating on stage at Guilty Pleasures with a stripper-clearly behavior you want to see in a Federal Marshal, a licensed vampire executioner and someone who gets as much publicity as Anita.The non-sex stuff in this book is just as uninteresting as the sex itself. We've seen it all before-the prejudiced, bigoted cop who gives Anita a hard time, Anita metaphysically battling two master vampires, more Richard angst. And the couple that wanted Anita to raise their son could have been a compelling subplot but was utterly wasted. LKH, who has apparently been too busy dreaming up new sexual situations for Anita to pay attention to her own mythos, because Anita's reasoning for not raising the son has never been mentioned in another book. And bizarrely enough, a critical plot point was dropped or just forgotten---you would think Anita would want to know for sure if she had the 4th mark, but even the possibility of immortality is nothing compared to Anita's throbbing, biological needs.I won't be reading the next Anita Blake book and I say that with bitter regret. I can no longer watch the decline of a series and characters I once loved so much. Ultimately, this series belongs to Ms. Hamilton and she can take it any direction she sees fit, but I, and I'm sure a lot of other once loyal readers, won't be along for the ride."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The Anita Blake novels. Glorious books, with plenty of romance, mystery, fantasy, and tough-as-nails vampires, cops, and vampire slayers. I came to the series late, and each book left me wanting more, as I shot through each one rapid fire. Here, I am sorry to say that a trend begun with Narcissus In Chains has continued.As Anita's powers continue to grow at an unrealistic rate (one could even call them deus ex machinas), so does the amount of sex found in the work. The plot continues to die as the list of partners grows high. I was hard pressed to finish Cerulean Sins, and Incubus Dreams was even worse. Sex scenes stretched for chapters, and supposed villains in the novel are mentioned only a handful of times. The language is ludicrous at several points, as the descriptions of the intercourse become insanely vivid, and glaring grammatical and spelling errors, which I first noticed in Cerulean Sins, come back to hit you in the face with even more force.If you decide to read this book at all, wait for the paperback. If I had not grown so attached to the Vampire Hunter series, this would have been my lost of the works. The entire novel could have easily been summed up in a fourth of the pages it took to print it. Picking this book up off of the shelf, having had no knowledge of the back plot, I would've just tossed it back as another third-rate romance novel. Bring back the plot!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I would have to say that this was another disappointing read by Ms. Hamilton. I checked out Incubus Dreams from the library, having learned my lesson from Cerulean Sins, that just because it's an Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter novel, it is not necessarily great, or even all that good. I did read it with a sense of expectation, and a strong hope that she'd done better on this one than on Cerulean Sins and her latest Merry Gentry novel, which was also disappointing to me, and, unfortunately, in my opinion, it's just more of the same.The book is chock-full of sex, lots of sex - and if that's what you read the books for, then, you'll find it in this one. However, the Anita that I'd come to know and love wasn't there. Yes, she may have some rather newfound stability in her relationships with Micah and Nathaniel; but her ever continuing-to-expand powers are just getting out of hand. She's Jean-Claude's human servant, for goodness sake, not the human (semi-human?) equivalent of some big-shot supernatural bigwig. At the rate she's going, she'll be able to wrestle Belle Morte single-handedly with one hand tied behind her back, at that.The murder mystery in this novel was thin; there was not much of a story line to back it up, and we never got to meet the bad guy; we just learned his name. There was mention of people from her past coming back into the picture, and, sure, we get Ronnie, but I know that I was personally hoping really, really strongly, that the persons from her past would include Edward.Richard is more reasonable in this book, but still has his demons. Just as Anita's sexual mores have changed drastically, Richard has now decided to be part of the triumvirate - despite all of his earlier protestations in the previous books that he'd never let Jean-Claude or Anita feed from him. Where is the old Richard, and where is the old Anita? The new and improved ones leave something to be desired, in my opinion.Overall, a disappointment; I'm just glad I didn't buy the book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have been a fan of this series for years. Every book has been a wonder, and has always left me waiting anxiously for the next installment in Anita's story. I have to say though, I was really disappointed in Incubus Dreams.Firstly, it's the sex scenes. Yes, I can hear the cries out there from the devotees. I don't have a problem with sex scenes. I realize that a lot of the story arc in LKH's novels revolve around sex (the Ardeur, various lycanthropy issues, etc.). My issue is that this book seemed to be nothing BUT sex. Aside from a glossed-over scene raising a zombie (which featured a sex scene before and after) and a battle at the end with a group of stripper-killing vampires at the end (which actually raised my rating one star since this part was well written) there was nothing but repetitive descriptions of Anita doing every man she ran across with long hair. I was hoping that Anita would finally resolve some of her issues with her powers and her Catholic hangups, but the way she resolved it seemed a little too easy.Secondly, I found the writing very amateurish, not what I expected from LKH at all. There were a lot of sentences that used the same descriptive word again and again and again (LOL). I really got a feeling that the sex scenes were written quickly or uncomfortably. The actual final battle was well-written, and as I was reading it I felt like I had finally found the book after 500 pages of the Penthouse letters.Third, and last was the sacrifce of the plot. Some will say that this book was necessary for the larger story arc. Fine. I still want a well-defined subplot resolved in a book I payed over $20 for! LKH has always managed to have a focus that is resolved in her previous books, this one would have been much better if the sex scenes had been choked back to under 200 pages and the plot developed further rather than a \\"see you next time\\" ending."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was a great admirer of the Anita Blake series up until the end of Obsidian Butterfly. All the books after that degenerated rapidly into erotica, and plot became secondary. Laurell Hamilton seems to have imposed all her private sexual fantasies on the character of Anita Blake, regardless of whether they fit the original character or not. She's no longer writing for her audience; she's writing purely for herself. This would be fine, except that I'm not particularly interested in her sexual daydreams. I feel that Hamilton has inserted her own new point of view into that of her protagonist, with the effect that Anita is now doing things she would never have previously done. It's as if someone else was writing the character and writing her poorly.We do get to see more of Richard and his conflict between humanity and the beast, but unfortunately, Anita spends her time trying to get him to accept his inner animal. By the end of the book, Richard has been convinced to try dominant sadomasochistic games, and Anita is exploring her inner submissive side. Also, Richard, Jean-Claude, and Anita are now in a menage a trois. Anita is sleeping with almost everyone in the cast in almost every sort of sexual situation you can imagine. Dominance and submission play heavy roles, and the sex is even more graphic than before. I'm starting to really wonder about what the writer does off-stage. I wouldn't mind the series turning into a sex novel quite as much if I hadn't loved the earlier works so much. Now, I'm just disappointed, and Hamilton uses cheap tricks like the \\"ardeur\\" to keep the erotic fantasies coming. Character development and plot are only there to get new sexual adventures onstage.Some people will tell you that Anita's sexual and moral fall are character development. Perhaps. But I see no signs of an upward spiral, and Anita revels in her corruption and abandonment of all human morality. In Incubus Dreams, she has almost completely come to terms with her status as a monster. She has become a cold-blooded killer while channeling all her passions into sex. I found her original struggles to embrace all parts of herself to be much more interesting. Now, it seems she has resolved her inner conflict by total transformation. Previous books were tightly plotted, full of murder mysteries and intrigue, but set tightly in the outside \\"real\\" world. Here, entire chapters go by that are just pure supernatural soap opera. Many of the characters, like Micah, are poorly developed and I have no interest in them. When Hamilton stops long enough to fully detail a character, like the police, we see flashes of her old writing style, but not nearly long enough. Unlike the last two books, this one actually has a plot, but unlike the series up to Obsidian Butterfly, the plot is completely subsidiary to the supernatural romance and sexual experiences of Anita. It is possible to read this one and get a story out of it, but you will have to skip heavily through the porn scenes. The series has gone from erotic undertones to throwing all caution to the wind. While Hamilton can write sex scenes well, they tend to distract and disturb when compared to the scenes of graphic violence, which are also frequent. Often, both happen at once. People who love both in heavy doses and are not disturbed by mixing the two will find Incubus Dreams exactly their cup of tea. Others should avoid it."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Boy, did I hope after Cerulean Sins that this series would improve, and boy, were my hopes dashed! It's a shame to learn that a fine writer like Laurell K. Hamilton can churn out such mindless drivel with so very little plot. Despite the endless sex, or more likely because of it, I feel asleep several times reading this book at night, which is far more than I can say for the first ten or so books of the series, which kept me up until dawn compulsively turning pages. I discovered the Anita Blake series relatively late, in the late 1990s, and devoured them voraciously, only to feel with the last couple of installments that the writer really isn't into her characters anymore, and has decided to turn them into vehicles for her own sexual fantasies instead of people in a coherent story. And, as others have pointed out before, the continuous typos and grammatical errors really are distracting and disappointing. \\"Diety\\" instead of \\"deity,\\" for example, and \\"afriad\\" instead of \\"afraid.\\" Absolutely unforgivable!!Like I said, glad I picked it up used and gave a charity sale my money, instead of the writer or editor or publisher."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"It has occurred to me that it is a disservice to Ms. Hamilton that I have very different expectations from what is actually delivered by her recent books. The \\"Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter\\" series previously provided an action packed read with suspense, horror, bad guys and a cool preternatural crime that only Anita could solve.Unfortunately the series has now evolved into \\"Anita Blake, Cranky Sex Addict.\\" The only other type of genre I have read that weaves such a weak plot around a lot of sex is the romance novel - and there is nothing romantic about the sex in this book. The whole menage a trois scenario is getting monotonous. I was surprised to find that one scene with Jean Claude and Richard (yes, he's back) is very, very similar to a scene in her last Meredith Gentry book (except in the latter her lovers have wings - don't ask).There were moments where I saw a brief flare of the old series. However, instead of Anita trying to figure out who the killer was, I got the impression that the police calls for her assistance were more an interruption of her very busy and ridiculously complex dating life. That we find out some of the motivation and reason behind the killers' actions in a short letter at the end of the book spoke volumes of Ms. Hamilton just wanting to get the darn thing completed. \\"Incubus Dreams\\" would have better story if she had focused on telling the tale instead of resorting to this type of cheap editorial device - and perhaps trimming down the wacky sexual exploits.In fact trimming down in general would have been a good idea. Incubus Dreams gets the thud factor award - at over 650 pages it is about 200 pages too long. A good example is a scene where Anita has a heart to heart with one time best friend Ronnie, it is too long by half. There are basic editing issues where you loose track of who is speaking and can you say \\"inept repeat?\\" It is unfortunate that the publishers have shied away from editing Ms. Hamilton's work.The Anita Black Vampire Hunter series has evolved from a supernatural crime series set in an interesting alternate reality to a series about graphic sexual situations with supernatural beings. A fine distinction, but one that makes a huge difference to this long time fan."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"...for this series may have passed two and a half books back, during \\"Narcissus In Chains.\\" No one loves Anita Blake more than me, but I read NiC with growing outrage, Cerulean Sins with horror, and Incubus Dreams with a sense of extreme tedium setting in. Yet another formerly wonderful author has succumbed, apparently, to success.To object to the number/quality/repetitiveness of the sex scenes in this book is to miss the point. Our prickly vampire hunter is now bleeping everything that moves because of the ardeur, the hypertrophied sex drive that she inherited during NiC from Jean-Claude. In the venerable tradition of fantasy protagonists, Anita was already on a trajectory of gaining an ever growing and ever less believable list of powers, so maybe the author gave her the ardeur to remind us that power always comes with a downside. If so, it backfired. The ardeur has not stopped her from improbably continuing to gain powers (as a measure of the problem, near the end of IB, Anita starts to feel as if her wishes are coming true, and I wasn't sure whether she was joking or whether this was the ultimate devolution of the series into a bad joke). No, the ardeur hasn't solved anything; it has only toploaded subsequent books with extra sex/love/relationship issues, diluting and distracting from the Richard-Anita-Jean-Claude love triangle that, for me, was the most fascinating aspect of the series. Two characters who first crawled out of the woodwork in NiC and gained entry (in more than one sense) to Anita's life courtesy of the ardeur, Micah the Nimir-Raj and Nathaniel the male stripper and wannabe house husband, dominate the emotional story of IB.. Or rather, they would dominate it if they weren't made of cardboard.We know that this author CAN create complex 3D characters. So what does she see in this pair of wimps? I suspect that she is trying to give Anita what she has found in her own life: domestic happiness. Unfortunately, that's not the way Anita's world was set up -- as Anita herself repeatedly comments. I get the feeling that Anita is struggling valiantly against her author's misplaced good intentions, as well realized characters will do. Tragically, however, in IB the author seems to have crushed Anita's spirit at last. She virtually lays down the law for her in the first few pages of the book with a Tarot reading that tells her to accept Micah and Nathaniel's love. And in a book like IB, when you get a Tarot reading, you know it's infallible.Perhaps the most regrettable casualty of Anita's spiral into implausibility is her sense of ethics. She used to be a devout Christian in a world full of knotty emotional and theological problems. Now she believes in therapy, the Tarot, and having sex with whoever you need to as long as it feels good. Then again, I suppose you can believe whatever you like when you have the power to make your wishes come true."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"A plot, a plot, what happened to the plot? I used to love the Anita books but I am so tired of reading the same thing over and over again in these past few books that I could scream. I'm fine with all the sex LKH wants Anita to have, but is it possible to include a storyline as well? Jeez. I was under the impression that a book's publishing house editor was the individual who was supposed to speak frankly to an author when his or her writing got out of hand, but that is certainly not happening with the LKH books. I had so much hope for this book since the last Merry book was just dreadful. It was as if LKH just stopped writing knowing she had one more book in the series to finish. I'm not buying any more of either series. I'm going to go back to the first eight Anita books and re-read those. They are so far superior to the last five books LKH has written that it's as if a different person wrote them. The same thing happened with Patricia Cornwell's books.

This book needs an editor dreadfully.You don't like sex. Well, most of us do, just not presented in a technical sex for dummies manner.\\"There is a plot.\\" 150 pages out of almost 600(ratio of vampire slaying/police work to sexual antics/endless analyzing of emotional state) does not equal a plot to this reader.Anyway, ID is my least favorite LKH novel. I feel like she has taken one of my favorite series and made it both a platform and megaphone for pushing some sort of agenda at me. I appreciate diverse lifestyles but present them in a way that makes sense for their characters and write them well. I don't care if Anita does them three at a time. However a lot of the sex scenes devolve into a dry clinical blow by blow descriptions-with a lot of shrieking and clawing for good measure.I have heard a lot of reviewers saying Anita \\"gets things\\" in this book. I would tend to think one of those things would be a social disease except vampires and lycanthropes are luckily clean. Sorry, but what does she get besides more sex and the power of the month? I think the ardeur at this point is a cheap excuse for the author to indulge in a little erotica dabbling.Which would be fine except Anita can't stop whining about it. \\"DO I really love him? Is this right, blah, blah, blah..\\" I wanted to say shut up and sleep with him already.Anita has grown-more selfish and Mary Sue like.

Extremely popular and selling well, so she decides she doesn't need an editor.Wrong! I lost track of the typos - sometimes three separate spellings of the same word on the same page. Is this minor? Yes, but it shows that not much care was taken with the manuscript - even down to using a spellchecker. Other people have mentioned the gaping plot threads; again, a good editor with the power to make suggestions can help resolve this.Much of the omni-present sex seems pointless.

Hamilton reads, now and forever. Period. She's a magnificent author, and I generally adore her characters.First, the not-so-fabulous.Let me first make a heartfelt plea to Mrs. Hamilton. Please, honey, for the love of God, PLEASE smack your editor. The sheer multitude of grammatical errors (hello run-on sentences!) is enough to make someone crazy! Writing as fabulous and awesome as yours should not have anything like this to detract from it! (Edit: Just read \\"Mistral's Kiss\\", and it was beautifully edited.)Second, the less-than-perfect.*SPOILERS*1.Why is AB in the midst of another triumvirate when the primary one has yet to \\"work\\" correctly?

No, really. Anything that has Anita knocking boots with a character we (the readers) meet 5 minutes beforehand is a BIT much. (Edit: Aw, now.. I was a bit rash. Anita's slowly beginning to control it, and let's just say there's a learning curve)3.Ronnie. What does she add to this book? She's cheez whiz, for pete's sake! Mildly interesting, but just not filling. (Edit: Mine is not to question why - though I don't like Ronnie, she plays an important role in a later book, and I see why she needs to continue to be in Anita's life. Touche!)4.Richard, wake up and smell the fresh deer meat. Enough with the angst, already. Move to Milwaukee and make a home with a roaming pack of wild chihuahuas, or deal with it.

I still want him to lose the angst, but he has a place in the story that wouldn't be easily filled by anyone else.)5.Anita went from NO Nathaniel to FURRY Nathaniel? Huh? (Edit: OK, I have to admit, this really freaked me out - but - y'know it had to happen eventually, with all the adeur and fur flyin' around.)6.Where was Asher? She fooled around with Byron, Damien, Jean Claude, Micah, Richard, Nathaniel, Jason and Requiem, but no Asher? After the lengths the last novel went to to see Asher included in her \\"list\\", why is he conspicuously absent? (Edit: He's not gone! He was just, er.. relaxing..during this book.)7.Where is the Mother of All Darkness? (Edit: WTH was I thinking? She's around, just not in this book! Keep reading the series!)8.Where was Cherry? Zane? Stephen? Caleb? Not integral to the plot, but it seemed like they were very close to her at one time.

Rare were the descriptions of guns, knives, or other sundry toys of destruction. Is AB getting soft? (Edit: Anita. Soft. I must have been drinking when I wrote that.)13.The cervix conversation. Can we just not say that anymore? (Edit: So sorry, but this still holds true. It's honestly the one part in these books that makes me squint and squirm, hehe.)The fan-damn-tastic.1.Anita and Nathaniel. Not the furry-frisky bit, but rather her showing genuine affection for him without having to over-freaking-analyze every nuance, touch or glance. I like this!2.The bit where she assassinated the guy was great, not because she shot \\"til she saw sunlight\\", but rather because it affected her so strongly afterward.3.The deeper explanations of Damien's relationship with Anita.

The attraction of Anita Blake books so far was the very clever interweaving of a detective story with the supernatural and the sexy. This one, however, is seriously lacking any real story and Laurell Hamilton probably could have written three more Anita Blake novels with the material she crammed into this one. This book transcends even the raunchiest of romance novels I ever picked up (and that one actually had a story line, believe it or not). Too bad; the 'official' first-look review promised a good book, but this did not deliver.

Those of us who have been with the series long-term, and remember when it was first and foremost a mystery series that just happened to have preternatural elements, will not love it so much.Ms Hamilton's world remains compelling, as does her writing style. However, she seems to be working very hard to outdo herself in the soft-porn category, and I am sad to say that with \\"Incubus Dreams\\" there is more porn than plot. When writing the novel, Ms Hamilton mentioned in her blog that she had passed the 900-page mark. The finished novel is merely 658 pages long, and the missing 242 pages might explain why the book ends rather abruptly. I cannot say exactly what is missing without the risk of a spoiler, but those of us who devoured the case-driven earlier novels will be left wondering what happened.All of the sex reminds me of the problems Ms Hamilton has professed to having in keeping her Anita Blake world separate from her Merry Gentry world. If I want kinky and inventive sex with characters added just for the purpose of giving the heroine someone to screw, I'll grab a Merry Gentry book. From Anita, what I want is casework and maybe new and inventive weapons. LKH can shorten her burden in writing the next Merry Gentry novel by merely lifting the sex scenes from this one--and they make up about 70% of the novel, it seems--and plunking them down wholesale into her current manuscript. They would be much more at home there.And I thoroughly agree with the complaints about the obvious lack of copyediting. From her website (www.laurellkhamilton.org) I know that the publication of the book had to be pushed back because of missed deadlines, and it is sadly obvious that the book was rushed into publication. There is an overly liberal use of commas, poor spelling, and a few cases of a completely wrong word being used (\\"wretch\\" instead of \\"retch\\" for example). It is distracting to those of us who speak and write our native language properly."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The first Anita Blake Vampire Hunter novels were good fun: they offered a somewhat unique farrago of sex, violence and kinky character both living, dead and inbetween, presented in a saucy, flip tone of voice by the indomitable Ms. Blake. Unfortunately, Ms. Hamilton seems to have fallen in love with her character --or, more aptly, with her sex life-- for that is what the latest novel (Incubus Dreams) is all about. If you like long, not terribly well written or conceived sex scenes --some of them sprawl across two or three chapters-- then Dreams may be your cup of tea. But if you seek a well developed plot or lively and convincing action scenes, you'd best look elsewhere.

Anita became like a friend and I simply had to know what the author had in store for her, hence I used to pick up the next book as soon as I get to the last page of the previous one. Sadly, this series also proves that all good things must come to an end as we see in the decline of the quality of Hamilton's writing after OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY.When I write reviews, I do like to summarize the plot. However after reading INCUBUS DREAMS, I was stuck trying to figure out how to begin my review. The problem is that this book has no plot, even though the back cover may suggest otherwise. This is so far the lengthiest book in the series, but there was hardly any of the kick-as* action that I have come to love in the other books, especially the first few. Ask me what I liked about the other books and I can go on about it. Ask me what INCUBUS DREAMS is about and all I can remember is that Anita spent more time feeding the ardeur, which meant getting down and dirty with any man that was available several times a day, whether in private or in front of her numerous male friends. I am certainly no prude but the sex scenes in this book were simply gratuitous and boring. Anita has spent more time on her back and knees than killing those monsters. I miss the old Anita whose sarcasm and no-nonsense attitude I found entertaining and actually endearing. Will someone please tell Ms Hamilton to bring her back?I will not ramble on much further, but I can tell you now that MICAH is actually worse than this one.

A little romp here and there is fine and dandy, but, good grief, I can't even finish the book. She has had sex in the last 3 chapters that I have read, and I'm sick of it. Leave a little to the imagination, Laurell....Please! I think I'm done with Anita Blake and Laurell Hamilton! PS. I'd give this book less than 1 star, but they won't let me."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I like so many here have been a die hard fan since Guilty Pleasures and have \\"stuck\\" with it through all the new books despite their declining quality. This book is just another in the past 3-4 where her once great plots get lost in pages upon pages of repetitive porn. Even the vocabulary she uses to describe these \\"erotica\\" scenes is recycled. She has reduced once complex male figures into 2-dimensional (or less) adoring sex slaves or sulky child figures.Her main character Anita Blake has gone from a commanding/feisty \\"do it herself\\" woman to an over-sexed drama queen. Hamilton really seems to be dragging Anita down in more than plot, but in character depth as well. Realllly disappointing.I don't think I will anymore of her novels since they are now more inept erotica rather than fun detective fiction. When in an almost 700 page book only about 100-150 pages actually involve a recognizable plot you know you have entered the erotica/romance zone."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have reread this series several times. Yet I have not been able to bring myself to reread Incubus Dreams. I enjoy many of the characters that are not as beloved by many other fans, but even Nathaniel, who is my favorite and is given much page time, is shorted. His story is slopped down without seeming thought as to how this newest development heightens or helps the main character within LKH's world.The book seems like it is a neverending rough draft. I am a reader who skims over spelling errors most of the time, yet this book did not allow you to miss all of the spelling and grammar indiscretions. Maybe this should be packaged as an adult grammar manual? It would keep the reader's interest most of the time, and if you were becoming bored with the story, you could stop and work some sentences to find the errors.I am a literature reader most of the time. This series was my guilty pleasure, but alas, all good things come to an end. I guess this was Ms. Hamilton's way of helping me return to my studies."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"AS much as I love Anita and all her faults I was deeply heart broken by this book. I have loved every word LKH has put to page up until this book. When I stumbled upon the Anita Blake series I was so pleasantly surprised that I read the first 9 books in seven days, that's how much I loved the series. If asked what my favorite book is, hands down, I always answer Obsidian Butterfly. I have reread this book so many times I am going to have to go out and buy yet another copy. Keeping this in mind it really does break my heart to say that many of the things I love about the previous Anita books is missing from this new book. Anita is this amazing, strong, independent, and smart character who writes her own destiny despite all obstacles the universe places in front of her. I wish I could be like her. Its why I was draw to the books. Obsidian Butterfly is the best book in the series because you get to see Anita at her strongest with out all the weird relationship stuff, that while interesting is not the point. The point, or at least what I thought was the point, is a series of books that tell the story, the development of a women despite all the crap life throws at her. This new book is about SEX. I was looking forward to because of the way the last book ended. I thought for sure Belle Morte would be in this book, but alas no. This book makes little sense and has no real point. No one grows, moves forward, and you don't learn anything. IF YOU HAVE NEVER READ AN ANITA BLAKE BOOK DO NOT START WITH THIS ONE. I hate to say it but I will read the next one when it comes out, but if LKH and her publishing house say true to form it will be a year or more and just when ya think you are gona get to buy the new book, they will change the publication date."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was very much anticipating the next book after Cerulean Sins. I couldn't wait to see the conclusions of the story lines left hanging. I was sad to see that none of them were addressed in this book. Don't get me wrong, I like the sex scenes in all her books, but this one seemed to focus on only sex with a murder as a kind of afterthought. I loved the whole series until this one. The reason I loved the series was for the characters you came to know & love, Anita's jobs and the mystery. This book is sadly lacking in those areas."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"When I bought this book, I knew there would be sex. Why? Because the previous books have made it clear that is where this is going. Anita went from being a woman who believed sex should be special to someone who has sex with whatever male is at hand. It's been building up over the last few books, so this wasn't a surprise. A disappointment? Yes. But I certainly knew sex would happen. Often. And it does. My main problem with all the sex is that after the first few scenes it starts to feel repetitive and boring.As for the plot? When the book ended I felt like I'd been cheated. Or that maybe a chapter or two went missing. Otherwise, it looks like Anita got more powers on top of the megapowers she already had. Is there no end to her powers? A few new characters were introduced. And every male in a ten mile radius wanted Anita, or rather make that every non-human male wanted her. The human males gave her a rough time and underestimated her. One thing I'd like to see is a beautiful, wonderful male look at Anita and say \\"no\\".I'm not sure where this series is heading, but I'll probably still be reading. I miss the days of when Anita's sex life was more of a subplot and not the main plot. I guess I keep hoping for a return to that."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams is a very long book. If it were as exciting and suspenseful as some earlier books in the Anita Blake series, that would be a big plus. How often with those earlier books did we readers feel disappointed when we reached the end and knew we had to wait for the next book to be published? But with Incubus Dreams, I had to struggle to force myself to finish it. I kept putting it down when I got mad or bored or disgusted about the writing, and even with forcing myself and skimming over some of the worst parts, it still took me 2 weeks to finally get to the end. I did not enjoy most of it, and some of it I disliked intensely.I enjoy reading about erotic, passionate sex and am not put off by graphic details per se. But what draws me in is emotional connections between the characters and skillful writing. Sex is not always sexy, if you know what I mean. If sex scenes are poorly written, with minimal emotion, with characters not acting consistently with their history and personalities, with an evident delight in shock value just to shock, it's not erotic and it's not fun to read. There's very little passion or erotic suspense in Incubus Dreams. Instead, the author gives us, over and over and over, panting descriptions of \\"writhing\\" and \\"spilling\\" and \\"clawing\\" and so on. It's phony, like a woman faking an orgasm to try to make her partner think she's hot.There is also almost no story line in this book, and what character \\"development\\" there is, is in the wrong direction in my opinion. As for the sex scenes, for those with a series of near-strangers, the lack of emotion was understandable. But there was just as lilttle emotion in the scenes with the people the heroine says she \\"loves.\\" It all felt shallow and sordid to me, like there wasn't any heart in it. That's quite different from the sense in the earlier books, where Anita had fewer metaphysical powers but far more true passion in all senses of the word.I do recommend the newer Merry Gentry series from this author. So far (3 books) it is amazingly imaginative, well-written, and engrossing."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"That must be what she was thinking when she wrote this one. Come on Laurell, its getting old. Can't you give us a little story with our smut? I read the first book about four years ago and was immediately hooked by the plot and the kick ass attitude of Anita. Now I am particularly tired of a few things:1. The whole I am so short because I'm 5'3\\". Look, I am 5'3\\" and its not that short. I can reach most things on the shelf. Oh, and my boyfriend is 6'6\\" and its not that hard to kiss him. So, get over how hard it is to kiss Richard (and other things) because he is 6'1\\".2. The whole, I am conflicted w/my family. We have never even seen Anita's family. If they are so conflicted, bring them to town sometime and lets have a good old fashioned family fight.3. Next the \\"oh no I can't possibly have sex with you\\" and them BAM! Lets just do every male vamp in the place. Come on. There was way too much smut in this one. At least Merry in the Fairy books doesn't pretend to be a prude.Getting short on plot? Hey how about a prequel? Write the whole story of Jean Claude, Asher, and Julia. Or write Damian's story. Or even the story of Vern and his clan before Richard came to town.I pre-ordered this book, I was very disappointed. I think I will wait and buy the next one at the used book store, if at all."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"All good books are alike....each terrible book is terrible in its own way.For instance....Cerulean Sins and Incubus Dreams.LKH seems to have abandoned the few things that were right with Cerulean Sins (shudder shudder), such as Anita finally coming up against a pair of monsters it would be a real challenge for her to defeat (Belle Morte and the Mother of All Darkness). As her powers grew, it's been so long since we've seen a real battle where we think she might actually get her ass handed to her that the weakly plotted 'metaphysical battles' that were supposed to be the focus of each book have left us unmoved. Another thing that was great about Cerulean Sins (Asher, Jean-Claude and Anita finally getting together) is also missing entirely from Incubus Dreams.Instead, she continued with things that have been making us ill for the past couple of books already (Ronnie's prudish anti-vampire attitude, plot threads being dropped left and right, Anita's constant whining about Richard, Anita sleeping with everything that will hold still long enough all the while protesting that she doesn't want to do it, Jean-Claude completely losing his edge, Micah-who was not really that interesting to begin with-turning into a complete and utter pansy who believes Anita can do no wrong). There should be a warning label on these books - Abandon All Hope Of Plot Continuity, Ye Who Enter Here.Admittedly, Incubus Dreams had its high points. The fact that Jason and Nathaniel, the two youngest characters, are the most adult, is something I find particularly amusing, although the other characters (RICHARD!) should be taking a hint from this-they are acting like children.An attempt (albeit a bad one) was made to give Micah some interest when some of the Chimera backstory was explained. While I appreciated the explaination-the whole thing at the end of Narcissus kind of happened a little fast for me-and the fact that Micah apparently wasn't always this perfect, I have to wonder why, yet again, this character was even introduced.I think the developing relationship between Nathaniel and Anita was the most interesting part of Incubus Dreams. Not only did Nathaniel actually get cupboard-slamming-mad at Anita (about time!) but I consider the kitchen scene where Richard was being his usual repressed, angry, whiny self while Nathaniel was making biscuits my favorite out of the whole book (not that there was a lot to choose from). The fact that Anita told Nathaniel she loved him by throwing it at Richard like an insult is vintage Anita, emotionally uncomfortable and angry instead of lusty (you know, the one we once knew and loved). And Nathaniel's reply...well, I had to put the book down, I was laughing so hard.But...The Vittorio storyline was a waste of time, and the conclusion to that left me royally P.O'd...you just know, despite what Anita said, we aren't going to hear word one about Vittorio again.Zerbrowski is slowly turning into Dolph (who seems to have disappeared entirely) instead of continuing to evolve in his own direction. A pity, since he was the only cop character I actually liked.Asher has also vanished into thin air-we hear nothing FROM him and very little about him-and the loss of my favorite character (Nathaniel is number 2, Richard and his poor-me mood swings are dead last) has not improved my opinion of this book.Speaking of Richard, why is he back? Why is Anita going to sleep with him again? Dear God, WHY? Get this man-ho out of the city!!! Or at the very least, out of Anita's life! LKH has made her point (again and again and again). Richard hates his beast. He hates what it makes him do. He hates what he wants to do in bed. He hates being a werewolf. He's frighteningly homophobic and repressed and prudish. He hates himself too much to ever love anyone else. WE GET IT, OKAY? Move on.Let's see, what else did I hate...oh yeah...Requiem and Byron and Wicked and Truth. Why does Anita need MORE men? She doesn't want to have to sleep with the ones she has!And the editing (as mentioned in previous reviews) is degrading book-by-book. In over six hundred pages, a few errors are unavoidable, but my little sister could have done a better editing job.Also, I did not appreciate LKH's attempts to justify the sexcapades in her last few books with Jean-Claude's comments that 'the powers of their line run to sex, and they cannot battle with that which they do not have,' or whatever. Useless.And last but not least, what's with Jessica Arnet? If she could cause Anita some trouble that's actually NOT sex-related (what a concept!), I'm all for it, but if she's just going to be one more whiner, she should go off with Richard to Tennessee, and I hope they're very happy together and never, ever come back.Some suggestions for the next book (LKH, if you're out there, please take these to heart):More Asher.Less Richard (none would be even better. Maybe be could be hit by a car while in wolf form and killed. Please?).Ditch the faceless new men.A RPIT mystery that actually strains Anita's brain or talents (instead of, oh, say, her crotch?).Let's hear from Mommy Dearest and Belle Morte. That storyline had some potential. The potential to help rescue the series, even.You're obviously not going to get rid of Micah, but maybe he could have some human failings? Ya think?Some plot continuity. For example...those plastic surgeons Anita suggested Asher see? About his scars? What happened with that? The doctors were hopeful. That's all we were told.And where's Edward? Remember Edward? The one man Anita DOESN'T want to sleep with? Where'd he go?Continue with the Nathaniel thing. The fact that they were actually in love before they had intercourse is a promising sign.Let's see Jean-Claude do something at least slightly power-hungry and conscienceless. It's been so long. I miss it. We all miss it. He is, after all, a vampire. Let him be BAD.Get an editor who didn't learn their craft on I-Can-Read books.And yet...I know I will read the next Anita Blake book. I might even buy it (in paperback, this time). It's like fast-food french fries. You know they're not as good as you remember, and they're probably going to make you sick. But you want them. You can't resist, you must have them. And even when they're terrible, somehow they're still worth eating (or reading).And as an end note, to cleanse the mental palate of the increasingly sour taste of the Anitaverse, some books you could try that aren't just about sex (they actually have a plot, what a concept!):Charlaine Harris 'Dead Until Dark'Freda Warrington 'A Taste of Blood Wine'Mary-Janice Davidson 'Undead and Unwed'P. N. Elrod 'Cold Streets' (a great stand-alone book but also the latest in a fantastic vampire series)"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The actual story takes up about 5 pages of this book.

Time to move this series to the porn category and forget that there is supposed to be a story that goes along with it."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I love LKH's Anita Blake Series but this one dissapointed me. In this book Anita instead of find out who or what commited the crime/murder and why? She focus more into who she will do and how? There is a lot of pages for a story which span is like 2 to 4 days and also how she wrap it all up on the last chapters is dissapointing.

And I love eros as much as the next person, when I got Incubus Dreams a 30 disk cd set, by disk 16 there were three descriptions of the Anita Blake I grew to love, the rest of it was Anita as sex object, I undertand the integral part her powers have in the novels, however I got it the first time, I didn't need to hear it over and over and over and over....get the drift???? When I want sexy, I get sexy, same for adult themes, I wanted Anita Blake Vampire Hunter, what I got was Anita Blake S**T, which if made into an adult movie and advertised as such I would purchase, Laurel Hamilton is still an excellent author, just package the novels honestly, and beleive me I am no prude."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Not that I don't mind some porn in books with a PLOT...I've enjoyed reading Hamilton's books for a look at a world where our \\"normal\\" world has had to make accomodation for the supernatural one. I've always enjoyed that in two or three pages, Hamilton's characters were off, non-stop, for several hundred pages.In THIS book, 106 pages and the only thing that happened is Anita goning on.. and on .. and on.. and on .. and on .. and on .. about how she can't enjoy any happiness in her life. Well, Anita, I really don't care about how you screw up your life. That's not why I read the books. Maybe you'll get it all straightened out - and something will actually happen - on page 107, but I'll never know. The book is in the give-away box.I remember I was not too satisfied with Hamilton's latest Merry Gentry book, either. I guess from now on, I'll have to read the reviews on any new Hamilton books, rather than just buy them based on her past books that I have enjoyed.This book reminds me of the one and only Anne Rice book I managed to wade through - lot of agonizing over the character's weird life - what shall I do, what shall I do? - with nothing much else happening."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Strangely, I have found the other reviews of some comfort. I know that I am not weeping alone. I, too, was hooked on the Anita Blake Series after reading Guilty Pleasures and no matter how much I hated Richard, I enjoyed the books. This book, however, was congested with pointless intercourse,endless rehashing of past plot lines,and missing a few familiar faces (where was Asher, Raphael, Stephen, etc?). Anita is now having sex with characters that we have never even heard of! Plus, we never even see the killer (who gets away). I would call the master serial killer a villain, but his crimes were the only thing giving this story two stars. Yet there are only two chapters in the first half of the book that are even devoted to the mystery. Anita is no longer even true to herself, she is a devoted Christian yet she is letting a tarot reading influence her life decisions. I was looking forward to learning about the Dark Mother of the Vampires that was introduced in Cerulean Sins. Where is she? Unless, there is more development concerning the problems with the Church of Eternal life, one can skip this book and not have a noticable hole in their Anita Blake collection."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The earlier Anita Blake books always had a lot of sex, but also a plot. The last two, Cerulean Sins and Incubus Dreams, have almost no plot. I never thought you could have too much sex, but that is all that Anita does now. There is a vampire serial cult killing strippers in this book, but that seems more an incidental happening rather than the purpose of the book. Sex is great, but I enjoyed the earlier plots much more. I probably won't buy her future books, just borrow them from the library."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I fell in love with the Anita Blake series after reading Guilty Pleasures, but was disappointed in this latest addition to the series. It is still a good book, but it got too wordy and some scenes just would not end. I prefer the books were the action was fast paced and the personal touches about the characters blended with the stories. This one felt like the action/mystery was just thrown in as an after thought to all of the emotional issues that the main characters were dealing with. I still recommend this series, but I hope that the next installment will be more in the style of the earlier books."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Like most readers, I've been waiting for Ms. Hamilton to return to the days when there was such a thing as a plot in one of her books. Waiting oh so patiently because of how hooked I'd become despite my earlier determination to hate her poor writing style.The only reason I looked forward to this book was because I was tricked into thinking we'd get more on Nathaniel--a character I find completely endearing. The parts that did feature Nathaniel were disappointing as hell. All this build-up, then Anita shags him and right away (literally) he's filed away with all the other guys Anita gets it on with and that leads into another mundane sex scene with two other characters. Not very appealing.And speaking of not appealing...my guess is that most readers of this series are women. Why would LKH feel the need to go into detail during the \\"rain-making\\" session with Nathaniel as well other aspects of sex no one needs emphasized even in erotic stories. C'mon, this is fiction. Why would any good writer emphasize those gross details? I felt like my face was being shoved into her...stuff. I wasn't thinking \\"Wow, that's hot!\\". I was thinking \\"Wow, that's TMI...but thanks for sharing, I guess...(gag!)\\"It's like she keeps trying to \\"up\\" the erotica facter by becoming more and more graphic each time, making each encounter supposedly bigger than the last. Really the only thing bigger than the last is the size of her lovers' genitals. Each guy seems to wow her with his size until the next guy comes along with a bigger toy. Get real, lady... There's fantasy and then there's just plain ridiculous.There are so many new characters randomly thrown in the mix that the interesting ones get pushed to the sidelines too often. I'm not the only one who's tired of all the talking where there should be action. They converse WAY too much. I feel that the author keeps starting things that she's either unable or too unmotivated to finish in the last couple of books before this.Y'know, just because you have a big fan base doesn't mean that you don't have to try as hard. It also doesn't mean you'll always have all of those fans. There's always going to be another writer who's better.I'm just glad I borrowed all of her books from a friend. I didn't waste a cent and from now on, I won't be wasting any of my time either."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The Anita Blake series was recommended to me, and I've been plowing through the increasingly awful books. Blue Moon was OK, the rest are repetitive and overdependent on descriptions of her guns, knives, eye color, hair length, and clothing. But this one is the limit, a wannabe porn joke. I keep trying to figure out WHAT the author was thinking. Did she think this would be funny, watching the character add more and more partners, in sillier and sillier sex scenes? It really is just pathetic; The Executioner, a slave to her powers and her libido, screwing anything and everyone that moves, in any way possible, because if she doesn't her minions will die. Oh puhleaze. Not funny, not sexy, not thrilling, not interesting, not worth checking out of the library, much less paying actual money for this book. Amazing that so much sex could be so very very boring."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This is no longer a fantasy series, it's not even titilating enough to be termed erotica, it's just one meaningless sex scene after another strung together very loosely by plot. It's not even porn, because it 'tries' to be a novel. Sad, especially sad because bringing this book out in hardcover and paper editions is a huge waste of trees. I don't say that about many books.I suppose \\"Incubus Dreams\\" is better than the 'talking head' relationship angst we suffered through in \\"Cerulean Sins\\". At least, something happened, although LKH seems to have forgotten all the plot points she laid out in that previous novel. I'm honestly tired of little else but the wild thing going on in LKH's novels. That's not what I read fantasy for. I have an erotica collection for when I want strictly bedroom olympics.As far as Anita sleeping with anything around being 'character development', I don't think so. Characters have a set of core values that generally don't change. If you read the first of the Anita Blake novels, Anita didn't approve of indiscriminant sex and she didn't approve of vampire lovers, either. Certainly Jean Claude could have changed her mind on the latter, but I'm not so sure the former would change. Some of you might have thought her a 'goody two shoes' on both respects, but I long for the days when a tough Anita said,\\"I don't sleep with vampires, I kill them.\\"I also miss the books being FUNNY. I don't smile anymore when I read this dreck.Cynthia Ward (Amazon Reviewer above) gave a pretty good analysis of the content of this novel. I'm going to add that the angst feels more like filler (is she paid by the word or what) and the sex in a lot of cases is pretty empty and boring. Suspect Laurell is losing interest and doing as much as she can to fill in, thinking the readers will be merely interested in the sex.Sorry, this reader's lost interest.Kept reading the Anita Blake novels because I cared about Anita and the characters. No longer. I'm even getting rid of the first of the series. It's a pity. The original Anita Blake series was witty, compelling and fun. I think Laurell K. Hamilton got lost somewhere in the writing."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"In TV terms, this is called \\"Jumping the Shark\\".

Its a real pity."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I liked Anita Blake in the first several books because of the religious and personal conflicts. The slightly growing powers she was developing against the alternate world background really was wonderful; coupled with her very human conflicts, that was what made her relative to ME, as a human, as a woman, as a reader. It's pretty insulting as a woman to read something that implies that the more power a woman develops, the more lustful and let's face it, the more like a nymphomaniac she becomes, losing all sense of self. It's very possible for a female to be powerful and remain human and herself, all at the same time.This latest book is not rooted in any basis of fact that is necessary to all fiction. As far as I can tell, it's not rooted at all. The plant is dead. It's dead, Jim, it's dead. Drive a stake through its heart and see if it will revive later with some sense of its old wonderful self, because this ain't it. Where is the Anita Blake who had superhuman powers but was human at heart and soul? who struggled within herself against her religious background (boy, don't a lot of us even in this day and age?); her lack of height; her role as a small female amidst males with power, with her own powers slowly growing? She doesn't have friendships any more. She has sex partners. She uses people, literally. Are there no sexual diseases even on this alternate world? Is there not anything in this world of Blake any more that relates in any way at all to our own? because it doesn't seem like it to me. It is also rather offensive as a woman to read about a female who had some real power in her soul and in her ethics, to give it all up and run from sex to sex. It's more like a chatroom hot breathing session than a novel. And let's introduce Hamilton to a book by a woman named Lynne Truss: Eats, Shoots and Leaves. Highly recommended. Will eliminate all sorts of misuse of commas, overabundance of commas, lack of commas, confusion, chaos, and general mayhem in between the panting and pulsing and beasts mingling with other beasts that are apparently trying to procreate faster than bunny rabbits based on the amount of sex, panting, and in keeping with the book's repetitious nature, panting.There IS supposedly a mystery plot in this book. Somewhere. I think that's the mystery. \\"Where's the plot? That's the real mystery!\\" This little paragraph is about in proportion to the actual amount of wordage used in the book regarding the, ahem, plot.A plea to Ms. Hamilton: You are a good writer. Please. Go back to the first few books. Go back to the old Anita Blake. Go back to what made this series so great. Notice I'm using past tense here. Get rid of about 453 males in Anita's life, pare it down, way down, waaaay way down, thank you. Go by the old maxim that less really IS more. Throw in a plot. Remember that a \\"climax\\" isn't necessarily linked to said female heroine having sex but is instead related to the literary basis of plot, climax, anti-climax, that sort of thing. Go back to being a writer.This was horrendous. When I can't even stay focused on the book due to the number of typos and misspellings and repetitious phrases, or because I'm apparently flipping through the Kama Sutra trying to find out where IS the mystery and what DID happen to the body and what IS going on here other than one orgy after another, it's time to let go of a series and an author.Until I hear otherwise by trusted reviewers, I'm sorry, but this was the last book I'm reading by Hamilton."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This volume of the Anita Blake series only proves that LKH can and will do what she wants with the series as long as sales are up. I find it hard to believe that any author who truly adored their characters could find doing this to your own characters that you have nurtured okay.Incubus Dreams is the stuff of legend. It is a book that should be on the worst lists. Problem is fans abound to ego stroke an author who although extraordinarily talented has decided the only way to alienate fans in to totally demolish the character they've grown to love.Pardom my candor, but Incubus Dreams was an absolute joke. This book should never have passed the pre-publishing aspect of novels. The repetitive nature of the story with the mindless sex, typos and the lovely phrases being used over and over(Spilling, screaming, etc). And LOVE there is so much love Anita has for everyone.Sorry call me crazy but it seemed like everyone in this book took ecstasy. Everyone was having sex with Anita and no one complained about it. Every man in this book lives, breathes and dies for Anita. Those that Anita hadn't had sex with before and some new guys thrown in for good measure get to experience \\"ANITA THE WOMAN TO BEAT ALL WOMEN\\". This story is bases strictly on the ARDUER and feeding it at every given moment need to go find out who the killer is, can't the ARDUER needs to be fed. Emotional getting to know you moment interupted by the ARDUER needing to be fed.What I find amazing is that other than on Amazon and a few other online retailers that I won't mention I have failed to find one MAJOR review of this book that doesn't continue to stroke LKH's ego of how great and wonderful the books are.Don't get me wrong Anita Blake is an incredible creation of LKH and she writes beyond my expectation most of the time. I understand writers block/deadlines/etc. But what I don't understand it that this is the 3rd book to continue in the downward spiral with everyone praising them.Has everyone gotten frightened to admit that some of the things going on aren't Anita growing they are simply things she'd never do. She had character and it was stolen and replaced.Richard became the bad guy because he still wanted to have a normal life (okay it was asking a lot when he's a werewolf and he's a bit of a whiner), but why did absolutely all of the morality have to leave the series.Jean-Claude once strong/seductive/deadly and even the voice of reason at times has been taken over by a pod version of himself that stands in the background as just another \\"YES\\" man. Every guy in this book has become submissive. I do not consider a moment in the sack playing dominate a dominate male. Every time a guy ends up in some type of sexual situation with Anita they suddenly lose their voice.The sexuality of Incubus dreams wasn't even erotic. I know I am not the only one who scanned over some of it.Knowing what I paid for this book and just imagining what LKH makes from this series. It seems as if she too is receiving similar treatment by the look of this book. Can someone please stand up and say, yes, you are a great writer, but this book is horrible and fix it?Although LKH wrote the book I pass a lot of the blame to the agents/publishers/etc who saw this book as it is and said \\"Looks great PRINT IT\\".I hope that Incubus Dreams isn't what we have to look forward to in Anita's universe and hope that Jean-Claude wakes from his fog and begins speaking his mind again. Although Asher did in CS and he wasn't in Incubus Dreams.If LKH wants to write a pure porn Anita Blake book I have no problem with it she's got the talent that could make it work. Incubus Dreams wasn't a showcase for that talent at all. But it does come across as Porn and not even good porn.For better Anita Blake books try the earlier ones. For better erotic scenes also see the earlier versions."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I like many of Hamilton's fans waited with bated breath for the release of her new book. I was thrilled when I found a store that put it out early when I was on vacation. Now I wish I had saved my money and bought it at my local used book store.On the front cover it clearly states that this is the next book in the Anita Blake VAMPIRE HUNTER series and that small text is the only way you would know it. It reads more like Anita Blake super skank. I have never had any problem with the sex scenes in any of the anita books before. They were mixed in at a nice rate making the book wonderful, but in Incubus Dreams all she does is have sex. Constantly. In 600+ pages there are only TWO scenes where she fights vampires. In such a large book you would think there would be room for something else.I am so disappointed that I spent so much money on this book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton's protagonist, Federal Marshal Anita Blake, used to be a tough, shoot-first-ask-questions-later type of woman who knew her guns, knives, and martial arts and who also just happened to rank very high on the supernatural-gifts scale. By the 10th book in the series (Narcissus in Chains), both the good and bad guys either admired or feared her, often both at the same time. Even though her authority was frequently challenged within the boy's club of law enforcement, grudging respect was always given by even the most chauvinistic and/or misogynistic of men. All in all, she was a force to be reckoned with and she did it with her gifts of necromancy, her intelligence and resourcefulness, her physical fighting skills, and let's be honest, the ever increasing ease with which she would shoot-to-kill. Alas, beginning with Cerulean Sins and now appearing in full-bloom in Incubus Dreams, Anita Blake has changed from an almost god-like destroyer of evil to an, at times, barely coherent and quite frankly rather pathetic sex-obsessed individual. Now, instead of using threats of pain or death to get information out of an uncooperative killer, Anita kisses and caresses him to suck the answers out of his mind. And she does this in full view of other policemen (!) not to mention hundreds of bystanders. Part of the enjoyment of the Anita Blake series for me, was that here was a women who, even before she gained powers through her ties with vampires and werewolves, was able to train her mind and body to equal and often surpass her male counterparts. Anita was strong and tough and awesome. Now, Ms. Hamilton has turned Anita into some male-fantasy nymphomaniac whose main power stems from and is completely controlled by sex. How very sad. Not to mention boring. I would say that the actual storyline of this 658-page novel perhaps includes 70 pages, and those pages appear almost entirely at the end of the book. The rest of the text is one tedious sexual encounter after another. Hey, I normally enjoy reading about a strong, sexually active, multi-partnered woman, but give me a break here; Anita is almost constantly involved in some sex act with some random male character all the time. Another point about the text itself, Ms. Hamilton's writing has always been a bit repetitive, but as the series progressed this flaw seemed less obvious; it is now back in full force, there are actually a few instances where the same phrase is repeated on the same page!For those of you who enjoy their female leads covered in less bodily fluids, there are, thankfully, plenty of other writers whose heroines have never been in a position where their ability to solve the case was undermined by the fact that their underwear was ripped off during a quickie and their mini skirt barely covered them up: Charlaine Harris, Tanya Huff, Kelley Armstrong, and Kim Harrison, just to name a few."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book was...oh, my. So, so terrible that I am torn between crying and screaming everytime I see it. Laurell K Hamilton had this wonderful series, filled with interesting characters and plot, and took a big, steaming dump on it. Do you remember the Mother of All Darkness? Yes? Well, apparently Hamilton has had some sort of amnesiac episode because it wasnt. Mentioned. Once. ONCE! How is it possible to leave such a dangling thread and not even DISCUSS it? Plus there is the fact that she totally destroyed all the characters. Anita came off as a whiny, lets-talk-about-our-feelings girl who turned around and had sex with random people. This includes two characters who have NEVER been mentioned before! Not to mention the fact that the usual boys (Jean-Claude, Richard, etc) barely had any function in the story except to be in sex scenes. I understand the ardeur; in fact, I thought it was a nice plot twist, until Hamilton decided to use it for random sex-capades. There are barely any fight scenes in the whole book; I believe it was about three, maybe four. So to sum up, this book sucked. It is the biggest literary disapointment I think I've ever had. Will I buy the other books? Yes, because some part of me hopes that Hamilton will, I dunno, remember how to write."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"My problem with the series since Narcissus is the characters have changed personalities so drasticly some of them are unrecognizable. The main thing that hit me during this book was the fact that Anita can still find a way to whine and moan about her holding on to her morality after she has had sex with almost every male character in the book.Its not erotic, its annoying! The \\"need\\" has turned her into a whore. I mean hey if thats what she has to do now fine, I dont mind but she shouldnt be whining about it either. I mean after you sleep with like what 8 guys in one day how in the world can you still be moralizing page after page and whining about oh im not sure I can do this...blah. The \\"need\\" is a huge mistake in the series, everytime a guy walks by her and even winks here go the clothes and shes gotta hop on them. People have sex, some people like to have multiple parterns that is FINE to each his own, but for god sakes it is annoying and tedious to have to read the same moralizing she used when she was a born again virgin back in the first book of the series, when now she is a completely different person that can hump every male character in sight just for business purposes.I enjoyed the series and I still have faith that things can turn around. The foundation of a good supernatural universe is still there, but there are things that MUST change for the series to keep my interest any longer."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Many pages. Many sex scenes. Teeny weeny plot. Laurell K. Hamilton stumbles further into the depths of Hades with \\"Incubus Dreams,\\" a dreary erotic horror-fantasy thriller... or is it, thrilling horror-fantasy erotica? Probably the latter -- the most colorful thing about it is Hamilton's insistently graphic sex scenes. Squeezed between the bouts of sex is a tepid little plot, which seems to be suffocating under pressure.Anita Blake's life hasn't been the same since she acquired the \\"ardeur,\\" which basically requires her to have sex constantly. Now she's coming to terms with the fact that she has a male harem, and quite an assortment of new powers. However, her old job still exists -- strippers are being mysteriously drained of blood.To make things worse, the St. Louis police department is getting suspicious of Anita's increasingly supernatural connections -- she's getting too chummy with the werecreatures and vampires. So (between random sex scenes), Anita calls on help to find whoever has murdered the strippers.There's a lot of sex in this book. A LOT of sex. So much that the actual plotline can be covered in a mere twenty minutes, if you skip the sex. In fact, Hamilton's strippers-being-sucked-dry plot seems almost like it was hastily tacked between assorted sex scenes. What's worse, the tantalizing plot hints at the end of \\"Cerulean Sins\\" are left dangling.A few flickers of Hamilton's wit do show through, given Jean-Claude's acid comment about Anita having \\"accidental\\" sex. The pace is slower, and Hamilton seems to be cluing in a little on some of the things that made her past two books so unsatisfying. Unfortunately, she hasn't caught on that her graphic, weirdly un-erotic sex scenes add nothing to the book. The consummation of the triumvirate (yes, consummation) is enough to make you cringe.Anita is obviously having an identity crisis -- it's like Hamilton is trying to meld different personalities together. The result? A very weird lead character who spends most of her time being crabby and whiny. Fans of werewolf Richard may be pleased, since Hamilton seems to have lost her disgust for him, but Jean Claude spends too much time clucking. And Micah? A laughable excuse for a love interest. Who needs a personality when you can have gonads?Hamilton's latest is an improvement over the ghastly \\"Cerulean Sins,\\" but it feels as if she wants to have her cake and eat it too -- change the Blake series to erotica, yet retain her old \\"feel.\\" And certainly this time around, it isn't working."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm about 1/3 of the way through the book and I'm starting to skim. I'm bored to death with all the dialogue. There's been a murder and Anita is too busy having sex or talking about sex to get to the business of solving the crime.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS BOOK. REMEMBER TO USE YOUR PUBLIC LIBRARY!There are approximately a dozen books in this series (I no longer really care so I'm guess-timating instead of taking the time to look). The 1st 5 were good but it's been down hill from there. I wish Anita would get back to the business of raising the dead and solving crime.If it were possible, I'd give this book negative stars."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Welcome to the Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter universe, where everyone and their brother loves and worships Anita Blake, whiny protagonist extraordinaire. Vampires love her. Werewolves love her. Leopard-men love her. Some crazy character called the \\"diety\\" loves her. The only people who don't seem to love Anita Blake are a handful of human beings (and one alpha werewolf), and they're all angry, psychotic jerks, so no big loss there.Being loved unconditionally by every attractive preternatural male in St. Louis, however, doesn't seem to be enough to make Anita Blake happy. Half of the 600+ pages of Incubus Dreams are filled with descriptions of Anita's incoherent and extremely self-centered ramblings, where she whines constantly to herself about how unfair life is. The other half is made up of badly written sex scenes, in which the difference between erotica and pornography is clearly illustrated to all.The fun doesn't stop with the sex scenes and the inner blithering, though. Incubus Dreams is also crammed full of tedious, wooden conversations between Anita Blake and whichever character she's having sex or arguing with at the time. Everyone in this book (and the cast is legion) has a sob story, and the lucky reader gets to hear them all.Also saturating the book are blatant authorial manipulations, character assassinations, myriad retcons, numerous plot holes and inconsistencies, grammatical and spelling errors on almost every page, and constant repetition of the same pat phrases over and over and over again, ad nauseam.There are only two reasons to read this book: If you're in the mood for sex scenes, or if you're in the mood for over-the-top, soap-operatic melodrama. Incubus Dreams has both in spades, and you won't be disappointed. There's nothing wrong with only reading a book for the sex or the drama, and you'l probably enjoy Incubus Dreams. However, an unedited hardcover novel with a starting price of $23.95 seems a bit much if all you want is sex and melodrama. You might want to borrow this book, or wait for the paperback to come out.For anyone else who wants something other than sex or melodrama in their reading material, skip this book. You'll only be unhappy if you try it, and probably regret the time and money you wasted on this terrible book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"author i onced admired. This series has become so contrived, so cheap, that i cannot fathom wasting any more time and money on it. Ever since NIC, the Anita Blake novels have CPD (Convenient Plot Device) written all over it. Let me point out the ways:* LKH wanted to justify the once overly moral, celibate heroine having sex with every single male character in the book with the introduction the ardeur, which has overshadowed the plot with mechanical, porn-like sex.* LKH has introduced new characters like Micah and introduced several more in ID, characters that will no doubt take precedence in Anita's life over Richard and Jean-Claude. Which is why it explains that Richard is now a \\"closet sadist\\" among other appalling things and the reason why Jean-Claude went from the dark, sexy, sneaky anti-hero to a lace-wearing queen who gives advice like a French version of The Karate Kid's Mr. Miagi (sp?).* Every female character, with the possible exception of Ronnie and a few other expendable females, is a villain who is beneath Anita's overall magnificence. Anita has become such a blatant Mary Sue it's not even funny.* It seems to me that Anita garners new powers and strength whenever it is convenient for her to do so. I wonder how many more triumvirates she'll be in before this series is over. I mean, really, what's next? Will she become 100% omnipotent by book 20? We might as well start calling her The Bionic Woman.I could carry on pointing out the many CPDs in ID, but why bother? Suffice it to say that i won't buy her next book. LKH, let me know when you begin writing something a little less crappy next time."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"If you are new to the series don't bother reading since you really need to have the background from some of the other books to understand all the things that are going ontIf you are into tough women who know how to deal with violence then this won't be for you because Anita softens up and crosses alot of the lines we didn't think she would ever cross.If you enjoy Anita relationship crab and angst about sleeping with the monsters then this is the book for you.Anita books come with multiple layers, her growing magical powers, the complication of her relationships, and solving a crime, killing the bad guys and big one touch b&itch.; I have loved all the books up to NC, after the ardeur was introduces I wasn't interested.I think this book was to help kick Anita out of her comfort zone at the end of every other book everything has a pretty nice neat bow on it and in between books she has resolved some issues. In this book we are in the middle of dealing with the issue, rather than the little paragraph we get at the beginning. This is THE ANITA relationship book. One of the ways to kick out her of the comfort zone is sex the one thing Anita doesn't not have a power to fight off or can calm down to that killing calm....so it is almost used against her as a weapon till by the end of the book she has adjusted to who she is and what her life has brought her.Since it is an ANITA BLAKE Vampire Hunter Book it has to have a mysterty be solved, but after 400 pages of sex and emotional crap there wasn't much room left. She also left out alof of support charcters (Edwards does not need to be in every book no matter how much we all enjoy it)Because I like the anita charcter I will stick with it (I liked seeing another side of Nathaneil), but I won't rush out and by the hard cover again until the arduer (anita relationship angst) has taken a backseat to a real story, rather than the other way around"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Thank goodness I did not spend money on this junk!!

Wouldn't it be better if they just retired gracefully or took some time off to see if they can regain their old writing glory? Again, this is the worst AB book yet!

Blue Moon, this series started its then-lazy downward spiral which slowed somewhat in Obsidian Butterfly but then began picking up downhill speed, bobsledding toward disaster...and now it has crashed into a mountain of \\"MEH\\" in Incubus Dreams, indubitably an even bigger pile of turgid writing than its predecessor Cerulean Sins.It's a little mind-blowing to me that some folks view as \\"character growth\\" the transformation of the heroine, Anita Blake, from an allegedly strong-willed, independent slayer of creepy-crawlies into an inflatable sex doll on GHB (with all appurtenant orifices) that gets willingly passed around at all the supernatural frat boy parties. Wow, if you think THAT equates to \\"character development,\\" then maybe in Micah, Anita can pull a train and REALLY grow!! The \\"I can't control myself\\" school of \\"character growth.\\" What a pile, indeed.And, on the \\"creepy\\" front - am I the only person who finds the whole Nathaniel thing beyond twisted? Let's see if I have this right - Nathaniel plays \\"dress-up\\" (like a little child) by wearing what he thinks are grown-up things - like frilly aprons; buys pretty things for around the house (like tea sets, whatever...like a little girl playing house), and lies in bed with Anita (Mom) and Micah (Dad), having bedtime stories read to him (like a little child)...and Anita's having SEX with this character? This formerly abused character, the one the \\"former\\" Anita heard referred to as \\"the most BROKEN of us,\\" by one of Nathaniel's pack-mates? So...are we NOT supposed to \\"get\\" that this is barely-disguised paedophilia? That this is paedophilia, with the author trying to make it palatable? Sorry...if Hamilton is trying to push people's \\"comfort zone\\" with atypical sex, that's one thing - but nobody should be \\"comfortable\\" with paedophiles, period.Truth be told, there hasn't been a real page-turner book in the series since Hamilton's divorce from her first husband. I'm not sure what that really means (hmmm...one has to wonder who REALLY plotted the mysteries?), but don't blow your hard-earned bucks on this excrement. Go with Kim Harrison or Charlaine Harris, instead, to go lighter, or try other authors for vamp-erotica or so-called romance, whatever. ANYTHING but spend MONEY on this garbage, validating this author's descent into self-absorption.A word to Hamilton, about her Amazon interview - your publishers and editors aren't telling you to cut out the sex because you're a WOMAN; they're telling you to cut it out because it's CRAP. Get a CLUE."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Most of the reviewers here seem to be longstanding Laurell K. Hamilton fans. You might find my review a fresh perspective, since this is the only one of her books that I've read. I picked it up on a whim at a supermarket, thinking that, hey, something with 700+ pages ought to keep me entertained for a while. It did... but... not in the way the author intended.I've got enough odd friends not to be shocked by the polygamy, furries, BDSM, occultism, strip clubs, and so on. I'm not offended by any of it; though, I must warn the average reader, it's definitely not mainstream content. Still, even with my open-mindedness... a vampire federal marshal necromancer who everyone in the book wants to sleep with? Did Ms. Hamilton write cheesy online fan fics before this, or something? Anita seemed to aquire a couple of new titles as the book went along, but I would have preferred some *inner* character development.That was the MOST annoying thing for me. Anita -- the main freaking character! -- is completely passive (angsty waiting) rather than active (initiating, planning). She never decides; she lets others decide for her. She just kept getting pushed from scene to scene, from emergency to emergency. Saying, \\"Hey, let's rent a movie!\\" would have been beyond her capabilities in this book.In the OTHER books, this may not have been the case at all. But it was in this one.If you can't see what I'm talking about, prior readers, then please open up the book and pick any scene to see what started it. For example:- every sex scene is caused by ardeur, or a metaphysical emergency, or Anita's partners being pushy.- every time Anita gets angry, it's only because someone else is angry first.- every time there's a fight scene, someone else starts it, and Anita spends most of her time in defense.- Anita goes to work, not because she has any ambitions in that direction, but because, apparently, she has to. (I was weirded out with how she never seemed to have planned going to work... \\"Oh yeah, there's people waiting for me.\\")- several times in the book, Anita is practically paralyzed, and other characters have to take care of her: like hugging her to them to dance, or sitting her in their laps to heat her up, setting down her coffee before she spills it, and trading seats in the car so she won't pass out and get them all in a wreck.- Anita asks for help every single time there's a problem, and waits for them to solve it for her. (\\"Um, Jean-Claude??? It's me again!\\")How in the world do you write a whole book about a character with no motivation? How can every single male in the story be in love with this worthless woman, for christssake?! (Sounds like wishful thinking on the part of the author, to me.)I did read through to the end of the book. Not because it was good, but mainly to see if Anita would ever DO something... to see if she would ever even notice that she had a life, and take charge of it. Well... no.The sex? Hey, I like erotica as much as any other red-blooded woman, but there's a limit. I started praying, PRAYING that after each chapter break, I could read, \\"The next morning...\\" but no. For some reason, the author thinks I should hear which fluids go where, every single time. I started skipping the sex scenes at around page 250.I wouldn't even keep this book around for erotic purposes. It's not just sex, it's droning dialogue sex. I couldn't BELIEVE it when I ended up having to skip 100 PAGES in the scene involving Richard and Jean-Claude. At that point, I actually threw the book across the room. Crap, lady, get to the STORY already!Interested in the plot? Read till you get to Damian, let's see, about page 100, so you can find out what happens with him. The rest of it starts on Chapter 61, page 567. I'm not kidding.All in all, though, this book was wonderfully motivating, in a reverse psychology sort of way. I want to have wishes and goals, and actually DECIDE on things; I want to avoid stupid, pointless melodrama in my life; and most of all, I want to drop everything and write a better book than this, just to show how it *should* be done. I'll keep this around, for when I get to that day. =)--Ms. T."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The Wikipedia definition(s) of a Mary Sue-like character:\\"A story in which a new character is so brilliant, witty, amazing, attractive and wonderful that one (or all) of the main canon characters completely falls head over heels for.

I don't need to have it explained in explicit, graphic detail for 30 hours. Why doesn't she get it? How many times does stuff need to be explained before Anita catches on?The overall poor quality of the writing really stood out when listening to the audio version.

Richard goes into his \\"Define touch.\\" mode. Then there was some huge discussion about what touch was OK. Then we'd have a couple of seconds of foreplay, then Richard would get his knickers in a twist over some other imagined liberty and everything would stop while some other basic word had to be explained for twenty minutes.

Certainly not an original plot idea, but at least it raises our hopes that we'll get to see the feisty, smart-alecky, ass-kicking heroine from the earlier books in the series.Unfortunately, once again it's Anita Blake: Vampire Humper that answers the call instead. As we've seen since her introduction in \\"Narcissus in Chains\\", the \\"new\\" and \\"improved\\" Anita is a whiney, self-absorbed caricature of the once strong, independent woman first introduced at the beginning of the series. Thanks to the Ardeur - a corny, trite plot device introduced to conveniently circumvent Anita's previous moral standards and to clearly up the ante of sexual activity in the series - we're left with a pitiful version of Anita that just grates on the readers' nerves.If the Ardeur had been introduced a \\"parody\\" of a once interesting series, it might have been laughable. But apparently Ms Hamilton expects us to \\"swallow\\" as easily as Anita does these days. She expects us to accept with out question the concept that a character must have sex every few hours or die as a plausible and believable storyline. Get Real!Once you open the book the whole serial killer plot idea is quickly jettisoned and replaced with endless pages of relationship angst and mind numbing, repetitive boring sex. The over indulgent use of \\"purple prose\\" by Ms Hamilton reads more like a 15-year-old's masturbation manual and quickly turns the book into a bloated stinky corpse. She apparently prefers \\"filler\\" to actual plot substance these days. The current installment reads like a cross between a poorly written soap opera and a cheesy porn movie. You can almost hear the \\"tinny\\" instrumental score \\"twanging\\" away in the background as Anita and her stable of well-hung \\"pretty boy toys\\" get it on again and again. It would have been nice if the publisher had included a \\"program\\" and/or \\"scorecard\\" to keep track of the endless parade of sexual partners and practices used by Anita to feed the insatiable sexual hunger known as the Ardeur. At least it would have given the readers something to do during the tediously drawn-out and over-the-top coupling sessions.Ms Hamilton's fiction writing is reading more and more like her rambling Internet \`blog \` entries and it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two. She writes these days as if she doesn't care whether she keeps her audience or not and has allowed her writing to devolve into a self-conscious portal absent of any coherent plot, structure or other basic quality components of compelling fiction. Among her disintegrating fan base we see growing signs of reader disconnection. It begins with a default form of disconnection where readers constantly browse ahead to the next anticipated volume hoping against hope that the next book will be better. Naturally, the disconnection progresses to its final form - active disconnection where the reader throws the book against the wall and vows to never look at that authors works ever again.Alas, all good things must come to an end. Unfortunately, this particular book's end didn't come soon enough."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I've been a fan of ABVH since Guilty Pleasures. But when I read this, pre-ordered-full-priced-eagerly-awaited, I was beyond disgusted. I paid for this?The product was horribly put together, the story leaving behind the mystery and suspense and violence in favor of willful ignorance and gratuitous, poorly written sex. I'm all in favor of well written sex but when 80% of the book is sex, and the plot is MIA, I lean toward calling it erotica, except the sex wasn't sexy! It was mechanical and hard. It honestly read like a teenage boy's fantasies.I expected alot more from LKH. Not Homer mind you, but something better than what ID was.I think the misuse of sexually abused characters is in very poor taste for LKH. I also believe that she needs to find another word for \\"Spill\\" and that eveyrone on the cast needs to go to Great Clips and get a trim.Another point would be the ever bloated cast. I do not know or understand half of them now. Nor do I care if they live or die. However I do have STRONG disbelief when Anita spouts off that she loves every one of them. Especially after she's just randomly had sex with them. But of course, justification is important, if she loves them, then it's ALL OK!It also seems that Ms. Hamilton made herself a list of the lastest kink sexual practicies and made sure her characters did them. Furry? Done. Bondage? Done. Blood letting? Done. Rainmaking? Done. If there was a purpose for all this other than \\"Hey I found a new sexual trick!\\" I could understand but there wasn't. Very disappointing.I can say, with great certainty, I will not be buying anymore of LKH's works. I urge others to do the same, maybe if her sales drop she'll start producing better works."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This is the 12th book in the Anita Blake series, or at least it is by title... I like to refer to this book as the third release in Laurell K Hamilton's new erotic series.The last good Anita Blake book was Obsidian Butterfly. That book was the embodiment of what the series used to be.Don't buy Incubus Dreams. It is a waste of money. It is about 100 pages or less of actually story and the rest is either badly written sex or angsting over the badly written sex.Save yourself the misery and buy something else. The money spent on this book would be better spent on something actually worth it."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have been reading the Anita Blake books since the beginning, and I have liked them all. I didn't even mind when they started becoming soft porn because the story lines were still exciting. But this latest installment kind of sucks.Firstly, there are just too many characters. It seems that to make room for the few new characters that showed up, we had to do without some old favorites. There was barely any scenes with Damian (except for 1 real important one) or Jason. She only mentions Asher in passing. And there is a complete lack of most of the werewolves, wererats, wereleopards (excpet Nathanial and Micah) and Edward. Where the hell is Edward? He's now been missing from 3 books.Secondly, there were many storylines that I was looking forward to reading about that weren't really mentioned. Her relationship with Asher and Jean Claude was touched on, but not explored. Same for Stephen and Gregory and their past abuse, their father is in town looking for them, it was hardly mentioned. Speaking of which, what about Valentina and that other Vamp whose name is illuding me. They stuck around to make amends on abusing the twins, but their names are no where to be found in the book. Belle's desire to kill Mother Vamp, and overthrow the council. Jean Claude's newfound bloodline. Olaf. All missing.Also, I have to agree with some other posters here. Anita has gained too much power too fast. The new triumverate with Damian and Nathanial happened and I don't know how or why. It was odd and unsatisfying. The arduer which initially intigued me now angers me, its all the time, but never the same. Its confusing and almost impossible to keep track of.That being said, this book wasn't all bad. Her relationships with Micah and Nathanial have grown and I'm glad she's finally coming to terms with her sexuality. But the bad outweighed the good. The book was way too long, I found myself skipping whole paragraphs that seemed to be unimportant to the plot. Also, am I the only one who is tired of Richard and his baby bullsh*t? Everytime he shows up, he pisses me, and usually every character in the book, off. Enough of him already.I can't recommend this book to anyone except diehard Anita fans, I'm sure it's going to be important eventually. Those who are just starting on this series should start at the beginning."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"First, I am addicted to this series, and, of course, I read the whole book almost as soon as I could get my hands on it. I had a novel experience in my own reading of Anita Blake - I was bored! 200 hundred pages in, I was saying, right, Anita, we all know you have had trouble accepting love in your life. I am not opposed to the large number of loves in Anita's life, except that it means you get a repeat of the same drama 5 times over at least. I really lost interest in hearing what the problem was accepting Nathaniel. Didn't we do this already with Jean-Claude, Richard, Micah, Asher? I'm beginning to suspect that more men are introduced throughout the series, so that Hamilton can continue to use this much loved formula. Yawn. I even got bored of the sex (after biting my nails through the first 6 books till she finally has her scene with Jean-Claude). Oh, she's having sex again. After the first five times, well, yawn.I am still fascinated by Anita Blake, but there is just too much going on in her personal life to allow any plot the room it needs to develop. I would estimate about 500 pages were devoted to personal drama and 100 pages were devoted to the murder mystery. I miss the old novels, like Obsidian Butterfly, Bloody Bones or Blue Moon, where I can't put the book down because I have to know who the culprit is, what the motive is, what is the mystical background. There is the barest allowance to those of us who want more mystery in an unfinished storyline about one crazy master vampire (I'm not ruining anything for those of you who haven't read it yet.)I am hoping this book allowed Anita to tie up all the loose ends and let us get back to the real fun in the next book. I've got it on order already. I'm still a Laurell K. Hamilton fan. I probably couldn't have skipped this book anyway, but I probably should have."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am about 2/3 of the way through this book and went on line to determine if I should even bother to finish reading it. These sceenes are so muddied and boaring. No-one goes through this much mental anguish for 4 to 5 books. Anita had a personality before she had to start second guessing herself all the time, where did it go? PS. LKH, editors, publishers, why should anyone else spell check their work, it you can print books with this many errors."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"All right, just to address the inevitable taunt of \\"prude!\\" that will be hurled at me by other reviewers first thing: I am a huge fan of the sexual scenes written by Hamilton. Or I was. I liked the grit, and the fact that she'd touch scenes that the average romance author was reluctant to venture near. I even applauded the release of sexual tension in Narcissus in Chains, (which is the last Anita Blake novel that I'd actually recommend). At the time, however, I thought Narcissus was an interlude of sorts. Alas, I was mistaken. I welcomed the widening of the scope of Anita's morality, and the attempt to answer hard questions, such as \\"who are the monsters, anyway?\\"None of this should have been allowed to get in the way of the plot. hamilton leaves delightful and tantalizing bits of unresolved information and plot hooks all over the place as one would leave seeds for birds. In Cerulean, it is revealed that Anita has piqued the interest of Belle Morte, and also something older and much, much more powerful. How will that resolve itself? Will it? I couldn't tell you, because this book didn't touch either. (It didn't have time, after all the sex, talking about sex, and worrying about the ramifications of sex.) In this book, it is revealed that the vampire church doesn't require its members to make a blood oath. This is a situation that could lead to an incredible book on its own. There is a serial killer (in fact, a bunch of them) on the loose, and by the end of the book- THERE STILL IS! What? There are a whole host of indisputably bad guys running around endangering the world, and Anita allows them to live, even though they are not associated with Edward (which I presume was her excuse for not killing Olaf in Obsidian Butterfly). We are also introduced to the Wicked Truth- a pair of seriously powerful warriors newly arrived in town. We don't know much about them yet though, and I suspect that if the series heads down the road it's on now, we'll get to find out their sexual preferences before learning of more of their history. Their addition could rescue the series if played out the way I'd do it, but I have reservations about the part they'll actually play in the next book.I had some other issues with this book besides an unresolved and wandering plot, however. First of all, wow. After three hundred pages of that I could just feel how badly Anita must need a bath. The point is made (and has been made before) that Anita is a \\"rainmaker\\". She then has sex for days, often without time to attend to hygiene, and borrowing other people's underwear. Ok, maybe I am a prude, because I didn't find that particular factor arousing or tasteful.In a slightly related note, what has happened to the entire supernatural male population in St. Louis? Why is Nathaniel, who is theoretically cripplingly submissive, suddenly better at decision making than Richard, who is in theory, the wolf king? Why is Damian, a former Viking, of all things, a gelded basement-dweller? Where is everyone who is just Anita's friend? We know where Dolph is- he's gone insane. Rafael? The entire werewolf pack besides Jason and Richard? Asher? Where IS everybody? And while I am at it, where's Micah's personality?I do realise that these books are being written by Ms. Hamilton, not myself, and that she can do as she wishes with them. But is this really what she wishes, or just what she thinks we, as the fans, want? The lack of editing and lack of care with which the prose is handled indicate to me that the author may be slightly. . . bored. I know I would be."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm a normal, healthy, psychologically sound thirty-two year old reader and this book still made me really uncomfortable. I made the ENORMOUS mistake of reading this one on an airplane (I was paranoid that everyone knew I was reading porn, although the cover should have been a tip-off). Do not read this in public if you are at all squishy about kinky sex! I used to really like the Anita Blake series but it is getting to the point where I can't recommend it to anyone. I am just not that comfortable with multiple partner sex, sex with multiple strangers, sex scenes set seven times a day, and sex scenes in graphic detail. It is getting a little too kinky for my white bread world. Also, I think its just kind of gross and turns off part of Anita's charm to me.In the past, I truly enjoyed Anita's conflict over her goodness vs. her life with the monsters which was a lot more complex than meaningless sex with multiple strangers who happen to be geographically close. I never expected Anita to remain chaste (as she had done throughout- what? four books), but, dude, I never expected her to become kinda \\"skanky\\" over the course of a few short books. Have you noticed that God doesn't talk to Anita anymore (you know those peaceful moments where she reaffirmed that she was living right despite what anyone said). I am honestly not being preachy. But Anita's neurotic worrying about her \\"good girl\\" morals was a big and really appealing part of her character. Now when she worries, I pretty much agree -- good girls do not do what she just did in that book.If you are a die-hard LKH fan, read it in the privacy of your home and hide it from your tweeners. I'll keep reading until there is no hope for a less-icky Anita."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"\\"Incubus Dreams\\"...What a disappointment. I have been waiting forever it seems for this book to be published and it was nothing but sex sex and more sex. I dont have a problem with sex...I dont consider myself to be a prude, not at all. I am not easily offended in that regard, but I want a plot. I wanted more action. I have missed my beloved Asher and he was NOWHERE to be seen. He was mentioned...sure, but the only time Asher was actually in a scene was while he was resting. How disappointing. At this point, Im frustrated because I bought this book expecting a great story and all I really got was a porno. I miss my characters. I missed Asher and Jason horribly. I miss the action and to be quite honest, Im getting a little sick of Anitas attitude. I know how I am and I can safely say that if and when the next book comes out, I will most definitely read it. I just hope, hope, hope that LKH comes up with something more reminiscent of the old Anita that I know and loved, because this most recent installment just is a sad display when I KNOW that LKH can do MUCH better."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"First, can I say I was a fan of Anita Blake before the series really took off and perhaps that is why I am disappointed. Laurell, if you read this, may I suggest you reread your earlier work and see if you can perceive any difference. There is no plot to this work. It is simply a series of sexual encounters with a bit of angst driven soul searching in between. I am not a prude nor do I mind well crafted descriptions on sexual encounters (even if it does seem that you are drawing on sealed section girlie mags for inspiration but at least try and keep my interest with a plot. Anyone who is interested should divide Laurell's book into how much is devoted to sex and how much to the underlying plot (rogue vamps on the loose). My impression was sexual congress 95% and plot treatment 5% (the usual Anita battling redneck stupid police officer at crime scene stuff. The most telling thing of all is how Laurell is forced to dispose of the plot in a page and a half at the end with someone we never even met writing a letter of explanation and the bad vamp (who we also never meet) just crossing state borders to be someone else's problem.I like Anita Blake, I like the world Anita has crafted for her to inhabit but this book was just going through the motions in a big way..(I think I also got sympathetic chafing as a result of Anita's incessant sexploits..I won't say don't buy this book but if you like me got hooked on the interesting storylines of the earlier books, you will be disappointed or at least nowhere near as satisfied as Anita was in this book (how many back scratching rainmaking orgasms was it Laurell, 10, 15 ..I lost count in the end, and that was just one of her encounters..God, I do sound like a prude but I stand by my criticism of this book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"OVERALL: I did enjoy the book, but ended feeling vaguely disappointed. There is something missing from the book that left me feeling that the story was not satisfactorily closed. After completing the book, I simply felt disappointed.Although, I liked the book. I know it had problems, not the least of which is that I was already familiar with the first couple of chapters from Ms. Hamilton's \\"Cravings\\". I really wasn't happy to see the material re-used in this format. I was hoping for an independent storyline, not something I had already read before.What I found most interesting was the crime itself, and its interesting development of the Vampire culture. Additionally, although I found the increase in Anita and Jean-Claude's powers interesting (note that Richards powers increase too, but this feels undeveloped), What was most interesting was the first use of Jean Claude of those powers via Anita, as Jean-Claude's human servant. That was the part of the book I couldn't put down.Like the other reviews, I was looking for more action on the crime aspects of the plot. I did find the conclusions of the various plotlines interesting, but unnecessary. The actual crime (murder of local (female) strippers is interesting, but feels like an underdeveloped late addition to what is basically a book about previously underdeveloped characters).It reads more like a soap opera than a (supernatural) crime drama. It felt more like the conclusion of Anita's complicated love life, than a crime drama."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I loved this series and used to eagerly await the next book. The last few entries started slipping off into nothingness and now this? I was hard pressed to find an actual story in this bloated book. And then there is the ardeur. Not a bad element, but it has become vastly overdone and now there are whole books based on feeding it. I love a good erotic novel, but not here. Hot sex and romance are supposed to be fun and interesting. Here, they just seem like something Anita and most everyone in the book HAS to do. At certain times it's fun, but it just goes on and on and on and on. I found myself flipping ahead a lot, just to see if anything else was going to happen.I have not written Anita off, but am getting close.Ms. Hamilton - PLEASE go back and read the first five books in the series. Especially Guilty Pleasures. That's what hooked me. I can only imagine how hard it is to come up with plot, characters, etc., especially for the same core group of characters. Please try harder...Sorry for the bad review, but I am very sad that I'm not enjoying your books anymore. Thanks."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I've been a AB for over seven years. I remember when these books used to come out every six to eight months. And when Mrs. Hamilton slowly shifted the focus of the series (starting around \\"The Killing Dance\\") to Anita Blake's relationship struggles, I only had a tiny, *little* problem with it. It wasn't until \\"Narcissus in Chains\\" that it became a real problem. (enjoyment wise, for me)The earlier Anita Blake were truly something unique. A modern urban fantasy series, with a strong female protagonist, that drew on elements from each of the major book genres (fantasy, mystery, romance, horror, humor, ect.). Mrs. Hamilton showed a skill for blending/balancing each of these elements, along with an addictive first person POV style that drew you straight into the story.Sadly, with the release of \\"Incubus Dream\\" all of that has come to an end. The inventive, creative writing that once appealed to so many, has now completely been erased and replaced with a load of uninteresting, Plot? What, Plot?, sexual filler.For the last few books, Mrs. Hamilton has slowly filtered out any and ALL non-erotica elements. Namely the paranormal mystery, the fantasy, the world building elements, the humor, the character development, and plot. You know, the things that made the books unique and appealing and interesting to those outside of the romance/erotica genre?You will find less then a hundred of the overall, 658 pg., dedicated to the mystery plotline summarized on the blurb. Instead, you will be treated to scene after scene of Anita Blake repeatedly screwing the last of the guys she hasn't gotten around to yet.If you enjoy the characters of Nathaniel and Damien, and hardcore erotica(not romance), then Incubus Dream will be a definite treat. Anyone else on the fence, I suggest you borrow a copy from the library, or check out your local used bookstore."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I hate to say it, but this may be the last Anita Blake I buy. What a waste of ink. Once again, LKH has provided us with an IDEA for a plot, which she then ignores for almost the entire book, choosing instead to ramble on and on through cliched sex scenes and tired one-liners used many times in her previous books. I say that she has an idea for a plot because it is almost entirely a sideline, an afterthought, pushed aside by whole chapters devoted to talking about sex, thinking about sex, having sex, regretting sex, wanting sex, metaphysical sex, and endless meanderings about how it's all for the sake of Jean Claude, or Damian, or Nathanial... Like many of the other reviewers, I did enjoy the few chapters involving the case (which I forgot about amidst the several hundred pages between mentioning), this was where the old Anita showed a little. On top of the endless sexual activity, there were also some blatant discrepancies: why is Anita killing chickens again when in Cerulean Sins they make such a big deal about her using only her own blood now? Why is Gregory such an obnoxious jerk when he was always so polite and submissive before? And so on. Now, make no mistake, I have been devoted to Anita since day one, but I had to put this down halfway through and read another book before coming back, just to get a breather. So, if you feel the need to tackle this mess, I heartily recommend a trip to the library, and not the book store. Of course, the library may not be to happy if you throw the book out your window."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"After having finished the latest installment of the Anita Blake series, I have to wonder if Hamilton has been researching \\"Letters to Penthouse\\" for material.What happened to the creative story telling that put her on the New York Times Best Seller List?

However, I will say I want my money back! I DO NOT mind erotic novels and have a large collection of various styles myself. Even when LKH began adding sex to the Anita Blake series I thought it was great. Lots of heat with the emotions just at the right place. But this book is the worst by far. No matter how well you write a love/sex scene when it becomes the staple of the book it loses the wonderful world that devoted fans like myself have come to expect in the series. Once again in this volume Anita is thrown into various excuses to end up in as many sexual situations as one woman could write. What I find horrifying is the fact that I paid money for this book and was looking forward to the fact that I heard it was much longer than previous volumes in the series. Once inside the book though I was disgusted in the fact that LKH has completely lost her way in Anita's universe. Anita is no longer the heroine that I am ruiting for and I find myself at odds over how such a wonderful series could be brought down so fast. (I saw fast it's been going this way since Narcissus in Chains). I guess the hardest part is knowing that this book is a mainstream best selling novel that has turned into a Porn novel that is receiving major attention/reviews based on the fact that the word of mouth that kept the books popular has now transferred over to what seems like a corporate gimmick.I felt as if I could be a fly on the wall and imagine Editors/Publishers saying MORE SEX, SEX SELLS. And in doing so this storyline has suffered.As I said I'm not a prude Anita could have had sex with all these characters fine and dandy if for so many novels we weren't led on and pulled towards the next books looking for story growth.The only growth Incubus Dreams adds to this series is a lot of meaningless sex that doesn't have one ounce the erotic or emotional nature of previous books.This book has left me with a bad taste in my mouth even Erotica usually has a pretty good story mixed in with all the sex...Please someone step in and get Anita Blake back on track. Have a Soap Opera moment and have her wake from a coma, something that will bring back the pure heat and great storytelling of old..."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Hamilton continues to degenerate into a cheap, soft core porn writer with this book. Actually, soft core may not be the correct term any more. It opens with a familiar plot. Dead bodies. A serial killer suspected with supernatural abilities. Then it goes off into a 1200 page diversion in which the plot is lost, and nothing occurs but kinky sex. Anita Blake was a great invention, and Hamilton has a prose turning page style, with \\"film noir\\" inner dialog that is immensely appealing. She has totally lost her way, though, and rather than realize her problems, she invents new ways to excuse the non-stop sex. Here, Anita discovers that Jean-Claude is an incubus, thus answering her question as to why every problem must be solved with inane sex. With Anita's counterpart, the thinly disguised, virtually identical Princess Meredith, Merry is ordered by her Queen to have sex with all the members of her guard. Thus, sex BECOMES the plot in Hamilton's books, which is a shame. Not because I'm a prude or object to some lascivious conduct, but because Hamilton gets totally lost in repetitive, increasingly boring sex scenes, and wholly forgets that she used to be a writer who had the ability to deliver real plots of interest. A regrettable waste of talent. Hamilton and Anita Blake are fast becoming something to avoid. If you've read one of them, you've read them all. There are only so many ways to couple, even if Hamilton frequently makes it a triple or more. And listening to the same description for the same stuff over and again isn't really erotic--just a mind-numbing diversion from what plot the book has left. Hamilton needs a reality check, as her self-absorption and inability to self-critique is causing her to commit mistakes as big as Robert Jordan's (Wheel of Time series), even if different in character."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I can honestly say it is now over with this writer for both series. This series started out with some interesting characters, alternate history, and good mystery / suspense. Now I feel most of her fans could write these current books and do a better job of it. I think the last 60 pages actually focuses on what we used to love about Anita. Now the only people that could actually choke down the first 600 pages have to be into porn. And it's not even good porn! Sorry Ms. Hamilton, you'll have to put your books in a different place in the store if you keep writing this way. In fact, I don't think this book should even be in horror."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The parts of this book that were not directly depicting sexual acts were good, but there were far too few scenes of this type in the book. With the previous books in the series, there was at least one major external challenge that the characters had to deal with. This challenge helped with the development of their characters and were the best parts of these books. This book lacked that challenge. The parts of this book that did not deal with the graphic depiction of sex were added as almost an afterthought. It wouldn't be so bad if the sex scenes were well done or in character, but around 400 pages of this book read like a posting to one of the Usenet sex newsgroups.The sad thing was that this is the first of the Anita Blake books that I have not enjoyed from start to finish. This one had no real challenge to the group and the issues that were brought up in this book will not be resolved until the next book. This book would have benefited by a heavy editting. Hopefully, the next book in the series will have more direction."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I didn't hate this book; I even stayed up all night reading it. But I spent the whole time (as I have with at the last 3 novels in the series) hoping that Hamilton was planning to actually move forward with the series in the next book. The threads are there. Neither the readers, nor Anita, need another repetative orgy.My gripes? Of course, the arduer. My sister and I both read these novels, but I usually get to them first. I remember telling her when the arduer was first introduced that it was a lame excuse to force Anita into utterly compromising herself sexually. I used words like \\"betrayal\\" and phrases like \\"degrading the character\\".Some of Anita's good points are also her bad points. She sets down rules for herself and tries to follow them--but she follows them even when they become ridiculous or hypocritical. So perhaps the arduer could have been useful in ONE BOOK to take away Anita's ability to prevaricate, make excuses, and lie to herself (which was itself becoming tiresome). But 3 books full of essentially coercive sexual encounters?!I had really hoped that the advent of the Merideth Gentry novels would give Hamilton an outlet for tons of outrageous sex with supernatural studs without further damage to the Anita Blake series. Let's face it, Merry having tons of sex makes sense. She likes it, has liked it since page one of the first book. It's part of her character. It's part of the plot. And, thus, I can enjoy it without any complaints about continuity.However, Anita having \\"casual\\" sex with a legion of men does NOT make sense. She couldn't even deal with 2, what in God's name does she think she's doing with 10? I believe that it is within Anita's character to have sex outside of marriage, and maybe even to have a threesome with Jean-Claude and Richard--because she loved them both. As Anita has said, sex *should* mean something.Speaking of which, in this latest novel, Anita, Jean-Claude, and Richard STILL have not managed to come to any sort of universally agreeable compromise.Micah is like a too-amiable substitute for Richard, whose character has become...shall we say...implausible. Does the author now hate Richard? I admit I did at one point too (since my intro to Anita Blake was Burnt Offerings). But after re-reading the series in order several times over the years, I feel really sorry for Richard. And I can really see why Anita fell for him. But what has been done to his character? It's as if he has not been able yet to wrap his mind around the fact that having a truly \\"normal\\" life (either with or without Anita) is simply NOT possible. He has developed a simply atrocious temper that we had absolutely NO evidence of in \\"Circus of the Damned\\" or \\"Lunatic Cafe\\". Am I only just now noticing this? Nope, but it was understandable in \\"Burnt Offerings\\" and \\"Blue Moon\\"--Anita had just broken his heart. But now in \\"Incubus Dreams\\" it's revealed, gasp, that Richard has long hidden his desires for sadistic sex! What? So, the sensitive, honorable Richard who declared in \\"Blue Moon\\" that he would NEVER hurt Anita wishes that he could do just exactly that? At this point, Richard's increasingly absurd tantrums and delusions have become another sad necessity just to keep the series limping along without conclusion.Should I even get started on how Jean-Claude has somehow been relegated to a secondary character? Since when is he such a compliant lover? He may be an incubus, and he may love Anita, and he may have been willing to let her sleep with Richard since he knew she could never choose between them...but I would certainly have expected some stringent objection to Anita screwing the days and nights away with everyone and everything that occasionally has a pulse. Maybe Anita would treat him with some dignity if he had the balls to confront her about her shoddy treatment of him (and, come to think of it, everyone else). And, I suppose, that's the gist of the problem--I never imagined Jean-Claude was really a sissy, but according to Hamilton's recent offerings, he is!Yes, I wanted Anita to bend a little. I wanted to see more sex and less faux-moralistic whining. I wanted to see her SOMEHOW find a way to be with BOTH of the men she loved. Even more, I was getting tired of reading yet another circular self-inquisition wherein Anita questions whether or not she's a monster, decides she *might* be--yes--could be, and yet continues with her bigoted attitudes toward \\"the monsters\\". But there is such a thing as going too far. We are told in this book that God (that's right, GOD) has presented Anita with a unique opportunity to debase her own moral code so that she can grow and confront what she is most afraid of. What's next, a massive orgy with a cemetary full of zombies as the arduer and Anita's magic explode in a 'shimmering orgasmic pool', of course, 'leaving everyone in a 10,000 mile radius wet and gasping with the metaphysical sensation of claws and fur and wind and power penetrating their bodies (ps: spilling)'?Something has got to give. It's not that the book isn't still a fairly enjoyable read. It's just that, and let me make this clear, AS PART OF THE ANITA BLAKE SERIES, it's completely frustrating, disappointing, and, dare I say, disgusting? At this point, I vote that, if the series doesn't get back on track, Richard should get himself shot by the police during one of his rages, thus killing Anita and Jean-Claude.I'm just praying the next step is not some kind of all-out war that forces Anita to have sex with every single preternatural being on the planet to create world peace.

It's all downhill from there folks. Incubus Dreams is the worst of all with 300 pages of pointless sex, no plot development, or any interesting characters with the exception of Nathaniel. I was reading a book a week until this one came out. I started it in December. After reading the threeway between Anita, Richard, and Jean-Claude, I put the book down and haven't picked it up since. Three months later it's still sitting unfinished on my nightstand serving a better purpose as a coaster. Way to kill a great series Laurell."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have read Ms. Hamilton's Anita Blake books all the way from the beginning, but I simply could NOT finish this book. I tried twice, and finally gave up. I mean, the main character goes from being at times overly prudish to becoming a complete slut. The so-called ardeur takes over the entire plot until you forget what the plot actually is! It all just becomes another reason for Anita to have gratuitous sex with...whoever! Don't get me wrong. I LOVE the hot scenes in the books, but come on! And on a side note...the bestiality was a little much. Needless to say, I will be skipping this disaster and moving on to the next book, IF I decide to keep reading LKH at all!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am only pleased that LKH has continued down the path that she has chosen for this series. The characters just get trashier with each book and all of the redeeming features that made them respectable are disappearing.The sad part is that it is such a flawed perspective on people. Some people are actually able to resist being corrupted by outside influences and that is totally absent from this series where everyone is so caught up in a need for sex and power that they will totally debase themselves to get it. The will to resist that call was part of what made Richard Zeeman admirable, but now he is so enraptured of AB that he is falling too. Get real!The saddest thing is that her editors should have helped her avoid some of the chracter clutter and useless dialogue. Kill Richard off or let him vanish into the sunset. Give Micah a backbone, because there is no way that he is a Nimir-raj like he is. He would get walked all over by a stronger personality. Jason would have been dead meat after the games he has played between the Pack and Anita and there would be nothing she could do about it. Nathaniel is just digusting and the whole infatuation thing that LKH has with him makes me want to gag. Teh creation of yet another triumvirate when the first one was still not well explained was another example of events taking the place of a planned storyline.There is so much potential in this series, but it just seems like LKH is bent on destroying everything that made this worth reading. I have hated many of the plot turns, but they made sense in the earlier books. What we are seeing now is like she is lost and feels like she can keep the readers interested by taking things further down the porn road than along the occult/vampire road. Bad choice...."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Once upon a time the Anita Blake series was an intriguing blend of police procedural and horror/dark fantasy, with a twist of erotic romance to spice things up. Unfortunately, that was only the first 4 books, and a brief relapse with Obsidian Butterfly. Incubus Dreams is the culmination of the series' long slow decline, and it can be defined as erotica with romance and fantasy themes, and residual police procedural elements. This does not in and of itself lead to it being a bad book, but it does mean that fans drawn to the series by the combination of tightly executed murder mysteries, fast paced action (of the non-sexual variety), and Anita's witty narration and repartee; have been very disappointed for a while now. Additionally, we have been bombarded with an ever expanding cast of secondary characters (LKH please kill some of them off soon), and dangling plot strands that I am beginning to suspect the author has lost track of. Frankly I am becoming very tired of 'meta-physical emergencies' whose only purpose seem to be to get Anita to have sex in some new way or with some new person (spoiler warning: why did we need to introduce both the Dragon and Damien's maker in such similar ways and so close together, with unresolved payoff's for both 'story-lines'?). The result is that this book is a mess, with a vast array of repetitious sub-plots, and a 'main' story line that really doesn't emerge until the last hundred pages of the book, and is never resolved (just another dangling story line, like Olaf, the Quetza Dragon, the black-ops interest in Anita, the Mother of All Darkness...). In the past LKH skill as a story-teller eclipsed the general weakness of her writing style, but as the books get longer and messier the lapses in actual writing skill are becoming more obvious and more painful. Some of the characters are still intriguing, but at this point there are so many characters to follow (many of whom are pretty redundant and/or simply annoying) that the impact of the good ones is pretty well muted. I still love the character of Anita, but only glimpses of the former character emerge. The old rule that things that scare Anita die messily shortly thereafter is sadly gone, along with the long MIA Edward. The only hope that I see for the series is if a large number of characters get killed off or Anita is required to leave St. Louis and her anchor weight supporting cast behind for a while."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am glad that I read it using a library copy.

She cannot go back from here, and she has changed Anita into something unrecognizable.

I miss the writing and stories of the first books in this series."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The saying goes \\"Your only as good as your last book\\" and if that is the case, LKH is in big trouble considering that people can't give away this tripe once they bought it. And trust me, I have tried.There really needs to be a \\"No stars\\" rating and this book should be first in line for it.This book is tedious, poorly edited... if it was edited at all. Considering the spelling errors, the grating lack of pacing, and that the main character's are less than one dimension, I literally threw this piece of garbage against the wall in disgust.The only spark of a decent mystery, let alone piece of story is shunted into half a chapter(if that) and spread across length of this atrocity. LKH needs a better editor or one that isn't convinced that all her readers want is cheap, gratuitous sex with complete strangers. I won't be spending any of my money on her again. I have no interest in being a fool a third time. I purchased NIChains and hated it. I was praying and hoping that ID would be different. It is NOT.Please, do not waste your time.

Goes on and on about nothingness!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"m not offended by Hamilton's shift to erotica. I simply wish she had developed another cast of characters to do it. I understand that a large part of Anita's relationships to her male \\"harem\\" is by nature sexual; however, in a novel of 700 plus pages, for what seemed to be at least 500 pages to be devoted to the ardeur in its many permutations and complications is a little much. Anita's role as the executioner is somewhat jarring because the book is not really about Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter; it's about Anita Blake, sexual woman.Yes, I read all of the book because Hamilton does an excelllent job of writing erotica most of the time and because I really did want to find out who was doing the strippers."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book starts out great; it has the feel of the old Anita novels. You know before they became like a soap opera. However, once again this book delves more \\"into\\" Anita, and her personal life than I care to read. It felt like I was reading the script to a porno. This was once a great book series, I loved them. But they gradually went down hill. Becoming more like a Dear Penthouse letter than the books I once loved. Ms Hamilton is a very talented writer, the world she has created is incredible, but the over sexing of the books has lost her a very devoted fan.I picked up this book in hopes it would be different, however it was more of who gets to do Anita next, and how can they do her. Oh by the way there is a vampire killing people but Anita gets to have a lot of sex, so lets focus on that is how the book feels (did not finish the book, it was just to much). I read the interview with amazon.com she did and understand that someone said she should not write sex because she is female, so she had a point to make. I think the point was made, and made, and made, and made...... Laurell please get back to what made this series great, (it was not the amount of penetration Anita can take, or how much sex she can have with as many people possible) it was mystery, killing bad monsters, and an incredible world, and Anita, where she does her best work (and that is not on her back). I think that Edward needs to make a come back, see how misguided Anita is and kill her, and her whole family. Then do a series about him."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am a dedicated fan of both of LKH's series, both her other one centered on fae culture and Merry Gentry, and on this one starring Anita Blake. So I expected that Incubus Dreams would contain the elements that other reviewers here have been bemoaning: lots of sex, lots of talk, and lots of Anita giving herself a hard time via internal dialogue.I did _not_ expect Anita's relationship with Nathanial to develop as it did in this book, and in that respect I was pleasantly surprised. Anita's life - sexual, romantic, and otherwise - is complex to put it mildly, and she herself has said it many times: the fifties nuclear family is not her destiny. I also have to admire Hamilton's willingness to confront many aspects of our contradictory and confusing American attitude towards sex, albeit in indirect and sometimes symbolic ways. Anita's 'love life' never fails to make me think, and for that, I am appreciative.However, I did _not_ expect Anita to be so out of control of the ardeur and her other powers that she'd literally fall on the floor with the closest available guy. I also didn't expect the bad guys to get away at the end of the book. So I was disappointed in these two aspects of the story. I can see that there's a good setup for the _next_ Anita Blake novel with the evolution of Anita's powers and with some sort of showdown with Vittorio. But I think there could have been more thoughtful and meaty development of these storylines within Incubus Dreams.In short, I'll keep reading. But I hope LKH can somehow take some more time with her next book. If her editors, publisher, and other such people are reading this, give the woman a little more room, please! She has a wide base of loyal readers and we won't go anywhere if you let LKH really do her thing. Okay?"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"If you're an Anita Blake fan, you'll probably read this book, if only to find out what happens in this series. I have to agree with the other reviews. There is less and less plot, and more and more sex. It seems to be an alarming trend since the incredible writing of Obisdian Butterfly. This book is slightly better than Cerulean Sins, but not much. Its definitely longer, but once again, more sex scenes, longer book.The only nice thing about this book, is seeing Richard become less of a pansy and Nathaniel becoming more 'real'. I would like to see more of what causes that development in Richard, but doubt we will see any reflection in the future. The main thing I hope is whoever is editing the series keeps Laurell on track, so we don't see Richard bouncing back and forth between being a pansy and coming to terms with himself."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Hamilton is turning into Christine Feehan. Stop, please stop! Sex scene after sex scene is just boring. Where did Anita the hero/anti-hero go? We the loyal readers loved Anita because against all odds she kicked-ass, human and otherwise.Let's get back to the hanging (non-sex) plot lines and reintroduce some real mystery, intrigue, horror, battles, and heroics. I am all in favor of a sexy heroine; but Hamilton is book by recent book taking the heroine out of the equation. The arduer as plot device to break down sexual barriers has run its course. Let Anita master it and move beyond it. Put her and her friends in mortal danger (I suggest even killling off one or more major characters to create heightened drama) and let's see how she uses all of these new powers."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Where to begin. . . First off -- if you don't like sex in a book -- DON\\"T buy.I realize that Anita has a lot of growing to do, that she has a lot of coming to terms with herself and her lifestyle, and that it is difficult to learn how to control her budding powers, but does she really have to have sex on nearly every page in this overly long book. Not that I don't like long books, or the occasional sex scene to spice things up, I've always enjoyed them -- but that much sex starts to get old fast.I miss the old Anita -- the tough girl who loves her weapons and who isn't tied down by all this metaphysical crap. I miss her meticulously getting ready, putting on each and every piece of weaponry that she has, ready to kick some bad guy butt. I really enjoy the crime solving and the zombie raising, the exciting fight scenes that get your heart pumping -- and there is just too little of that in this book, and what is there is highly unsatisfying.I guess that it was time for Anita to stop running and start facing the myriad of problems that plague her life. Well -- she certainly faced a big one in this book -- and she seems to have conquered it rather nicely, over and over again. This book definately did it's job transforming Anita into a new less chaste individual who doesn't let her past morals get in her way. This is a huge stepping stone for Anita -- and I'm sure will be very signifcant in future books. Once one bridge is burned, after all -- don't the rest just burn easier?One of the few things in this book that I found really interesting was Laurell's fleshing out the character of Nathaniel. It was great to really start to get to know him in this book, and to learn more about Micha as well. Another good thing is that Richard seems to be growing up, (a little,) which is refreshing as his constant whining about his life is really getting old. But I really miss Asher who isn't in one scene in this book, and isn't about time to bring back Edward?I decided to give this book 3 stars because it was an alright read. It isn't on par with what I had come to expect from Laurell K. Hamilton, but it had some truly interesting moments that made reading this book worth it, and of course I'll read the next one in the series. I am after all, a die hard Anita fan. It will take a lot more than one book to make me stop reading this series, and I can always hold out hope that the next one will the thrilling read that I have come to expect from Laurell's books. All-in-all I would recommend that you die hard fans read this book -- I'm sure the curiosity would kill you if you didn't anyway! (It certainly did me, a million bad reviews couldn't keep me away I'm afraid.) And for those of you who are already feeling disappointment in the series or who are very uncomfortable with the idea lots of sex scenes -- maybe you should skip this one -- if you have the strength of will that is."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This review will be brief--- this is not LKH's best work, nor is it the best of Anita. In fact, the only thing this book attempted to do that I *was* waiting for, was try and resolve all of Anita's relationship issues. If you are not into the main character's relationships-- or like steamy sex scenes-- skip this book. However, it seemed to straighten up some of the personal issues revolving around Anita.The part of the Anita character and story that was missing, and I hope comes back to the series, is her ability and skills to work through vampire and werewolf politics, deal with mysteries and puzzles, and be the motivator and protector of her friends and \\"family.\\" The reason the book has three stars--even though the one aspect overshadows all the others... the characters and descriptions are richly written, as well as, I feel, the personalities....I do hope, however, in future books, we are given more of the Anita's intellect and driving personality, and not so much of her sex drive. I miss some of the more detailed and intense aspects, especially when Anita is working with RIPT or Edward or the politics of the \\"monsters.\\"So-- basically-- this book is only for those who are into the character's ongoing relationships.. if you want something like in the earlier books, or obsdian.. skip it."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I enjoyed reading the first 8 books and then they took a turn for the worst.

They got a little too gory for me at times, went a little overboard in the shock value from time to time, but I still enjoyed the characters and the story behind it all. I keep trying, thinking she'll get back on track, but this book officially ends my interest in Anita Blake. I don't mind some sex scenes here and there if they expand the plot and continue the story. The past few books have increased from being good stories to being hard core porn. Nothing is left to the imagination, every little detail is included and they are not subtle. I find myself skimming over half the book because all the sex just doesn't matter. Anita finds herself \\"needing\\" to bonk every male she comes in contact with because of this convenient beast she has in her now. She's not even her anymore.

I kid you not and I did lose count. I really don't mind a good sex scene, but it's really starting to push it when I feel like I am reading a porno. There is one scene, described in graphic detail, where Anita has sex (really, not metaphysically) with Richard on one end and Jean Claude on the other. Wow! There is also bestiality where one of her wereleopards shifts in the middle of having sex with her. I have been a loyal fan, like most of the readers below, since guilty pleasures. The books were very entertaining to read and had all the elements of a good murder mystery with just a hint of sex thrown in. It seems progressively that LKH has been substituting sex for plot in her books, especially in Incubus Dreams. There was next to no plot whatsoever - maybe 30 - 50 pages in a 650+ page book! In the end it wasn't really even resolved. All the characters were either talking about sex (very long, drawn out, and boring) or having sex, whether it be metaphysical or physical. I am left to wonder what will happen with her, JC, and Asher's threesome since that wasn't even touched on in this book, and Asher is one of my favorite characters. It seems like most of the boys have just become Anita's playthings (except for Richard, who is just annoying), and have next to no personality. They are just there to have sex with her and run her errands. I am also getting really sick of all these descriptions of hair as \\"curtains\\" and \\"spilling\\" all over the place. I think every single character in this book has some kind of curly or wavy hair. Come on, mix it up a little! Another thing that has bugged me since the beginning of the series is that LKH seems to be trying to promote a positive female body image by Anita saying \\"anything below a size 5 is just a boy with boobs\\" and \\"yes my thighs rub together when I walk, thank you very much.\\" One little thing she forgot though, is Anita is 5'3 and 106 pounds (as stated by Anita in an earlier book), which seems to be a weight most of us would consider unattainable. I am pretty sure that someone who is that small is about a size 2 and their thighs may or may not rub together, but thanks LKH for trying to promote a healthy body image for us all and failing. I guess my opinion doesn't matter to her though since I am like Judith - an evil blonde ice queen! I am returning this book to the library and taking up another series."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book is not your typical Anita Blake novel. For one thing the focus of the book is Anita's interpersonal relationships rather than monster hunting. (For those of you who thought the sex scenes were graphic I suggest you read something along the lines of Jaid Black or the highly overrated Zane, and you'll see that this was pretty tame compared to erotica) There is a mystery in there, but it takes second chair to the men in Anita's life. I for one am happy that Ms. Hamilton finally addressed Anita's relationships, especially Nathaniel. Usually she just pushes her feelings to the side and focuses on the monsters. I did miss the vampire hunting action that usually packs the pages, but I also feel like I got a lot more insight into Anita. If you like the series only for the action sequences, then you may find this book a bit lacking. But if like me, you have come to enjoy the characters as much as the action, you should like it. Can't wait to find out what happens to Anita and the gang next."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"It all starts innocently enough with a Halloween wedding, but things never stay innocent or simple long when Anita Blake is around. From the wedding, she takes off to investigate the first in a series of stripper murders. To all appearances, it's a vampire kill- but she knows it can not be one of her vampires. That leaves two possibilities, the Church of Eternal Life or someone from the outside threatening her lover, Jean Claude's, territory. Complicating matters is Anita's multi faceted love life. The ardeur she inherited when she bonded with Jean Claude is becoming more demanding, to the point of being life threatening if she does not feed it. Not only is that metaphysical hunger demanding more of her, so is her pomme de sang, Nathaniel. For once, personal issues have to at least ride in the front seat beside her professional ones, sometimes literally. Love can be just as dangerous as hate in Anita Blake's St Louis.***** Romantic suspense, murder, vampires, were beasts, soft erotica, comedy, you name it- this book has got it. Picking up a new Anita book brings old friends back into your life. Jean Claude's portrayal is the best he has had since book six, and Anita's Ulfric, Richard, is at his best. Although new comers to the seris may be totally lost if this is their first venture into the land, long time fans will be doing their happy dances. *****"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"That's what my copy of this book is now doing....in the fireplace that is.700+ pages of useless crap has to be good for something, and tinder for my fire appears to be it.\\"Anita does St. Louis\\" is even being polite about this book.

It's too bad, this series had great promise."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I would have to disagree with the negative reviews but maybe that's because I'm looking at it differently than most are. To some extent I can understand what they're saying. This book was very different from previous ones in the series. But who wants to read a book already knowing or expecting to know what it's going to be like? Isn't different good? I agree that there was quite a bit of sex and at times it was between Anita and a stranger or someone that she had only met on a few occasions. I also missed the interaction with some of the characters that were in previous books but not this one, like Asher. Also, you're left hanging with an unsolved mystery but that just leaves room for more to come. However, even with all of the above I really enjoyed this book.I can remember reading some of the previous books thinking that Anita didn't seem very human...when did she laugh, cry, eat, sleep or become totally exhausted that her body gave out on her. No one could go through the things that she goes through in the time frame involved and survive. Of course she is different and at times she herself wonders if she's human. I think that in this book we see more of Anita and how her life has changed and we get to know her on a more personal level.This book allows you to envision Anita as a human being, a normal person (or as normal as normal is) even though the \\"monster\\" still lurks close to the surface. In this book you get to really SEE Anita and everything that makes her such a great person/character. She actually got tired in this book and her body gave out on her at times. We saw her face the demands of her body and at the same time battle what she felt in her mind. How often do we ourselves do that? We knit pick every little thing until we tear it apart and oftentimes we are our own worst enemies and Anita is the same way. Also, she cried in this book...I know that if I experienced some of the things that she does I'd cry too.It's nice to see her with feelings and actually facing those feelings and in this book she accepts who she is and who she has become and discovers that she's OK with herself. I think that is a discovery that a lot of people never make about themselves and if they did their lives would be much easier. This book wasn't so much about one of Anita's hunts, although that is partially included, it is more about Anita. I liked that aspect of the book. In my opinion if you read this book expecting it to be solely about Anita you would not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Although this was an obvious set up for the next book, I liked \\"Incubus Dreams\\". While the sex scenes (great fun, as usual) did seem to be unusually numerous, they were also a big part of the story line. Without them, I don't think the reader would appreciate the importance of the \\"ardeur\\" to the story and the extent that it affected the lives of the lead characters. Clearly, Hamilton is building up to something big with the unsolved murder, the \\"Wicked Truth\\", and the changes in the character dynamics. She's never disappointed me yet and I can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I enjoyed the book. It did have a lot of sex and I didn't particularly like AB having sex with some of the newer people (like the new vamps, etc) I was excited to have Richard back on the scene. I was also very excited about Nathaniel because he is one of my favorites. I missed Asher a whole bunch!!! I am a little concerned about all the characters, sometimes it is hard to keep track.Overall I give it high marks and i am anticipating that the investagation will go into the next book for a large built up. (That is my hope!)i think it was worth the money and more."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton continues to amaze me. How does she come up with this stuff? I am also glad this is her longest book yet, a veritable treat of a tome. (Yes, tome. It's huge.) Some people object to the plot getting so sexed up, and I can see the point, although I like all of her writing. Don't give this to your kids if you don't want questionable material in their heads, as the book is just this side of X rated, in my opinion. However, I really enjoyed the thoughtful development of Anita's personal relationships, as they were logical and made sense. Her prose is lush, with lovely use of language. If you haven't read any of the other books in the series, you might want to pick it up from the beginning."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"And she's changing. I've read the reviews about how the series started going down hill with Narcissis In Chains. Actually, the series was headed towards this latest book starting with Blue Moon. Obsidian Butterfly is what messed everything up. Anita was moving along with Jean-Claude, Asher and Damian, then suddenly, there's Obsidian Butterfly, but none of the regulars are there. Yes, she needed time to get herself together, but she'd already inherited the incubus. Where was it in Obsidian? Then, she's back with Narcissis. Had she left Obsidian out of the series, or added the regular cast to it, I don't believe most reviewers would be having the problems with the series. I would prefer more time with the plot, but apparently, something is coming (maybe the mother of all darkness?) that the powers (which are needed without personal conflicts) need to be at their strongest. I don't believe that the sex is going to go away. I certainly hope not. But, I do hope that the plots are going to thicken a bit."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I've been reading this series from early on and I liked this last book a great deal. It continued the general story with development being shown by the main characters. I can see why some people don't agree with the way the series is headed, but I've enjoyed it all along. I anticipate reading further books by Laurell K. Hamilton in this series and the Merry Gentry one, as well. The style of her writing excites me and I like to follow her characters through the events that complicate their lives."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I enjoyed this book. I really did. I didn't want to believe the reviews that said it was the worst book ever and how big of a waste of time it turned out to be. I'm glad I read it. I think it's a good continuation of the Anita Blake series and it wraps up a lot of unfinished storylines that were hanging around in the background.However, I found it hard to keep going in some parts. The scenes with Nathaniel, the cops, Micah, Richard, Jean-Claude, etc. were great. But once each scene was over and it was time to switch or move on, the book came to a grinding halt. It was just really difficult not to put the book down and stop reading. I think the book could have flowed much better if there had been more coherency or connection between sex/love/relationship scenes.It's not the worst Anita book. It's not the end of the series for me. In fact, it was one of the best books for insight into Anita and her life out of the entire twelve books. But it was hard to push myself through some parts."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I really enjoyed this book because I could deeply relate to Anita emotionally. Not because I'm having sex with every man I can lay my hands on, but because of issues with emotional intimacy. Maybe I'm just really messed up, but Anita has resonated with me on an emotional level since the beginning, and I feel like she's finally growing. I think she may be moving beyond her mother's death and all the issues that has left her with. I could perfectly understand how hard it is to be happy with the life that you have, especially when it's a life you didn't ask for, and you're afraid of losing people you care about. I'm sick of all the sex, much like many of the others that reviewed this book. But because of what I perceived as huge emotional break throughs on Anita's part, I was able to basically just ignore the sex, not really paying any attention as I rapidly scanned through the scenes waiting for something else to happen. Because of Anita's emotional growth, I felt like it was worth enduring all the tedious sex. By the way, I also agree with the people who think the sex is boring. I thought it was just me, and I'm glad to know it's not.Why do I keep reading the books, knowing I'll be forced into sex scene after sex scene that I don't want to read? I'm emotionally invested in this character, and I want to know what happens to her next. I've read all the Anita Blake books. I didn't like the last two very much, though Cerulean Sins was a vast improvement compared to Narcissus in Chains. I care so much about her that I'll buy the next book because I'll go crazy knowing that the next book is available to read if I don't have it, and I need to know what happens. I can't say I'll continue to purchase the books if they continue on in the same vein as this one, with tons of gratuitous sex. I can understand the pleading of many who wish for the old Anita to come back. However, I think it's too late now for her to return to the old Anita, and I think some of her changes, regardless of the vehicle used as the instrument of those changes, are for the better (the vehicle obviously in the case of this book is sex). I think it's a good thing Anita is learning to be happy with the life that she has. I also think that's not an easy place to arrive at, and making her struggle to arrive there is realistic and very human. I'm willing to accept that I may have so many of my own personal issues and that I'm so flawed that apparently I'm one of the few people out there that can resonate with Anita on an emotional level with all her issues. I loved this book because of the emotional connection I felt with Anita, and because I've struggled with many of the same issues she is struggling with, though for very different reasons.That said, the main reason I would NOT recommend this book is there is too much sex. If all I wanted to read about was sex, I'd pick up a sordid romance novel. It only needs to be alluded to, and I'm smart enough to figure out what happened without all the graphic details. It didn't bother me that she had sex with men that were basically strangers. What bothered me is that I had to read all the details about the encounter. I've always felt that what happens in someone's bedroom (or car or where ever else Anita is getting her groove on) is none of my business.Here's hoping that the growth Anita has achieved can be incorporated into the next story along with more plot and much less sex. I'm not ready to give up on the series just yet."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"It took me a really long time to read this book because of all the negative reviews. I am a big fan of this series and have read each of the preceding books. I am now sorry that I took so long to read it. I loved it. I thought it was a great book. At first glance I was intimidated by its length but it was fast paced and intruiging and I read it in two days. Laurell's preceding books were focused more on action, this one was almost exclusively about Anita's personal life. And Yes there are sex scenes, but so what. Laurell explains why everything is becoming increasingly sexual. She is fond of using the comment \\"When all you have is a hammer everything begins to look like a nail\\". Also its not like Anita is totally okay about the sex. The book shows how she is conflicted with all the casual sex and how she is trying to just be content and come to terms with her lot in life. Its funny how everyone who wrote a review is judging her just as harshly as everyone in the book was. All in all I think Laurell took a deep breath, stepped back, and slowed the series down a little with this book. I think that was a good thing. The book didn't span a long time frame and it wasn't so action packed but I think that was the purpose. It put us more in touch with the character of Anita and helped us understand her mind frame and where she is in her life. It was a needed book in the series. I would bet money that Laurell's next Anita book will be back to the action and less personal and I will be waiting for it impatiently."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"What can I say? Was it the best of the series? No. Did it answer all the unresolved questions from previous volumes? No. Was it well edited? No. Did Richard return to being someone I might find halfway worth caring about? No.Was it entertaining, was it enjoyable, did Anita grow, will I be buying the next one-- you bet."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Love, Sex, Blood and PowerThese are the ingredients of the triumvirate formed between Jean Claude, Richard and Anita; Incubus Dreams is an examination of the characters and how they dealing with the changes in their relationships both physical and metaphysical.Just when our main characters begin to feel comfortable with their gifts and relationship to one another, a new complication has arisen with Anita at its center. She inadvertently forms a second triumvirate including Damian as well as Nathanial. This has pros and cons with the major benefit of elevating the original triumvirate's power at the cost of magnifying the demands of the Arduer upon Anita. The book is predominately of how the characters cope with the changes and the moral questions associated with their powers. There's a RPIT investigation involving a group of rogue serial killer vampires that Anita is involved in but that's secondary to the novel's goal of character development.Overall, the book is a good read. Maybe not her best work but still a worthy endeavor deserving of 3.5 to 4 stars. Many have complained about the turn towards prolific sex in recent works but I find her devotion towards character development admirable. So many authors spend little time on it, yet here, she has spent nearly the entire book! Face it, major ingredients in the mythos of vampires and magic are sex and blood. It's going to be there especially in the lives of young adults achieving sexual maturity under what amounts to combat stress....a stress that's eating at the character of Anita. The killing is taking its' toll and it appears sex is the escape she has chosen.I too would like to add my name to the list of fans who would like to see a return to the mysteries and actions of old but does Anita have it in her? Only time will tell"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I agree with a few other posters that there was an amazing amount of sex. Considering there wasn't anything but a few steamy kissing scenes prior to The Killing Dance, Anita seems to be making up for lost time. While I think some of us may disagree with the way Anita is going, it's unfair to say it wasn't a well-laid development.However, there were spelling errors. They were easy mistakes that spell check should have caught. Though that doesn't lessen my enjoyment of the book, I still notice and think a little less of the publisher for it.For the sheer size of Incubus Dreams, not very much time elapsed and a lot of threads seem to be dropped. The actions of the first few hundred pages were not resolved nor addressed.The new powers Anita gains at the drop of a hat are getting a bit old as well. I can usually lend my imagination to the world of the author, but I admit that the constant stream of new powers strains my credulity.Anyhow, that being said, I enjoyed Incubus Dreams a lot. If you take off your couch-Author/Editor hat and skim a few of the sex scenes, it's a very enjoyable Anita book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams was a fun, if slightly disappointing read. The investigation that main character Anita Blake is working on gets very little attention; instead the focus is on Anita's love life.For this reviewer, the fact that the book revolves around Anita's love life rather than a gruesome crime should not be a problem. Ms. Hamilton writes very compelling characters, and a chance to delve deeper into the lives of these characters would be a lot of fun. However, in this book, there did not seem to be a great deal of character development going on, mostly there was just a lot of sex.Anita becomes more comfortable with who and what she has become, Richard seems to be moving in the right direction emotionally as well, and the character of Nathaniel was given a great deal of much needed attention. But that is all that happens in just over 650 pages. Jean Claude was purely a supporting character in this book with no plot or real motivation of his own. Dolph was barely present. Jason was only in one scene, and Asher slept through the entire book. There was nothing happening with the leopard pard, and nothing happening with the wolf pack. Damion, whose relationship with Anita is one of the most interesting, got some pretty decent treatment in the beginning of the book but then disappeared for the most part somewhere in the middle.The author created some really interesting plot threads in Cerulean Sins. I was very much hoping to read more about Dolph's problems with his son, Anita's growing relationship with Asher and, most of all, what was coming with the Mother of all Darkness. None of that was dealt with at all.I gave the book 4 stars because first and foremost the book was fun to read. Laurell K Hamilton is one of my favorite authors, and I am glad that I bought the book. The author introduced some great new characters (Wicked, Truth and Requiem being the best), wrote some really fantastic sex scenes (she always does), and the little bit of character development that we do get is good development. I didn't give the book five stars, because there just was not enough substance to warrant it."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams is Laurell K. Hamilton's 12th Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter novel. I've been reading the series since it was only three books, so you could say I'm a fan. First thing you need to know about Incubus Dreams: there's a LOT of sex in it. If that bothers you, stay away. If not, read on. Several books back, Anita was infected with the ardeur, i.e. she became a succubus, now she has to have sex several times a day. In Incubus Dreams, her control of the ardeur goes out the window; I'd estimate about 3/4 of the book is sex scenes. Thing is, far more than these scenes being just porn (though at their worst they'd be very well-written porn), Laurell uses them as a springboard for meditations on the concepts of friendship, love, sex, commitment, fidelity, monogamy, polygamy, trust, S&M;, and the relationship between pleasure and pain. It's all fascinating stuff, insightful, compassionate, and, while I don't agree with everything she says, I do with 99 percent of it (maybe 99-plus). I'd say Laurell K. Hamilton has her head screwed on pretty straight in these areas.That doesn't mean everything here is wine and roses. As always, Laurell is weak on the gun stuff. She has Anita carry her Browning Hi-Power safety-on but chamber empty, and rack the action to chamber a round while chasing a bad guy. Okay, here it is, folks, coming from someone who makes his living writing about guns, and was a 2002 Washington state combat pistol champion: no one with two brain cells to rub together carries an auto pistol without a round already in the chamber. After that, she has Anita holster her gun chamber loaded with the safety off, just in case she needs to draw and fire fast - she doesn't know that for the well-trained shooter, flipping off the thumb safety adds exactly zero time to the draw and fire stroke. She has Anita let the gun hang at the end of her arm, pointed at the ground as a sort of \\"at rest\\" position. Serious gun people call this \\"dangling.\\" It is invariably the sign of an unsafe, poorly trained person, and a darn good way to shoot yourself in the foot. She has Anita fire a shotgun from the hip, a hideously inaccurate technique despised by every true gunperson. And so on. I cannot read a Laurell K. Hamilton novel without being tempted to write her and say, \\"Look, I do this for a living, would you like me to proof your next manuscript for firearms correctness?\\" The fact I give the current book five stars (and have stayed with the series this long, actually) even though Laurell ALWAYS screws up in my area of professional expertise, every single shot out of the box (pun intended), is an indication of just how strong she is in every other area."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Okay, so I don't mind a lot of porn with my supernatural activities... sue me. But I think what many of the negative reviewers are missing about the book is that, with 12 books written about Anita coming (pun intended)into her power, and injuring so many people she cared about because sex got in her way, that this was the experience that she needed because it finally broke down absolutely every barrier that she had to her power. We've sensed that there's a \\"big bad\\" coming-- we know it's out there, we fully expect our little executioner to kick it's big, bad patookus... but she wasn't up to it until this book. There were too many instances of \\"I'm not going to do that because...\\" in the way. Well, now we know that she'll do anything to keep her people safe. Sex with strangers? Yes. Feed Jean-Claude and all his appetites? Willingly. Doing it with two half-changed were-creatures? Yowza! So, hopefully, these things will not get in her way again. (Although I'm sure they'll come-again, pun intended--her way again. Looking forward to it, in fact.) I'll admit that talking the sex to death got old, but we've been waiting for these many threads of her personal life to wrap themselves up. They did. She has her support system of many-talented, many faceted preternatural men at her back and call, to both feed and be fed by. Now she can keep them all safe. I can't wait to see how."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I've been faithfully reading all of the books in the Anita Blake series ever since I picked up the first three from a book club. If you didn't mind the last book, then you won't mind this one. If you expect quality literature than this entire series isn't for you, and you probably already know that. If you want something thats a fun, fast, and reasonably light read then this is a great choice. If the idea of Anita having sex with something like 8 different men in the course of the book (sometimes only implied) than this probably isn't for you. I'm giving it three stars because it gave me an enjoyable couple of hours to let myself relax and be entertained but it wasn't anything particularily exceptional, and in fact (like its direct predecessor) was not really up to par with some of Hamilton's other books.On the other hand, it really is exactly the sort of book that I want for light reading, something that i can read even when I'm stressed or distracted, but without the inanity of a common romance novel."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Okay, to address all of the reviews I've seen:1: There aren't missing words. I almost thought the same thing about some of the sentences, but the truth is, when it's said aloud, it makes perfect sense. We're used to conversations and thoughts in novels being perfectly, almost stupidly simple (in some cases) and organized, and what LKH has done is simply used sentences as one would in a normal conversation. Apparently, the results were not liked by fans. If you allow yourself the chance, it really isn't that difficult to get used to. Also, as to the pomme de sangS comment, Americans aren't exactly commonly fluent in French, perhaps LKH felt the need to simplify it for them so they understood it was plural. Either way works.2: Yes, everyone by now probably knows LKH has transitioned into an erotic author. Here's the deal: you know what to expect, yet you keep feeling disappointed when you get it. Trust me, if you ignore the books, you'll find its not as difficult as you think to drag yourself away if your opinion of them is so low. Or maybe you just like to whine.Now, about the book:Sex. Yes, a lot, LOT of sex. It's a good thing LKH doesn't write in purple prose, because otherwise it would be a lot of flowery nonsense. No, luckily, her sex scenes are readible, even if they don't affect you, and most of the time she includes thoughts and a little dialogue that don't waste the pages. In fact, they offer some insight to the changes Anita has made, perhaps as justification by the author, whom I understand has changed a lot herself in the previous years.Nathaniel fans may get a kick out of this book, as he's in it more now than ever. Micah, as always, is an unimportant character without much personality. Richard makes a comeback and he and Anita get a few details about their breakup sorted out, while Jean-Claude is still a semi-important character. Everyone else pretty much takes a back seat, including some of the people Anita sleeps with. There is an interesting Tarot reading at the beginning that I think obsessed fans should look out for, as it may very well offer some tantalizing clues to Anita's future, as well as perhaps her future full-blown love...if indeed she ever has one.Anita forms a fully, four-marked triumvert and positive as well as negative elements come with the deal.About the mystery: It is not the main focus. I don't know the numbers, but the last section of the novel is reserved for almost all of the action. This mystery is tied in with vampire power, of course, and once more, there are portents of a future fight with some pretty wicked beings. For now, Anita seems to be making alliances and gaining powers.Another note to mention: LKH takes the oportunity to introduce a problem to Anita that seems odd and out of sync with the rest of the novel. It sticks out and should be paid attention to. Her meeting with the Browns is probably far from the last time Anita will be seeing the couple. They've got problems, and are desperate enough to keep trying to get what they want, even if they have to use illegal means."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I loved this book.

I hope the writing improves regarding plot, as for steaminess she already excels in that area."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I won't repeat the detailed reports of other reviewers, but I can not hold back my frustration. LKH used to be one of my favorite authors. But the the number of continuity errors, spelling errors and just bad writing/editing have reached a point where they are infuriating. The repetative pet phrases and the complete lack of pacing are amateurish. The way the 'plot' is put on hold for the majority of the book for the sex scenes (or more to the point, the ad nauseum talking about the sex) is simply self-indulgent.If what you really love about the Anita Blake books is the endless romantic analysis, the beautiful men and their slavish devotion to Anita, and the hot, erotic sex scenes, you're obviously the audience for whom LKH is writing now, and you may like this book, because there is plenty of that. If you're looking for the mystery/intrigue/adventure that characterized LKH's earlier work, you will only be frustrated here."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"OK... granted this book meandered from plot to subplot to sidebar and sometimes back again, and yes it read more like a \\"Letter to Penthouse\\" than your typical LKH novel... but let's just chalk it up to... well I don't know what you can chalk it up to. Anyway, I will reserve judgment until the next installment to see where things go. After all, any \\"Anita\\" book can't be all bad and this one still has plenty of supernatural ruffhousing and metaphysical fun!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Strange direction to the series this book takes.

Every book in this series (with the exception of Obsidian Butterfly) has become more erotic in stepwise fashion as Anita's Catholic inhibitions are broken down one step at a time. Many readers appear to be disgusted with this particular book because of the kinky sex, sex, sex throughout. There is hardly any mystery and no significant resolution of said mystery. I view this book differently than many. Rather, I see it as a transition point in the series for the development of the characters. Now that many of the erotic pressures are 'out of the way' and Anita is accepting of what she has become, I feel the series may be able to move in a different direction (ie, better quality of sex scenes, NOT quantity -- make them count toward the plot). This book introduces a new group of dangerous vampires and proposes a major problem with the Church of Eternal Life. Plotlines which I am sure will be explored in later books. (Ms. Hamilton is contracted at least thru book 15, I have been told.) Overall, as a major fan of the series, I found it very satisfying. The only regret I had when reading it was previously reading her short story in the 'Cravings' anthology. This short story became the plot for the first full third of the book -- and if I had been warned, I would not have read it and ruined the first part of this novel."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I loved this book. I have been a fan of Laurell K. Hamilton and the Anita Blake series for 10 years now and she has NEVER disappointed me. INCUBUS DREAMS is wonderfully written and explores the relationships Anita finds herself in and her attempts to renew her friendships as well as trying to pull her personal relationships together. I am so in love with Jean Claude and Anita that I cried when I reached the last page and then had to start the whole series over again so I could stay close to them."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Anita Blake books are like salted peanuts; it's hard to stop reading them. The characters are amusing, and the urge to find out what happens to them has kept me going through two near-changes of genre and some severe challenges to my suspension of disbelief (how big is that woman's mouth, anyhow?).Incubus Dreams is above average for the series, although the mystery element is left half-solved with only a hope of resolution in the future. It's not as mechanical as some of the past books, and the effects seem to have causes more often than usual. It's not up to the standard of Obsidian Butterfly, the best-written of the later books in the series, but it's not bad. Anybody who truly is going to object to a little mild porn quit reading two books ago, so I don't believe complaints about that at this point; if you don't like it, why do you keep coming back for more? Actually, it's a good read, and parts of it take Our Heroine to places where many have wished she'd shut up and go a few volumes back.I am bothered by the careless use of language and the lack of attention to detail. Words are misused and misspelled on almost every page. Every time it happens I am jerked out of the world of the story by irritation at the sloppy writing.Many of the problems are with homophones, the sort of thing that a computer spellchecker wouldn't catch: phase and faze, sight and site, etc. But there are also simple misspellings; in Incubus Dreams, the word 'suave' is misspelled three times in the course of two sentences. The author doesn't seem to know much if anything about pronoun cases, and half the time when she does use 'whom' she uses it wrong. Possessive pronouns often come complete with apostrophes, and so do some simple plurals. Punctuation is spotty and sometimes confusing (\\"Who are you to play, God?\\").Richard's bodyguards: when did they exchange titles? Why is it impossible for a multiple vampire victim to become a vampire here but not in Circus of the Damned? Sometimes Damian is one of Belle Morte's line, sometimes not; and how old is he, anyway? It was Shelley who drowned, not Byron, as she says here. This sort of thing happens again and again. I may seem to be nitpicking, but these small things are like stop signs interrupting the flow of the story, and this book and all the books would be much better without them. Ms. Hamilton doesn't need an editor so much as she needs a good literate proofreader.Some things are much improved here, though. Many of the tired phrases from the other books, while present, aren't as omnipresent as in the past. The eyes aren't drowning as often, and the bench pressing and arm wrestling have largely been given a rest. She's picked up a couple of new ones she needs to watch: 'metaphysical' is overused, and the construction 'we are so not...' is there every few pages. Personally, I'm getting tired of being reminded that Nathaniel has lavender eyes every single time he shows up.All in all, though, if you've read this far, I think you'll enjoy this one. It's good and long, and nice and juicy, and so are most of the characters."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Having been a very long-time fan of Anita Blake, I have to rate this latest in the Vampire Hunter series as one of the best! When you look at each of the books subjectively, from Guilty Pleasures to Incubus Dreams, you realize the true evolution of the characters, most especially Anita herself. Anita is shedding her skin, and with her, Richard is coming to terms with his life (for now!) With Jean-Claude, perhaps they'll make it all work.I also write short stories, and just marvel at the scope of what LKH has created here. She challenges alot of mores that many, many people - myself included - consider outside their comfort zone or 'something that just isn't done'. Hey, what can I say, I was raised Catholic! BUT - the characters have depth, they are real and believable. For me, these books push all my buttons...strong central characters with their own flaws and irresistability...humans, vampires and lycanthropes: the stories aren't sugar-coated and pretty - because the reality wouldn't be either with creatures that crave flesh and blood. There's violence, gore, horror, passion, humor, pain, and mystery...You can really put yourself THERE, because her writing is so vivid.There isn't another vampire series out there that can compare...sure, a lot of folks won't agree with me. That's okay - I can't for the life of me read Anne Rice...different strokes for different folks!If they ever tried to make a movie, they couldn't do the series justice, nor keep its integrity (read 'PG13'). Perhaps an Anime movie-toon...?Who knows. A rabid fan like myself can only speculate and wonder.So, while anticipating the NEXT Anita Blake, I'll get my fix until then by periodically re-reading the series: for the UMPTEENTH time!(...but the next Merry Gentry is on it's way...&#60;&#60;Very Big Grin&#62;&#62;)"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I love all Laurell K Hamilton's imaginings. For all you non-believers out there, patience is a virtue.... Even though the sex seems to get tiresome, and Anita's mind is a jumble, it helps you to feel some of what she is feeling. After all, it is written in the first person. One must also consider that there are now two books after Incubus Dreams. Micah may be disappointingly short, and I have not yet read Danse Macabre, but it is apparent to me that you just have to keep reading. The books are going somewhere, and as far as I am concerned, I don't want them to end! They are my escape from the mundane. So, do not desert our fair heroine!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I read all the other reviews and just had to add my two cents worth. I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Yes, the sex is over the top but well done. We've had 11 books of Anita trying to get past her hang-ups and finally, boy does she ever! I thought this book fleshed out Nathaniel and Micha better than they have before, and some interesting new characters are introduced and lined up to appear in future books. If a serious mystery book with only a little steaminess is your thing, well then this isn't the book for you. But to be fair, I think this book was all about Anita and Jean Claude consolidating their power base. As has been revealed in books since this one, I continue to think LKH tries to juggle too many characters."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I loved this book. Truly and simply, loved it. Some fans are going against the book because of the sex, but I believe the series has developed toward the sex. The sex did not suddenly appear or get thrown into the mix. It has always been there. It is just now with different partners, and an increased amount. I did not however find myself overburdened with the sex or putting the book down because of plot inconsistences. I found a plot. It was around the emotional life of Anita and her men, as well as trying to figure out how to fix the mess she has gotten into. I saw character development. She FINALLY admits to Nathaniel that he means something to her, she realizes that she is treating Damian horribly, she has a long, emotionally-wrought conversation with Jean-Claude that had me in tears....I found that this book pulled me in and left me breathless. Fans of the series cannot let the new developments deter them from reading this book and enjoying it. I believe that they have seen bad moments in the previous book and applied it to this one. I am in no way belittling Cerulean Sins. I loved it too, although it had a few parts that could have been better. I respect other reader's decisions based on this book, but they are not treating the situation with class and respect for the author's hard work. Laurell worked hard on this story, which I think was reflected on every page. I jumped for joy when I saw the page count because I knew a lot of things were going to get addressed, and they did! I laughed with Anita, I cried with her, I groaned with her, I found myself sympathizing with her. I cannot believe how quickly people turned on the author because of the sexual content. It does not take away from the story as a whole, as it adds emotion to the series and the character's development. Sex is a part of life. It is a part of a relationship. And Anita's choices for sexual partners, or words to use during sex, are strictly her choice. They were always her personality that was constantly growing toward a newer, more open-minded person. I do not find that her character suffers in any way toward development and I feel sorry for all the readers who do feel that way. They need to overlook the negatives because I think they are influencing people to not buy this book based on their own conclusions. Dear Readers, you should BUY this book, and make your own decision. Do not let anything negative touch your ears until you read the book yourself because you may find things that you like. If you go into the reading believeing it will be bad, then it will, which I DO NOT see in this book. There may have needed to be a little more mystery, but that was put aside for the emotional reasons which I understand. I would not change the book if the emotional scenes between Jean-Claude, etc. were taken out. Please, LKH, do not change and write as you see the world. It keeps me interested and jumping out of my seat for more."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The whole thing about this book being too sexual...may be true. Lets think about this logically however. Animals-like leopards...have sex..people have sex. Relationships can be purely sex based..it happens.This is a good book over all, and well writen despite a few typos here and there. I really hope this saga goes on, or i'll have to write my own!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"If you like the personal drama, and darkly sexual supernatural soap flavor of Anita Blake's life, the new book delivers a fully packed read that explores in depth Anita's relationships to the many interesting characters that inhabit her world. No, this isn't an open and shut mystery novel, if you want that you are in the wrong book section. This is fantasy adventure, full of vampires and shapeshifters and a world trying to cope with the full knowledge that magic exists and it's DANGEROUS.There is plenty of sex, and those who want vanilla or inspirational romance stuff, get over it. Anita Blake's world moves far beyond the pre-set paint by number romance plot that some want it to be. It's full of messy emotions and imperfect solutions as Anita struggles with her place in dark, often seamy, underworld of the supernatural beings that she becomes more and more caught up in.This is a world where Dominance and Submission are part of the culture of the Vampires and Werewolves, as the powerful command and the strong must fight for their power and to protect that which is dear to them. Anita has grown in power since the earliest books, and is now a force to be reckoned with in the society of monsters, both human and other. Beyond personal magics, power also depends on a treacherously delicate weave of alliances and rivalries.Different cabals plot to bring about changes to Anita's entire world and her own alliance with Master Vampire Jean Claude and various leaders of the shapeshifters in St. Louis holds a critical position in the unfolding events that can affect the destiny of everyone she cares for, and her entire world.Incubus Dreams adds more to an enthralling ongoing story and for those who like their fantasy dark, sexual, and not overly clean cut and tidy, this books delivers a very satisfying portion of an over all feast of fantasy and dark erotic power play."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This is one of the best Anita Blake novels in the series. True fans of Anital Blake will really enjoy this book because there is finally growth in the main character. There is resolution in the many realtionships that have been forming in the previous novels. I can't wait for Anita Blake # 13."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Packed with plotline and resolution to a lot of the ongoing personal angst and relationship confusion that Anita has been going through for many books. Anita has found her balance with dealing with the Ardeur and in accepting the many types of love and support that the men in her life provide.This is a real turning point book. While not my favorite of the series it is definitely one of the top ones because it's defining the characters closest to Anita, as well as Anita herself. This is the culmination of several books, where Anita's personal life and powers have been growing more intense and varied, and she finally gets a handle on things and makes the best of what she's got.If you are looking for a open and shut, cut and dried Nancy Drew mystery, this book is not for you. However if you are looking for something darker, more sexual, where black and white have blurred out to beguiling shades of gray, and the heroine is embracing the shadows, this latest installment of the ongoing Anita story is a rare delight.Very happy with Incubus Dreams. Can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book was truly amazing. The amount of power that the characters have gained in this book alone was staggering! Yes there was sex but it was not gratuitous. Every time Anita takes her clothes off you can assume the power is going to fly! I have read a couple of reviews stating that the murders are not solved but I have to disagree. They are solved to the best of their abilities at this time. I read this book in about 3 days and I am now going through withdrawal. I can say without a doubt that if you have followed the Anita series from the beginning, the character growth in this book is what you have been waiting for. WAY TO GO LAURELL!! You've done it again!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Anita Blake is still shoot before asking too many questions, but she is coming to terms with her varied sex life. Just because she isn't fighting every man in her life does not mean that she can still be cold hearted and kill when necessary.I went back and read the last few previous novels and this one is finally getting some of the issues straigtened out ( this is a long series of books). It is a relief that she has these men and can still do the job she was made for. I loved the sex, crime solving and the messy part of her private life. Way to go Laurell K. Hamilton.

Anita Blake is cooping with her new preternatural powers so she's dealing with the good and the bad. It had alot of sexual encounters i was hoping for anyway! hehe. But still i loved it. This time Miss Blake didn't get to catch the bad guy, they got away. Something that has never happened to her before. So it's going to be interesting how the next book will continue. Instead of seeing her cold, executioner side, we get to experience her more emotional side again, not just a glimpse either, anita will cry and more than once. I thought it can never be done!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"a good read if you are a fan . not as good as some of her earlier works but, i still could'nt put it down."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"There is a lot of negative feedback on this book from what i have read. I thoroughly enjoyed it myself. There wasn't as much fighting...Anita is getting very very powerful and I am very curious to see where her powers are going. There is more character development of Anita and her love life than anything else. There is a lot more sex than usual and Micah's role was downplayed just a bit compared to the last book BUT Nathaniel rules the book and I have to say that he is one of my favorite characters. I was also getting mad at Richard in the past two books and he was able to redeem himself a bit in this one. I don't want to give any spoilers but finished the book with good feelings. I can't wait for number 13!!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have to disagree with all the complaints from other reveiwers. Yes, the Anita Blake books used to have more police/necromancer work involved in the plot. Yes, the relationships were about love and not lust. But, who of us has not had our private lives overshadow our professional lives at some point.I feel that Laurell Hamilton is just exploring the natural progression of Anita's character as she comes to terms with her new powers. This book had Anita come to control the ardeur - only to find that this complicated other issues for her; of course this would result in lots more angst and sex-guilt.If half of the reviewers here were honest they probably would like to be in Anita's place and have the pleasure of sex with everyone in the book but without the guilt. If Anita didn't get 'whiny' and 'angst-ridden', given her circumstances, I would think less of her.I read the book in one day - and as far as I am concerned any author who can write such a page turner needs to be embraced not criticised.Roll on book 13 and the next Meredith Gentry book too!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Anita Blake, vampire executioner, has gone through some metamorphosis over the series.Along the series, Anita warred with her catholic upbringing in her relationships. I used to feel a little frustrated and wished she'd just go for it. As quoted from the novel, 'beware what you wish for'. In one poignant chapter, she compares her loss of control of her body with the torture scene from the novel \\"Blue Moon\\", whence she lost her innocence of another kind.She is no longer a true Human, since marrying the marks with Jean-Claude and Richard, she is gaining the powers of a Master Vampire. Jean-Claude is an Incubus and being his Servan, Anita inherited Succubus powers. She can literally love men to death.A heavy book (over 600 pages), it's a breathless arm chair reading, perfect for a hot and steamy summer night."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Wow! I know this book did not get very good reviews, but I LOVED it. Yes, there is a lot of sex...good sex I might add, but there is also a lot of emotion. Everyone seems to be coming to terms with who they are or at least visibly trying to come to terms...I bet you can guess who I am referring to there. People are growing up and we really get to see a side of some we have not yet seen...one of whom happens to be my favorite and another who is now my second favorite. It's a wonderful thing. I think there was a good amount of mystery and work in the book though I will agree that on some aspects it would have been nice to see them more flushed...not much though. The mystery was nice and strong, I liked it and it was left open to possible be more, which I like even more. If you are a TRUE die hard Anita fan, then you are going to LOVE this book. If your interest started waning at NIC, then don't even bother!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I LOVED this book! So, I was truly surprised to read some of the negative reviews above. Some reviewers seemed so disgusted with the sexual situations that they were compelled to label & condemn them as Bestiality, Pedophilia and such. Come on! Then again, if I hadn't been eased into the \\"Blake reality\\" by reading the entire series, I may have thought similarly... Until recently, I've been a \\"traditional\\" reader, so to speak and I remember being a little perturbed by the 1st Anita Blake book, but immensely curious, obviously. Maybe if \\"Incubus Dreams\\" had been my first \\"Anita Blake\\", then perhaps,it may have been my last. Luckily, I've traveled with Anita though them all. And just as LKH allowed Anita to grow and slowly accept who she is, the reader has been given the same opportunity: to learn & change our misconceptions about our realities. \\"Never Say Never\\" is the moral of the story. Anita's reluctance of her gifts, her fear of intimacy & the inability to accept herself is because she has been taught by society to \\"see\\" her traits as \\"evil, perverted & ugly\\". Notice how often, like so many of us, she keeps seeing glimpses of the \\"monster\\", \\"the nympho\\", \\"coffin-bait\\" that she appears to be through the eyes of other humans. And like us, she cringes at what she sees through judgmental eyes. In my opinion, Anita's powers and the sexual taboos are simply a metaphor for all the \\"untapped\\" potential in each of us and the fear/shame we must overcome to live a happy life. Anita must overcome her shame of sexual contact (the biggest taboo of them all) to become her own powerful self. One day, Anita will not need the deceiving \\"mirror of society\\" to see her beautiful face. LKH is a genius & a philosopher, I will faithfully await for any work she produces!! Again, if you are a true Anita Blake fan, and leave your prejudices outside, you will not be disappointed. AWESOME!!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I thought this was one of Laurell K. Hamilton's better books. It was about time Anita grew up and realized that she wasn't your run of the mill, average human. Though the book focused more on Anita than on monster hunting we are beginning to see into her soul. She has finally begun to develop into the character she was meant to be."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"For all you people that gave this a less than kind review: shut up and deal with it. This book was a great advancement in Anita's life, maybe the mystery wasn't the focus of the book, but \\"real\\" life isn't always a mystery. I liked the fact that Anita had time to deal with herself. Plus, the new power levels she and the boys reach are important.I have to admit Asher and Edward are sadly missed, but when a world like the Anita Blake universe becomes so rich and full of character and detail it stands to reason some characters won't be directly involved with the plot. Not to mention, the first person perspective means that anyone that doesn't see Anita in person won't appear in the book.In terms of typos and spelling errors; yes there are a bunch, but there have always been typos in LKH;s books, if you haven't come to terms with that by the 12th book then you have a problem. And if you are reading this Ms. Hamilton I'd be delighted to proofread for you.I would also like to point out that LKH is publishing almost two novels a year. Keep it up!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"When you ask yourself the above question more than twice during the course of a series, it's time to hang it up. However, I just can't stop reading. It's sort of like a train wreck--you don't want to look, but you can't help yourself. Hamilton has never been a good writer. The Blake books are a far cry from literary fiction. However, with each book, the writing and editing gets worse.The sex is interesting at best, and weird at least. There is an annoying focus on Anita being the dominant in a relationship, thus giving all of her worst qualities (egotism, arrogance, etc) free reign. However, when the world really DOES revolve around you, what other qualities can you have? Nathaniel is probably the only interesting character in the series, at this point. For a few chapters, I thought we'd get some insight on Damien, but that didn't happen. The murder mystery is frustrating because it is mentioned in one chapter, ignored in another 300 pages or so, and then brought back. When I read Narcissus in Chains, I was glad that Anita wasn't such a prude. However, going from prudish to astonishingly promiscuous isn't really a believable character arc.I gave this book two stars instead of one because a)I couldn't stop reading it, no matter how much I disliked it, and b)Nathaniel. I really wouldn't recommend buying it in hardback form. Check it out from the library or wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Ok, I've been a diehard LKH since Guilty Pleasures, I've read all her work I can get my hands on, but I'm sorry, this book sucked!

I mean, don't get me wrong , its nice, but not 700 pages worth of it!Some things here are dealt with I guess, with plp psycho-analyzing other people, and some metaphysical twists, but the whole book from page 100 on is just so....predictable, except maybe which stranger Anita's gonna screw next.

Hamilton and Anita Blake Vampire Hunter on a toy collector's forum a few years ago from a fan of the series. I picked up Guilty Pleasures, the first book, and rather enjoyed. Now fast forward a few years. I just picked up the audio version of the book Incubus Dreams, which is book twelve in this series not having read the other ten books in between. So I had high expectations for this story.I finally finished the audio version of Laurell K. Hamilton's Incubus Dreams. Thank god I was listening to the abridged version (only 10 discs) instead of the unabridged version (24 discs). Twelve hours of this droll was bad enough I don't think I could have made it through thirty hours.So what exactly did they cut out of this story for the abridged version? I thought perhaps major plot points were dropped. But according to the reviews I was reading about the book that might not be the case. So did they must have cut out some of the sex or perhaps the sexual scenes had gone into to more graphic detail than what I was getting. I don't know and I have no intentions of finding out.I will read her earlier works (I loved Guilty Pleasures when I read that a few years ago and now in comic book form from Marvel), but I don't think I will bother with any of the books beyond this one. Incubus Dreams is 12th in the Anita Blake series so I will have plenty to check out before I finally give up on this author.If I wish to read (or in this case hear) pure Vampire/Werewolf erotic fantasy I will look for books likeDeep Inside: Extreme Erotic Fantasiesby Polly Frost. With Anita Blake I was hoping for a Vampire mystery with a little sex in the mix, not that the entire story would be filled with only sex. We lost the whole aspect of any mystery or case a few chapters into this storyline and never got it back again until the very end of the book. Everything in between was one sexual experience after another. We had characters come and go too easily without any story development. What happened to the Vampire servant Damian? Anita f--ks him and he has a complete vampiric break down only to drop out of the story completely without resolving the problems brought on by the encounter. That is only one of many, many flaws with this story. The story ends with what else, more sex and the mystery is left unresolved. Not that I will be picking up book 13 in the series any time soon to see if this author bothers to fill her readers in or not.My suggestion is to stay away from this story. Go ahead and read the earlier works of this author but don't bother with this book. Even better check out the comic book version ofAnita Blake, Vampire Hunter: Guilty Pleasures(at least she is actually hunting vampires, raising the dead and dealing with werewolves instead of just f--king them all).As I said I was listening to this story. I did not yet touch on the flaws in the audio version, which is published by Brilliance Audio and read by Cynthia Holloway. Cynthia does a good job of rendering the characters and keep our interest even if the story can't. My biggest problem with the audio version is the production. The publishing company Brilliance Audio sees fit to add unneeded audio at the beginning and end of each disk. Most people today take their discs and turn them into MP3s, which is what I did and that is why I found the fade in/out music and notice to put in the next disk a real distraction. Combine that with the repeated two or three lines of text from the previous disc and the annoyance only compounded. So drop the unwanted extras from your audio discs and maybe they will be easier to listen, although even that would not have helped this story."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton, Incubus Dreams (Berkley, 2004)Here we are in the twelfth Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter book. It's been quite a while since Anita Blake did all that much vampire hunting (and what she's been doing with vampires recently has very little to do with hunting). Perhaps it's time to get back to some vampire hunting?In this one, Anita juggles boyfriends, emotes, kind of makes up with Richard after meeting his new girlfriend, and, oh, investigates a handful of murders along the way. And that's what's been bugging me about the last few novels in the series; the mystery angle is an afterthought. It's not so much that the series has turned into a soap opera, but that it's turned into a soap opera that's still trying to keep its original readership by still including a few pages (I'd say 5% of the book's six hundred fifty) devoted to the original premise of the series, preternatural crimes.Still, for all that, I can't be too incensed with Hamilton, because I'm still reading them, and I'm still interested in the soap opera.

Just when i think we might be getting somewhere with zombies and animating it turns into another sex fest. And it took until page 240 something to even mention anything other than Anita's crazy sex life. In fact she was clothed just long enough to argue with a client before needing to be \\"rescued from her condition\\".I also agree with another reader when they said if she wants to write erotic fiction she should label it as such. It seems the days of crime solving and life and death situation is gone from Anita's life.

I didn't mind the writing style because this is a first person novel and Anita has her own style of discussion that in and of itself is fairly repetitive. But I find it odd that Anita resolves her own hangups by jumping into bed or backseats or desks or anyplace else with almost the nearest warm body.I didn't mind the sex for the most part, and I did like the book but Anita books are starting to resemble Merry books in that they take hundreds of pages to cover an unbelievably short time and go a very short distance to advance the story. I'm sure LKH has an ultimate destination in mind-but we could do with a lot less repetitive sex and a few hundred pages less."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The story opens with Anita at the wedding of her friend and co-worker Larry Kirkland. By the end of the evening she is called to a crime scene where a stripper is murdered by vampire bites. To make matters worse she inadvertantly forms a second triumverate. This grants her and those linked to her more power.Anita grapples with the addition to her power and more responsibility to others (especially those linked to her by metaphysical ties) and finds that if she does not take care of herself everyone suffers. She struggles to juggle work and her new legal power as a Federal Marshall even as yet another mystery is dropped into her hands.In an effort to come to grips with her growing power, she turns to her vampire lover Jean-Claude and the reluctant former flame the were-wolf Richard, who find they are also gaining from this increasing power base. Finally, they all bind themselves together-tighter because together they are far stronger than they are apart. Life is never easy nor dull for this particular Vampire Hunter.Laurell K. Hamilton is a gifted writer, with the ability to create fabulous secondary characters, spine-tingling thrillers, and great mysteries. This particular book does not quite deliver on any of this. Instead we are introduced to a few mysteries that are never adequately answered and the rest of the book is devoted to her exploring her sexual awakening through the 'ardeur'. The coup-de-grace is given when Anita performs and discusses in mental self-talk how to 'deep throat' as well as vocalizing and participating in her preference for a menage-a-trois. In addition, the author is quite clear that Anita is crossing all of her boundaries, mentally, physically and spiritually. Even as she explores her expanding veiws, her tolerance of conservatism dimishes, especially with those who do not share her perceptions.This book strikes one as more of a 'filler'. Two mysteries remain (only one partly answered and not very well). One hopes this will be answered in the next book. Even though this may not be considered her best work, I would recommend this to anyone following Anita's adventures but be warned of the explicit sex."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I finally borrowed a copy of this doorstop from my friend fully expecting to hate it based on all the reviews I had read. I am pleased to say it is nowhere near as bad as I expected it to be and it might even be worth the price charged to own it, although I still haven't decided if I will buy it for myself or not.Yes there are a lot of typos and her new favorite word seems to be spilled. Everything spills in this book except milk.However, of all the books, I think this is the one that really starts to try and make sense of the Ardeur, the metaphysical affliction of lust that causes Anita to hump any man she can restrain with her hands. (Interesting side note, Anita is always turning down men, but they are always willing to sleep with her. Surely there is a man somewhere who would feel no attraction to Anita and her penchant for orgies? Surely there is a man who would say no.)That being said, I was bored. Don't get me wrong, the writing is good, Laurel can write and there is a coherent storyline, but I don't really want to endlessly debate the Ardeur.One of the key complaints I have about the Merry Gentry series is that when people aren't having sex they are talking about sex and all this literary foreplay kills the mood for me. It's like psychoanalyzing a person's sex life and it doesn't really move the story forward in my opinion. So ergo, it's boring. Sex is not plot, it can be a plot device but sex cannot carry a 600+ page book, not even in erotica.Now with Incubus Dreams I see that same dynamic at play. Talk, have sex, talk about the sex you just had, talk about what it means and various sexual hang ups for about 30 pages, have sex again and make it so spectacular it spans three chapters, talk about it and ruminate on future sex, have sex yet again, decide you need a shower, debate whether or not you'll have sex in the shower, take a chapter to work on the serial killer mystery, end up dry humping a suspect during an interrogation, meet ex-boyfriend you're still half in love with and determine he doesn't have the right to touch you anymore, but in the end you let him and guess what, you have sex again, this time with your current boyfriend participating.Sorry to say, for me, it gets a bit tedious. I don't care about anyone's sex life enough to want to read the excruciating psychosexual minutiae Hamilton seems to be specializing in. I'd be bored even if she were writing about my sex life. Wait, not fair, it's entirely possible my sex life is boring to begin with.Anyway, the other main criticism launched at this book is that the mystery plot is weak and unresolved. I don't know if I agree with this criticism. The mystery is solid and I think the way it was resolved or left unresolved (whichever way you swing on that one) speaks to Anita's character development as opposed to any failing by the author to complete the story. If you've read the book, go back to the conversation where she's talking to the cop from the team that helped her storm the house and I think you can see the logic for why things ended the way they did. Anita is not functioning very well and we're starting to see the burnout with the way Anita lets the case go even though she now knows who the killer his and that he will kill again.Even so, I do think Laurel spent too little time on the mystery and way too much time on the personal angst stuff which is why people may not be happy with the mystery. Her ratio of personal life to mystery is off kilter and I hope she can strike a better balance in future books.So it's worth a read and I give a cautious recommendation to buy."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Capsule review: Heavy on emotional baggage, lots of sex, progress in the areas of magical powers and overcome inhibitions, very light on plot, very VERY light on proofreading. Sadly, it's probably my least favorite of all the Anita Blake novels. Sad, since it's the longest of them, and my biggest problem to date was that I would tear through LKH's books in hours, and be left happy, but wanting more story after I was done.My biggest gripe with this novel is not what I've seen most often complained about here in other reviews, namely that it's so heavy on sex. I LIKE all sorts of adventuresome erotica, it's fun! Threesomes? Groovy. Sex with werecritters? Hey, they need love, they're people too, so bring it on! However, it's better when done to further the plot, rather than when what plot there is seems to shuffle between chapter after chapter of either sex, or the characters agonizing over interpersonal issues regarding sex and each other.My real gripe is that the novel doesn't MOVE like previous books did. It sort of sluggishly meanders back to a half-forgotten mystery every few hundred pages. I kept getting a mental image of Anita showering off after sex, with a vague feeling like she's forgotten something. \\"Did I need to get groceries? Noo... More ammunition? Nah, got plenty out in the Jeep... Are we almost out of condoms? No, Jean-Claude sent me a bucketful... OH YEAH!!!\\" as she smacks her forehead with her palm \\"We've gotta find out who's been killing those strippers!\\" Earlier books left me breathless, as Anita would dash from moment to moment, crisis to crisis, being tough as nails, boldly snatching victory from the jaws of etc... It was fast-paced, exciting, you never knew what would happen in the next chapter. With this book, nine times out of ten when you turn to a new chapter, the same people are in the same room, talking about the same stuff, maybe wearing less clothes.It's my sincere hope that in the next novel(s) two things will happen: First, that after several hundred pages in I.D. of Anita agonizing over her relationships with people, fighting with herself and everyone else about what she really needs and wants, that she finally can resolve a lot of the emotional problems that turned her from someone who kicked ass to someone who, in this novel, just sat on it a lot. Second, it would be a simple enough thing to write the ardeur into a much less important role. I can think of several potentially valid ways to do it without too much effort. It's important to the plot, and to the powers from Belle Morte's bloodline, sure, but it's taken up too much of a prominent role in Anita's life. You can't go chasing after bad guys only to stop and have an orgy every few hours to recharge your magical batteries. Well, you can, but then this book happens again.As for the proofreading... sweet baby $deity, what happened? This one wasn't really LKH's fault, but running across that many obvious errors is just distracting, and rather breaks up whatever amount of \\"flow\\" the story starts to develop. On a purely personal level, I was somewhat disappointed to see what I'm pretty sure was supposed to be \\"squick\\" changed to \\"squeak\\" by an editor lacking in clue.I enjoyed reading Incubus Dreams, but it pales in comparison to the rest of the series. Please! Laurell, you can do better!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"It would be interesting to divide the book up and compare how much of the book is spent having sex vs. how much on the actual plot? The plot itself is introduced but never followed through. So many story lines are left hanging in the air, including the case she was on about a serial killer that didn't manage to be solved in 658 pages. Her characters, as always, are engaging but her story lacks anything solid to stand on.Read it if you've read the other books in the series, if not, don't bother. That's the only reason why I read it - even though the last one and this one are very disapointing to say the least, I feel obligated to finish out the story of Anita Blake."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I loved the Anita Blake books up till now. It was nothing but porn that made me feel like throwing the book away. There is no substance to the plot I wasted my money. Bring back the Anita of old stop draging out the ardeur thing who cares anyway if it makes a character like Anita act like she's in heat bring back the story line bring back the series that I enjoyed and the tough, kick ass Anita Blake we have grown to enjoy. Lets hope she doesn't mess up the Merry books as well."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I find I'm both loving and hating this book. I'll start with the negative and end on the positive. The negative half of this is that I am confused as all hell. I have no idea WHAT's going on. Very few loose ends laid out in the series were tied up, and now there are a million more that have just sprouted out. I have absolutely no problem with the amount of sex that is going on, but I'm more upset about the fact is I don't find them titillating at all. The delivery is sloppy, wordy, and excessive and I'm yawning through them. The one scene that really starting to grip my attention with Nathanial (who I have been waiting books and books and books for a good sex scene with) got totally destroyed because Anita stops all the foreplay and stuff to have a freakin' heart to heart about her sexual hang ups with Jason who is sitting there watching! She and Nathanial supposedly didn't \\"lost the mood\\" because of it, but I sure did.I also agree with A. Pang about how many times she uses \\"spill, spilling, and spilled\\" and how everybody screams in this book. Though by now, it keeps sending me into fits of giggles everytime I read it.I think the worst part is I keep getting reminded I'm reading a book, not being part of the story, and that's really a shame.Now for the parts I'm really enjoying. I am liking very much the character development. I think it's on par for Anita, and it is progressing nicely, learning valuble life's lessons with some very deep insights that make you stop and think. Richard is slowly coming to grips with himself, JC is relaxing a bit, and best of all, Nathaniel gets a personality! Yippee! I love all the little extra tidbits about the personal life and hobbies of the characters that's been added. It makes them all a bit more real. Plus, I'm just loving how all the men in Anita's life are finally giving her the proverbial smacks upside the head. Those are the moments that make you go \\"YEAH!\\"All in all, I give it three stars. I really think this book could have been managed a lot better (interestingly enough, from what I gathered reading LKH's blog, she wasn't too happy about the way it was going either), but I still think it will sit nicely on my shelf, and be ready to pick up again some rainy night. And I'll still buy LKH's novels!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams is the longest Anita Blake novel so far, finishing up at over 750 pages. It didn't really need to be this long. The mystery wasn't hugely complicated. The ongoing mystical/metaphysical repercussions of Anita's relationships with the \\"monsters\\" was absolutely perfect, but not extreme enough to necessitate hundreds upon hundreds of pages. As seems to be the case with some of the later Anita Blake novels, Incubus Dreams was heavy with the sex. While both a good and a bad thing as it relates to the story line, I actually lost count as to how many sex scenes there were in this book. But there were a lot. So many that they kind of started bleeding together. And that sort of indicates a touch of overkill.Incubus Dreams has a mystery eerily similar to that of Circus of the Damned. A band of vampire serial killers, lead by a rouge master vampire, is on a killing spree. The difference: the killers are targeting strippers. Being that Anita is personally involved in some way with a number of male strippers, I was surprised that she never feared for them. The victims were female, but there still should have been a connection on some level.The mystery concluded in a thrilling but less than satisfying fashion. On the bright side, the mystery brought about a good hard look at Malcolm and the Church of Eternal Life. Both the church and its leader are not quite what they seem, which could lead to a fascinating story in the future.Anita's abilities, along with those metaphysically tied to her, continue to grow exponentially. I absolutely love experiencing the new powers and seeing where they lead. Of course, with any new ability Anita acquires, it comes with a price. And the price is always sex. The sex is hot and sweaty and continues to push the envelope. In many places, I found myself thinking that these scenes could actually be very educational for those open to the kinkier side of the bedroom. But even lusty goodness gets to be a bit repetitive eventually and Incubus Dreams definitely enters that territory.Incubus Dreams is a very good book that brings about much power and possibility for its characters. Had it been edited better, it could have been amazing. The massive amount of sex in this book is completely at the forefront, leaving the mystery and the series progression in the background for most of the book. This felt too much like using the threads of the story to get back to the sex, instead of using the sex as a way to further the the action in the book. Incubus Dreams is definitely worth reading, but will likely be the last straw for many series fans sick of the increasing bedroom action."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I enjoyed this one more than I thought I would (based on the reviews), but the problems in it outweighed much of my enjoyment. The plot wasn't interesting or substantial enough (in most of the book) to balance out the sex scenes. Or I should say the very long, overly detailed, this-is-why-I'm-having-sex justifications before actually having the sex scenes. Whew... I wanted to say, just do it and move on... the over-justifying was painful to watch. That said, Anita does finally come to terms (mostly) with her need to have more than one man in her life (finally... I can tolerate a lot from a character, but enough angst is enough already), and Richard redeems himself a little in this book. However, the repeated phrases, over-description, and over-justification just seemed to bog the book down too much. I'm still interested enough to read the next in the series, though, so it wasn't a total waste of my time."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm a long time fan of the Anita Blake series. Hamilton can write a murder mystery in a fantasy setting better than any writer I have ever read. Most importantly, her characters are wonderfully complex and endearing.I liked the way that Incubus Dreams resolved a lot of character issues, but I was bitterly disappointed that the story had to come to a screeching halt every twenty pages for yet another increasingly raunchy sex scene. I wanted to see more characterization and more murder mysteries, not just watch the cast be arranged into a variety of sexual positions. I won't read the Meredith Gentry series because it is nothing but sex, and I am saddened to see this series following the same path. If the Anita Blake books become much raunchier, I will stop reading them."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"People complain about unresolved plot and all the sex. What I got from the story was how Anita needed to acknowledge all the problems in her life and deal with them instead of avoiding them and hope they'll go away. Could the mystery have been deal with more? Yes. Could the sex scenes have been shortened? Of course. But for me it was the heroine realizing that she needs to deal with her feelings, personal and professional. Now that is out of the way, bring on the Council and the Mother Of All Darkness!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This was a great book. A lot happening with romance and action. Anita has to find herself and come to terms with the life she has. Very exciting and a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book has a lot of metaphysical and a lot of sex. I didn't mind the latter as much as the former. Also ridden with typos and writing errors. I'm a newcomer to Hamilton's books, I read only \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" and \\"Burnt Offerings\\" before, so I'm not burnt out on the series yet. I like this book quite alright. It was a tad too long, sure, but still entertaining.What really bothered me was her repetition of phrases, especially \\"That did it for him, flat out did it for me\\" used like 4 times in the book, not to mention \\"metaphysical,\\" every other freaking page. About 3/4 into the book, I decided that she did it on purpose, as a running joke, inserting metaphysical every chance she could and giggling at herself.Should you read the book? Only if you like sex. Anita's got a harem, how great is that? She has threesomes with beautiful men. I'm jealous. This book is a great chance to live out vicariously your fantasies of being an all-powerful nympho whom all men find irresistible."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I love this series! I've reread each book in the series at least twice. The premium price I paid for this one makes it hard for me to admit that I have to agree with the negative reviews on the typos and the abundance of sex in the book. I was actually embarrassed to lend it to my Dad, who is a big fan of the series too. I mean, come on, the book was mostly sex and very little spook squad or other action. Yet, it was still a quick read, if not a bit erotically disturbing.However, there really is NO excuse for the editor(s) not catching the typos. I can excuse LKH since she's just discovered that she has dyslexia and it causes her to switch her middle letters. But geez, you'd think the publisher would hire some better editors.Regardless of its less than spectacular story line, this book does continue to provide insight into the continuing evolution (and possible degradation) of Anita's character. I would still recommend reading the book, but maybe wait until it hits paperback and hopefully it will have had some additional proofing. It's part of the series after all and I do believe there's so much LKH has yet to explore in the Anita character and certainly some great story lines. Personally, I'm still waiting for the Mother of All Darkness to appear, the trip to D.C. and another round with Edward.So, still good reading, not as great as the others, but still good."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I started reading these books a few months ago because I'm a fan of paranormal romance novels and these seemed to come highly recommended. I really liked the whole feel of them and the writing was excellent. To be honest, I was a little disappointed in the lack of sex in the first five books. I was not expecting erotica, but the sexual tension and prudishness of Anita was starting to annoy me. These are some sexy guys and I wanted to see a little action because that seemed to be where things were headed. I just took a while to get there :)I love the way Hamilton built the characters and the zombie raising kickass Anita Blake was very interesting. After reading so many bad reviews for the later novels I decided to quit reading after Blue Moon and not risk being disappointed. But I actually picked up Cerulean Sin the other day while waiting on some other books in the mail and really liked it. So then I read Incubus Dreams, and wow it wasn't the literary monstrosity it was made out to be.First of all, I totally get how some people would hate the direction these books have taken. Die hard fans of the first novels could easily be offended by the actions of the characters in these later books. The grammatical mistakes can be a little distracting. I saw two or three out of a 650 page book. I know there were more because others have pointed them out, but overall it wasn't as bad as i had expected. And yes, some phrases get used and abused over and over... \\"so much meat\\" haha but it actually became a inside joke with myself whenever I saw phrases repeated.As for the big bad SEX. There is a lot of it in this book in particular. BUT it is not the entire book. After reading dozens of reviews I expected her to be having sex right after the first page. But, I found that not to be true. Yes, she is still fighting the audeur. And yes it disrupts the flow of a normal plot. But I think Hamilton is a good romance writer and the development of the characters and my personal investment in them makes the sexual relationships really hot and interesting. I like that she writes outside of the box (a little BDSM). It makes the scenes more interesting. Granted, some of the sex scenes I could totally have done without because the characters are blah and it did nothing for the plot or character development. And I got a little tired of all the talk before sex, especially when she was talking herself into it and then out of it, and then back into having sex again. When that happens I just skim over a few pages til i get to the main scene. Her conflicts should really be resolved my now in my opinion.Anita have evolved as a character. She is not a total sociopath yet, but she is not wreaked with emotions over what she sees as survival killings. I LOVE that about her character. I love that sex has become part of her world. Hamilton writes book sex in my opinion. I love the new characters that have been introduced. Though, someone mentioned in a review that there are like 50 characters now b/c every book introduces another 5 and nobody gets killed off. (SO TRUE) Some characters do not seem necessary to me...Micah anyone...but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt for a few more books.So far I like the direction Hamilton has taken the books in. It might have helped me that I came into this series having read a lot of reviews on each book and I was expecting the later books to be total stinkers. So, the evolution of Anita's character was not such a shock and I was able to enjoy the new turn of events.Lastly, some have said in the reviews that the plot in this book (the stripper killing part) is hardly ever mentioned. It is true that the mystery plot is not as central as the previous books because this one deals a lot with the characters themselves. But I do believe that there was enough of it to still remind me of the old Anita kicking butt and mouthing off to the police. hehe"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was fairly pleased with this book. It had PLENTY of steamy scenes and proved that there is still A LOT of life left in this series. LKH opened up many new interesting possibilities (no spoilers here, I promise), so I am looking forward to seeing what happens next.However, I will say that I was not altogether pleased with this offering. The mystery (plot) part of the book suprisingly suffered quite a bit in this 658 page book. The whole book seemed to be about how many more men Anita could add to her growing male harem. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it, but I just wish more plot than sex had been involved in such a long book. Anita just has too many guys now. Some of them have GOT to go (as long as one of the ones that gets cut isn't Jean Claude...lol)."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Let me start by saying I love the sex in the Anita Blake books, Narcissus in Chains is my favorite in the series and I have no problem with the ardeur.The problem with Incubus Dreams isn't the sex, although there was a heck of a lot of it. No, it was the disjointed feel the book had overall.There was a lot of great stuff in there, but the problem was that most of it fell to the wayside. There was at least three books' worth of material there. What about the Dragon? Why didn't we hear more? What about Moroven? Why didn't we hear more? What about the lack of blood oaths? What about Requiem and his strange words of advice? Why was Gregory and Stephen's dad hanging out at Guilty Pleasures? All of these story threads were interesting but none of them were explored in the depth they deserved.I don't mind Anita sleeping with more people, that isn't a problem for me. But if we are going to be introduced to a new threesome, why have Damian disappear after the first encounter, only to be referred to as he's dying or draining Anita? Where was our beloved Asher?Speaking of that, where were the characters that set up the core of the story arc? No Asher, no Damian after the delicious first chapters, no Dolph except for one strained confrontation, no Sylvie or Shang Da, no Edward. What of the vampires who remained at the end of Cerulean Sins? Moreover, what about the end of Ceruluean Sins, there was a heck of a lot of stuff going on that never even gets referred to.On a positive note, we had some resolution with Richard and thank god he's not such a royal bas*ard this book. Nathaniel is really shaping up into a great character. I am glad to see Anita letting go a bit and dealing with her situation with something other than anger.Overall, I wasn't disappointed in Incubus Dreams, it isn't that the book is bad, it's just that it jumps from storyline to storyline without wrapping anything up. Hamilton is a good writer, her characters are clearly ones that have the ability to catch people and make them into fans, it's not that she ran out of material, more like she had so much that she couldn't bear to edit it out."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"...I'm not sure I like where she's going. I read the interview with the author and she said that one of the reasons she's adding more sex to the books is because people told her she should tone it down more. I can understand 'being contrary', as she puts it, but this seems over the top a little.I was fine with her 'feeding' and am thrilled about the changes in her relationship with Nathaniel. The scene that made it too much for me was the one with Jean-Claude and Richard - those who have read the book will know which one I mean.Okay, enough about the sex - now about the story. As storylines go, this one was just okay. This book was more about Anita's new powers than it was about the murder investigation and the crime scene stuff seemed a little stale. Plus, it wasn't even really wrapped up in the end.Some of the other things in the book are familiar territory for those who've read the entire series. Anita faces some people who view her as 'coffin bait' - no big surprise there. What?! Some of the guys underestimate her abilities - no way!A couple of the literary devices were also a little annoying. First, couldn't Hamilton have used some other way to set off the flashbacks? I found myself getting pulled out of the story because I lost track of where everyone was. Second, all the references to events in previous novels seemed forced. Anita has conversations with Micah and just happens to drop into the conversation about saving a naga? It seems to me that Hamilton was just trying to make this a stand-alone novel in a new way - we normally read about the past events in Anita's head. I think it's fine for them to come out in conversations, but it needs to be more natural.Overall, I give this book 4 stars - even though I'm not sure I like the direction Anita is going, I still want to see how she gets there!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams is author Laurell K. Hamilton's latest installment in the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series. After 11 books in this series, Hamilton still manages to surprise the reader with new material.Incubus Dreams opens at a wedding - Tammy and Larry's. This is not a church event as the blushing bride is not only a cop, but a witch as well. Not to mention that the groom raises the dead for a living. It would seem a Halloween theme has been somehow made to fit for a wedding - orange bridesmaid dresses, orange and black decorations, and so on. Thankfully, Anita is on the groom's side and allowed to wear a tux as a \`groomsman.' The Anita we know has been forced into many a bridesmaid dress - but the orange creations for this wedding are horrid in every way.As with any event in Anita's life, a murder takes place and she is forced to leave the wedding to fulfill her duties as a consultant to the Regional Preternatural Investigation Unit and a Federal Marshal. The murder is almost tame after the murder scenes visited in Narcissus in Chains and Cerulean Sins. Just a dead stripper. Only twist is that this stripper seems to have been drained dry by multiple vampires. While Anita is positive none of her lover and the vampire Master of the City Jean-Claude's vampires would commit this crime, others are not convinced. Anita must face many prejudices and find ways to fit into the cop mentality once again.To add more spice to the murder storyline, Anita, Jean-Claude, and Richard - werewolf and Ulfric, enter into a new power level. This creates many conflicts within Anita's life. Not only must she embrace Richard's beast and her own, but into this comes her \`vampire servant' Damian's loneliness, everyone's rage, Jean-Claude's blood lust and ardeur to round out the mix. Everything in Anita's life hinges on her ability to be flexible and accepting. These are not two characteristics that Anita has been known to posses in the past.Incubus Dreams delivers to more then just a die hard Hamilton fan. The mystery/murder is interesting and allows us to experience the horror of the monsters. Anita has just enough friction from her fellow investigators to remind us just how sexist and bigoted the old boy's school mentality can be. Her new powers enhance her skills in the investigation, but also hinder her with their baggage. Nothing is every straight forward with Anita and her powers.While many consider the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series to be nothing more than erotica, they are vastly underrating the series. Incubus Dreams does contain many explicit sexual encounters. Some of these encounters are not pleasant to read - nor do I think they are meant to be. The powerful sexual incubus that Jean-Claude has inadvertently shared with Anita is not amiable. It is a driving force that she must feed or face the consequences. This dilemma gives rise to the sexual acts. The sexuality is not gratuitous in nature and has a purpose in the story arc of the entire series.Incubus Dreams allows the reader to see that Laurell K. Hamilton is still able to produce amazing characters in mind-blowing situations. The story line of the mystery/murder and Anita's life is continued, but more complete then any of the previous books. Hamilton has allowed herself to write until she has completed the story and it shows in the 658 pages of Incubus Dreams. I look forward to the next installment of Anita Blake.Laurell K. Hamilton is the St. Louis author of twelve Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series books and three novels in the Meredith Gentry series. She has also published a number of short stories along with another novel recently re-released, Nightseer."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Some reviewers have written that this book is only about sex, but to anybody who has read all the Anita Blake books, that is simply not true. This is a pivotal book in the series, and its importance is that in this book, Anita finally begins to come to terms with who and what she is.After spending several books running away from her growing powers and her emotional ties and obligations, she finally begins to accept that while she may never have the white picket fence lifestyle she thinks she ought to want, she is surrounded by people who are willing to love and accept her for who she is, if she will only let them.Yes, there is a lot of sex in this book, but none of it is gratuitous. Most of the sex here relates to her coming to terms with her relationships with the people around her and consolidating her power. And unless I miss my guess, she and her people will need all the power they can get, because there are a lot of threats on the horizon. Readers who complain of too little action and suspense here will find plenty in the next few books, but a lot of it will be based on what happens in this book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm not going to elaborate on all of the reasons why I found this latest Anita Blake book so disappointing - other reviewers have done a fine job already. I can only say that after 727 pages of overdosing on sex scenes, redundant dialogue (how many times does Anita have to psychoanalyze herself and explain why she had to have sex AGAIN), and not enough plot development, I sit here bleary-eyed, tired, and simply sad. Anita's character stalled out from all the sex! Overly-discussed sex! Mindless sex! You can only stimulate (no pun intended) a reader's imagination with sex up to a certain point before we begin skimming the sex scenes! I never thought I'd actually be skimming the sex scenes in search of the story!!If you've been reading the series, you are committed to reading it all the way through - at least I am. I've grown too fond of the story arcs and the characters (especially Nathaniel) to give up on them now. However, Hamilton has strayed so far from the chemistry of plot, character development, sexual tension and sheer fun that made this series so addictive, that I literally finished the book more for the sake of all the previous books than just out of interest in this one. Sadly, either Hamilton has lost direction at this point in the series, or has fallen victim to the myth that a formula of 2/3 mind-numbing sex and 1/3 story will keep the readers happy - believe me, I'm not happy. The only reason I gave this book 3 stars is that Hamilton did sprinkle in a few interesting new story lines that have me hoping that the next book will pick up on now that Anita has basically had marathon sex for what seems over 400 pages!Laurell, give your readers some credit for taste - we like the sexual tension just as much as other people, but it was your characters and story-telling that hooked us on your series, not just the sex!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Most people I know, including the person who got me hooked on the series years ago, couldn't manage to slog their way past the first couple of chapters - these book lovers actually abandoned the book. I forced myself to keep reading even though the pages and pages and pages of sex with characters I either didn't know or couldn't care less about was boring me so much I would only read a few pages at a time (compare that to the first book which I read pretty much in one sitting because I couldn't put it down). There is a slim case to solve which basically gets lip service only, Jean-Claude and Richard are almost invisible (Jean-Claude gets more time simply because he is talking in Anita's head a lot), and there is way too much time spent on characters like Micah and the wereleopards. Vampires interest me. Wereanimals are okay, but all the metaphysical descriptions about the beast rising, etc., etc., etc. got really old really fast.If you can force yourself to keep reading, the latter half of the book is better, but it still left a bad taste in my mouth. My solution? I went back and started the series over again, and I found the early books just as addicting as the first time I read them. The sexual tension was huge. The case was interesting. The characters were distinct personalities that I cared about - the triumverate, Edward, Dolph, Zebrowski... The villains were interesting, and they got enough time so I got to know them. All the things that Incubus Dreams was not. Will I buy the next book? I wouldn't even read it for free unless I read reviews that Laurell has gone back to the format of the earlier books (a real case to solve, more Jean-Claude, more Edward, WAY less wereleopards, no page after page after page of sex with characters I don't even know). That's a sad assessment because up until Obsidian Butterfly, this series ruled. :-/"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"When I finished reading Cerulean Sins, all I could think was 'Wow! This is one of the best books I have ever read.' Considering how many books I have read, which literally number in the thousands, that was high praise coming from me. I couldn't wait to see how Laurel would top herself on the her next book.I am still waiting! Where is the masterpiece I was expecting?While I really enjoyed how the relationship of Anita and Nathaniel was addressed, and how Richard finally came to an understanding with Anita; I was horribly disappointed to see so many of the excellent threads developed in Cerulean Sins tossed by the wayside.Laurel, you had a good thing going here! Please don't toss it away. Don't kill the optimistic hopes of a die-hard fan.***For those of you who have the question of is this book worth my money. My answer is no. If you want to read it in hard cover go to the library.But if you are like me and want to have a complete collection, despite the quality of said book; wait for it to come out on paperback and go to your local half-price book store."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"well, I just finished reading this book for the second time, and I was very disappointed. When this series first started out they had a well defined plot, great side stories and every character was someone you could get to know. In this book, the story takes a back seat to all the sex. Although they are well writen, the sex scenes take up far too much of the book. The actually mystery that Anita is supposed to be solving is bearly mentioned. There were plenty of good parts too this book, but I just don't think that it comes anywere close to being as good as her earlier novels. I am re-reading burnt offerings today, and I am surprised at the difference in quality of the two books. If you are a big Anita fan read the book, but wait till it comes out in paperback."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I will always read the next intallment of Anita's life. I think she is an interesting character in a world like no other. That being said, I am sooooo dissappointed in LKH for letting her personal fantasies alter something great that was developed so painstakingly.I believe one of the book jackets I first picked up said \\"I don't sleep with the monsters, I kill them.\\" If only that were still true.Anita has become a slut, and subject to all kinds of unbelievable excuses to justify it, so that she can remain a \\"reluctant slut,\\" and supposedly retain some of her previous dignity. There are, in fact, pages and pages of confrontations in which Anita is told she is too promiscuous, and we are dragged through Anita's previously-enduring refusal-to-regret-anything until we want to say \\"enough already!\\" I felt like LKH was trying to justify to us the new content, and wear down our resolve that this is not our Anita.Sexual tension is a good thing, and sex itself can be great, especially in vampire stories and such. But sex with everyone? I consider myself a feminist (gasp!) who is all about positive portrayals of women, and that includes being comfortable with your sexuality as one. That doesnt mean sleep with everyone and dont apologize for it. It means do what you want to do if you have good reason.All these forces taking over Anita that conveniently result in (small spoiler ahead) having sex or eating someone every 6 hours is not true to these characters. Its a lame excuse to add cheap thrills to a story in which such satisfaction is worth waiting for. Every 6 hours! Give me a break! And LKH's excuse (that its sexual because people told her it shouldnt be, or because shes pushing some gender restricting envelope) is BS. I think LKH is just getting lazy and going for obvious routes. Or letting her too-personal fantasies creep into this world. Or all of the above. She can't possibly believe this stuff is as good as it once was.Its understandable that it would be intimidating to top some of her earlier books, they set new standards for this genre. But smut is smut, and that's where this series is headed. LKH is entitled to do whatever she wants with Blakeville, after all it is hers, but its still hard to watch it take this turn.Like I said, I will still read Anita books, because they have other things going for them. But all this sex... its very distracting (even the book covers - they are getting embarassing to walk around with) and really does take away from the integrity of the stories.Let's just put it this way: I invested in every book up to #9, and now it's time to start getting my Anita fixes from the library. This new stuff isn't worth re-reading or keeping around."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"There was just too much filler (Anita having sex with everyone) and not enough of the case. In fact, I realized that I had actually forgotten what the case was. I didn't even finish the book before I returned it to the library."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Laurell Hamilton is one of about 2 authors that I will cough up the bucks for the hard back. It's been interesting to see her writing style evolve. Her first couple of Anita Blake books involved a whole new kind of story line which I liked. Her next several books involved a whole new kind of story line with a very sensual element which I really liked. Now we've come full circle. Most of the book covers sex scenes, usually kinky. A lot of what's left over involves discussion with people in her life and with herself; lots of angst here. Obviously, this leaves very little room for anything resembling an actual plot.Laurell isn't the only game in town with this kind of supernatural story line any more. I hate to say it, but some of the other authors are doing it better. Even when she's poor, Laurell Hamilton is still worth reading, but I'll probably wait for the paperback on her next effort."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Ms. Hamilton has truly lost track of what this story was about. I thought the sex \\"phase\\" would pass, but it's not going to. I didn't have a problem with one, two, or even three sex scenes, but this book was nothing but sex. I used to be excited when these books came out, but I've finally realized that the characters are not going to develop any further, which is sad because Anita used to be a Kick as Bitch with a purpose...I don't think I have to say what she is now."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton writes a great story. But in this book she has more sex than story line, more than half the book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am loyal Anita Blake fan. But this book might be the show killer for me. It is not the fact that she's doing menage a tois, we all wouldn't be this far into the series if it bothered us. Or having \\"sex\\" with 5 different guys in less than 24 hours. The beastiality portion was a bit too much, and I liked her better when she \\"didn't do furry.\\" Especially when an hour later she has an official threesome. But I am tired of how the sex scenes that she is not comfortable with are a life or death, the future of St. Louis depends on it situation. Every problem is solved with either metaphysical sex, partial sex or just plain sex. She saves lives by feeding the ardeur which makes her or someone else more powerful, and basically by having an orgasm. Where's the Anita Blake that kicked Raina's and the old Master of the City's [...]??? With all her new powers, these books have so much potential. But instead she's saving the world through sex. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with sex, but at least beef up the plot around it. I skipped so many pages. There's also a lot of screaming during the sex scenes. Screaming is good, but the scene doesn't work up to what I would warrant the need for a scream. Some of the sex scenes are outstanding, but some are down right disappointing."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Whether it's about the mystery, the sex, or the characters -- it's all about balance.Unfortunately I feel that Laurell has lost all perspective on that.As a die-hard Anita Blake fan, I was impressed with the fact that the first few books were filled with sexual tension (and no sex). When it did enter the equation with a bang -- I was even more excited. Character development, a little steaminess -- and still awesome mysteries and plot elements. All right!But now -- what's going on? I admit, this book did finally show some growth in the characters. Anita's finally 'growing up' and accepting who she is and her actions. As are some of the other characters.Unfortunately, a lot of that is overshadowed by some of the same moanings and superfluous sex scenes that many other complain about. After about 20 chapters, I ceased to care about Anita's continual whinings about Nathaniel. It is entertaining (in a sad way) to see how many new strangers she'll sleep with before going back to whining about Nathaniel. At this point? I don't even care.Like several others, normally I can't put an Anita Blake book down. Now, it's taking effort just to pick it back up. Slowly but surely.I expect this sort of thing from Merry Gentry, I was hoping that writing such a series would help her even get it out of her system and take the heat off of Anita Blake. At least somewhat.That doesn't seem to be the case as this book is helping me see my worst fears realized. I find I'm revising my expectations and that if I just accept it for what it is, don't look at the lack of plot, and grab onto any and all character development I can find -- it's an okay read."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am a die-hard LKH fan and when my husband saw me bring this book home he was prepared to run the house for a few days because I usually can't put her books down. Not this one mama. It took me so long to read because it just was NOT intersting. It really doesn't add much to the series so my advice is to just skip it. Maybe her next one will be better after she reads all these harsh reviews (fingers crossed)."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I gave the book two stars just because I can't admit to myself that an Anita Blake novel could be awful.Not the book I was looking forward to. There have been many times in the past where I was tired of Ms. Blake's whinny, high moral double standards and wished she would 'go with the flow,' but this was a little too much. You can only read about someone having sex for so long... The end of the book was great. The beginning was about four hundred pages too long.To wait another year+ for the next book in the series may give most fans too much time to think about just how badly this book was written."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book was downright awful. I was not able to even finish reading the last few chapters. It is really frustrating that the books (after Obsidian Butterfly) have a crime scene at the very beginning of the book, which misleads the reader to believing that there is going to be an action-packed, rich story with amazing characters to follow and mysteries to solve. Do not get your hopes up !!! Anita is so busy having sex with anything with a pulse , that there is no space for anything else. The woman is sexually frustrated.I truley miss the \\"old\\", the real Anita Blake series. She was such a strong character, taking no nonsense from anyone. Someone who had her priorities fully sorted out.The main men characters were strong-minded and actually had a personality. Now they are only lining up to see who is going to get jumped next, when she gets \\"hungry\\" again.Even after reading these last horrible books, I am still hoping for a miracle to happen...... book 15, The Harlequin is going to be published soon, and I am hoping that the author at least tried to save the series !!!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"While I thought that nothing could be worse than Dance Macbre, Hamilton proved me wrong with this installation of the Blake series. This book has lost the luster of the early books of the series. The grand battle that usually happens at the end of the books is sadly replased with disturbing sex scenes. The intreguing growth of Anita's powers has been replaced with the growth of her lust. Serriously, Hamilton, if you want to write a romance series, write one, but don't forsake one of my favorite characters for an outlet for your sexual frustration!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was so disappointed. I bought this in hardcover, so eager to read Anita's adventures, to find out what was going on after CS, to see if the Mother of Darkness was coming back and what was going on with Stephen and Gregory and their father, but did I find any of that out? NO! None of the dangling plots were mentioned in ID. In fact, I don't think this had a plot at all.The story starts off with a wedding, and then proceeds to near sex outside the wedding, to full blown sex (that doesn't stop for most of the book) and then maybe a little plot at the end. I read this book twice, and I still can't find any mention of some of the new characters that were supposed to be in here. I aslo skipped most of it because I have had it with the sex.Don't get me wrong, I like sex in books. I read romance novels a lot. However, they have never left me feeling as dirty or violated as ID did. I was disgusted. Sex is one thing, but the kind of sex Anita has, plus the fact she went from being someone with morals to a jumping in bed with anything (and I do mean anything) that would have her made me ill. The series took a turn for the worst, turning our beloved strong and independant Anita into Wonderslut. She, who used to swear she'd never have casual sex, has gone from just being with one, maybe two guys, to bedding half of St. Loius. And those who oppose her sudden change, are shown unfavorably and will probably be killed in the next book (assuming that book has a plot).I, for one, will never buy any more books by LKH. She lost a very loyal fan in me."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"A few months ago, I read an amazing book (BloodAngel, by Justine Musk, if you're interested). After finishing it, I moved on to another book, only to be disappointed. In fact, 95% of the books I've read since have left me feeling let down. Sure, they've got decent plots and interesting characters, but they lack the language, the prose that was so effective in BloodAngel. I had been angsting over this fact, and I would've continued to do so had I not read this sorry excuse for a book.I took decent plots and interesting characters for granted; I assumed that they were inherent to published writing, which (I so naively thought) went through SOME sort of screening process. I now know that, while amazing prose is always a nice touch, a plot and characters would be good enough.That pretty much sums it up - I read one book, and it made everything look awful in comparison; I read this book, and suddenly nothing else seemed quite so bad."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have read every Anita Blake novel along with my 26 year old son. He stopped at Cerrilian Sin, and I've stopped at Incubus Dreams. Where was the plot.

The series was great because it was an awesome mix of detective novels with a fantasy background and some romance thrown in. Now it's all about the sex and not even emotional or interesting sex. I suppose LKH thinks she's making it interesting with the multiple partners and with the descriptions of what it takes to give a good bj, but that's not what makes a good sex scene -- that barely makes good porn.I don't care about Anita anymore. I don't care if she lives or dies or who she ends up with, or about her job (which she doesn't seem to much care about anymore either.)Don't bother to read this, if you want some good and honest erotica with a fantasy edge read an Ellora's Cave book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":".............that should have been the name of this fiasco of a book.

Do not hide it behind a mask, deceiving new and old readers alike.This book does not belong with other Horror/Fantasy/Mystery/SciFi titles.I agree with so much stated by previous reviewers, why rehash it all?I do NOT recommend this book unless you are looking for supernatural smut.In which case, dive right in."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Sad to say, but I agree with those who disliked this book. I gave the first few \\"Anita Blake\\" books away as a gift and highly recommended them. But this one?The typos that readers mentioned in the hardback edition are still in the paperback edition. And I never expected to find a book with so much sex so boring.At what point does fiction with explicit sex become simply porn? I don't know. But I wish that there was more of the mystery and adventuresome elements that I loved about \`Anita'. I wished that the character questioned herself more. Her current behavior does not reflect the conflicted soul that we saw in the first books. If the character has changed, then I wish that the change was explicitly acknowledged and confronted. Contrasting it with her friend's fear of marriage feels flat and forced. Instead I am left to wonder if the author is simply giving us more of sexual elements that readers praised. (And heaven knows, \`Anita' was one of my own Guilty Pleasures. I wouldn't want a de-sexed \`Anita'.) Maybe it's time for the character to move on. Ms. Hamilton has started another series.

Anita feels tired and worn-out; it's no wonder after those 12-something sexscapades with \\"what-was-his-name-again?\\" I know Hamilton thinks she is crossing some great taboo by making a strong female character that can have casual sex whenever she wants- with no consequences, but instead Anita has devolved into sniveling, crabby monster-bait that couldn't see the bad guy if they were on top of her. Don't get me wrong I LOVE erotica and Anita's sex scenes are usually hot beyond compare, but this time it felt like a junky going back for one more hit. I feel betrayed, personally I think Blake in on the back-burner while Hamilton lives out all of her real fantasies through Merry- a series which I couldn't read from the beginning. I knew as soon as the covers of her books went all sexmopolitan that the plot was gonna suffer, but I didn't think she would rule one out entirely. Anita's edge is gone! She no longer seems to be the scourge among rogue vamps, but rather seems like an after-thought. She couldn't even kick-butt 'cause she spent most of her time ON IT with her legs in the air. Jean Claude, one of my favorite characters, reduced to being nothing more than (pardon my pun) dead-weight through the entire book. His laissez-faire attitude was neither charming nor witty but just unimpressive. Richard was given the role of weak puppy that comes to lap at Anita's feet and as far as things Finally being resolved between him and Anita- Yeah right, all he did was join her harem. The Most interesting character in the book, Nathanial, was given the most pathetic leftovers from Miss Blake's enormous sex table- He deserved so much more, I was downright appalled.

I didn't read much of it before it was obvious that once again, Anita-as-boring-[...] was in residence and I returned it. It may be that, as a reviewer or two point out, the author wishes to go in \\"new directions\\", but authors with hugely popular series who end up trashing their characters in these \\"new directions\\" (Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series is going down the tubes as well) should remember that the reason they became hugely popular authors in the first place was that the readers loved the characters as originally written.

Others have done that job already.I think the most stinging review I can give this book is that I'm going back to the bookstore and demanding my money back. If people stop paying for feces on paper, maybe the author will finally get the point, put down her copy of Marquis de Sade's \\"Ettiquite in the Bedroom\\" (which at least was well written), and write a story with a plot."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am very dissapointed in this book.

I love the characters, and I was glad that we got a little history on Damian, and some more insight on Jean-Claude, but overall it was a big let-down. Thw whole book, I was sitting there asking myself, where is the big bad that she always battles? Anita has been going down hill since Cerulean Sins, where she gained these new powers all of a sudden at the end of the book to defeat Belle. I just thought it was all starting to go a little overboard. I love Anita Blake, and I will continue to read the books, but I can't help but ask myself if it's time for Laurell to put an end to the series.P.S.

Her alternative reality of vampires, animators and were-wolves (not to mention were-leopards, were-rats and even the occasional were-swan) is both amusing and exciting. I admit, I am a fan of the genre, from Stephen King's Salem's Lot to Joss Whedon's universe that includes the blonde, but tough, slayer and the hunky vampire with a soul. It is a nice escape from the world around us and it's sometimes even more terrifying reality. After the first three books of the Anita Blake series, I was with everyone else I wanted the woman to get some sexual action from the seductive vampire and the hot werewolf. After reading Incubus Dreams, I feel like I am in a careful what you wish for situation. The author can certainly write an effective sex scene, but I'm sorry no sex scene should take three long chapters. And maybe if that was the only(or two or three) scene, I could forgive it, but it was the last (or next to last) of many sex scenes. All basically the same sex scene. Anita and two guys. It flat DOES it for her. I get it. I really get it. I believe all of us who read that book REALLY REALLY GET IT. Where was the mystery and action (other than sexual) that this author does so well? I'm three-fourths done with the book and have read so many long drawn out deja-vu writhing and couplings between Anita and her furry or fanged boyfriends that couldn't even remember what the mystery was supposed to be. And I don't want to even mention those LONG relationship conversations. Those just made me start hoping the ardeur would kick in, so they would stop talking. There has to be a happy medium. I don't want to go back to the chaste, smugly chaste Anita Blake. But I would enjoy more of a story next time. Sometimes, honest, less is more."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Wow, LKH has really done it this time...I thought that since she made Anita out to be kind of a slut in Cerulean Sins that maybe she'd let Anita take a break for once. Apparently I was very wrong, I've been reading some of the reviews and there's not really much to say that hasn't been said. I'm still going to stay loyal to the series but please Laurell, I can't take anymore repitions of the words 'breast' and 'meat' anymore. And since when does Anita say something like \\"I want to see if I can deep throat you\\". Maybe something Laurell or I might say but not the prude vampire-killing sociopathic bitch from hell I've grown to love and care about.

I miss the old Anita...The Anita who could pass up sex and not let it run her life. I understand that because of the Ardeur Anita has to feed her desires...but, this book really overdid it with the graphic sex! I got through half of the book and just thought, \\"When will it end?!?!\\"I LOVE this series, But the last 3 books in it have been like reading a poorly written script for a hardcore porn film. There were some good moments in the book that kind of carried it for me. The moments where Anita was working on the case (Which were not that many moments)or doing something other than giving in to the ardeur. I was also excited to see Richard back in this novel, even though it was mainly for an INTENSELY pornographic threesome with Anita and Jean Claude. i actually gasped out loud at some of the sex scenes since I had never before read anything like them in my life (Cmon...Did we really need to know that Anita was a \\"RAINMAKER\\"-otherwise known as a female ejaculator).I miss the action and adventure that used to thrive in this series. I am not entertained by the hardcore sex that Ms. Hamilton is letting run her stories. I also am not very fond of Nathaniel and some of the other characters that have been thrown in recently. I really dislike that Anita is in love with the idea that she can have all the men that she wants and that that is just how her life is going to work. Also, It's 2004...How many men have long hair nowadays? Why does Nathaniel have hair down to his ankles...That disturbes me more than the murder cases Anita briefly works on. Hair down to the ankles seems like a safety hazard to me. Could you picture him running? Wouldn't he trip? Any enemy of his could just grab onto that 4 feet of hair and just take them down to the ground. That hair is a bad idea.Anyways, The sexuality of Anita was always interesting and complex, and now she is just a slut!

There's an editing error on almost every single page, and that's a problem with the publisher, not the writer.Now, I've noticed that Hamilton's books are poorly copy edited in general. I expect things like \\"alright\\" for \\"all right,\\" and \\"midmorning\\" for \\"mid morning,\\" but in this book we have, more than once, diety for deity, ardeur spelled in a number of interesting ways, Damian as Domain, and Damain, sauve for suave, put for but (a dyslexic marker, which makes me wonder), libility for liability, particliar for particular, hoptial for hospital, retch and wretch are confused (and, like discreet and discrete, not for the first time in one of Hamilton's books), and a cornucopia of continuity errors, and contradictions of facts presented in previous books. The grammar is, well, let's just say I'm used to reading the work of under prepared freshmen, and even they aren't this bad. Even the grammar and style checker in Microsoft Word will catch its/it's and you're/your, and would of/would have errors. Was there an editor involved? I'm talking about comma splices, and not just in dialogue, commas sprinkled as if they were a seasoning, apostrophes in plurals, and not in possessives, sentence fragments, and Hamilton's long-term problems with irregular verbs, especially lay and lie. We'll skip the creative use of French and German. Incubus Dreams desperately needs a decent line editor--Hamilton's developed a number of repetitive nervous twitches in her writing, including repeating descriptions verbatim (not only from previous books, but repeating them in this book) like frequently repeating that only new vampires flash fang. Limit this kind of reference to once per book--that way, you clue in new readers, but you don't annoy them. I'd guess that at least 25% of this book could, and should, have been cut. A good editor could have really made something interesting out of Incubus Dreams. Right now, it's a mess.If I hadn't seen this kind of sloppy editing and writing in previous books, I'd blame overly rapid typesetting and a rush to market, but this is just too awful to find any excuse for it, even that one. And I can't even hope that the errors will be corrected in the paperback, based on previous books."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I don't particularly think I'm a prude, but I just have no interest in reading a book all about sex in various forms/positions, and with a wide cast of characters. It got to the point where the only questions were, which men are left for Anita to screw, and what new power will she get next? Where was the plot? Where was the humor that was in the earlier books? Where was the character development? The mystery itself takes less than 100 pages of the book, and is more like an afterthought, it surely has nothing to do with the rest of the book.I've looked at LKH's blog. She's pretty proud that she can really crank the pages out, but I'd much rather have quality (including editing!!) than quantity, but maybe that's just me.I did like that LKH actually showed Anita at work, but, sigh, more sex. It gets boring. That's not _all_ I want to read when I read Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter. I found myself skipping pages at a time.If you're like me and you just had to read the book - because you really enjoyed the earlier Anita Blake books - my advice is to go to the library and check it out. Do not waste your money unless you really enjoyed the more recent books like NIC."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Anita Blake started out as refreshing. A dirty Harry style heroine in a world of uncertainty, grappling with morals in a city filled with sin and dark temptations.But at every un-edited turn of this bloated piece of tripe Anita is a total slut. She sleeps with every men who enters the book it seems, but she has to have 1-2 chapters of mindlessly boring chit-chat first.Anyone who disagrees with her is relegated to the status of a jealous, churlish moron. Such as Ronnie, who is written in her only scene as a PMS-happy b*tch, jealous of Anita's harem and who calls Anita \\"unfairly\\" a slut (though Anita spends the whole chapter talking about what a slut Ronnie is. Well, takes one to know one)That there is a plot is a cleverly hidden facet. Who is the bad guy? Dunno, because he never gets caught. Oh, joy, so we get to relive this novel again? I'll pass.Hamilton claims that this is an homage to erotica for women. Uh, lady, didjaknow that the romance industry is primarily porn with a plot for women? We don't need this egotistical, skeezy crap.Bestiality? Serial orgies with bad hygiene and old vampires who like sloppy seconds? Feminine men with attitude problems and sexual attitudes that are 100% opposite of what they've been billed as? Long boring conversations that cover A: what you the reader already know, B: what all the characters present know, and C: what no one cares about?If that's your cup of tea, enjoy. But that probably means you're a masochist so let me tell you, you'll enjoy \\"The Lunatic Caf&eacute;\\" and \\"Narcissus in Chains\\" much better, what with the disemboweling sex.And PS: I don't care how many books this woman sells, her editor at Berkley should be taken out and shot. Here's why:#1 - 40% of the scenes and dialogue need to be cut, or pared down to a more concise vision.#2 - The characters need to react realistically. If Anita is dressed like a hooker, she shouldn't be offended when the local cops think she is one. The old Anita would be horrified, not indignant.#3 - The spelling errors. This is proof that the editor just stamped \\"OK\\" and never bothered to read this. For shame!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"...but then I read this book.I can say that I definitely not a prude. I find erotica entertaining, but I did not buy this book for erotica. I bought it for a good story with evil powers, vampire political intrigue, and a good ol' mystery plot. Instead, I got page after page of dull sex. It was complete overload. I found myself skipping chapters to find the plot (boy, you had to look hard to find it!)I will not go into great detail on the book and my disappointment in it, because so many other reviewers have summed it all up nicely.... the one-dimensional characters, the aimless drawn-out sex, the lack of plot, the multitude of typographic errors, and the redundance of certain phrases.In the book there was one single ray of hope for our beloved Anita.... there was an indication that she was gaining control of the ardeur. Maybe, just maybe, she will have control in the next book, and then there might actually be a plot instead of sex, sex, sex.It used to be that I would pre-order any book by Ms. Hamilton.This one, I waited for it to be in the Sci-Fi book club one a buy one book, get one free deal. After this one, I just may wait to find a beat-up paperback at a yard sale before I buy another one of her books."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I WAS a fan of Ms Hamiltons' books, but Incubus Dreams as other reviewers have rightly pointed out, does 'suck'. There isn't a plot worth mentioning, Hamilton makes a stab at presenting us with a murder mystery, 'Stripper found killed by unkown Vampires' then seems to get bored with the idea and rambles off into repetitive and not terribly erotic porn territory, featuring threesomes foursomes and moresomes, necrophillia, bestiality and other stuff {sorry to be so vague, but I got bored with this pretty quickly and skipped page after page} 'The ardeur' is a pretentious and laughable plot device, {for the uninitiated, this is apparently a hunger which arises in vampires and associates which needs to be fed either by blood or sex or both, and Anita indulges in a lot of sex} our hard bitten vampire 'Executioner' screws her way through most of the novel wearing little more than a short skirt, hold up stockings and no panties. I confess I was taken to wonder if Ms Hamilton was feeling 'needy' whilst writing this disaster, as I'm sure a psychiatrist could make some interesting deductions from many of the so called 'erotic' scenarios to be found in the book. I'm also tempted to consider that the book was a mercenary production, the fans will buy anything...no need to worry about plot....After the main filling of vampiric sexual practices, Hamilton seems to suddenly remember that she's supposed to be writing a story, not porn and she returns briefly to the plot thin as it is. The resolution of the killings is dull and certainly not worth wading through the repetitive sex scenes. If Ms Hamilton wishes to write a book on Vampire Erotica, she should do so, it would probably still sell, but it is unfair to pass such a book off as an Anita Blake adventure. This book is dire. For all of those people who have tried to defend this shambles on the grounds of 'character growth/development' whilst I fully accept that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, it just amazes me how anyone could read all of this boring book let alone read it and find anything of worth. Oh one last thing...either Ms Hamilton should get a better proof reader or at least invest in a spell checker. My e-book version contained repeated mention of the word 'Diety' ...did you mean Deity by any chance?"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Due to mechanical errors in grammar, editing, and story continuity, what should be a wonderful book is dragged into the quagmire of what the heck just happened?The author is free to take her stories in to whatever realm that she so chooses, and should.If you like lots of sex, then this is the book for you. Hamilton's sex scenes are improving, and not so mechanical unlike the first few in earlier books. But, if you like an asskicking taking no prisoner's Anita, sorry, she didn't show up in this book.I don't buy many books in hardcover, and I think the next one, I will be waiting for the paperback version.I would have given this book a better rating, but the mechanical and grammatical errors were just too overwhelming for me to ignore. And it did affect the flow of the story, at least for me."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"With the introduction of Laurell K. Hamilton's newest chapter in the life and times of Anita Blake, ardent fans might be surprised that \\"Incubus Dreams\\" is anything but \\"fresh\\" or new. And with a fan base desperate for new revelations from the spicy heroine who slays vampires with precision and a deadpan face, fans find Anita Blake does not deviate from the well-worn road her creator has taken her too many times before.Only Ms. Hamilton has not recognized that Anita's trusty Nike's have long lost their tread.Even the fresh infusion of lycanthrope and vampire characters can't eradicate the yawning lack of conflict, because Ms. Hamilton parades them once again as marionettes' performing the same \\"Anita Show\\" of sex-ardeur-blood-sex over and over again. This vicious cycle pantomime continues until the end where they are caught in a perpetual loop (until the next and hopefully last installment). Anita Blake's enemies are so amorphous and trivial; one wonders the purpose of the book, other than a soft porn knockoff, with hacks repeating themselves. One finally realizes with stark perception that the only source of conflict is Anita. Anita is her own worst enemy fighting the ardeur and the many convoluted powers she possesses, and you cannot build a story around that and incessant mimicry, let alone hold a reader to sit through all the muck-racking."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Here's the gist of the 'plot':Anita has sex 6 times.4 of those times, were with two guys.7 different guys are involved.4 of those guys she'd never had sex with previously.2 of those guys hadn't shown up in the series previously.(Minus one on some of those, depending on what you count as sex.)Variations of the phrase \\"just flat does it for him/her/me/you\\" are slung around 7 times.The Mother of All Darkness and the two vampire children from CS weren't even mentioned in this book. And the barely-there mystery isn't even wrapped up at the end! It's... a special book, no doubt. It's about a millimeter better than CS and NiC were, but it was still so disappointing in comparison to the pre-NiC books. I feel no less than betrayed.It's as though Anita Blake was one of my best friends. She was tough, down to earth, practical. One day, she disappeared and an absolute stranger took her place. This big-boobed stranger slapped on a curly black wig and a knife and started a ticketed queue for a round of vigorous (does she ever have any other kind?!) sex.I miss the real Anita, the self-proclaimed \\"something that would kill you before it'd kiss you.\\" She might as well be dead. I'll probably give the next book a chance but I'll be reading it in the library before I buy it, just in case. As for this book, I recommend reading it in the library first."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"With Incubus Dreams, LKH has commmitted the ultimate sin for a popular writer.She bored her audience.Let's hope that she can take some time after finishing the next Merry book and re-read her own early work and re-capture some of what made us all fans in the first place."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have been a loyal reader of this series, but this will be the last book I purchase. What happened to the plot, the mystery, the character development?This book is a tedious series of sexual situations thinly glued together with rare mentions of a group of serial killers that we never meet. So what if there are a couple dead strippers-there's a sex scene to get through!What happened to the tough, smart, resourceful woman who raised entire graveyards of zombies or slew ghouls? She's too busy having sex in the back seat of her car.She can enjoy her new found powers and partners-I am not enjoying the stories anymore."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Let me begin by saying I am not a prude. I enjoy porn and erotica, and have specific series of books and movies I avidly enjoy. In the early part of this series, I happily rooted for Anita to get past her puritan tendencies and longed for intimacy between her and JC. I hated Richard's selfishness and even liked Micah for standing in as a new *lover*.But I was most drawn to the series for its solid plot, dark mystery, fascinating world creation, and the interplay of \\"evil\\", \\"good\\", and \\"grey\\". Anita stood as a strong and independent woman who was defined by strength of character. Her inner struggles as she worked through the puritan and patriarchal ideals of sex, of what was proper, and of what was \\"appropriate\\" for a lady, or for a good human, resonated with me and many twenty-something friends of mine as we worked through the same issues in our own lives. We looked to the books for a engaging, fast, witty, intelligent, dark, and mysterious story that held depth of meaning to us.In ID, I actually find myself almost unable to finish the book. I am insulted and embarrassed *for Anita* as I read ID work and watch as a character that used to stand as an example for me and others of a woman trying to *balance* herself (the powers within her, her job, the power around her, what she was expected to be, what she wanted in life, and the reality of the world around her) become an embodiment of the one-dimensional clich&eacute;s that all power for a woman must come through sex (or through pleasuring men) and that powerful women are necessarily promiscuous. LKH is now defining AB not by her strength of character, intelligence, wit and charisma, but by her sexuality and its creativity.Yes, as has been said so many times before amongst these reviews, there was little to no discernable plot, little to no editing, and little to no connectivity within this book. But above all there was no LIFE to the characters anymore.I will not be continuing a series that I had loved and for that I am sorry. But more I am bitter over what LKH has done to such a wonderful character.LKH you are a wonderful writer as evidenced in your earlier books. Your creativity and charm of voice was astonishing and built an audience that waited breathlessly for more. Please, revisit the muse that inspired you before and remember the voice that was Anita. If we want lurid and exciting supernatural sex and erotica, you have created the perfect world and vehicle in the Meredith Gentry books (a series I hope to continue enjoying), give it to us there. Step back and return to us the AB we have grown to love. Some fabulous sex is fine, even needed, but use your literary talent to make the scenes *matter* and *add* to a solid and definable plot and interesting involving character arcs."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"First let me say that I love books with lots of sex. However, the sex in this book is so mechanical, so without any emotion, and so repetitive with endlessly boring screams and groans. What's worse most sex scenes end with some disaster or dramatic turn that spoils the relationship between the participants. Anita is so reluctant and then so willing that I wanted to kick her. The plot seemed promising when you think that the sex was suppose to lead to greater powers, but instead we have another triumverate to worry about and vampires that have become wimps who exist only to do Anita's bidding. Where is the strong. sexy Jean Claude that I came to love and Anita came to depend on for strength? Where was Asher? He seemed to be asleep (or shall I say dead) for the entire book. Characters appeared only for the purpose of having sex with Anita and then went somewhere outside the book only to reappear when she needed more sex - all in the short span of 48 hours. The murder plot took up so few pages that I wasn't even sure it was meant to be an important plot line. Anita is developing new powers, but there was so much metaphysical trash and so much gratuitous sex that I couldn't even follow the \\"new powers\\" line. All I gleaned from this rather poor excuse for a book is that Anita was becoming stronger and everyone around her was there for the sole purpose of satisfying her needs and answering her call. I have read all the Anita Blake novels even though I sensed from the last two that the plot was headed in this direction. I kept hoping LKH would find her way back to the action that made this series so great. Don't get me wrong, I'd hate to see the sex go, but surely it can be handled in a better way that moved the story along and made the scenes more enjoyable. I don't care if Anita \\"loves\\" more than one person, but I'd like to see the sex scenes express that love or at least be meaningful to the participants. If LKH wants sex to be an important part of the series then make it, at least occasionally, a pleasant experience for the reader and the characters. I'll only read the next book in this series if I can get it from my library. Then I won't feel so bad if I don't finish it."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I got Incubus Dreams (ID) the day it came out and finished it that morning-about 5 AM. While the ride itself is fine I find the book far too disconnected from the events Cerulean Sins (CS) to give this book anywhere near a 5 star rating. I am disappointed in the number of issues not dealt with-not including Mommy Dearest (as I assume that she is the series ender).While the book starts at Larry's wedding, there is not a single word of dialog from him in the book. Asher is mentioned but never appears \\"on screen\\" and considering the major changes that happened for him it is a serious flaw in ID. The same can be said for Richard's pack and his suddenly growing a backbone. The difference in behavior for Richard between CS and ID is down right jarring.Then there are the guest vampires that are never even mentioned-Bartolome and Valentina (who is someone I would like to know more about). They never appear in ID. They have disappeared completely. And some of the tricks that were new in CS become old hat by the end of ID-visits from the Dragon and Damion's creator.While there is a kernel of good story here, it is too disconnected from the events in CS and buried under too much sex. A rewrite with a continuity check would be nice. And I am left wondering just how drunk (and for how long) a werewolf can get."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Remember those coffee commercials? \\"We've secretly replaced their brewed coffee with [this instant coffee]\\"?That's how I feel. I honestly don't think LKH is writing these novels anymore. The publisher has secretly replaced her with someone else.This series started so brilliantly only to be decimated into something unreconizable. The only way to fix this?- Anita wakes up and the last couple of novels were a dream. (A la that favorite 80's TV show based on a town in Texas)- Edward comes in and kills everyone.- LKH just starts from the ending of OB and tries again.I'm done. I've had it. I won't even borrow the next book. This is pathetic."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"First things first, I am a total fan and Anitaverse enthusiast. Secondly this a rant, but one my fellow fans will most likely agree on. Anita has to be one of my favorite things on the planet. Its a most appealing escape. And now...now it has become this [...]with a threadbare plotline that is putting a bad taste in my mouth towards the entire series. To rectify that I went back and started to reread them and know exactly why they were worth my time, adoration, and money. So here we go-1. Anita. She was a royal pain, a big mouth with a Napoplean complex, but that was her most likeable trait. She was noble, she was a warrior, and she was also her own worst enemy. It was her against the world and that is what gave her an edge.2. The love triangle triumverate. Hamilton was a genius when it came down to creating the best rock\\\\hard place love triangle. Two men, polar opposites, appealing to a broad readership.As more men come in, her love life becomes cheap, and depressing, it trivializes how hard she fought to keep her virtue and her independence.3. The guns, the cops, her real life. I am tired of all the magic, I am so tired of all the rough sex(does anyone find it erotic...honestly?300 pages spanning one day and no shower...ewww) I am tired of watching these characters crash and burn. I am tired of the near invincibility of all the core characters(which grows and grows)I am tired of \\"power plateaus\\". I miss the normalcy, the little things, her privacy, her coffee, even her bad clothes. I miss her stuffed penguins and her angelfish. The minutea that made her a real person. Also does anyone else remember VLAD SYNDROME-she wasn't exactly safe in the last few books.***So here are my recommendations of how to get things on track. They are severe, but desperate times and all that.1. Kill Nathaniel, this is an empty, annoying character. He is a houseboy!, its somewhat [...], frankly I hate him. Kill him, show Anita she can't save everyone.2. Get rid of Damien,this is another dead weight character, he has the presence and emotional range of a mildewed rag. Cut him out, have him establish his independence...whatever.3. Let the other shoe drop with Micah, let him be a villian. With him I just don't buy the mister perfect, soulmate garbage. And how often does she mention that he's just too good to be true...let it be. Richard I believe she loves, Micah-nope. It would be a perfect slap in the face.4. Do something about the ardeur, again who really likes it? Its a plot device to have a lot of sex with a lot of people. But its done, its annoying, and the books start to have a narrative like a [...] movie. Also it does not make Anita sexually empowered at all, she couples with all these people not out of desire but out of a handicap. Curb the ardeur, somehow.5. No more men can love or respect her promiscuous lifestyle. Bring back female characters who arent' 1. lesbians 2.married 3.villians. Cut the harem lifestyle.6. Anita needs to hit rock bottom, she has become too comfortable and that needs to stop if this franchise wants to keep afloat. The smut, the rule breaking, the empty libido driven characters, I enjoyed the harsh independence of a lone gunmen in a world gone mad, I miss her. The Anita of the past would hate this new weak oversexed Anita. If I wanted to read erotica, I own better, I'd read that. I read these for the characters."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The strong, female, gun toting executioner that's drawn so many fans to this series is dead. She's been turned into a soft porn imitation.This latest entry in the series continues the downward spiral began in Narcissus in Chains and Cerulean Sins. The real mystery seemed to be where the plot went! It was lost amongst so much detailed, clinical... and suprisingly boring sex. Over three-fourths of the book is just gratuitous sex. One partner, two partner, beastiality.. our girl does it all. What she doesn't actually do in this volume is CATCH the bad guy.I can understand the purpose for character development, but by the end I was hoping that Edward would show up and provide a deadly intervention for all involved. Unfortunately, he didn't make an appearance. It's sad to say, but after three such 'transitional' books, I'm done with the series."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I picked up the book from the library and still felt cheated after I'd read it. There is only enough plot to keep the erotica progressing. This really should have been published as a Harlequin Romance, except it might even be too graphic for that.To add insult to injury, this book has not been proofread. I stopped counting incorrect spelling, bad grammar and the use of incorrect homophones about halfway through. Does Jove employ editors?"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I agree with all of the above. I have read all the books, but lately I feel like Anita Blake has left the building. Where is the Executioner? I understand that she contracted the ardeur and must then \\"feed\\" it, but does the whole book have to be about her sex? I am nearing the end of the book and I feel like there is about 10% story in there and 90% porn. If I have to read the phrase \\"endless loop of pleasure\\" one more time I will absolutely shove a pencil through one of my eyeballs. It is that bad. There is so much overanalyzing over everything and so much review....HELLO! Why would someone start a series at the 12th book?! I don't need to know who Jean Claude, Ronnie, Asher, Richard, etc are. And I don't need to hear about each of the characters eyes every single time they enter the room. I get it, LKH has said it in EVERY book...Jean-Claude's eyes are midnight blue. I get that Nathaniel's eyes are lavender. I get that Micah has his leopard eyes all the time. Jeepers, enough is enough. It just feels like LKH has had enough success that her editors will distribute [...] just because her name is on it. I'm sincerely sorry over the loss of my beloved Anita Blake."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Laurell K Hamilton is so much better than this. The book spends far too much time fretting over Anita's X-rated personal life and never really gets into the crux of the murder mystery we were promised in the beginning. By the end of the book, we don't really know any more about the original plot than when we began, and we know far too much about Anita's bed hopping. This isn't a character \\"maturing\\", unless you rate maturity by the number of sexual partners a person has. This is a character degenerating."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"If I had stopped with Obsidian Butterfly I would have been infinitely happier. Someone had mentioned that this book was like a sexual revolution for Anita, and after this they were sure LKH would get back to writing stories and not dull and endless sex scenes. Having read the latest in the Gentry series, I have to conclude that this will not be the case, and that either LKH has thrown in the towel for writing good fiction, or someone is lying to her.I have no objections to a lengthy sex scene or two as long as it helps the story along, but give me a break. The scenes should be a small part of the story, not the story a small part of the scenes. LKH should find a couple of her earliest fans and let them shred her rough drafts before she even considers submitting them for publication. I am sure sex sells, but can't she have a smut series (and don't start with the Gentry books, they are holding their shape better than Blake right now) seperate from what used to be the awesome Anita Blake one?Every book LKH has published since OB, in either series, has been progressively more choppy, more pointless, and more based on endless, repetative, sex...we all understand she has an Ardeur problem,...really, I promise, enough already.If I bother to read any of her future works, it will be from the library and strickly to see if she actually takes any of her critisicm to heart. 2.5 stars for an Anita Blake novel? Poor show Ms. Hamilton. Very poor show indeed."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"600 pages of pure porn, which got boring and repetitious...200 would have sufficed. That left 58 pages for a skimpy plot. I love(d??) the Anita Blake of old...she has turned into nothing but a sex-craved, sleep-deprived, orgy-loving whore. I agree with other reviews...Nathaniel was the most interesting character in this book.I don't know where the old Anita went, but she definately isn't here. I usually pick up a new Anita Blake novel and can't stop reading till I'm done!! I had to struggle to get through it, a few pages at a time, and the only reason I stuck with it was because I kept hoping it would get better, around page 590 it got to be good and vaguely resembled the reason why I bought the book in the first place.Heed the warnings, don't spend your money on this book. You won't miss anything if you skip it: oh wait, (SPOILER!!AHEAD!!) she has a new triumverant, gains a power level, and sleeps with Nathanial, and leaves the murder plot unresolved..it took 658 pages for that..(END SPOILER) Pray Laurel Hamilton reads these reviews. I am hoping she doesn't do to Meredith what she has done to Anita...guess we'll find out in April."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"There's a plot here. I'm sure. I read through all 752 pages of this, the 12th Anita Blake novel, and there were vague hints of a plot toward the end. I think. The rest of the book, though, should have been subtitled, \\"How I Stopped Worrying and Came to Love Wanton Sex.\\"I mean, really. By the end of the first chapter, Anita -- erstwhile vampire hunter and current multi-discipline sex queen of St Louis -- has boffed two strangers. A few more chapters, a few more strangers. By the end of the book pretty much every lycanthrope or vampire Anita's run across -- certainly every series regular -- has gotten down and dirty with her.There are a few moments where there's, well, interesting stuff happening. All's not well with the vampiric Church of Eternal Life, there are some rogue vamps doing Very Bad Things, there's another powerful vampire doing cunning things, and ...... and, of course, Anita has New Amazing Powers, which lead to New Mystical Complications, even as she continues her steady evolution toward being the Mystic Queen of the Midwest (one must assume).But enough of that trivial leavening. We're here for the hot, sweaty, and other-fluidly vampire-necromancer-lycanthrope sex, right? Am I right? Evidently I am. And that's not to mention frequent polemics on sex, strangers, B&D;, S&M;, following your bliss, accepting your kinks, and other received wisdom from the woman who can't decide if she's being driven to being a slut because of metaphysical compulsion or because it's fun.Not that I necessarily have a problem with sex, or books with sex scenes -- but, really, fergoshsakes, after a while it gets repetitive. And boring. And repetitive. Most books would be satisfied with a cut scene from when things get hot and heavy to the aftermath. Not Incubus Dreams (or, frankly, most of the recent AB books); we end a chapter just as things are getting hot and heavy -- and the next chapter is all about the hot-and-heaviness. At length (which is ironic on multiple levels).(Note to copy editors: the synonym for \\"god\\" you are looking for is \\"deity.\\" Not \\"diety.\\" No matter how many times you let it be typed that way.)Mercifully, the next installment, _Micah_, is ... well, at least a decent echo of the original books in this series. Skip this one, go to that, and at least feel like you've gotten a story for your [...]."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"While I have enjoyed the previous Anita Blake books, they are just getting boring. If you are out of puberty 400 pages of sex scenes are about 300 pages too much. I'm getting where I read them like I read a Tom Clancy novel. Plot, skip 70 pages of detailed submarine description, plot, skip 50 pages of helicopter description. I wish Laurell Hamilton would get a sex life herself so she can start back writing an actual story or two."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I just started reading the Anita Blake series. I bought all of them and read them in a couple of weeks. My original impressions of the characters are still fresh. However, I don't know why she decided to butcher them.I loved the series thru Blue Moon, after that I don't know what happened to the characters. I'm far from being a prude, I enjoy reading erotica I just would prefer a little romance with it. If that makes me a prude (seeing as we get lectured about views on sex thoughout the series) so be it.Who is Anita now? She went from being modest about her nudity and wanting a relationship and monogomy to screwing every and anyone. Now she needs 2 men at a time to \\"flat to it for her\\". When she's not screwing everyone she is showing them she has the biggest \\"balls\\". I love the thought of a strong woman but she is now in the \\"god\\" status with all her new found power's.I'm a romantic at heart and I actually thought Richard/Anita was a good love story. I could live with a Jean Claude/Richard/Anita traingle. Instead I had to live with Jean Claude/ Asher/ Anita, Nathaniel/Jason/ Anita, Nathaniel/ Damien/ Anita, let's not forget Micah or anyone else that may be sitting around. But she love's them all. No plot, no romance just boring sex scene after sex scene. I'm enjoying Christine's Feehan's Mind Games and Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter series more than the last 3 installments of the Anita Blake series.What a shame the series started out so interesting."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I enjoyed this book, but only for the character development that Nathaniel goes through. Too many characters doing the exact same things they've done for the past three books, having the same conversations and issues that they've had, using the exact same descriptions and language. Only with more sex that really doesn't feel innovative (again, with the exception of Nathaniel's interactions with Anita). This book felt like watching porn on tv, flipping to other channels during the commercials for long enough to catch the surface of other plots. Entertaining, but not satisfying and certainly not up to the standard of Obsidian Butterfly or Blue Moon.Another reviewer quoted Hamilton complaining that female authors are discouraged from writing erotica about women, and this is her response to that discrimination. Is she completely unaware of the millions of dollars in the romance novel industry, which consists almost exclusively of female authors writing about female characters for female readers, frequently involving explicit sexual behavior? Hamilton would do well to get over whatever snit she's having about feminism and prove that female authors can deliver well-turned, non-repetitive prose that incorporates effective erotica.And to add to the list of phrases that were clever the first two times they were used, but lost any sense of creativity when they were used in every chapter of every book:\\"spill\\" (applied to anything not liquid, including cloth, hair, boots and even entire people)\\"blood and thicker things\\" (You know what? Just say gore. Or brains. Or chunks, scabs, clots, mucus, flesh, tissue, gobs or any of a number of words available in your local thesaurus.)And a spelling lesson:deity, not \\"diety\\"nein, not \\"nien\\"Spellcheck and a thesaurus are your friends, and can even be used in the middle of writing! I expect more from a professional, published author and her editing and publishing team. I would prefer publishing dates to be set back if such basic errors are to be left in a manuscript. All in all, this was not the worst book I've read, but I was severely disappointed."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am returning this book...The jacket cover an all of the advertisements suggested that Anita was finally up against the ulitmate evil... A serial killer that is a vampire and that preys on strippers.Well, not very original.. because what serial killers don't prey on strippers? but I wanted to see where LKH went with this one.By page 317 of her 650 atrocity named Succubus Dreams, she has devoted only 5 pages to the story line.She is not doing any investigating, she is not being asked to consulate on any Federal cases, she is not doing anything at all but sleeping with anyone and everyone that comes across her path... and then afterwards sharing this information with anyone that comes into her life.I am just going to return this book and buy a magazine or something."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This \\"Book\\" (and BOY, do I use the term loosely) was like a train wreck.It was excruciating, and you really didn't want to see it, but you were so transfixed by the degree of it's horrendousness that you just couldn't look away.Don't buy it, and for gods-sakes, do not read it.If I could give negative stars, I would.You can't find the plot between the badly-written porn and the glaringly obvious fact that Laurell K. Hamilton is living (ew) vicariously through Anita.As a reader, I'll find it hard to get past the fact that I was reading an author's disgusting sexual fantasies even if LKH ever does learn how to write again (unlikely).The author and her books have proved themselves to be one thing: Garbage."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have to agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers. I LOVE the Anita Blake series, in fact, I have read almost all of them within the space of a couple of months. I was addicted!Anita was a real spitfire with a razor sharp sense of humor and a smart-ass comeback for every situation. She had really evolved into something sassy and fun to read about since her first book, but now she is nothing more than a desperate nymphomaniac running around in heat!! SOOOO DISAPPOINTING!! Don't get me wrong here, I had always loved that Ms. Hamilton could artfully (and tastefully) weave a little hot sex into a great storyline.But that seems to be no more.There is absolutely NO plotline to this book at all. The author wraps it up at the end with flimsy, convenient explanations. This book is nothing but pure sex. If you are looking to read some cheap erotica, (and not-so good erotica, at that!) then this may be the book for you. I'm sorry Laurell, I NEVER thought I would trash one of your books, but I don't think you deserve even one star for this piece of trash! I think I'll go re-read Guilty Pleasures so I can have my old Anita back!! :("},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have read the entire Anita Blake series, and I enjoyed every one until Incubus Dreams. This book was nothing more than vivid soft porn. Every few pages Anita was involved with another partner or several partners. I understand the \\"ardeur\\" being a new complex issue that needs to be controlled, but it took over the story line. Normally I can not put one of these books down until I have finished. I found myself skimming pages or forcing myself to continue to find the point of endless sex. I hope the next one has more story and less random sexual encounters."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"If you can ignore the poor writing, editing errors,you will still find this book VERY Disappointing. Almost all sex, safe sex-NOT. Anita Blake has become VERY boring having to have sex every other minute,Anita no longer has time to fight the bad guys, develope a plot, or finish a story line. It is time to put Anita Blake on a new road or retire her to the dead or undead. I will not buy another A.Blake novel-So sad to say goodbye ma petite."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Boring. I just want to reflect on what that word means.uninteresting, tiresome, dull, monotonous, unexciting...All of these are very apt words to describe the quality, the storyline, the plot-- Well, just about everything about this book.I've tried to \\"read deeper\\" into what Anita is going through. I've tried to see her incessant humping as \\"character growth\\". But frankly, the only thing I saw growing was the amount of men in her \\"hisem\\" and the bits and pieces of said men.I'm not going to wait and see what happens next. I refuse to see if she pulls out of this slump or decides to put more effort into writng a good novel. I've already given this woman a buttload of my money and I don't intend to give her any more.And I just want to say that I'd really have loved to give it a negative score but they don't have that option."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have always loved the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter books. I have read every single one published to date. But, this is ridiculous! It's just page after page of sex with vampires and wereanimals. Besides, there is something bizarre about the S&M fixation. A little sex adds spice to a good novel. But, the basis for the novel should be it's plot. This book had a poor plot line thrown in, so Ms. Hamilton could publish blatant pornography and call it a novel. Yeah, I read all of it, but I won't bother with the any future books in the series. I just can't express how much it saddens me that such a fun series should become have evolved into such complete trash."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The early Anita Blake stories were engrossing, something happening on every page. I read them in one sitting, regardless of how late I had to stay up. But the last few have been so focused on sex that any other plot is lost in the bedsheets. Frankly, I am getting turned off by Anita's nonstop sexual activities. She was an action heroine, a woman who knew she was good at what she did. Now, by the time you sort out who she's in bed with and why, you really don't care if you even finish the book. Go ahead, put it down--pick it up tomorrow. You haven't missed anything. This will certainly be the last hardback I buy by Ms. Hamilton."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I LOVE LKH. My sister and I both buy her books in hardcover because we can't decide who will read it first. We finish these books in well under a week. Incubus Dreams, however, took me 3 weeks to finish. The great suspense that I love about LKH books was completely missing. The book starts with a murder mystery and then it is forgotten until the very end. The middle is Anita having sex with everyone. As if she wasn't already sleeping with enough men, new ones were brought in. The ardeur is getting old. Many of the core characters were completely ignored. Where was Asher? If Damian is now part of a new triumverant why didn't we see him very often?If you are a die hard fan, like me, then you have to read the book in order to move on in the series, but wait for it to come out in paperback."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. This book contains barely 100 pages of any kind of relevant plot and 4 or 5 hundred pages of kinky sex. It's boring. Please, let's return to the first books in the series, where Anita is a woman with a purpose, who deals with supernatural messiness and solves crimes. If there is an absolute need for mentioning the \\"ardeur\\", include one sex act, maybe 2. That's it. If I want porn, I'll go buy XXX.I mean, what ever happened to interesting characters, like the 2 kid vampires from the previous book? What about the Mother of Darkness? Why is her waking going to be so disasterous? Give us some PLOT!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"SEX....and then some more sex. The plot shows up at odd intervals...occasionally. Well, it's more like the plot is tacked on to a porn story. I used to like this series, before it became nothing more than Hamilton writing down her fantasy life for all to see...It used to have good characters, pace, plot, and that VIBE a good book gives you. But in this one, the author has abandoned any pretense that it is anything more than a porn story.I have no problem with erotica in my fiction. But this isn't erotica. It is poorly written, dull, and cliched sex. Period. I liked most of the previous books because Anita was a strong character. Well-grounded, but with quirks. She has now become nothing more than a cardboard cutout. All I can say is that if LKH isn't interested in developing her characters or their actual involvement in the Anita Blake world, why should we, as readers, be interested in them at all?I am sorry I wasted my money."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":".. or not. By the sheer thickness of this books, I did flashback to the Order of the Phoenix - and was expecting the same must-get-through-book-and-read-it-again feeling.Not happening. I like sex. I like the sex scenes in the previous books.But for the love of all that is good in this world, why did I have to suffer through 500 pages of increasingly perverse sex? Okay - I can try and understand.. when you're screwing someone five times a day, apparently vanilla sex isn't good enough. But did we really have to do furry sex?Ew. ew. And the vivid descriptions of.. er.. let's try and put this politely.. violent oral sex really contribute that much to the book? I suppose I learned a lot about how you have to be careful of your saliva while being screwed every which way.I love Anita Blake, I really do. I even love the new characters - but I honestly dread the appearance of any more long haired, darkly handsome, sexually motivated male vampire/werewhatever/tree/etc.I'm pondering re-reading the book.. after all, I did try and speed read all 700 pages, so many I missed the plot?I have hope.. but I still worry that this book will end up like Jean Auel's Children of the Earth series where I ended up just skipping half the book.My suggestion? Loan it from your library. Don't buy it."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"...or just read the last 200 pages.I am a Hamilton fan. I have all but 2 of the books she's written, and I've read everything I don't have. I eagerly await each book. ...And then Incubus Dreams came out. I'm not sure if I even want to read the next Merry Gentry (the teaser in the back of 'Incubus' was icky, not tantalizing. Violent sex with goblins! and men with hundreds of tentacles! Hooray!), and I'm *really* not sure about the next Anita. I buy (bought) the LKH books for the plot. They are intelligent, interesting, and they have Edward! But *this* book devoted 500 of its 700 pages to increasingly perverse sex scenes. I do understand that the sex scenes are a bit of a 'F**k You' to the publishing world, but she's alienating her fans more than anything else.Every time the actual plot emerged, I almost started cheering. And then, just as I got my hopes up, Anita had to screw someone else. Again and again and again. I prefer the Hamiltons where the violence is almost enough to turn your stomach, *not* the sex scenes! Erotica is great, but I don't buy these specifically for the erotica (and I have no interest in mild bestiality).Admittedly, the last 150 or so pages were quite interesting. And the Malcolm-not-binding-fledglings plot had massive potential. But LKH didn't really go anywhere with it. And please, did Anita really have to use her 'sexual wiles' to interrogate the suspects? That, almost more than anything else, made me loose hope that this marvelous series might redeem itself. Anita has always been interesting because she is so tough, violent, and mildly deranged. Now, well, she doesn't beat people up, she has sex (or almost does) with them instead.If you are looking for a Hamilton to read, start with an early book, and for your sake, stop before 'Cerulean Sins', and stay far, far away from Incubus Dreams."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"...it would be that phlegm-filled hacking noise your cat makes before it shoots a hairball onto your freshly vacuumed carpet. I have been an avid fan of the Anita Blake books from the beginning; they were a great combo of interesting characters blazing their ways through lives of sex, violence, and metaphysics. Now it's the same characters, but all Anita does is alternately whine and offer shallow theological \\"insights\\" about her life. And the (for lack of a better word) plot? All I saw was a pale attempt to patch monotonous sex scenes together, much in keeping with a cheap porno where the \\"plot\\" is to have the pizza boy knock on the door and say, \\"Did someone order extra sausage?\\" In the end, there wasn't even a showdown--more of a minor skirmish, and then the plot wraps up with virtually no resolution. If it was an attempt to keep me waiting with bated breath until the next book comes out to pick up where this one left off, it failed. Miserably.Basically, if I want erotica, I'll go to that section. It's better written than these cheap thrill scenes--which I started to skim read after about the third in ten pages. PLEASE, more plot!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This is an improvement over the past two books in the series, in that less than half the book is devoted to sex scenes and the other half actually deals with plot. I think that Ms. Hamilton was trying to work through the sexual material to try and get Anita back on track, so I HOPE that the next book will be back to mostly plot. Basically, the first third of the book is plot development, with minor sex scenes. The next third and a bit beyond is sex, sex, and more sex, to the point that a scene that should have been a pivotal resolution just bored me. (Hint to Ms. Hamilton: less is more; don't try to cram every last sex scenario into one book) The rest goes back to plot for the most part, with a strong hint that the next book will be about finishing up some missed details (not all the bad guys were caught). I'm hoping that means it will be more like Obsidian Butterfly (which I consider to be the high point of the series)."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I started the Anita Blake series when book four had just come out and loved them. Paranormal mystery has always been my cup of tea. Unfortunately this latest version of Anita Blake is noticeably lacking in mystery. Rather it just seems to be page after page of sex. How convenient that Anita now has this \\"gift\\" that requires her to sleep with every male she happens across. This is nothing like the Anita I grew to love. If I wanted a book about sex I would get a harlequin novel. So, if you want a book full of gratuitous sex this is for you.

AAAARRRGGGHHH!!I was so fed up with the sex, I started flipping pages halfway through. There is no plot, period. I like paranormal mysteries/adventure stories. I like novels about kick-ass women.

Plain and simple, Anita's at her best when she's solving crimes and kicking ass. Incubus Dreams took that Anita Blake away from me and became the trash that turned me towards her in the first place. I finished the book, all 650+ pages of it, and the 50 or so pages dedicated to her sleuthing wasn't near enough to make up for the endless sexual descriptions found in the 600 other pages. With the previous books, the focus was the crimes that needed solving, the sex was anticipated, and the descriptions made you want to share the experience with her. This time around, the sex made me sick and completely turned off...not only from this book, but if this is the way the series is headed--I'm closing this chapter for good."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I love the Anita Blake series. i love the kick ass hard girl. the sexy vamps and werewolves. the crime and detective bit. and the council politics and scheming. or i used to. where has that all gone now? for the last few books all the characters seem to do is whine about how they cant cope with their love lives, go over old ground continually OUT LOUD (for whose benefit?) and have lots of sex. Now don't get me wrong, i usually really enjoy the sex scenes, with vamps and blood and were-animals and things just making things more interesting for all us vampire fans out there, but these weren't even fun, they were boring and pointless and still full of whining! i want the old Anita back with maybe a good dose of Edward, keep the sex in but make it part of a PLOT, where the reason for the book is to solve a crime or take out a Master, not just have it going on in the background.I will read the next book, as i love the idea behind the series but there might come a point where we might have to admit that the Anita we love is gone and we might have to move on."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This is by far the worst book of this series. I don't think anyone bothered to proof read it prior to printing it and in the 650 pages, LKH forgot to put in a plot. I started reading her books for the battles that Anita fought and won, this book was Anita having sex with everyone that crossed her path. Her AB books started going downhill with Narcissis in Chains, then Cerulean Sins, and now this. This was the last time I shell out $28 for a book from her."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I loved the first few Anita Blake books. I love the character, and I enjoyed the sexual tension of the series. I enjoyed it as sex became more and more part of the stories. However, there are limits. This isn't a book with a plot, it is a series of soft-porn short stories with repeat characters. The author has even run out of ways to describe things, and repeats phrases several times over trying to describe the climactic moments. I am no longer buying her books new, and will only be looking for used copies, if at all. She has made it clear with the new six hour rule that the next book in the series will be entirely about Anita's sexcapades."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams is without a doubt, a complete and utter disaster. I've taken a great disliking ot Anita Blake since Narcissus in Chains, and Cerulean Sins and ID did nothing to fix that. I read all of Ms. Hamilton's Anita Blake series in less than a year, one right after another, so the change from Obsidian Butterfly to NiC was especially jarring.As for Incubus Dreams, I read most of it at school, where I removed the cover and hid the title for fear of complete embarrassment. Reading mechanical and uninteresting porn did nothing to alleviate my before-finals stress. Frankly, I find this character assassination. the Anita Blake we knew and loved has been killed, and replaced with some whiny brat who should have been killed by at least SOME jealous lover. I mean, honestly. She's having sex with a dozen guys, and they're all okay with this? Okay enough, at least, to not up and take a swing at another guy? Seriously.Also, the sheer amount of sex was staggering. I mean, shouldn't Anita be kind of sore? Kind of, as in walking bowlegged. She had sex so often and at the most inopportune times, it was like she tripped and accidently had sex with the guy she landed on.Frankly, ID was like a badly written fanfiction. Definitely not worth a reread, or even a first read if you're a staunch fan of the first books."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book was a total waste of my time and money. The Anita Blake series has become nothing more than soft core pornography. The fantasy elements exist now only to justify Anita having sex with someone and describing it in unnecessary detail. If I truly wanted soft core porn, I would have bought something else. The ardeur needs to go. The triumvirate with Nathaniel and Damien needs to go. Get back to the fantasy elements, with only one or two sex scenes thrown in to liven up the story with characters the reader will care about. Ms. Hamilton, there is alot of room to continue this series, if you will only concentrate on the story and the character and the supernatural world Anita inhabits.I used to really enjoy this series. Now it is just a disappointment. In fact, stop writing the series.

I'm glad I'm a man too. If I were a woman I'd be raising hell about the downward spiral of morphing Anita Blake into the writers stand in from the roof tops. I don't care what writers do behind closed doors, but to advertise it in book form is disgusting and so is this so called novel. That's the only justification there seems to be why this book is what it is. Bad. I couldn't find the plot and it wasn't because I didn't try.

Hamilton, however my questions about editing, the quality of the sex scenes and the bleeding over of phrases from her Vampire Hunter series have obviously fallen on Deaf ears. After visiting her MB to attempt to find an answer, and reading post of fans wishing her well, as her Grandmother is ill ~ I found this rant posted on the Laurell K. Hamilton Message board on May 3, 2005.\\"Tuesday, May 03, 2005And the flags go upI wasn't going to post this blog. It's one I wrote back in February when Jon and I first realized how mean some people had gotten on the guestbook on the blog. But today when I read over the blog entries that Darla and Jon had made I accidently went back a screen or two and saw some of the messages on the board. Shame on the handful of nasty, jealous, individuals. We don't owe anyone an apology for anything we've done. But I'm loosing track of the apologies that people might owe us. Yes, my grandmother is dying, but not because of a second stroke. And the change since her 94th birthday is not that great a change, unfortunately. She has been ill for a very long time. Do I really have to say that I'm aware my grandmother is dying to strangers. Yes, you are fans, readers, but you don't know me personally. Do I really have to share details of my life that only my friends deserve to know to keep some of you from being cruel? I went up four weeks ago with my husband, and daughter to say good-bye to the woman who raised me. I wanted Trinity to see her before it got too bad. She did. We did. There was no Hallmark moment. I did not expect one. But we went, we said good-bye, and I knew the news would eventually be bad. Or good, she is in so much pain now. You don't want to loose them, but you understand that they are tired of hurting.Is this what some of you want, my pain? Not happy that I don't share my innermost torment? Books not enough? Blog not enough? 99 percent of my fans are some of the nicest, niftiest people on the face of the planet, but to that other 1 percent I say this. No I won't say it. I have deleted several choice things here. But I won't say them, because maybe that is what the nasty-minded noisy 1 percent want. They want me to be as mean-spirited, cruel, and rude as they are. Well, not today. Maybe that small ugly percentage will wear me down and I will finally loose my temper publicly. I hope not. But today I am a grown-up, who was raised by a strong woman who taught me that you are polite to strangers. That you are nice to people if they will let you be. That was the way I was raised and that is the way I will behave.What follows is the rest of the post I wrote some months ago. Enjoy, I guess.Darla and Jon tell me that I really don't want, or need, to read some of the posts that have prompted Jon to think the guest book has out-lived its usefulness. There was a time, not so long ago, that I would have insisted. I would have read all the crabbiness, but I've grown up since then, or maybe I'm just tired. I'll vote for tired.Jon is going to put up a link to the moderated board. Apparently, some of you guys that were unhappy because the moderators of the main board were not allowing you to call names and say cruel things, decided to come over to the blog. The guest book was unmoderated. It was a place where you could speak, and maybe, just maybe, I might see it. I never get on the board. But a few of you, a small, but vocal minority, have forgotten that the guest book was a privaledge not a right. So, like any privaledge that gets abused, it goes away.Now, some of you are going to say, she just can't take criticism. That Jon and Darla are keeping me away from the fans that would tell me the truth and bring the series back to where you want it to be. You, the vocal minority, started complaining to me, and Jon, on the tour for Narcissus in Chains. You complained that there was too much sex, and that she shouldn't have dumped Richard. You guys actually made me doubt so much I went back and reread the scene. Anita didn't dump Richard, he dumped her, for being more comfortable with the monsters than he was. So the most vocal, the most cruel, those that called other fans that didn't agree with you names, most of you that have been the least well-mannered have wanted the same things. One, you wanted less sex in the books. Two, you wanted Richard to win. You differed on other stuff, but that was your main desires.Cerulean Sins was the next book, then Incubus Dreams. Did you, of the vocal minority, notice a trend in these books? Richard was almost non-existent in CS, and I had to fight with my subconscious to get him into ID. And the sexual content? Is it going up or down? I think up, definitely up.I did not do it on purpose, it wasn't in the front of my head, but my subconscious has always been contrary. You tell me I can't do something, or shouldn't do it, or try to force your preferences on me, and I have to really fight not to do just the opposite of what you want me to do. It wasn't until somewhere near the end of Incubus that I realized all your complaints both hearing about them third hand, and in person on tour was effecting me in the way I just described. I can't stop doing something if I don't realize why I'm doing it. Now I do, but you know what, I'm going to have to take a nod from Ms. Rowling. She said in an interview that nothing anyone says, or wants, will change a single word she's writing in her wonderful series. Well, folks, guess what, me either.But unlike Ms. Rowling, you are having an effect on me, one I keep fighting against. A very negative one. You tell me that there's too much sex, and part of me thinks, you ain't seen nothing yet. You advocate Richard, and it makes it hard to write him as a character, because every time I deal with him, I hear the ugly echoes in my head of you.You are allowed to express your unhappiness, but politely. Not just to me, but to other fans. For all of you who have been complaining, and not just the vocal minority, here are some examples of things that can be said in moderated space:I would like more mystery and less interpersonal relationships in the next book. (Me, too.) I would like Anita to end up with Jean-Claude. I would like Anita to end up with Asher and Jean-Claude. I would like Anita to end up with Micah. I would like Anita to end up with Nathaniel. I would like Anita to end up with Richard. I would like Anita to end up with Nathaniel and Micah. I would like Anita to not choose and keep everybody. I'm a Damian fan, why can't she pick him? (A variant of that.) I'd like to see more sex with Damian. I'd like to see more sex with Asher. I'd like to see more of Asher on stage, period. I'd like to see more Jean-Claude. When is Jason going to take one for the team again? I would like to see (insert character name) do more of (insert activity) with Anita. Oh, and some would like Asher and Jean-Claude to be a couple so that Anita and Richard could be a couple. There's even the, Ronnie and Anita should be a couple contingent. We'd like to see Anita do her job more. (Me, too.) More police action please. More with Marianne and Verne's pack. More vampire politics. More furry politics. More zombies please. When are we going to see Willie and Angel-fangs again? More Edward, please. When will Olaf come back?I've covered most of the different complaints, though not all. I've left out the personal attacks on me and my husband. I've left out the fans that wanted me to kill Micah, and have Anita pin his leopard hide to her wall. (I am not making that up. A fan asked, and meant it.) The last few are just mean, folks.But seeing the previous list, tell me how am I to please everyone? There is no way, so I shall please myself, because in the end if you don't please yourself, then what is left to you?You are all allowed to disagree with the direction the series has taken, or who Anita is dating, or sleeping with. Feel free, but be nice about it. You can say the same thing but in a polite manner and it won't be deleted. It won't be censored. But the moderators on the board do not allow personal verbal assaults on other fans, or on me, or even the moderators. Be nice, or play somewhere else.The arduer is a major metaphysical ability, and curse/blessing. It cannot be brought into the series and then fixed just like that. Anything this powerful should have consequences, and a learning curve. I've always planned on Anita getting to the point where she can control the arduer and not have to have sex every few hours. (And already I hear some fans complaining that I'll be cutting the sex down. We actually have vastly more people who love the higher sexual content than hate it. They just don't get mean about it, so they don't get as much press. And by the way, as the sexual content has gone up, so have the sales of the book. I didn't plan it that way, but it's worked out that way.) I'd always planned on the arduer being controllable so Anita can go out of town as a federal marshal. The arduer traps her here in St. Louis, unless she takes a harem for food. You can't do police work that way, not out of town. So, have patience, and it will calm down. I honestly don't know where her domestic arrangement will go. I didn't plan on us being where we are. Anita is more contrary than I am, and every time I push one person over another, she digs her feet in and does the opposite of what I had planned. A trait we share, for good, or ill.But I will not rush the transition. I will not hurry my overall plot because some of you are not happy with it. I am sorry you seem so unhappy. If you are truly that unhappy with the direction the series has taken, then stop reading it. Stop reading what I write. There, simply, fixed. If you don't like it, don't buy it, don't read it.If I was as rude and nasty to my fans as a few of them have been to me and to my husband, you would be screaming about it. And you'd have a right to complain. Let me clue you, all of you, just because a person is a celebrity, in a small way or large, they are still people. If you wouldn't be this nasty to your friend, or neighbor, then why do you get to be that nasty to someone just because they write a book, or acted in a movie, or sang a song. Does being an artist mean that common decency no longer applies?As for those who claim I'm in an ivory tower, well it's my tower, and if I want not to listen to people call me names, or speculate on my sex life with my husband, then I'm entitled not to listen. All of you complaining that I isolate myself from what you believe to be the truth, remember that you aren't right. Your opinion is just your opinion, not right, not wrong, just your opinion You are entitled to it. As I am entitled to mine. It's a free country, last I checked, and that means we are all entitled to our opinions. But being entitled to an opinion doesn't make you right.posted by LKH at 3:51 PM \\"If you have any complaints, concerns or wish that the series world return to it's original premise, your hopes are in vain, LKH has stated that the series will continue as she sees fits to spite those who are not happy."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"And I don't mean \\"nightmares\\" in a good scary, enjoy-the-ride sort of way. Not that there isn't a lot \\"riding\\" going on in this book.When you read a thrown together mess of a book, like this one, its almost impossible to figure out how to write a review for it. The mystery plot is so inconsequential, it hardly seems worthy of mentioning. Funny that. This supposed mystery is still being put on the book jacket, and used at the various book sites, to advertise the book. Come on Laurell, lets stop the ruse. False advertising if ever there was an example. Just like \\"Vampire Hunter\\" still being used to describe the main character. Take the n & t out of Hunter, and stick in m & p, and its a much more accurate depiction of the plot and main character.I certainly don't mind a good sex scene. In fact, love 'em. There isn't one to be found in this book, unless your idea of good sex generally involves a visit to the emergency room and a drop cloth. I find Ms Hamilton's need for graphic details to be so curious, and somewhat disturbing. Did anyone need to know Anita was a \\"rainmaker\\"? Thanks for that visual, I'll never be able to watch the Burt Lancaster film again. And the painstaking description of a manuever involving oral sex is so clinical as to be hysterical. Is this a fictional novel, or a sex manual? If its the latter? *shudders*To set out one scene for its particular badness, I'll have to choose the long anticipated coming together of Jean-Claude, Master Vampire extraordinaire and sexy French guy, Richard, powerful werewolf king, gorgeously sexy, and totally messed up in the head (he used to a GREAT character, until Ms Hamilton gutted him) and Anita, bestest everything in the universe. I know so many readers that longed for this scene for 5+ books, and what they got was do disappointing and unsexy, one almost wonders if it was written intentionally in a manner to kill the desire for this trio. Jean-Claude and Richard seem to be yesterdays love interests, pushed aside for newer guys. Less complex, 2-dimensional males that enjoy the \\"wife\\" role with Anita, worshipping to the Goddess 24/7. Or maybe its that the scene comes after Anita has already had sex with a legion of other guys, and frankly, this scene doesn't read much differently from the rest. Ms Hamilton seems to have only one way to describe graphic sex, and she does it over and over and over. And hysterically, Anita's inner dialogue always seems to suggest she's NEVER experianced anything like that before. Sure you did sweetie, 40 pages ago. Apparently with Anita's ramped up libido, she's developed the memory of a cocker spaniel puppy.So many good minor characters missing in this book. Edward, Rafael, Shang-Da, Jamil, Sylvie, Stephen, Cherry, Zane, Willie, Irving....nary a mention. Instead, brand new characters are introduced for some unfathomable reason. Just what this series needed, MORE characters ... NOT. And just try and ignore that all the new characters introduced seemed like prime candidates for Anita's ever-increasing stud factory. Subtle Ms Hamilton, Subtle. Anyone want to know why the 2 kid vampires from CS were dropped? Simple, Anita can't have sex with them.From a technical aspect, this novel is a hoot. If it was a drinking game, I'd give it 5 stars. Everytime Ms Hamilton uses the word \\"spill\\", drink. Everytime you find a misspelled word, drink. Everytime Anita begs someone to **** her, drink. I promise, you'll be passed out by page 200. Try and keep going after that, and you risk alcohol poisoning.Others have mentioned the mind meld between Merry & Anita. Absolutely, and there can be no doubt. Some authors have the time, juice and talent to write 2 distinct series, and some shouldn't even attempt it. After one Merry book, I realized that series wasn't for me. Now Anita is Merry 2, and its not for anyone who was a fan of early Anita books. I'm all for growth and evolution of characters. The invasion of the pod people is something altogether different."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I've been with this series from the beginning, but I had a really hard time getting into this, the 12th in the Anita Blake series. The book started slow and then segued into sex, sex, sex. Oh there is a mystery but it's plastered at the beginning and the end of the book with no real conclusion to the crime and no glimpse of the real killer. At over 650 pages, you'd think LKH would have enough room to conclude the mystery, right? Well, no, Anita is far too busy having sex with anyone and everyone and when she's not, she wondering if she should. I lost count of the amount of sex this wonder woman had in the length of 48 hours, which, by the way, is how much time passes in this story.If there are any fans left after Incubus Dreams, there may be a few things that can be done to save this series. And yes, I'd like to see it saved.1 An editor would be nice. Ms Hamilton is allowed to wander where she may, even in the midst of all the action she has Anita thinking about the bra she wears in order to accommodate her gun!2 Give the men back their testosterone. The men in this book have been emasculated by Anita. She has become so strong that no one seems to be able to do a thing without her. Even when she takes her two lovers to a club and someone hits on them, it's left up to Anita to get them out of it. I won't even go into what LKH has done to Jean Claude.3 I'd like to see less sex (I can't believe I'm saying this, but after a while the repetitious sex just began to NOT be all that sexy) Give me more adventure in its place. That is why we all started reading the series, because Anita was a strong female presence in a world full of men. I'd hate to see Anita hobbled, I enjoy watching her win, but she seems to become more and more masculine with every new book in the series.This is not to say that ID didn't have some entertaining moments. But they were merely moments in a 600+ page book of marathon sex and rambling thoughts."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was so looking forward to reading Incubus Dreams that I went to the bookstore and got it on its release date. I cracked it open with both anticipation and dread -- anticipation to read more of the Anitaverse and dread because I would have to wait a year for the next installment. However, Incubus Dreams disappointed me in more ways than one. To me, the series was not the same after Burnt Offerings, and it reached a downward spiral with the developments that arose in both Narcissus in Chains and Cerulean Sins, but I nevertheless loved reading all of those novels. But I couldn't get into this one and almost threw in the towel several times by the time I was halfway through the book. In this installment, Anita Blake has to find the vampire serial killer who is preying on strippers. She is certain that the local vampires aren't responsible for the murders, but then again the fact that she is the Master of the City's lover and friends with most of the local vamps may have blinded her perception a bit. To make matters worse, she has to deal with the metaphysical communications that help her see the painful pasts of the monsters around her, cope with her feelings about the men in her life and with the ardeur, which has almost taken a life of its own. In typical LKH fashion, there are many, many twists throughout the novel.Several things bothered me about this novel. First of all, I liked the symbolism of Anita wearing a tuxedo at Larry's wedding. Hamilton has always done a subtle and clever role change between Anita and the men in the series. However, it bothered me that Micah, Nathaniel, Damien and Louie cried somewhere within the first eighty or so pages -- on the same night but in different scenes. It seemed excessive to me, especially since all men, with the exception of Louie, cried over something Anita did. Another thing that bothered me was that the murder mystery was introduced in the first few pages but was completely forgotten until almost halfway through the story. The rest was wasted on metaphysical contacts in which she saw Damien and Nathaniel's pasts, tried to control a deranged Damien and, of course, fed the ardeur. The ardeur is bothersome in this installment. That storyline almost took over the plot. I am no stranger to reading stories centered on sex. I'm an avid erotica reader who's devoured almost every Black Lace, Blue Moon and Ellora's Cave book out there, but most of the sex scenes in this novel are gratuitous and unnecessary, not to mention nasty (having sex with several characters in a matter of hours, wearing the same clothes and underwear and... well, you get the picture). The whole ardeur bit wouldn't bother me so much if the series had intended to be this way from the very beginning, like the Merry Gentry series. Also, I don't like what LKH has done to Jean-Claude. He used to be one of the most compelling, sexiest and darkest characters in the series, now he's just another Anita follower. And where the heck was Asher? He hardly appeared in this installment. LKH should do a spin-off novel centered on Jean-Claude and Asher and the things that happened between them and Belle Morte centuries before Anita came along. A prequel of sorts. That would be neat. And finally, I won't even deign to elaborate on the blatant lack of editing in this book. Suffice it to say that the grammatical errors, typos and word repetitions were very distracting. Anyway, the only parts I enjoyed about this novel were the first twenty or so pages and the bits and pieces centered on the mystery aspect of the story and some of the action that had nothing to do with the metaphysical mumbo jumbo that monopolized the book. And there are some other good points -- however small -- about this novel. I liked that LKH delved deeper into Nathaniel, Damien and Micah. (But I still don't like Micah.) I also liked that Anita and Richard got into the heart of things a bit. Those two characters will always have issues though. And I also liked the fact that, though brief, Anita and Dolph worked together the way they used to in the earlier novels. All in all, Incubus Dreams was below my expectations -- 658 pages of lots of twists and turns, but by the last pages of the book I just didn't care what happened anymore. I couldn't wait to finish reading this book. I am sure that I will read the next installment, but I'll check the book out from the library or loan it from a friend. I won't spend my hard earned money on the hardback if the next novel is written in the same vein as this one. Note to Ms. Hamilton: we the readers, at least most of us, judging by the reviews on this page, want more action, mystery and suspense and less filler metaphysical and sexual situations."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Dear EdwardYou've always claimed that you wanted to kill Anita, please do us all a favour, get your finger out and do it.Yours SincerelyEx fan.Any signs that Laurell K was going back to a plotted Anita Blake story have been shot down in flames and we have yet another bloated windy, whining porn fest.

However, the one thing that I hate most about it (that hasn't received much space) is the fact that NOBODY here is allowed to have a life that doesn't revolve around Anita. Nobody has a sexual relationship with anyone but Anita. Jean-Claude once said he would share her with minor side dishes (basically) but he insists on limiting the entrees. Well, he is now a side dish along with every other male. At this point I like just about every other character more than Anita and would like to see them happy - and that doesn't mean happy that they get 1/20 of Anita. I wouldn't even mind all the sex if it involved someone other than Anita. I realize she is the central character but please! I gave my copy of ID to the library after taking 3 months to read it. This is the first time it's taken more than 3 days to read one of these books. I'll read the online reviews of the next one before deciding whether or not to bother."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I got it from a library. A library that I walked to (so I didn't even spend gas money). I still want my money back. I don't read them, but I can't get upset at the Gentry books turning into a plot-free boff fest, that's where they were headed from the get-go, but I give up on what used to be a really fun AB franchise entirely at this point. I refuse to beleive that an editor LHK talked to at any point beyond the mid-20th century told her that erotica from a women's perspective would be a problem. What s/he may have told her (accurately) is that SHE can't write good erotica from a woman's perspective. It's like she wandered off to have coffee and let a 13 year old boy at the keyboard. The only thing that makes me think that an adult woman wrote this is the endless headache-inducing nattering about feelings inbeween AB doing her best Linda Lovelace impersonation over and over again. I don't understand at all who this book appeals to. If you want erotica, you can do much, much better. If you want a book w/a plot...well, heck, I'd go for \\"Green Eggs and Ham\\" before this train wreck. If you like icky, poorly-described werewolf sex (at one point I wanted to take a shower on AB's behalf--at least a dozen \\"gushing\\" encounters w/o changing clothes *shudder*) interrupted by pointless group therapy-like angst-fests filled with characters that get whinier and more annoying every book, then I guess you've finally found the perfect book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Laurell, please, I beg of you - if you want to write porn, just write porn and be done with it! Porn is a fine thing to write, and a fun thing to read at times, but turning a perfectly wonderful series into nothing but one sex scene after another is a real drag. I am in general not a fan of the \\"vampire in modern culture\\" genre (it's pretty wrung out), this series and Tanya Huff's Henry Fitzroy books were about the only ones I could stand and this one's pretty well shot.Anita used to be such an interesting, unpredictable character and a lot of fun to read about, until she turned into a skank ho controlled by her gonads (again, calling a spade a spade). Now I am sorry - no, devastated - have to give Incubus Dreams my ultimate condemnation for a book...It's BORING.At one point I bought all of the Anita Blake books as soon as they were released (and I did so with the first Meredith Gentry book as well, which is suffering somewhat the same fate; although we knew the score from the get-go it's just getting worse with every book). The last three have come from the library, because it's a waste of money to buy something where I'll spend a day skimming the endlessly repetitive sex scenes, searching in vain for some actual plot point in the midst of Anita's multiple orgasms.Figure out some way of curing the d@mn \\"ardeur\\" and give Anita her brain back (not to mention giving that pathetic wretch Richard his spine back, I can't be the only one sick and tired of his passive-aggressive whining and self-loathing), or put a stake through the heart of this series because it's dead and rotting."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"When Incubus Dreams came out, I was excited to read it. However, I didn't have any money to purchase the book, and so I put it on hold at the library.Thank god.For the first 80-100 pages, the book tricks you into thinking that it is, in fact, a book. Anita is at a wedding, Anita is called out to the police, Anita and Dolph have a tense interaction, Anita sees a murder victim. And you're thinking, \\"Oh my god, she's back!\\"Unfortunately, Laurell seems to think alienating almost her entire fanbase is somehow a wise decision.Anita jumps into the sack with several men--some introduced for the sole purpose of screwing Anita. For the next 400 pages, there are nearly nonstop sex scenes. Anywhere and everywhere she goes.In her office, where she thinks she's a cat and sticks her butt in Nathaniel's face. Followed by a three paragraph explanation about Anita's ejaculation (It's fun discovering new words, Laurell, but come on. \\"Rainmaker\\"? No one wants to picture that.) Yes, it's during office hours, and yes, Bert, Mary, and some clients are right outside the door.On her kitchen floor in front of Richard, his new girlfriend, Gregory, Nathaniel, etc.At Guilty Pleasures with two random new vampires.EVERYWHERE.Now, I've read that Laurell is doing this out of spite. Apparently someone told her that she couldn't write so many sex scenes because she's a woman, so she did it just to prove a point. But Laurell, honey, this isn't about your petty differences. This is about a series your fans have stuck by for eleven books. For eleven books, we knew and we loved Anita.And now her personality traits are being mashed into other characters.Now the characters we didn't even like (Nathaniel, Richard) have reversed their personalities completely.Now you're adding so many new powers that Anita will be omnipotent. Sooner or later she will take out the Mother of all Darkness by thinking about it, because hey, you did make it so she could think something into reality.I've seen people talk about the resolve of the original triumvirate (I say original because in a desperate attempt to prove Nathaniel is never going away, Antia is not only suddenly madly in love with him, but formed a second triumvirate, too) but really, what happened? Jean-Claude held Richard's hand. Jean-Claude face-f**ked Anita while Richard got her bound-to-be-gaping vagina. This isn't resolve, or if it is, NO ONE CARES. You can only read sex scenes so many times before the one that is supposed to matter most is just a giant nuisance.Also, Jean-Claude calling Nathaniel a bad kitty while Anita flogs him on stage? Not sexy. And out of character.\\"Sorrow covering the pleasure like evil chocolate ruining your ice cream\\"? WORST. ANALOGY. EVER. I laughed so hard, I almost started crying. You've been reduced to evil chocolate, Laurell. EVIL. CHOCOLATE.If you must proudly display your insane masochism, just borrow this book. Don't waste your money on this trash.Issues are unresolved. MoaD is only mentioned as an expletive. This is the equivalent of reading a 13-year-old's Anita Blake fanfiction. In fact, I'm fairly certain Laurell must have just stolen this from fanfiction.netSex scenes are fine.Sex scenes that last six chapters while the plot is mentioned maybe 25/650 pages and never even resolved are not.I was not one who complained about Anita having any sex. The first time with Jean-Claude was one of the best scenes I've ever read. Thereafter, I enjoyed them.But not this. I wouldn't pay a dollar for this book even if it were made of solid gold.The characters are mashed into one being, and some people call that development.I call it extemely poor writing.This book made me want to sell all of my Anita Blake novels and forget about her forever.If the next book is anything like this, then it's obvious just how much Laurell's fans mean to her. Absolutely nothing.Hope you have another skill, Ms. Hamilton. You may need to fall back on it soon."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I agree with the other reviews....This book sucks!

I don't mind a little sex in my books, but 500 pages and 5 or six different sex partners is revolting. She started out great with the murder, I just knew that it was the old Anita, then it got gross.

I'm a helpless nymphomaniac boinking everyone against my will... however, I do like it).Anyway -- that's what I read between the sticky lines.So, now I'm going to gripe about something totally non-intellectual.... here goes (pacifists, please stop reading this review now).Did anyone else realize that in ths whole book, never once did Anita get all decked out in her battle-gear or get any new, fun battle toys? She used to speak often and with such fondness of the favorite Browning High-Power, and low if I recall one mention of the little darling.Now me, I'm no lover of guns or violence -- but I did love that aspect of Anita... the girl who knew her way around an automatic weapon, wore custom made knives on every possible body part... and ALWAYS had her Browning near her heart... and the Firestar someplace else... and the oozie hung in the shoulder sling... etc.Does this sound shallow? Childish? Does the fact that I actually missed the battle scenes and the anticipatory thrill that always came with the battle prep and waiting to see how many weapons Anita could hang on her five foot frame? How many new powers she might get to throw at the enemy? And of course, having the plot actually being somehow connected to all of the above?Was I the only one who, when it came down to it, really missed the kick-arse action and attitude which always left me feeling charged up when I finished yet another installment?Now... sheesh... someone could toss her precious Browning out the window into a steaming septic tank and she probably wouldn't even notice it was gone (what with the pile of lovers that are likely balanced atop old Anita a la Cirque du Soleil).In the end, I really don't mind if Anita has a dozen boyfriends who are all happy to have their 1/12th ration of the new and lusty Anita Blake -- but I want my scary plots back! I want to hear what hardware she's packing for the dangerous night out! I want some bang for my buck (well... I guess that is the wrong phrase to use -- we got WAY more than enough bang in this book)... I just want some of the old Anita back; you know? How can I get my vicarious arse-kicking excitement now? I don't need porn... (sex is legal, thus, one can be a \\"do-er\\" when it comes to sex so I don't need vicarious thrills and impossible blue plots -- that's my feeling anyway). But when will I ever get to cut in half a rabid vampire with a sawed off shotgun -- NEVER!So -- there. I said it. All intellectual commentary given by other reviews aside (all of which was completely valid and I agree entirely with almost everyone)... when it comes down to it, I missed the non-PC Anita Blake blood and gore action. Forgive me if my opinion is less than high-minded -- but I just had to tell the truth. Why? Because I hope one of LKH's \\"people\\" start to hear that this low-brow non-PC stuff is also some of what we are missing from the new Anita Blake. Yes, we want better character development and continuity, yes we want interesting and complex plot lines, yes we would very much like less typos and repetitive phraseology... but heck... we also want our tough, shoot-first-ask-questions-later Anita, too. Or, at least I do.If we never see her again... it was a fine 11-12 book run. Sigh..."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"LKH has done the unthinkable. She has taken well-crafted and much loved characters and thrown them out the window. They have been replaced by fragments of themselves.In Incubus Dream LKH has made it clear old fans if you do not like it too bad. She has filled this book with more sex than actual story and I am sorry to report not even good sex.Anita Blake vampire hunter is no longer that. She has so many men in her life that are there for nothing more than sexual page filler, that the Vampire Hunter no longer applies. It has become a laughing joke of a series trying to keep up with who Anita has/or has not done something with.Morally a pain at times Blake now no longer has to worry with a conscience. She is only led by the plot filler LKH loves to throw in at every given moment the Arduer feeding from lust/sex. Might have been an interesting idea had it not taken over the series.The two male leads in the series Jean-Claude the Master Vampire and Richard Zeeman the Werewolf spent several volumes of the series as strong characters fighting for Anita's attentions. Seduction and erotica well thought out and followed through with at the time exquisitely. These two men are now thrown over for submissive types that remove any romantic attachments from Anita's life. Micah (her were leopard lover) is now her wife type character. Instead of one of the strong interesting lead characters we had grown to love, we are slapped in the face with Anita taking up living with Micah and the other submissive were leopards that other than look pretty simply are there for sex and to take care of her.Jean-Claude who it seemed had finally won Anita's heart has been thrown over as well. He is good for everything but the real relationship his character had built with Anita. He accepts too much. For a rather dominate man normally he has become the A typical man who does whatever Anita wants no more wonderful voice of his own. It's a sad day in the Anita Blake universe when Jean-Claude sexuality has been demoted to clinical descriptions that do not suit him.Anita in this volume has multiple sexual encounters with a variety of different men for metaphysical sex/actual sex/plain old hard to explain sex. Something that all of these men could not get away with and still be in the company of Anita. She wouldn't have any of it. Her arduer feedings are sexual encounters. Jean-Claude who has the same power is not allowed any of the freedom Anita is. His once strong voice is now silent and he is there for his share of Anita's body, but has lost her heart as much as her inner voice says otherwise. The double standard Anita lives by she would never allow of any of the various men in her life. Anita no longer sustains friendships for longer than her next sexual conquest. By looking at my review, you would think for erotica all of this might be fine. However, it is not LKH has proven she is capable of much better work than this and this book was a thrown together piece of trash. In no way am I self-conscious when it comes to sex. I adore erotica. This however was cold and unfeeling although we are continually pummeled into submission with how much Anita loves every one of these men. Just once, I wanted Jean-Claude to tell her she had gone too far. I know he is a sexual creature and love him for it but this book looks like a slap in the face for Jean-Claude as earlier volumes did for Richard. Micah a two-dimensional sex toy for Anita who cleans and cooks sounds more like a live in prostitute than an actual boyfriend. Nathaniel a very abused guy that Anita once thought of as a brother now is in Anita's pants as well. This book kind of made me feel dirty. I don't say that very easily I've read graphic stuff before. This reminded me that had LKH been a man this book would have been criticized from every major book reviewer in the country. As a woman this doesn't make me feel as if the author is achieving anything. The final blow for me was a much-anticipated m&eacute;nage between JC/RZ/AB and it was pitiful. Cold and tasteless with none of the emotions the three characters share. All their hang-ups aside, the three have always had a great sexual chemistry. LKH seems to have taken a very big turn towards submissive men who are pretty boys with no real saving grace other than the size of their...LKH must have truly won major rights on her books editing process because this one was full of holes/errors and repetition. It comes across as if it were cut and pasted from one sex scene to the next with a fill in the blanks/names style.The whole crime thing was only a blip on the screen of this novel. This was a 600+ page NOVEL (not paperback), but hardcover novel that had more sex than actual novel. Wouldn't have been a problem if the Anita Blake series had begun about the Arduer and Anita's moral conscience hadn't kept her from the two men who she really loved.Jean-Claude has become a watcher and Richard an erratic nut who although claims he wants nothing to do with Anita still continues to accept the pull of their connection.LKH committed the worst of crimes with this book she took her anger at her readers and put it into the book. She tore apart the whole core of the series. This book is a slap showing that she has an open-ended contract on these books and proving that she can write something this bad and it will still make her sales margins. Finally, I have had my fill of being slapped around by an author who could do such a disservice to her own characters.If you've never read a LKH book you probably won't understand the passion of those that have stuck by for so many years. However, if you finish ID and start with the others you will probably ended up feeling as empty as I did after reading this book. Such a sad affair for an author with so much talent."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"If I hear one more word about Anita working hard not to \\"flash\\" someone, some metaphysical power roaring through her, or some plateau of power, I think I might go get some fangs just to get a stake for myself.Rehash of the other reviews: Asher has disappeared, Micah walks in and walks off, her supposed soul-type-guy and she doesn't even think to call him and say \\"No honey, I'm not dead, just busy fvcking as usual,\\" Damian gets a brief moment in the spotlight and then spends the rest of the book suffering due to Anita's carelessness. Remember when Anita would be horrified to even SLEEP an hour or two and leave someone in her care unattended?Sure we got tired of the martyrdom/only *I* can prevent forest fire attitude, but much better than her absolute lack of self-judgement here.Sigh and poor Jean-Claude. Once the dashing, fashion loving man who could truly spark Anita in every way, is simply a cow mooing in her direction. He can't even manage his own clubs anymore.A brief highlight is Anita finally after (ohh...CHAPTERS) of agonizing over Nathaniel, consummates their love (I guess love)...and promptly kicks him out of bed and forgets all about him because Richard shows up and has a little hissy fit.No need to actually nurture the life relationships who actually can give you stability...nope gotta have more hot sex and that \\"metaphysical power rush.\\""},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Let me start of by saying the Anita Blake series has always meant a lot to me. I recommended it to all my friends and can't count how many times I've re-read her storiesBut Hamilton's new works are destroying my faith that she will get back to her former quality.As odd as it may sound I feel Hamilton has betrayed her readers with the turn this series has taken. She has thrown away many aspects that made it so unique and engaging. Instead, she is offering in its place puerile, prosaic, repetitive junior high level melodramatic soft core romance for the emotionally stunted.I have read Hamilton's interview. She tries to dismiss criticism of this trend by either saying the complainers have a problem with a woman writing sex from a woman's point of view, or that they want Anita to be kept in the little box she was born in and not change.That over simplification ignores the truth and the serious problems with this once beloved series. Character evolution and development is the lifeblood of a story, it's true. It's also exactly what has been lacking ever since Anita got that damned \\"ardeur\\". Too many creature own bits of Anita's soul. Characters go through periods of conflict and self doubt and weakness as part of their evolution. But Anita has stayed there, as unchanging as James Bond and just as dull, running in endless circles.I enjoy well written sex from a woman's point of view, written by a woman, about characters I feel a connection with and care about.None of that is present in the series any longer.Anita Blake has been vanishing from these books for the past several installments. Now she's gone. I miss her.I was going to say Edward and Anita used to be my favorite characters of modern fiction, but now it's just Edward. But I'm going to amend that. Anita is still a favorite. I wish she would return to the series and kill the doppelganger that is pretending to be her.I loved being inside her head, and Edwards via Anita's.I honestly think the root of the problem is this: Anita has become a victim. And she's grown accustom to it. She was tricked into accepting it as part of opening up to people. Part of what makes Hamilton's monster societies frightening is they are all slaves.Some outside force over whelms them and they are remade in its image, enslaved to others of its own kind and the mass mind of the invading nature. The individual is erased or compromised and they become just like all the rest. Whether it's the vampire hierarchy, the were creatures addiction to belonging to a pack and over ruling animal nature, or the mindless zombie crowd or demon possession. It all results in enslavement to a mass community.Once, no one owned a part of Anita or Edward's souls. That's what made them so captivating.Now Anita is being added tot he slave state and she doesn't even know it.The supernatural creatures that cling to her have consumed her. She's nothing more than a conduit for us to be presented with their stories, which are all amazingly similar tales of abuse, and what they do to her.A formula has been repeating over and over for at least 6 books back.1-A supernatural creature character, interchangeable with all the other such characters despite superficial variation, walks into the room where Anita is. (\\"It was Xanadu, the were-penguin from Zanzibar. He was The Waddle of his flock. That meant he fetched ice water for his leader and then have sex with him.\\")2-Anita feels a rush of emotion and repression and either gets mad or sad about it. She takes 4 chapters talking about it and repeats herself A LOT.3- She takes three more chapters telling us how what ever he is wearing affects her (\\"The combination of him wearing only an open pirate shirt, a French tickler and the space helmet made the ardeur growl\\")4- They talk for days and then either have boring repetitive sex or get mad and storm off like 14 year olds in a snit.5-Another (yet exactly the same in many ways) supernatural creature enters the room as the previous one leaves6- See 1 through 5. Repeat.This is so repetitive and the sex is boring and the fights are boring and the emotional \\"turmoil\\" is a dead end. Anita has been reduced to self obsessive whining collection of character quirks. A love for coffee, penguins, Nike and Browning High power automatics do not a character make. I always loved Anita for her inner self and her personality.The best of the series is still The Laughing Corpse, in my opinion. That's hard for me to admit because Edward is not in it but the real Anita is. The execution of the book is flawless and the characters real.The quality started to decline when the were creatures took over and the ardeur entered into Anita. Because they make Anita a weak victim who is not even aware she is a weak victim. She been owned and subjugated and fooled into thinking it was her choice and that it's emotional growth.You don't have to lose yourself to be with someone else, and if you do it's a bad relationship. Anita knows this; I can even accept that she may be deceiving herself out of a need to connect.My only reason for holding on is the hope that this is all part of a huge multi novel character arch. That Anita has lost herself to the parasites clinging to her and feeding off of her. Since the attempts to enslave and control her by traditional vampire bites or enslavement to a were pack failed, they possessed her in this more subtle way.And she is going to wake up, something will happen to break the spell and she will emerge a combination of her true original self shaped and matured by life's journey.That would be a hero, a real, human, approachable hero the readers can connect to.That would be Anita Blake."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"\\"It is a cardinal sin to bore your readers.\\" - Larry Niven.LKH seems to have forgotten this. Screwing everything in sight does not a plot make. It can be part of the plot but seriously, it's not a plot to explore how many different ways tab A can be inserted into slot B. And I also think it would be physically impossible for a woman to be...serviced by...so many men in such a short period of time (I think ID covers a grand total of 36-48 hours all told, maybe 72) without at least getting slightly raw.The book could have been interesting if LKH hadn't subsituted merengue for meat. As it stands the book is empty and disappointing and no amount of gratuitous sex or angst can make up for it. I would prefer to wait longer between books and get an actual story worthy of the books prior to and including Obsidian Butterfly (by far the best, IMO) than to get the repetitive over-done erotica that's being released as \\"Anita Blake: Vampire Slayer\\" now."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was drawn into this written, imaginative story within the first few pages. A woman with emotional conflict; a vampire hunter with a few secrets other than solving murder cases. I was influenced to read this book because of its title, \\"Incubus Dreams.\\"The main characters are Anita, Micah, and Nathaniel, they all live under the same roof. They aren't exactly human, and their everyday lifestyle isn't what you would call normal. Anita is a necromancer, and possesses some abilities that don't have. Despite these abilities, there is a major downfall, the arduer...only feed-able by sex or blood. Anita is solving a series of murders, while trying to contain her arduer and person conflicts.This book is only one of the beautiful novels in this series. It's wonderful because even without reading the previous books, you can easily understand the novel.I couldn't put this book down it was so captivating. This is a very graphic novel and I wouldn't recommend it to a young audience. Overall there is some necessary sex, but in my opinion it intensifies the storyline. This book was very enjoyable, mainly because of the level of detail. If you find intense, suspenseful, romantic graphic novels enjoyable to you, I think you should read Incubus Dreams.Each word will leave you wanting more, her best book yet."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I know there are a lot of people out there that aren't happy with the 'turn' that Anita Blake has taken. But I tend to enjoy it. I understand that she is a tad bit more promiscuous - okay, more than a tad - but if we are to take this 'ardeur' seriously doesn't it require the extreme? Honestly, sooner or later, yes, she should become master of the ardeur, not the other way around - but until then. . .I am not happy with everything that is happening - but nobody is going to be. That is the price for everyone having their own opinions. But until we all think as one organism (no, Anita, not orgasm) everyone is going to have their own feelings and have the right to them.

If you have too, then what I say here won't matter much. You've probably already read this book. You decided, just like me, that reagardless you were going to read it. Stop reading, this review ain't for you!If you have not read this and are either new to the series or just haven't read very much Hamilton, this review is for you.This book is mostly sex. Flat out. This book contains long winded descriptions of Anita and various monsters getting thier groove on. If plot advancement is 40% of this book by weight I'd be shocked. But that's what Ms. Hamilton writes. That's what I thought I was buying when I bought this book. I was not dissapointed. I also thought that some of the plot advancements were good too. I like the prose, the story telling and the characters the author creates. Besides, if you think this novel is trashy, you should read any of the Princess Meredith novels. Whew!So, basicly, I'm saying that this is an entertaining book. I enjoyed it for what it was. I tried not to place any higher expectations than that on any book.Summary:Heavy on the sex.Great characters.Good dialog and story developmentFair pacing (previous novels were much faster paced)P.S.I do think a visit from Edward is long overdue.

This book is dramatically different from the first Anita Blake books, however this is going into a direction that I like.Is this book for everyone? No, it's not. Is this a good place for a person to start the series? I tend to start a series (if I know it's a series from book 1, like I did with Anita).Is there a lot of sex in this book? Yes, there is and most of it is very graphic, and it's not romantic fluffy sex. Some reviewer's call it porn or woman's Masturbation book. I disagree. Yes, there is sex in this book, but it's a part of the book. It makes sense. The sex is because Anita is no longer a simple Animator with a boyfriend who is a werewolf and another who is a Master Vampire. She is a powerful Necromancer who is linked preternaturally to a Master Werewolf King (who gave her sexual powers of the Munin) and a Powerful Master and Master of the City Vampire (who gave her the ardeur, which makes her a succubus-a Drinker of passion).When you toss these two together you with the fact that Anita has had an Catholic upbringing in which good girls don't have 5 or 6 much less two men who she is sexually active, not to mention that she refuses to learn how to control the succubus within - You are going to get sex. And you layer on another complexity, which she inherited from the joining of a powerful Trimative - That she has part of a \\"were-beast\\" rolling around in her.Anita Blake is not a simple book, it's complicated. The sex is no something so easy like a \\"fantasy\\" flash back in \\"Wayne's World\\" it's apart of the story. It's something that is in the books to say.There is something that I didn't like about the book, that I fine upsetting in many series that I read and that is: Where is the editor? This book needed a good spell checker. Not a content editor but someone who could have taken this document in another computer and checked for miss-spelled words. No one is perfect, and I have Learning Disabilities, but when a book is published it should be run through a secondary machine and then have someone go through it \\"Just in case.\\"The book still gets five stars - because it's so much more than the sex.

I will admit that it was not the best of the bunch it was good. It was a necessary and vital book in the progression of not only Anita, but the other characters we don't see enough in the series. Damien is finally coming out of the woodwork and becoming a functional character in the book. Anita finally recognizes him and not just as one more person to take care of but as someone important that she has to be \\"close\\" with. Nathanial finally becomes a man in this book. Before he was just some flimsy thing you really wish would get back bone. The depth of ignorance Anita has to what is going on inside her is finally reached the all annoying if I don't deal with it it doesn't exsit syndorme she has is finally popped. I can't thank Laurell enough for that. Richard finally begins to come to terms with himself and what is going on around him. No more wallowing in self pity. Both of them begin to see just how badly both of them are f***ing up and how much Jean-Claude is taking care of both them.I'm aggrivated that all of these so-called fans don't grasp the importance of this book Anita has to hit bottom before she can go up. She does that in this book and now she can really start to grow in her power in her self in everyting. Not just her but everyone.

Blake now believes vampires have souls, or something similar. Makes it easier for her to accept that she loves two vamps and has bound a third to her in a power surge that boosts the magical abilities of Blake and those closest to her heart. More power means more demands on her body. She has to give up her last pretense of chastity, as in sex equals love. Her power requires her to have sex three or four times a day, and the five men she loves aren't enough. Blake's status among shapeshifting wereleopards and werewolves also takes a twist. A wereleopard, Nathaniel, is joined with Blake and the vampire Damian in a power trio that is unprecedented because necromancer Blake is its primary. The new trio boosts the powers of Blake's existing trio with werewolf Richard and vampire Jean-Claude. Blake has power over the dead; Richard is the very strong local werewolf king; Jean-Claude, this trio's primary, is master over the mainstream vampires in the St. Louis area.The vampire and werewolf stuff constitute Blake's personal life in St. Louis' outsider culture. Her mainstream jobs are as animator - she raises the dead one at a time so people can ask them questions - and as federal marshal who is an expert on crimes involving magic and who serves as executioner for those magical offenders deemed too dangerous to hold for trial. Blake has kept her mainstream and outsider roles mostly separate, but that changes here.Also changing are a number of the rigid precepts that Blake used to insulate herself from harm. A leopardlike force within non-shapeshifter Blake tries to tear her apart. The magical solution leads to Anita making love with Nathaniel in his manleopard form, previously a primary no-no. She has just accepted her love for Nathaniel and his for her, making this affirmation of love and trust one of the most tender scenes in the book. But still waaay out of the mainstream, one of several sex scenes that are not for the faint of heart. I found several scenes uncomfortable to read, but necessary to the characters and the plot. It's sex play at a strip club and Blake's touchy-feely vampire-fueled powers that set up the final action scene, where a police tactical team has to work with this hotdog vampire executioner who gossip says is an exhibitionist sex fiend. Blake, of course, proves her action hero chops yet again.But this book is less about the action hero and more about acceptance, and how what we wish for when we're 21 often is not what we end up with when we're 27. Hamilton gives Anita Blake a chance to get comfortable with her out-of-the-mainstream love life. The no-nos keep crumbling, as Hamilton brings Blake and other characters to new levels of acceptance of their powers, their responsibilities and their relationships. Anita lets Jean-Claude drink her blood during sex. Richard agrees to feed Anita's incubus. Richard and Anita let Jean-Claude damp down their resistance to being together, in a scene that suggests this tragic romantic triangle may have a chance after all.It would be great if the author's demanding 2-novels-a-year schedule could build in enough time at the publisher for an additional copyedit. But the yarn is so gripping that I forgive the typos in order to see what comes next."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"First off, if you didn't like the previous books like NiC or CS, you probably won't like the new one. But those who liked the previous books, this is a GREAT READ. Looking through the reviews it is pretty clear the divide on readership is you either LOVED it or HATED it. Count me on the loving side (^_^)Yes, Anita has many sexual encounters. Not a surprise since the character has been growing more and more sexual and this been going on for several books. Her supernatural powers and hungers for the last four or more books have added a very sexual element. Is the sex the whole of the book? Not hardly.This book has extreme amounts of character development and reveals lots of information not just on the characters many of us have come to know and love, but it continues the details of Anita's entire world. From the mundane but no less dangerous existence of growing prejudice towards the supernatural by the human law organizations, to the unstable political atmosphere among the hidden powers that be in the supernatural world.This is clearly, for those who are enjoying the whole series sex and all, a LYNCH PIN book where a lot of things important to the ongoing series plotting and the main character personally begin to become tangible.The book for me was another welcome adventure with Anita Blake, and I very much appreciated how fully packed this book was.

Richard actually starts to make some sort of sense. Nearly every pivotal character has something new, interesting and important happen to them.I'm always amazed at the way that each new Anita novel manages to pick up and reference threads of the others, without being self pretentious and in-jokey.I wanted this novel so badly I tried to talk store clerks into giving it to me early.

In the meantime she ignores Michah, finally does the deed with Nathaniel, almost ignores Jean Paul and does the nasty with Richard. That's the plot right there.Do they ever find the rogue vampires? No. Does Anita inexplicably gain more supernatural powers? Yes.But the writing style is lucid and imaginative and the details of the characters are so like the very first novels.

For regular readers, the background has been pretty thoroughly filled in and can be taken for granted, the regular characters all have tons of shared history providing context for their current interactions-and on top of all that, most series, if they reach book twelve, have started to run down several books back.Nevertheless, despite the fact that I was plunging in cold, with no prior background other than the fact that there was an \\"Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter\\" series, I only occasionally and briefly found myself feeling a bit lost. Hamilton does a pretty good job of salting in enough background and character history that the new reader has a sense, however illusory, of knowing what's going on.For those as new to the series as I was: Vampires, werebeasts (wolves, leopards, and rats, most prominently in this book), zombies, and other unnatural and frequently nasty things really exist. The vampires and werebeasts, at least, have some legal rights, but distinctly limited ones. Anita Blake has the ability to sense and to some degree control the restless dead, which is the basis of both of her lines of work. By day (loosely speaking) she's a professional resurrectionist, raising the quite restful dead as zombies for a few hours so that they can answer such crucial questions as \\"what did this clause in your will really mean?\\" By night (usually), she's a federal marshal, the go-to person when a vampire's gone bad and you need him staked, quickly and permanently. In this capacity, she gets consulted by the local police in what are or might be preternatural crimes, a lot.All of that might be relatively straightforward, if she weren't also one of the lovers of Jean-Claude, Master of the local vampires, and Nimir-Ra of the local wereleopard clan and lover of Micah Callahan, their Nimir-Raj. (No, she's not a wereleopard herself.) But, really, her love life is more complicated than that, and gets more so as the story progresses.The story opens with a murder, a vampire-gang murder of a stripper at a local strip club, which looks like it might be the work of a serial killer. It's not long before there's another stripper killed, the same way, and the bite marks match those from the first killing. Inquiries also turn up the fact that there have been similar killings in other cities, and it looks like the killers are stepping up the pace. Anita is sure, for numerous sensible reasons, that it's not the work of Jean-Claude or any of the local vampires, but, of course, she might not be totally objective.Since one of Anita's lovers is a stripper, and another (Jean-Claude) owns the club he works in, she's personally involved in another way, too. And if Jean-Claude's not involved, that's not really good news, either, because it means there's another master vampire in town, powerful enough to hide himself from both Jean-Claude and Anita.While Anita and the local police, and eventually the Mobile Reserve, are trying to solve the murders before more people are killed, she's also juggling her job as a resurrectionist, where one client wants a resurrection that would be a really bad idea (zombies of murder victims do not play by the rules), and trying to manage her personal relationships along with her growing magical powers and the growing demands of those powers. Those last three things are all, of course, deeply entangled with each other in the most frustrating and inconvenient ways. It all builds towards a satisfyingly exciting conclusion.I do have several observations, the first of which is not a complaint, but something you should be aware of if you're picking up an Anita Blake book for the first time: There's lots and lots of mildly kinky sex. It's not, mostly, gratuitous, in that it does advance both plot and characterization significantly. On the other hand, the sex scene that took up several chapters, important as it was for plot and characterization, clearly could have been shorter if that had been its primary function. So, if you don't like reading mildly kinky sex scenes, don't complain that I didn't warn you. In this book, if you skip them, you will miss important stuff that matters later.This next one is a complaint. Early on, someone does a tarot reading for Anita, and one of the things that comes out of that reading is a prediction that she will receive help from someone from her past. At the end of the book, this hasn't happened-and we're reminded of the reading, and the fact that it hasn't happened. This isn't something I missed due to prior unfamiliarity with the series. This is a 658-page book in which major threads are left hanging, the story not really finished. That's annoying. The pace moves quickly, those 658 pages don't ever drag, and there is a conclusion-but this is putting the gun on the mantle in the first scene, and saying, in the last scene, \\"we'll get to that in the next play.\\"Thirdly-and this is a big complaint, but not directed at Ms. Hamilton. This one is directed at Berkley. Whoever decided that proofreaders were an unnecessary extra expense ought to be thoroughly embarrassed by the result in this book. \\"Liability\\" is spelled \\"libility.\\" \\"Your\\" and \\"you're\\" are repeatedly confused, in both directions. Apostrophes are stuck, apparently randomly, in plurals. An exhaustive list would be exhausting for everyone, so I'll stop now. But Hamilton's a good writer, and she deserves better than this from her publisher.If you're an Anita Blake fan, you'll surely want to grab this one. If you aren't, but you enjoy vampire fiction at all, this isn't the best one to start with, but you may want to go find the earlier ones."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I just recently discovered Laurell K.

Don't worry about characters that were not emphasized in this one. Many of them return in the next book and the plot lines get intertwined nicely. I like Anita's growing powers and wonder where it is all leading. Probably at some point to a grand battle with Belle Morte herself! I'll stick with them as fast as Ms.Hamilton can write them."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Ok, so I've never read any of Laurell K. Hamilton's books before. This was just a random buy at the airport because I needed something to read to on the plane. I usually like vampire stories, this was supposed to be a murder mystery as well, so I thought I should be pretty entertaining. And, it was entertaining. The murder mystery was totally lost in all the sex and the psycho-analyzing, but I still enjoyed it. I agree with everyone that says it was soft-core porn with some other stuff thrown in, but Hamilton is obviously a good writer who has developed an intricate and compelling cast of characters. I intend to read her earlier books whenever I need some light fiction."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"\\"Incubus Dreams,\\" the 12th installment in the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series, will delight loyal and new readers alike. Anita is dealing with a whole slew of personal issues while trying to find a vampire serial killer who is targeting strippers. Anita must learn to control her new power(s) and still nab the bad guys!I felt like I was reading this novel forever! Not because the novel was bad in any way, I just felt like I was reading really slowly. I thoroughly enjoyed Incubus Dreams. I thought Hamilton spent a little too much time on Anita's \\"life\\" issues and not enough on the actual vampire hunting, but that did not diminish my enjoyment. I can completely understand why other readers are so disappointed, though. Hopefully, she will listen to what we have to say."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book made me want to cry. I am a long time fan and own all the books including Cerulean Sins. First the editing slowed my reading of this book. The excessive mistakes were annoying, was this book even edited? I had to stop and try to figure out what word was actually meant to be there. The gratuitous sex was sad. Anita is not even recognizable as herself. Major characters were no where to be found in this book. This book was about 400 pages too long.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK, GO TO THE LIBRARY."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Perhaps it was due to all of the negative reviews I read before I bought the book so I had low expectations (although I really don't think so), but I thought the book was great! As one of the previous reviewers mentioned, wasn't it about time for Laurell to discuss the relationships between the characters? I really enjoyed Anita's discussions with Jean Claude about the growth of their relationship, learning more about Damian's and Nathaniel's background and who they are as characters as well as what Richard has been struggling with. The changes and growth in Anita's powers also add a new dimension to the ongoing stories. I thought the book was timely in the development of the characters and a nice change from the blood and guts of the murder mysteries of many of the earlier books. As for the threesomes, etc., we should all be so lucky! Write on, Laurell!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Is there sex here? Yes. It's PLOT-DRIVEN sex. If you pick this book up without understanding what's been going on with these characters through all the previous books, yes, it's gonna look like a pointless sex-fest. Which has a charm all it's own....***SPOILER WARNING***SPOILER WARNING***SPOILER WARNING***Hamilton's made this a book of focus and consummation. She's gone back over the \\"rules\\" of the many mystical facets of her universe. She's let them do some growing and changing and takes the time to mull them over that as the action occurs.She's made an interesting move in rounding up some of her minor characters and moving them forward. A bit-player cop whom we haven't seen in several books moves up the ladder. A psychic resurfaces whom we left hanging by a thread very early on. The twins' father actually appears.It's not all about the previous characters, though. There are lots of interesting new vamps and weres that you're gonna love to love and love to hate. And the plot (Yes, Virginia, there is a plot!) revolves strongly around Anita's blending of her executioner role, her vampire authority and abilities, and her relationships with the local cops. Sticky stuff, there.The absolute best part of this book, though, is the consummating Hamilton writes for the key characters in Anita's life. Damian gets some well-deserved time. Micah is much more finely drawn (and the subject of the next book,apparently). Nathaniel comes into his own with Anita, addressing emotional issues you've probably had running through the back of your mind since you've met him. Very satisfying. Wonder of all wonders, Richard takes a refreshing step or two toward healing. And there's an affirmation scene for Anita and Jean-Claude that'll make you feel like a heel for ever doubting him.***END SPOILERS***END SPOILERS***END SPOILERS***In short, don't let the nay-sayers get ya down, kids.

Yes, I liked most of them. But this travesty of a book does little to develop the characters, little in story line and reads more like a soft core porn film. If you are truly a fan, you might find something in this book. Otherwise skip it. I just hope that Mrs. Hamilton will get her mind out of the gutter and write a STORY."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Wow! This is LKH's best book yet! I am a huge fan of the series and have loved the development of Anita. See, when we first met Anita back in 'Guilty Pleasures', she was a no-nonsense, tough-as-nails, vampire-killer with morals, integrity, principles, and intelligence. How boring. However, starting around 3 books ago, her degeneration into an ambivalent, unconfident, self-centered, cheap whore who will have sex with anyone and anything, has got to be one of the best destructions of a literary character in any series.Gone is the prissy Anita who said \\"I don't do furry.\\" Or the undead, or any stranger who happens to be present when the arduer kicks in. Enter the new liberated Anita: one who will forever walk bowlegged based on the frequency and quantity of sex she has with impossibly endowed men (who all have long hair that \\"spill\\" everywhere).Now we don't have to waste time with solving crimes or raising the dead. The vampire world used to be scared of Anita because she might take them down. Not anymore. No siree, Bob! Now vamps are only scared that if they piss her off, they might not get to sleep with her for the umpteenth time.LKH wisely chooses not to waste any precious space in ID with lame filler like an actual plot. Instead she focuses on the only thing that really matters: How many times can she get Anita to have sex, with as many different men, in a multitude of positions, in as little amount of time as possible.And did I mention the dialogue? I mean, can you get better writing than in this book? Consider this classic line from ID...\\"Fvck me while I'm tight!\\" or \\"Please stop or it won't last!\\" I don't think so. What about this great sequence...\\"Fvck me, I said. Fvck me, God, fvck me, just fvck me. Fvck me, fvck me, fvck me, fvck me, please, please, please, just fvck me.\\" Just terrific.Get this book! You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"A really weak book.Practically no plot and way too much sex.Believe me, I don't begrudge Anita her sex life with all the beautiful and supportive were-men. I was delighted when she overcame her prudery and hang-ups - how long can you whine about a cad that ditched you back in college, after all.This book, however, really overdoes it. First there are hundreds of pages of \\"we have to talk\\" scenes and endless discussion of everybody's sexual needs. Then there are hundreds of pages of sex. Towards the end there is (finally!!) a mention of bad guys and a brief visit to a crime scene that solves nothing.I really wish Anita would put on some clothes and go back to work."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was a big fan of LKH. I loved this serries from the start. I could even forgive the occassional clunker, but this piece of offal pretty much broke me of the habit.The serries originally started as a pulp detective type setting only the bad guys were vampires and the occassional lycanthrope or serrious head case. Then it started to change. Anita went from tough and self assured to whiny self indulgent and self hating. she went from not letting anyone getting close to being very friendly to lots of people. By this book she's the town bicycle-anyone can have a ride.The book reads like a porn screenplay. Sure it starts at a wedding and there's a shoot out at the end with an apartment full of nasties but it's a long, boring, pointless road to get there. Basically Anita goes to scene A- has sex or vampire foreplay that's almost the same. Goes to scene B Repeat. again and again and again.LKH said that her fans, who have loudly complained at the bent the serries took, should bare with her, but it's getting old fast. The only scene in here that is worth rer-reading is when she rescues a drunken friend from herself at a stripper bar and has to flash her badge. But in general- this is a waste of unparralleld proportions."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am such a huge fan of Laurell K HAmilton and i read the reviews before i even read the book and choose to ignore them. I have to say that some of the negative reviews were right. In Incubus Dreams it was like Laurell K Hamilton decided to forgo plot and just insert porn. The whole book Anita had sex with absolute strangers and was very indiscriminate about it. I was shocked Anita went from needing to have a serious commitment with a person before having sex to banging any vamire/werefolf that happen to be passin by.One of the things that was great in Narcissus in Chains And Obsidian Butterly is that Anita managed to solve the case, cut through some emotional baggage and still kick butt at the same time. I also love Obsidian because Edward was in it and he rocks. In this book she didnt solve the case which left me with a feeling of WHAT!!!! Where is the fighting the mystical mayheim the confusion the action. It seemed like all Anita wanted to do was CRY. ANita's not like that shes a hard chick.LAstly but certainly not least WHAT HAPPENED TO THE QUEEN OF ALL VAMPIRES. I mean in the last book she had me up all night reading hoping to find out what happens when the Queen of all Vampires wakes up. I get to Incubus Dreams to find nothing, she did not even mention the queen of all vampires in this book much to my dissapointment.I will not give up on Anita Blake or Laurell K HAmilton. I have read and loved the Anita Blake series for years. MAybe Laurell K Hamilton will clean up this mess in the next book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"First, I must say I am an absolute die hard Anita Blake fan, and will continue to give LKH the benefit of the doubt with each book she publishes. Unfortunately I must emphasize that there ARE doubts. Aside from expressing my disappointment of another Edward-free (and *Asher*-free?!) book, I must say to all those complaining about people who didn't like the sex scenes, let me explain something: I have no problem with the details of the sex scenes that have been taking up more and more of her novels post-Obsidian Butterly. I agree, Anita is coming to terms with her metaphysical connections and her ardeur, and obviously that will involve sex. *My* problem is that some of these scenes have become unnecessary and random. LKH has started to lose sight of the initial plotlines described on the back of the books themselves.In this book in particular she developed a habit of starting to go into important events, discoveries or problems that *weren't* about sex---such as the problems with her relationships with her fellow officers, or the current killing spree going on---then spending the next five to ten chapters with Anita \\"having\\" to have sex with random new characters that were just sprung upon us two pages before. Do not tell me *that* is essential to the plot.I am not giving up on the AB series, nor would I advise anyone else to. But I must say I was surprised and disappointed in this book; it did not hold my interest as strongly as the previous ones have. Hopefully things will improve, but for now---get the paperback."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"While I enjoyed this book, I did find myself begging the author to leave the sex alone for a while and get back to some murder scenes and police work. Eventually this happened, around page 300 or so (she briefly visited a crime scene earlier in the book). My main complaints are:* the editing is really, really bad. There are spelling mistakes and strange grammatical errors.* the repetition of ideas. Very similar things are said by different people, and each character is introduced with an explanation of what they have done in the series so far (useful for new readers, but I wouldn't advise starting with this book!)* the sex and emotional angst! Oh! the angst! Anita has sooo much sex, with sooo many people. (On the plus side, she doesn't feel as guilty about most of it as she has in previous books.)If you are new to this series, start with the earlier books - they have more plot, and you would find this hard to follow. I did still enjoy this book, despite the above points."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have been reading the series sense 1995, when Guilty Plesures was a new release. I emediatly fell in love with the crime solving, supernatural totin big bad s$$ in a small package. I still love Anita, but all the sex and second-guessing takes something away. I really Missed Edward. I would be estatic if there was a spin off one shot book just about his adventures.I still loved the book, and several parts were wonderfull, the rescue mision for Ronnie at the book's name sake was my fav. but its getting to the point that I can't recomend the latter books to some of my friends, cause I know they would be uncomfortable with some of the sex parts,The side story line that could have been: Accualy having Evan look into the murder of the kids at the beginnig. As is it was ignored for the entire book, then revisited and left dagling."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have to admit, I'm a diehard Anita fan. That said, I can freely admit to being diappointed in this book. I've always loved the crime-solving elements in the earlier books. This one had potential, a series of serial killings you could truly sink your teeth into (no pun intended), but LKH failed to deliver. The crimes are treated as an after-thought. Anita has stepped into all this power, and what does she do with it? Gets laid... again, again, and again. Granted, she did also use those new-found abilities to find the baddies, but that was over 500 pages later. Must have sex first, apparently. Lots of it. LKH stated more than once that Jean-Claude's, and therefore part of Anita's, power is sexually based, but the ardeur has taken on a life of its own, dominating the book like a main character.As for the characters, there's a lot of missed potential there, too. Nathaniel's coming along nicely, just a touch more assertive. Richard is as annoyingly prudish as ever. While I would never like him as a true person, I get a kick out of the conflict he creates. Jean-Claude spent a lot of time in the background, but after all, it is an Anita Blake novel, right? I would like to see more development of Micah, Damien, and Asher. She and Micah are supposed to be akin to a mated pair, Damien is a third of her triumvirate, and Asher is Jean-Claude's second. I think she ought to add Jason to her 'stable' as well. What the heck! Seven is a good metaphysical number, right?I'm hoping that the next book will be more on track with earlier Anita Blake novels. Anita appears to have gained more control over the ardeur, so perhaps it will not be the focal point it has been. There are new characters to explore, such as Wicked, and Truth, and new adversaries, like the Dragon, and Vittorio. Perhaps we'll also get to see how these new power levels have affected her own innate abilities, her necromancy.I'm keeping my fingers crossed, just in case."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Too much sex, not enough plot. I am a huge fan of the Anita Blake series; but this one was a huge disappointment. I had such a hard time getting through this book, I nearly quit reading it several times.

The editing was laughable, and hopefully a fireable offense. LKH keeps writing books, one right after another, and I'm beginning to wonder if she's either burnt out or has simply lost respect for her readers. Aside from the problems with this particular book, I still can't wrap my brain around two of LKH's core concepts: 1) Despite living for centuries,and LKH's own interest in the minor details of Anita's psychology, vampires have even less awareness of their own psychology and the psychologies of those around them than a ten year old human does; and 2) Also despite living so long, and being master hunters, they lack enough self respect to keep out of the stripping business.Another concept of LKH that I have a personal issue with is that really, really short, muscly guys with incredibly long hair are not attractive. I mean, if you're into video games or LOTR, then dwarves are interesting to play or watch, but when it comes to having sex with them... ummm... no. The thought of Gimli begging to be tied up and spanked does not turn me on. (Oh, and once you've had your fourth three-some in under three hundred pages, you are no longer allowed to talk about your \\"innocence\\" like it's something that still exists.)"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I believe the book could use a bit more editing.

Oh well, this book was so disappointing."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Up until Incubus Dreams I was loving the Anita Blake series.

Ms. Hamilton has a gift of creating the most interesting characters, and I find myself literally involved in all Anita's relationships, but her relationship with herself has suffered. Where is the kick--- Anita of the early books? It is so refreshing to read books with a strong female character, there are so few out there. Eve Dallas (J. D. Robb) and Anita Blake are so nontypical of the female leads in books written by women, yet whereas Eve has retained her strength even with all her \\"relationship\\" issues, Anita has lost hers. Will the real Anita Blake please come back?"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Anita Blake was such a great character. Was is the key here.I have eagerly awaited each new installment of the Anita Blake books and continue to feel disappointment with each new offering.It has taken a little while to get around to write this review, hoping a re-read of such a large book might change my initial view. However, the attempted reread stalled.Lack of a central plot, absurdly extraneous sex scenes, poor character developement, TERRIBLE spelling and grammar reinforced the first impression.One can only hope that the next book will see an end to this downward spiral.As an LKH fan, I appreciate the author's imagination and original premise. I also applaud her willingness to take her stories in new directions in spite of the bald face criticism from her core base of fans.Hopefully, she will take note of the growing trend of disappointed fans and take a harder look at her books before approving them for final manuscript delivery. All I can think at this point is that her publisher is so eager to toss out a book for profit that editing and series development clearly mean little to them.I have high hopes for Stroke of Midnight, Merry Gentry series. After reading her web log and some of her thought processes as she was writing the new Merry Gentry book, I'm afraid this too may be a shadow of what it could be if she focused on the intergrity of her stories and characters."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"But I tend to agree.

Out of 650+ pages you get 500 of them are focused on Anita's numerous sex partners and her need to have sex with anyone walking by at anytime. It's sad because the little that Ms. Hamilton gives you which dosen't deal with Anita's sex play is good and imaginative and should have been played up more. If that had happend this would have been a great book.Ms. Hamilton has strayed so far from her kick but heroin to this sex starved nympho, it makes you wonder if the author is wrighting what she thinks her fans wants. If she beleives that we want to read page after page of sex then she'll keep putting out this soft porn and pretty soon it won't be so soft.Those of you looking for an author who deals with werewolves, witches, fairies and other little creatures of the night and has this kick butt heroin again, you might want to purchase \\"Dead Witch Walking\\" by Kim Harrison."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I've loved this series since it's beginnings when it mixed up the action, romance, sexual tension, humor and monsters all into a nice page-turning stew.Well it's like they say, too many cooks ruin the stew and in this case it's too many sex scenes ruin the plot. Like most who have reviewed this book, I don't mind sometimes gratuitous sex in a book if it has a place there and finds a way to walk along side the plot. Otherwise it just seems like trite filler to me and I won't bother mentioning the typos that were present.I know this book must've taken a long time to work out because it is her longest so far, but more effort could've gone into it. I would've gladly waited longer if the book had turned out better. For me, the series tripped right when \\"Narcissus In Chains\\" came out. \\"Obsidian Butterfly\\" still remains one of my most favorite of them all because I had thought, then, that the books were finally going into a more interesting, darker place with more insight into characters previously unknown.I have heard LKH state that Edward will make his return in the next volume. One can only hope his return will signal the kick start of what was once a truely great and interesting series."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I was really disappointed by this book. It seems in Ms Hamilton's books that you're either a nice girl or you'll \`do' anything. Why couldn't Anita be a strong sexual character without losing her personality? The spoilers in R. Clifton \\"sithean\\"'s review (below) pretty much sum it all up. I think this'll be the last book I purchase from this series. The actual story line was about 40 pages. The rest was sex. If that's what you're after - this book is for you.

I dreamed that Anita Blake got back to paranormal investigations. I dreamed that the hesitant young lady who had such relationship troubles would find some relevant type of love. Instead, slut sister from the cerulean sin city was dreamt up by Laurell K. Hamilton; and then it had an incubus suck it dry and came up with this book in her Anita Blake series.I had enjoyed Hamilton's eroticism. I believe it used to have some relevance to everyday life--even though it was teaming with werewolves and vampires. This installment finds our heroine overcoming all her morals and admitting she likes to sleep with...well...any good looking male who has some mental health issues, oh, and who isn't human. But wait, we discover actually she'd prefer them two at a time.

I'm still dreaming that she will announce that Incubus Dreams was a mistake and write the great Anita Blake series book that we all deserve.Frankily if she would drop her Gentry series (way too much romance for my liking) perhaps she could then focus on a good Anita book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I liked the early books in the Anita Blake series.

Sex was always in the background; humans would be drawn to the vampires, and the vampires would be all to happy to oblige - at a price.Human relations were only at a business level, also something that would suit a fearless vampire hunter.Now, the characters spend most of their with jealous bickering and sex games. Every few pages there is a snippet of story, which is quite good, but too little of it.Ms Hamilton tries to make her characters three dimensional and realistic, but I fear she succeeds only in watering out the stories and writing second rate human relations dramas and sex manuals."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Why did she write this book? It is such a step down from all of the other ones in the series. The rest of them are so good, but then this one reads more like a porno than what I have come to expect from her. It didn't advance the story hardly at all. She wrties so well, I expected and anticipated a book as good or better than the previous ones. I hope she gets it back together and the next one continues the excellent work I know she is capable of."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Should be better descriptive of this book. Is there anyone left for her to have sex with? There was so much of it in the story that I started skipping pages to try and avoid the repetitious bordom of it. I feel that Anita who was a courageous,smart and witty character is now just (...) weak and obviously nymphomaniac. I feel MS. Hamilton lost alot of her focus somewhere and about half way through remembered there is suppose to be a story so tried to save it by throwing in a plot, at this point why bother. In my opinion her demoralizing of her characters, herself and her readers is a complete let down. Good luck on the next one."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I like many of the other people who have posted am tired of the porn in favor of plot. The series used to be great with the vampire hunter trying to keep from falling into the monstrous world she was fighting. Every story had at least three plotlines that twisted into a wonderful climax that left me saying, \\"Wow!\\" However, since \\"Obsidian Butterfly\\" sex has overtaken both plot and relationships. Bring back the Anita I love or let her die."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"In this 12th instalment of the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series, Ms Hamilton loses her way. The action takes place over a short time period but the plot gets lost along the way. The author does resolve some issues and shows some of the main characters in a new light but.... enough with the over-long and repetitious sex scenes. A little more plot please. I usually enjoy her books but this one is definetly not one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams was a book I was waiting for. I was sadly dissapointed that the plots changed to sex. I have read all the books of Anita Blake and found this one to be a little too much like pornography. The book has lots of twist and turns that are not very well explained. I was surprised to see that Richard had made a come-back into the scene. But even worst I was shocked to see how Ainta's harem had grown. It seemed to me that if Anita wasn't having sex with someone or something than she was agruing about it. I am glad that she appears to be more comfortable with herself but enough of the \\"drama\\". I thought that there was going to be a bit more about the case Anita was working on. Instead it was a sad glimpse into the previous Anita Blake books. What a let down. I hope that the next book will be better and and stick with the orginal plot lines."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I bought this book for the same reason a majority of the other reviewers did. The remaining threads from CS needed to be resolved! And I was so excited when this book arrived in the mail....until I started to read it. Being an avid LKH fan, this was such a sore disappointment. If I wanted to read about nothing but the sexual escapades of the main character, I'd stick with the Merry Gentry series. But I liked Anita Blake better because she raises the dead for a living and solves cases involving vampires and other various monsters. That is what made the stories so interesting...Most of the problems have been addressed by other reviewers...mainly the almost laughable editing and spelling errors. LKH could really use a thesauraus...I found myself skimming through most of the book...even the sex scenes..bacause I got bored with the never ending dialog, and wanted to find the \\"monster crime\\". It all was wrapped up far too neatly by the end of the book. I read 658 pages for that??I probably will get the next book though...every series has their awful 1 or 2 books. I just hope we have seen the bottom now and it can only get better."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Please don't get me wrong, I love this series; I loved Anita's darkness twisted with her morality. I loved it when she gave Richard and his whining ways the heave-ho and chose the deadly bad-vamp, Jean-Claude.I literally ate up those zombies, bad-guys, vamps-gone-bad...but where O, where have they gone? Has Hamilton traded in plot for sex, sex and O, yeah, more sex? Didn't our little Anita once have problems sleeping with one guy? Now she has another three way power threesome to deal with, more power, more magic...which would be way cool if she were using it to kill the undead instead of sleep with more monsters!ID is a soft-porn novel (and I like my sex too!) disgusing itself as a vamp novel and when exactly did sex start taking a back seat to bad guys and crazed Master Vampires and her day job?And where O, where is Edward?Edward could get her back on track.If Hamilton keeps writing like this who (even in the world of fiction) is going to stop and take our beloved Anita seriously? The Executioner feeling remorse! Good Lord, when did that happen, and more importantly, why did that happen?Skip the sex, and stick to the undead - go for the balance, or bury the series altogether!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Have the agree with a lot of the other reviews here. I enjoyed the book, having read all of the other Anita Blake series, but the sex scenes are becoming the majority of her books. More plot PLEASE! By the middle of the book I found myself skimming through the sex scenes trying to find where the plot picks up again. I have NEVER done with with one of LKH's books. I understand the whole JC's \\"power is sex related\\" thing, but in the next book could you have Anita crawl out of bed ONCE in a while and take care of business? Some sex is fine but It's her business that readers find so fasinating."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The typos and misuse of words drove me nuts! \\"Discrete\\" was used when she really meant \\"discreet\\" - two very different things and then \\"the plain of his stomach\\"?? Don't you mean \\"plane\\"? \\"Libility\\"?? Perhaps \\"liability\\" was what she had in mind....and then to have another misspelling in one of my favorite poems - \\"To Lucasta, on Going to the Wars\\" by Richard Lovelace...and others..this was just jarring and sloppy. Spell check wouldn't have caught some of the gaffs - but what about a proofreader?! I know it's severe nitpicking, but come on. That being said....If graphic sex offends you, DON'T read this. Anita and the boys (and there are a few more than before) are getting a little \\"out there\\". As for the story...well, it begins with the discovery of a stripper drained by multiple vampires and then there's a lot of sex, angst, another dead stripper, a stubborn zombie, more sex, another dead stripper, and then all of a sudden it seems Ms. Hamilton remembered that she hadn't really finalized the serial killer mystery and had better wrap this up in a hurry. I'm still an Anita fan even though this was not the best book - but the groundwork is being laid for something really big in the next book I think. Something along the lines of the confrontation with Belle. Jean-Claude might be looking at a hostile takeover. We'll just have to wait!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I must echo what others have said here - there is no plot in the first 300 pages of this book, simply Anita going from one sexual encounter to another in one day. I admit that early in the series when she was a prude I was rather irritated with her as a character, but atleast there was a story then. So far, this book is much like the last Blake novel - lots of sex with multiple partners, but no actual plot. As with Meredith, I again tell the author that while some new 'blood' is always nice, we like to see heroines sleeping and talking to their old flames as well."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"My daughter referred to this book as a \\"PWP\\" - \\"Plot? WHAT plot?\\" Yep. Plenty of sex - WAY too much, and woefully short on anything resembling a storyline. Absolutely atrocious - really nonexistent - editing. Deity was misspelled in every instance, as was triumvirate. How can something as crucial to the story be misspelled EACH and EVERY time? Grammatical errors, syntax problems, punctuation trouble...my guess is the editors at Penguin/Berkely gave this one to the rookie because they couldn't handle the misery themselves. Apart from the editing is the lack of anything reminiscent of the first few books in the series. Sorry, Laurell. Hope the next one's better!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The character didn't have much time to solve any murders or save anyone from the bad guys because she spent most of her time on her back going at it with someone, anyone! No Edward, no Asher and no action that didn't include the removal of clothes. Over 600 pages and if Anita wasn't having sex she was talking about having sex. All sex scene required an analyst before and after and it just went on and on. There was a murder, there were bad guys but that didn't add up to 50 pages in a 600+ page book.I took the advise of another reviewer and borrowed this book from the library. I am thankful not to have contributed to what is truly a bad story. Laurelle K Hamilton's last two books in the \\"Anita Blake\\" series were heading just toward what you end up with in \\"Incubus Dreams\\". A non stop Sex Fest! I lost count after the eighth guy Anita has sex with. There may have been more!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have read every one of Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake books, in addition to her Merry Gentry series. This book, by far, is the worst in the series. The book is 658 pages long, however the actual meat of the story (i.e.: the plot) is less than 200 pages. The rest of the book is filled with repetitive, excessively detailed and pointless sex scenes that become a blur well before the halfway point of this book.There is so much sex in this book that you become easily desensitized to it- it's like visiting 20 museums in one day and trying to take in the art- after the first three museums, all the art begins to blur together so much that you wouldn't notice if you were standing in front of Van Gogh's Sunflowers, or in front of Dogs Playing Poker. This is not erotic sex; this isn't even an erotica book. This is an author who watched too many bad porn movies, visited a couple of strip joins, and BDSM parlors, deemed herself an expert, capable of writing erotica. She failed badly. Not to mention that Anita Blake's love life can now only be described as approaching a love Dodecahedron. Her tally of lovers (people she engages in some kind of 'meaningful' relationship) is as follows: Richard, Asher, Jean Claude, Nathaniel, Micah, and Damian. How did this happen? As a result of a new 'power plateau' (which was poorly/inadequately described) established from the Triumvirate formed between herself, Nathaniel and Damian. Just for once, I would like to see Anita's power level *not* go up- because every time her power level goes up, we lose more of the Anita we loved, and she becomes even more so a 'Mary Sue' type of character.Heck, what am I saying, she is a Mary Sue.I will not get into the tally of 'sex partners' (all because of the ardeur- the token plot device for this story) because that count is higher than any previous book. People she still hasn't had sex/ some kind of sexual contact with by the end of this book; Dolph, the Mobile Reserve, Malcolm, Zerbrowski, Louis, any were rat that made an appearance in the book, Buzz, Jonah Cooper, two vampires named Wicked and Truth, and the congregation of the Church of Eternal Life. I'm sure i'm missing a few more, but not many. I waited until 3/4 of the way through the book to start skipping sex scenes because I thought I might miss something important, and I can tell you that I waited too long because there was *nothing* in those scenes that you needed to read in order to follow plot.The serial killer plot (and I use the word plot loosely, because it's hardly a plot, more like an afterthought) is a joke. There is maybe 1-2 chapters worth of material scattered between the large sex scene chunks involving the murder(s), and the serial killer(s) with in the first 3/4 of the book. There's less than a chapter worth of real material involving her voodoo gig at Animators, Inc. The last quarter of the book contains LKH's attempt to give the reader a plot, some closure (which fails), and lo and behold, more sex! The end is underwhelming, to say the least. People die, Anita uses her power to locate (one) of the master vamps involved, there's some moral waffling on her part, the bad guys get away, and (boo hoo, tragedy!) she goes home to have 'metaphysical' sex with Micah to feed the ardeur, then goes to bed with both Micah and Nathaniel. The epilogue chapter (which appears at the end of each book) attempts to wrap up some of the serial killer storyline. It ends up feeling like a half-a#@ed, empty promise.Do yourself a favor. Read all the reviews on here before buying/reading this book. I know the series has become like a horrible train wreck that you want to pull your eyes away from, but keep looking because you hope that something will avert the disaster. But if, even after reading the reviews (like I did), you still want to read Incubus Dreams, then check it out at your local library. That way, you won't regret spending the $23.95 ($30.00 CAN) for this book if you end up hating it as much as I did.I wish I had stopped reading after Obsidian Butterfly."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Less sex, more plot and butt kicking. I loved the first books when Anita spent more time kicking butt and less time in the sack. If I want porn, I'll go get a porn book. I got hooked on this series because of the great characters and the non-stop action. What happened to that? Ms. Hamilton, leave your porn penmanship for the other series, let Anita get back to being Anita.I have been able to finish the last few books in a few hours just by skipping over the sex scenes. That tells you how much they lack in plot and action.What a shame. It was such a great series. I don't bother to buy the books in hardcover anymore. If I can't borrow one, I wait for paperback. Why waste the money. I no longer eagerly await each new book as it comes out."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Yes.....Sloppy writing, too many repititions, and a weak plotline that kept disappearing in the steam ......Yes, there was some good developement in characters like Nathanial and Richard, but where was Asher? I feel overwhelmed with periphrial characters that keep gathering around, but we don't know anything about them because we are spending so much time in Anita's bedroom....oh wait, most of the sex wasn't IN the bedroom, and I can honestly say that, metaphysical powers or not, no one can have as much sex as she did and still walk. And I did not like having a murder in the beginning of the story, and then hardly any mention of the details until it was all quickly wrapped up in the last 50 pages."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I've been a huge fan of the series since I discovered the first four books, and had to wait desperately for Bloody Bones. But this book was dreadful.I didn't have a problem with the fact that there was a lot of sex -- but I didn't find the sex scenes here well-written. For example, an extremely non-arousing four-page clinical description of deepthroat techniques in the middle of what might have been a hot scene completely spoiled the most important encounter in the book. And BDSM elements, which were potentially interesting, were entirely unrealistic -- too mixed up with Anita's \\"new power/effect of the chapter\\" to be realistic or sexy. And unrealistic BDSM porn I just find to be putrid.Then there were the typos. It was obvious the manuscript wasn't even spell-checked before reaching press, much less actually proofread (one reviewer guessed 200 typos, but the real number of just mispellings or homonym problems exceeds 600 -- it was a rare page without at least one, not even counting the grammar/punctuation problems). And Hamilton desperately needs a copy editor as well -- someone who will sit down and fix all of her punctuation -- removing unnecessary commas, fixing incomplete sentences, fixing run-on sentences, using semicolons, dashes and colons where appropriate, while still reflecting Anita's unique informal voice. I'm sorry, but punctuation like: She, said \\"why, would I. Care about the book\\"? is intolerable!Usually I don't comment on proofreading issues, because typos happen -- all authors make them; all production departments try desperately to fix them; and some slip through anyway. But the complete lack of editing on this book gives the overwhelming impression that Penguin/Berkely doesn't care about the quality of the book at all. Typos pull readers out of their \\"reader's trance\\", and, if only on a subconscious level, greatly decrease readers' ability to enjoy the book. This book's number of errors greatly exceeds anything I have ever seen published, placing its quality of copy somewhere less than the average Usenet story.This book would have already been controversial because of its obsession with \\"freak\\" erotica and borderline bestiality. But the complete lack of even spell-checking the manuscript, and the unrealistic nature of most of the sex acts (won't go into details, but I don't find \\"metaphysical\\" sex that interesting), along with the unsatisfactory and incomplete resolution of what started to be a good adventure with the vampire serial killers, contrasts violently with the plot-and-character driven masterpieces that were the first 9 books in the series.And in the future, Ms. Hamilton can work out her BDSM-angst issues on someone else's dime. This book cost her at least one fan."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"LKH seems to be stuck in the same old rut: if you have a problem, need beautification, need emotional healing, have a hang-nail; just have sex with Anita (or Merry) and it's all better now. Every other page a new power manifests itself just exactly when it's needed to save whoever. There's a gazillion beautiful men and every one of 'em's just dying to grind away between Anita's legs. And send everything (yes, I said 'thing') involved into screaming convulsions. Enuf already.If you also read the Merry Gentry series, you'll probably get confused about who is in which book. There's skin-hunger and pouting and curtains of long male hair. The only difference I'm seeing consistently is that the Anita series stays with somewhat normal human coloring, except for Micah's \\"kitty-cat\\" eyes, and the Merry series doesn't.There really isn't a story here. The metaphysical attacks from two vampire Masters and the stripper serial killer seem almost afterthoughts and certainly aren't solved.The grammer and spelling errors were just distracting.Bottom line - if you want plot, story, and character development, read something else. If you're looking for soft-core porn, wait for the paperback verion."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I just finished this book because I'm a big fan of the Anita Blake series. That's the only reason. Any other author, any other book, I would have stopped reading it after the first two-hundred pages and moved onto another. It's that bad.As a fan, I was so excited to finally get this book, the 12th in the series, but I was so disappointed with it after reading it. It wasn't anything like I was expecting that had been set up in the last book. There was nothing even close to resembling the synopsis I had read on it--until maybe the last 100 pages. For the most part, this novel has no plot at all and only pretends to really be about something.It just didn't seem like an Anita Blake novel at all. I have nothing against erotica, but that's mostly what this book is and it actually got to the point, I was skipping over those scenes, trying to get to the real story. I found myself groaning over each one, not because they turned me on, but because they were boring me to tears. It was like every guy Anita met, she had to sleep with to solve her current problem. The one \\"necessary\\" sex-scene towards the end with Anita, Richard, and Jean-Claude, was made very anti-climatic (excuse the pun) by all the pointless, preceding ones. Later on, when the sex scenes eased up, I still found myself looking for them around every corner. Everytime someone was injured or something happened, I thought, oh no, she's going to have sex with them!Characters are LKH's strong point--she invents the most intriguing people I've ever read, but even those were lame in this book. The characters have all become unrecognizable having blended all their personalities. There's not even much of the real Anita left.What was the absolute worse, besides the lack of plot of course, was the lack of editing. So much of this book is pointless to the series and pointless to the story itself. And then, there's all kinds of spelling and typographical errors which makes me wonder if any of LKH's editors read it at all, but just assumed it was wonderful because she's a NY Times bestselling author.A little advice to the would-be reader. Wait for the $6.oo paperback or check it out in a library, don't waste $25.00 on this book. Then, skip the first 500 some pages and read it from there on. It will save you a lot of eye-strain. Then, if you'd like, go back and read the rest when you have nothing better to do, and read it a little at a time. You'll get some character insight from it, but that's about all."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm a big fan fiction fan so I'm used to characters being out of character but damn it I'm not used to it from the original writer. [...] She's not Anita anymore, she's some Mary sue that took over and replaced my favorite heroine. The only thing I can compare it to is when Buffy went from super slayer girl to the slayer slut who slept with Spike every chance she got. But at least Buffy had an excuse, she died. Yes Anita has to feed the ardeur but the Anita I remember from the past books wouldn't feed off every thing in pants. It's just not her! If I wanted to read badly written Anita Blake smut I would have looked online for a badly written smutty fan fic. No, I spent my money hoping to get a wonderful supernatural murder mystery and I got cheated. I'm not even going to bother trying to sell this piece of trash, I'm dumping it off at Goodwill. Maybe someone there will like it."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have to preface this by saying this is the first book by Ms. Hamilton I've ever read. Given my other purchases, amazon always recommends her so I picked this up on a whim. It's good to know that this book isn't typical based on other reviews, so I may go back and read the first book, because I like the author's style if not the content. But generally this book sucked, IMO. Anita has sex with anything that walks. Hamilton makes it somewhat palatable by giving her some angst over it but still, this is ridiculous. And the 'mystery', there is one murder at the beginning of the book, then some 300-400 pages later there is another murder and there's been no investigation, Anita just screws her way through a variety of men until the next murder happens and then gets some real clues as to who might be doing this. I do find the various vampire, lycanthrope and other occult story lines interesting, but it doesn't really make up for the weak plot."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Having previously read all of the Anita Blake series, I must say Incubus Dreams is indeed the worst book of the series as of yet. The writing is shallow, as is the plot - and the book is utterly focused on SEX. Rather than the casual, and not too tacky commonplace sex scenes of the series, Hamilton has gone way overboard. This book has been bombarded with scene after scene of raunchy sex. One can barely find the plot at all in this book - which happens to be more like a pornography magazine than anything close to a novel.Unless you are a die-hard fan, I strongly recommend that you do not purchase this book, but rather, if you must, borrow it from a library or a friend. Also if you are a parent, keep your son or daughter away from this book, lest they add some less than wholesome words to their repertoire. Good luck."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"All of my friends gave up reading this series several volumes ago, citing the lack of character development and the trashy sex. I stuck with it - I knew Hamilton could pull a great character back from the brink. Boy, was I wrong.Everything I've disliked about her last few books hit a peak in this book. There was a ridiculously brief stab at a mystery story, which resolved itself (sort of) with almost no work on Anita's part and which was feebly explained away in the prologue. The book was jam-packed with kinky and gratuitous sex, and the few \\"plot\\" advances served only to give Anita excuse to have sex with near-strangers even more often than she does now (and then worry about whether she's a slut - in a word, sweetie, \\"yes!\\"). There was no attempt at a cohesive plot, no need for the offensive amount and extent of the sex scenes, and no trace of the character we loved from the earlier books.

But to change the feel and style of the books so drastically for the worse is deceptive. If Anita must become promiscuous (putting it kindly), so be it.But the plot need not suffer.However, in this case, it does.It seems a talented author has become interested only in expressing her unconventional sexual fantasies and has thus become lazy in the process of creating drama, mystery and intrigue. They are now gone.My optimism for this book has proven to be foolish.This book should be removed from the Fantasy and Science Fiction shelves and over to the Romance section with an over 18 warning. Better yet, send all the copies to those stores that sell sex toys and pornographic videos. It seems the majority of the content in this book is MINDLESS, SLOPPY sex scenes anyway. I wasn't turned on or intrigued. I was disgusted. I am not prudish, so that is saying alot.Previous Laurell fan or not, skip this book. It's not worth the money or time.

I can't quite give it a one star because there were a few scenes that I liked. Unfortunately they were eclipsed by page after page of Anita and various interchangeable males discussing having relations or doing it. I don't mind a little torrid prose but this is ridiculous. It is debatable as to whether the discussions were more boring than the activity.In addition, there were so many typos and spelling errors that it seemed that I was reading an unedited manuscript. Things like \\"he\\" for \\"me\\", \\"diety\\" for \\"deity\\", \\"wretch\\" for \\"retch\\", \\"decore\\" for \\"decor\\". Some of these should have been caught at least by a spellcheck! And at times it was impossible to tell who was speaking during the dialogue--no designators were used.It just seemed someone was in a rush to get this out and didn't bother to craft this work. The formerly finely crafted tales with the nice balance between interpersonal relationships and mystery are no more. I can only assume Hamilton is burnt out and doesn't care about her character anymore. It's too bad because her fans do."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I loved the first few books in the series but it was at this book that the series took a turn for the worse. I was so upset to see the heroine I had come to love turned into a horny moron. The writing seemed to get sloppy and lazy. For example, the phrase \\"sleeping/cuddling/laying around like a pile of puppies\\" appears now in all her books. It drives me nuts. If you want hard core porn held together by a flimsy badly written plot then by all means by this book. Otherwise I strongly suggest that you check out Charlaine Harris or the Dark Hunter series. They are much much better."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Having finished the book, I had these impressions:(a) Hamilton wanted to set up future books with certain background development(b) Hamilton made a list of the points she wanted covered(c) Hamilton gave this list to her housekeeper with a note about what needed to be thrown out of the fridge if it went bad while she was on vacation, and told her to write the scenes she wanted done, so she could later string them together with scenes that would provide structure to the book(d) Hamilton never actually wrote the scenes that would reveal plot to the reader, and submitted the background drafts ghosted by her maid without further adornmentThere is a theme among many of these posts, and it runs \\"It was such good noire/vampire/fantasy/what-have-you, then she started writing pornos.\\" This is not the problem. The problem may be that Hamilton is so taken with her characters that she can no longer judge the quality of what she writes about them. Perhaps she's so lost in her romp that editing just isn't important any more. In a few books, the typos and misplaced punctuation had really convinced me this was the case, but someone has returned to make sure the spelling is right and the commas are mostly defensible. Or maybe my standards are falling.But just to make sure nobody mistakes my concerns:(1) I don't mind reading sex scenes.(2) Hamilton eventually demonstrated, after the first yawners with Jean Claude many books ago, that she could write sex when she bothered to try.This book is not a worthy effort. The main adversaries are not dealt with in a way that enables the reader to see she's won anything, or showing her defeated and needing to re-group. She just misses the boat, the bad guys get away.What DOES happen in the book? Background. The main character is introduced to the SWAT-equivalent of her town and gains their respect (killing little minions an enemy left as a smoke-screen), while leaving longtime readers dumbfounded that the police would want to close a case that's so obviously not closed (who's the cop in this story? didn't we establish many books ago the cops now trusted hard evidence on supernatural things? didn't Blake provide the hard evidence? why the sudden incompetence?). The main character's vampire allies are buttressed with convincing muscle, some of it famously good (OK: we expect a fight later; could be exciting ... where is it?). We hear about recon against the local werewolf pack (OK, more conflict being set up). Distant and extremely powerful vampires are illustrated for future use (allies and enemies, no doubt, but ... for later ....). The possibility that mundane adversaries will drop in by surprise increases (hmm, where's Edward? Is he no longer necessary now that Obsidian Butterfly proved him mortal? No, he'll show up with intel on the mundane powers ... he's just not showing up here, or he was murdered before the mundanes came to town last time). The ongoing build up over Dolph's son's fiancee is discussed, again, but the dinner where Blake meets the boy's vampire love-interest still goes untold. Supernatural sex compulsions drive Blake to bone numerous new specimens, some now apparently complete strangers, and she does 3-ways while you wait for some plot to arrive, like cavalry, to save the book. One hopes that all this background is setting up volumes that will really rock -- volumes in which Hamilton invests time, thought, and craftsmanship.Incubus Dreams is not the first dud in this series. However, Micah is also weak (even aggressive typesetting tricks fail to make Micah even appear the same length as a \\"normal\\" Hamilton novel). Micah is not bad, but a Hamilton novel has several threads going on (her life is supposed to be confusing, her dangers complex and multi-faceted). Obsidian Butterfly, the other book besides Micah in which Blake leaves town without Jean Claude or Richard, is easily complex and fulfilling in ways neither Incubus Dreams or Micah have bothered.So while I'm optimistic Hamilton is building a great tale down the road, I'm not willing to bet a book's price on it. I'll not read more of her until I get confirmation (from a trusted reviewer) that Hamilton's actually working to make a good book again.Unfortunately, as long as Hamilton's sales stay up, she'll have little incentive to do solid work if pride in her craftsmanship has failed. It's great for her to live on a hobby -- I think everyone should do something they love -- but it's rotten to see a good series lost like this. Not to sex -- sex is fine, and the series hasn't been lost to sex (though this book positively drowns in it, and since there's no plot for the sex to advance, it comes off as utterly gratuitous, which isn't what Hamilton is after: she obviously wants the reader to see what increasing power does to her appetites, and how she needs to take care of herself and those who depend on her in order to avoid disaster ... the fact that Hamilton has failed to make the reader feel it, and leaves you to suss it out afterward, simply shows how little care she's taken in her work).The series is lost, rather, to laziness. It's been lost to lack of pride of craftsmanship.And it's a shame."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Does anyone still care about this series at this point? I guess I do because I checked the book out of the library. And now I see why there was no waiting list. Simply put, if you feel the previous books had not enough sex and too much plot, this one's for you. Otherwise, steer clear and don't tarnish your memories of what this series and its feisty protagonist were.Sure, Anita wasn't perfect. The books were occasionally stiltingly written, some characters were not that well fleshed out (Micah, we're all looking at you now) and Anita's sociopathic behavior could be really aggravating and nonsensical. And Ms.Hamilton was often guilty of drawing too many times from the same simile well; how many times have we heard about someone's pulse feeling \\"like candy on my tongue\\"? But the concept of this alternate universe was original and the stories were fun. But the fun evidently couldn't last. Every man who meets Anita now must have her or simply die. Who doesn't she have sex with in this book? Nathaniel, Damian, Micah, Requiem (wait-who??) Oh yeah-and Richard and Jean Claude. At the same time. Because, see, that's the only way to share power within the triumvirate or...you know, I really have no clue. Anyways, be prepared to want to shower for the rest of your life if you make it that far into the book.The mystery has something to do with some strippers being suspiciously killed but honestly I couldn't make it till the end to see what all that was about; I couldn't even make it far enough to see when or if that particular thread was ever resumed. Unlike the Amazon review, I say this is exactly a bunch of sex scenes strung together drunkenly without context. It's like a supernatural key party. I lament I must give the book one whole star. Clearly, I'm not alone."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I so wish that I had read the reviews before wasting my money on this book. I really liked the earlier books in this series. Particularly the relationship with Jean-Claude and Asher. I was tired of Richard's whining almost from the beginning but really liked the other characters.In Incubus Dreams, Anita had so much sex with so many different characters who had little or no purpose to the story that I found myself quickly skimming the pages in hopes that she had moved on to something else. The reasons for ,as well as the acts themselves ,actually became monotonous. It was like a really bad porno not the fiesty, sexy series I encountered before. I noticed a similar problem occurring with this author's Meredith Gentry series. In that series as well, the main character has just been turned into a mindless sex fiend. There is nothing interesting about the sex either. It's as though the author has suddenly decided to appeal solely to the fantasy of a hormonal teenager. She just relentlessly pile drives the main character. Who cares about plot, mystery, maintaining the storyline? It's obviously not the author of this book. Who are you and what have you done with Ms. Hamilton?"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have read all of the Hamilton books so far, and have to say that this was by far the least interesting of the batch. I simply could not finish the book. I had to write a review.Seemingly gone are the raising the dead days for Anita Blake, and the agency days, which were so interesting - to be replaced with page after page of unnecessary and repetitive descriptions of the \\"pard\\" dudes. After ten chapters in this newest book, we still hadn't gotten beyond mundane descriptions, none of them any different from the over-lengthy descriptions of the guys in her Kiss of Shadows book. With no real story at chapter twelve, I gave up."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have to agree with the majority of reviewers on this one. This is Laurell K. Hamilton at her worst.Hamilton's books will never be considered literary masterpieces, but I've always enjoyed her stories. She has a wonderful imagination, and her characters are colorful and sympathetic. Up until now, Hamilton's books were fun, interesting stories with just enough steamy romance to heat things up a bit and keep her readers intrigued. I really enjoyed the love triangle subplot from the previous books of the series, but this is ridiculous! The character of Anita Blake has become so busy \\"feeding the ardeur\\" with anything that moves that the actual plot itself suffers. I had difficulty even following the plot, because it was just too erratic and disconnected. Where is all the conflict? The action and adventure? Any of the qualities of the first books of the series that made it so compelling? Yet I continued reading on, even though I had already lost interest by the second chapter, in hopes that it would get better. But, sadly, the story just continued its downward spiral into the black abyss of Bad Writing.Also, I have one last word of advice for Ms. Hamilton: EDITING! The extremely poor grammar and punctuation is terribly distracting. I mean, we're talking basic high school English 101, here! I couldn't get through a single paragraph of this book without finding at least one blatant error to nitpick.I get the definite impression that at this point, Hamilton is just cranking out books as fast as she can without regard to the quality of her work. Her interest appears to lie more in quantity than quality, and her goal is no longer to entertain her readers, but simply to keep her status on the bestseller list and rake in the profits."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am a die hard fan of the Anita series, or was until I painfully finished this last book. There is no police work, no 'Executioner' work, no cool magic stuff, nothing about the old Anita until the very end. And once Hamilton finally gets there, she leaves you hanging. Ya, Anita doesn't even get the bad guys. She's too busy have sex with at least four new guys, not including the boyfriends. Don't get me wrong, I'm always up for the good sex scenes...a little pickle tickle here, a little pickle tickle there...but the book was full of it and I just wanted to see Anita kick ass the way she always does. This book good have easily been told in 200 pages, and I'm beeing generous. Edward does not even make an appearance. Also, Hamilton does not even mention anything about the Mother of Darkness, where she left the last book, Cerulean Sins, hanging. This book was extremely frustrating and disappointing and not worth the time and or money. All you need to know is that Anita's powers have grown and expanded, as has the triumvirate."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams is easily the weakest offering in the Anita Blake series. There's a neat 350 page novel in a 680 page extended orgy. The murder mystery is merely paid lip service--kind of like the hit man who wants the zombie raised in Cerulean Sins. Yes, Anita sort of starts getting a handle on her personal life, but Hamilton adds so many other issues that it's just getting ridiculous. Add in Hamilton's overdone repetition, numerous editing/spelling flaws, and a plot that never works because the reader gets bombarded with scene after scene after scene after scene of ardeur-spawned hedonism, and you get a mess. Incubus Dreams bored me to tears. I have never said that about an Anita Blake book before. I'll never say it again. If the next book is as bad as this one, I'm done."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"If you want to read a good Anita Blake story, read any one in the series before Narcissus in Chains. If you want to read a good erotica novel, pick up something by Emma Holly. If you want a good sexual fantasy, I'm sure you can image one far better than LKH has for her once admirable character. If you want to read a good book, don't read this one.No amount of 5 star reviews from the ever-loyal fan base of Ms. Hamilton will disguise or forgive the elementary school grammar errors that abound. No amount of praise for the sex will assuage the lack of plot or story line. The only amount of suspense you'll find between these pages is whether or Anita takes one where no monster has gone before for the team.Wait until you find this books shoved in some airport garbage can before spending your money. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for the onerous privilege of reading yet another load of Ms. Hamilton's sexual dribble; dribble that is about as erotic as the thought of cleaning the hair clogs out the drains at Anita's house.Here's hoping that Ms Hamilton learns how to use word search and spell check before her next pseudo literary offering hits the shelves. More likely it will up having spill misspelled on every other page."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Ok, so I haven't been reading the Anita Blake series for years and years like a lot of people. I only started reading this series this year. My opinion of them in general that is no matter how bad they are, you can get hooked. You have to keep reading. Incubus Dreams is like that.I'm a terrible speller. I also don't usually find editing mistakes in most books I read (and I read a lot). I'm happy to say that Incubus Dreams was the first book in this series that I haven't found a completely obvious editing error. That doesn't mean there aren't any... there probably are. But I couldn't find any. That's about the best compliment I can give this book. Well that and I liked it better than Cerulean Sins.I understand that this series seems to be about the moral degredation of Anita. But I am just TIRED of it! I'm not even sure anymore if there are any relatively regular male characters that Anita hasn't slept with or had some type of sexual experience (e.g. passionate kissing) with. It's just silly!This book does virtually nothing to advance the plot of the series. After reading the first few chapters in \\"Cravings\\" I was hoping this book would be much more than it was. Yes, sex sells but Laurell, after a while it just gets boring. This will probably be the first/last book in this series I buy in hardcover. I still have the reciept... it's only been a couple of days. Maybe I can get a refund."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"What a terrible book! 500 hundred pages of sex and only about 200 pages of a real story. Anita is more or less a nympho now -- she'll have sex with just about anyone. Maybe Dolph is next! I miss all the great story lines where she is actually hunting non-human killers. Jean-Claude has actually become close to uninteresting. Anita is almost to the point that she doesn't really need him or Richard. Also, I have never taken to Micah; his description is not very masculine & doesn't appeal to me like Jean-Claude or Richard did. If I wanted a book with little plot and a lot of sex, I'd read \\"Deep Throat\\". I will probably keep on reading the series but I will never buy a new copy again. It will be the used book store from now on."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"it bears repeating. This book *does* blow. Hamilton isn't even trying anymore. The 'mystery' of the book unfolds in unimaginitave 20 page increments. I'd be surprised if it was a total of a hundred pages, but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.The rest of this book is either boring talk about pretty much the same crap they've been saying for 6 books or so, or steamy sex scenes.Now, personally, I *like* the steamy sex scenes (which is why I gave the book two stars), but to be honest she might as well dispense with the pretense at plot and story line and just write an anthology of short hot erotica stories. It'd be more charitable than what she's doing now: butchering characters we like with endless boring sexual and emotional exposition. To be honest, I'm not sure I like any of the characters any more. Maybe Nathaniel, but I need another book to be sure.Yes, I'll read the next one - but I'm certianly not paying for it. This is a series that has moved from the 'own' category to the 'check out of the library' category."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Hamilton's delightfully macabre and erotic tales have tickled the senses of millions, but of her collected works, this novel falls dismally short of the caliber of story this author is capable of producing. The walls between Anita Blake and Merry Gentry's worlds have finally begun to crumble - from Anita's suddenly Merry-like approach to sex with random (and even less human) partners to the appearance of \\"brother\\" vampires Wicked and Truth.Readers who love the growing eroticism of Anita's world will not be disappointed. Every hot, steamy page goes the distance, with creative twists and switches that quicken the pulse and leave you gasping for air. On the other hand, those looking for Hamilton's signature creative plots and witty sarcasm will experience little more than a disappointing quickie with a premature climax. Major characters and encounters are glossed over or rushed, the plot is loaded with holes, the characters lack their previous charisma, and the book reads like a pile of notes glued together with co-dependency and wet dreams.On a personal note, I will not be pre-ordering the next hardcover Hamilton, as I normally do. I am sorely disappointed in the disintegrating quality of this series, and cannot believe the editor and publisher allowed \\"Incubus Dreams\\" to go to print in its current state. I introduced my sister and a number of friends to these books, and we are all saddened by the loss of our favorite hard-as-nails necromancer and executioner.I'll preview the next one at the library before I buy it - I recommend everybody else do the same."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"When I saw the size of Incubus Dreams, I felt like I had been given a special gift. I wait impatiently for each of Laurell K. Hamilton's books to be published and this was just more to savor. It's sad to be wrong, especially on your birthday. Remember the good old days when Anita would kick butt to save the day? Now she just has sex. A lot.While I lament the loss of a great series, I am still grateful that the author has given me so much entertainment over the years. If you are a fan, please do yourself a favor and skip this book. I would have much rather seen Anita killed off than brought to this boring and drawn out low."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This series has gone steadily downhill for the last 3 books, in my opinion. LKH has taken a strong female character and turned her into a nymphomaniac.

Every book I read of Hamilton's grows progressively worse.The entire Anita Blake series had degenerated into plotless pornographic filth. A useless waste of money. Unfortunately, I cannot rate this review lower than one star.Oh - I tried reading the first meredith gentry novel as well, which I RETURNED for my money back (after reading about 20 pages)with a complaint about adult material being carried without labels (lol, hopefully the bookstore will pull all of Hamilton's books)."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I used to be normal. When my best friend and I had conversations, they weren't about the Anitaverse. Now, when she says something pathetic sounding, I'll guffaw \\"God, how Richard of you.\\" Now, when people ask what I'm reading, I'll actually be embarassed to share it with them. In the early days of my anita reading, I was manic. I would cancel dates, skip classes, and look around me on the subway to wonder what everyone was really hiding.My recomendations for the series went out to everyone from my grandmother to my boss. Not anymore. If I tell anyone about the series I will tell them that there are only 9. And not to get too attatched.What happened? When did having intercourse with the monsters become more important than shooting them? Where are the guns and the spine-sheaths? Who told LKH that she could creat a new triumverate, when the last one was limping along? And is Anita really so hot that all of these vamps that have seen tons of women in thier lengthy existence just need, more than anything, to do her? And Hello? lycanthropes have a very keen smell. I'm sure after all of those men in that short span of time, she must have been pretty ripe.I just don't buy any of the characters anymore. not even Anita is recognizable. Jean-Claude, my all-time-favorite, is flat. Dolf is crazy.Richard is a closet-sadist. And Nathaniel is important. I read these books becuase the characters make me happy. Now, I'm praying that all of St. Luis will sink into the river.I've never written a review here before, but I really needed to get that off my chest. And I'm so glad that i'm not the only one who feels this way. I felt like I was taking crazy pills after I read this."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Oh thank god I'm not the only one. That's how I felt when I meandered over here and saw all the reviews that felt like I did.I guess I'm kind of a sucker for the \\"Girl kicks the crap outta the bad guy\\" thing. Loved the Buffy of old, and Alias when they weren't busy focusing on Sydney's love life. So girl power is kinda fun. I also enjoy characters that are flawed, human for lack of a better word.Oh how the mighty have fallen. I suppose I should have expected it after the Merry Gentry series. But I held out hope that Anita wouldn't fall into the same tireless pit.But she has. For more than 500 pages actually.POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!!Apparently I'm the only one who felt a bit ripped off that a good number of the first 100 or so pages was straight out of the short story novel Cravings. In fact, I started reading ID and was like, \\"Why did I pay for the OTHER book then?\\" But with the addition of a murder I had hoped that maybe I wouldn't feel quite so ripped off. Oh well. Glad I didn't actually buy this one myself, cause I'd have been one ticked off chick.When your book is 700 pages long and about 500 of those pages is nothing but sex scene after sex scene after sex scene, well, that's just sad. Seriously, this book could have been done in 200 or so pages and we wouldn't have missed a damn thing. As another reviewer said, sex is not sexy. Pervious novels had a lot of sexy scenes in them that also included sex. Great. I've always like erotica. But this was well... boring. Anita screws someone, or multiple someones, and three pages later is doing it AGAIN. It literally got to the point I'm reading and all I can think is, Didn't I just read this? And if any of the characters said \\"F**k me, f**k me now\\" one more time I was going to scream.The ardeur had GOT TO GO. Seems to me the only thing it's done has given LKH a reason to write more sex. Wow, I was oh so impressed. That was my sarcastic voice.What happened to the Anita who did someTHING instead of someONE?I also have to agree with the influx of characters when we barely know the ones we have. Tho I admit I'm really sick of some of them. Richard, as always, is an ass. *shrug* Sorry but he needs to get over himself as much as Anita does. Nathaniel is... blah. He's like a giant puppy dog that Never. Goes. Away. And I like dogs. Does Damien have a point? Or is he just another someone for Anita to jump? Micah is now the insta-soul mate? Alrighty then. At least it isn't Richard... oh wait, maybe it is. Raina was a bad person. I get it. Thanks. Jean Claude oozes sex appeal. Think we covered that too. *sigh* We hardly ever seem to have any kind of character development these days. Or maybe it was just lost in all the \\"f**k me\\" scenes. And WHY did we need to form another threesome with Damien and Nathaniel? The mind boggles.The actual plot of the book was crammed into a few pages, and while it ended on a slightly different note than some, which was a good thing IMHO, you could tell it was rushed and forced. She might as well have used the Ex Deus Machina (sp?) and solved it all with one wave of a magic wand. We really didn't even get to see Anita as The Executioner in the few pages dedicated to plot, instead she's busy macking on the bad guys as well.While the side plot of Malcolm not requiring a blood oath had potential, I'm not sure it's enough to make me buy the next book. I like a little plot with my porn, thanks anyway.Her novels used to always give me the urge to go write. I've never been able to pin point WHY that happened but it did.... Until this one. And it just gave me the urge to hurl."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Like all other Anita Blake fans, I was waiting anxiously for this book. Now all I can say is: TAKE IT BACK! It's obvious that this book was rushed (in the way it was written and in all the typos/grammatical errors it has). It appears that Hamilton is trying to publish 2 books per year (1 Merry Gentry novel and 1 for Anita Blake). I'd MUCH rather wait longer and get a quality story.At least 3/4 of this book was all about feeding the ardeur - enough already! I like to see Anita grow a little & overcome her hangups, but I almost didn't recognize her in this book. Most of her feistiness and values flew out the window because she had to sleep with everyone in town. Providing blood to the vamps was WAY too easy for her. Since when did Anita give up her values/rules that easily???My advice to Ms. Hamilton: 1. Stop introducing new characters & focus on the ones you have 2. Have the MAIN plot be about some monster or creepy crawly that Anita, et al. have to overcome. The sex stuff should just be the frosting on the cake. 3. Have some outcome in mind - at this point, is Anita really going to get the 4th mark from Jean-Claude & become immortal? It was confusing if she got the 4th mark with Damian & Nathanial. That was briefly mentioned then totally forgotten. Where does she go from here? At this rate, the series will be over because there's no where for the plot to go. 4. Don't crank out these books just to meet some deadline - I'd like quality over quantity.I NEVER thought I'd say this about an Anita Blake novel, but I agree with most everyone else here: Incubus Dreams was BORING!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"As with many of the reviewers, I agree that this book is the worst of the 12 books, and the last three have left a great gaping hole in series.

Up until the last 2 books I've really enjoyed LKH's ability to write a steamy one-handed read, but now I'm on sex overkill and I'm bored. Ok, ok, ok, LKH, we get that Anita can deep throat already! Don't need the tutorial. Yes, LKH, we know Anita likes it rough...do it and stop rehashing that fact. I'm going to hang in with the series because I hope it will be as good as it once was. I will say I enjoyed the 150+ pages that dealt with the case. That felt more like the old Anita to me and kept me interested. I could have easily skipped the majority of the book and not missed anything crucial.The main problems with this book: not enough carnage/adventure, no Edward, too much Nathaniel, but perhaps the worst is the emasculation of Jean-Claude.

There's some sort of plot, serial killer vampires, but it is...well...submissive to Anita's continued attempt to show the world that's she's the boss, while she has sex basically all the time.No other book in the series has given such short shrift to plot, and so many, many pages to BDSM sex and sexual politics. I did not enjoy the book at all, and I admit I mourn the loss of one of my favorite writers. The author is clearly more interested in exploring themes of sexual relationship and dominance than telling the kind of story we genre lovers dig. And it's sad.Anita as a character has become almost unbearable. She must bear all burdens, she must be the toughest, and no one suffers like she does. I imagine her walking into McD's.\\"Do you want fries with that?\\"My eyes grew cold, and I welcomed the emptiness.

I was astounded at the many typos throughout the book, plus the just very poor writing (noun-pronoun agreement...let's have some, please). The book is overpopulated with under-formed new characters while older characters never show up (Asher? What happened to him in this book?). Richard unfortunately made several appearances.

But I'm seriously tired of Anita fornicating her way into power and becoming pretty much leader of the pack over EVERYONE in St. Louis.If you're new to the series just stop with Obsidian Butterfly.To others who've loved the books until now, I plan to use the Library for the next book (if one should actually get published) and suggest you do the same."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams is one of those books that makes you wonder if you were on some kind of nefariously administered drug when you read it.

Hamilton must have a multiple partner sexual fantasy because that's all that's presented in this book. It's sadly repetitive, with all the men being super-endowed and petite Anita having no problems accommodating them, and then the men are all described as having sex the same way, \\"Head thrown back, eyes closed\\".The plot line had very little attention paid to it. For example, Anita's now so magic she simply makes a wish in her head and it comes true. There is no effort expended for her to attain anything, not even the sex, as \\"everyone wants her\\". The final battle seems to have been added simply as a footnote to the dull sex and some of the plot revolving around that I think is a deliberate attempt to be more shocking than ever, probably to make up for a nearly complete lack of a plot or action in the book otherwise.Others have mentioned the copious spelling errors, to which I say Hamilton must have either turned off her spell checker, or she hasn't bothered to invest in a decent word processing program, which would catch her gross spelling errors without leaving it up to an editor. From the looks of it, this book wasn't edited at all, but was simply rushed into print.Add to that the extreme overuse of the word \\"spill\\", and I was ready to \\"spill\\" my stomach contents over this disappointing book. Other overused phrases include \\"relearning how to breathe\\" and \\"sex tore screams from my throat\\" and only increase the aggravation caused when reading this book.Save your money if you must have this Anita story as perhaps at least the spelling errors will be corrected in the paperback version. The plot is hopeless, and the series probably should be staked and buried in a deep grave if this is all Hamilton can come up with."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"As a fan of the Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series, It's with great disappointment that I have to discourage the reading, or at the very least, buying of this book. If you're a fan of mystery, you'll probably miss it as you're reading. If you enjoy good sexual tension, it's been replaced with script-like amateur porn. If you have your favorite characters you're looking forward to, they have most likely been replaced with 2 dimensional pawns who are just there as wallpaper. Many like Asher, get a mention, but no page time.With the development of another triumvirate, LKH has shifted the focus to bringing in yet another problem instead of fixing the ones she has. It does nothing to the development of the central characters. All it does, is present an excuse for Anita to feed more often, thereby allowing the author to include as many sexual situations as possible, while hiding behind a gimmick. When our \`heroine' is finally given a chance to be rid of her \`curse' she refuses, thereby making all her future choices seem justifiable and in effect, planned.The complete lack of editing coming from a \`best-selling author' is downright embarrassing. Mistakes with regards to grammar, language usage, overused words, repeat phrases, and spelling errors in general, are found in at least every other sentence, with the most obvious words like \`triumverate' and \`diety' standing out repeatedly.Overall, there are many things left hanging at the end of this book, the most evident of which is the main baddie who gets away. Unfortunately, I don't see this as a planned plot idea for the future books, only that the author ignored that there was supposed to be another focus for this novel other than Anita and her lovers, and chose not to conclude it. She seemed to prefer the idea of stretching out this particular story line, instead of cutting back a number of sex scenes and developing it further in ID.What upsets me the most, is that Ms. Hamilton has the potential to write a great novel, filled with mystery, humor, interesting characters, and yes, even sex. What this book has depreciated to, however, is a 650 page manual for bad pornography, with a minor filler of a mystery thrown in as an afterthought. My suggestion, is if you're looking for plot and a good Anita Blake novel, read the first ones. If you like sex, buy some good erotica. If you like mystery, read your DVD manual. It's more satisfying than Incubus Dreams."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I finished this book, with all its glorified 600+ pages in less than 24 hours. How? I skipped over half of it. How could I not? If I wanted to read erotica, I would've bought something else. If I wanted to read erotica, I wouldn't have bought this book. \\"Anita doesn't do furry.\\" Oh no, Anita does anything now, with or without fur."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams was 722 pages (paper back) devoted to finding increasingly ridiculous ways for Anita to have sex with EVERYONE! If it isn't the ardeur, its something else, some beast, some force, some outside interference from anyone that is making her HAVE to have sex with everyone who walks within a five foot radius of her. In one day, she woke up and had to have sex with Damian while Richard watched and Nathaniel sort of had sex by osmosis. Then she went to work and was forced to take Nathaniel along in case she needed to have emergency sex, and guess what!! Gasp! She DID need to have emergency sex! Then she ended up taking Nathaniel to work at Guilty Pleasures and GUESS WHAT! She needed to have emergency sex YET AGAIN! This time with some completely unknown guy named Byron while another unknown guy named Requiem bit her neck and she \\"brought him\\" no less than 8 times, possibly more. Also while Nathaniel watched. All right! I get it! Anita is hot and sexy. Every man and some of the women want Anita. The ones who do get Anita are astounded by how totally awesome she is to have sex with. Now can we please have SOME PLOT? Some STORY? I like a good sex scene as much as the next girl. For instance, in the Kim Harris series, when Rachel and Kisten have sex for the first time, that is a good sex scene. I read it probably three times at least (blush!) The only sex scene worthy of reading more than once in the Anita series is the first one with Jean-Claude. The point being that all this gratuitous sex is not lending itself well to the series. Its not making this a better, more interesting read. Its degraded the entire series to the point that unless you simply have a need to read soft core porn, then there is becoming very little reason to keep going with this series. Tune in next time to find out if Anita can recover some of her tough, fun, wise cracking ways."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I hate to slam an author's hard work (658 pages can't have come easy) but MAN did this book suck. I have been an Anita fan since Guilty Pleasures, but found I REALLY enjoyed the series when it took a darker turn, around Obsidian Butterfly. Cerulean Sins was great, because when Anita really started to feed the ardeur, at least she was doing it (literally) with characters I had come to know and like. The pairings were interesting and compelling, and I couldn't WAIT to see how the delicious menage a trois between Anita, Asher and Jean Claude would play out, how they would battle the big Bad Mother of All Darkness, and what that would mean in their relationship with Belle Morte. So many delicious threads left dangling, and twelve excruciating months to wait....then finally the wait was over! Incubus Dreams was at last here!Cut to 658 pages and 200 typos later, and here I sit horrified and dumbfounded. What the holy (insert Anita's favorite expletive here) was this?? It was as if Cerulean Sins never existed! All those threads I mentioned? Still dangling. No room to address them when you've got 500 pages of talky porn to write!Yes, before Anita and her lovers (some of them strangers introduced a mere half a page before Anita goes all ardeur on them) have sex, they TALK ABOUT IT for at least TWO CHAPTERS beforehand. Perhaps Anita must feed the &#34;talkeur&#34; before the &#34;ardeur&#34;. Though the sex is pretty hot, you'll be amazed that the lovers haven't talked themselves into a coma first. Like all die-hard Anita fans, I was expecting another great read. Instead, here's what I got.100 pages of unresolved mystery story,200 pages of psychoanalytical musings (of the &#34;Richard loves to hate himself more than he loves to love me!&#34; variety).150 pages of sex with people you could care less about.150 pages of sex with people you DID care about but now can't stand anymore.The character work is repetitive, with only one spark of interest--Nathaniel. His character arc is nice, and is the only reason I'm giving this book two stars instead of one.Jean Claude? morphs into an emasculated Machiavelli.Richard? a spineless repressed prude, no matter how many three-ways he's in.Asher? Missing in action.Jason? Harmless brother-figure.Micah? still a well-endowed yes man.Nathaniel? Surprisingly still interesting.Damian? Quickly-forgotten sextoy.Requiem and Byron? (&#34;Who?&#34; you ask?) Two unknowns who get more action than poor Asher.Save your time, your expectations and your twenty bucks. Donate it instead to Proofreaders of America, or any organization that could help LKH find a decent editor. Sorry to vent, but man am I pissed at spending hard-cover money on this! &#62;:("},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Before I begin, I have to say that this was the first Anita Blake book that I'd read in a long time. I had stopped at Obsidian Butterfly, which read like a frog that had been floating in the pool too long: dead, bloated, and gross. Since then I have had no desire to read one.So here I am one day, browsing through my Amazon Recommendations, when I see Incubus Dreams with its rating: a whopping two and a half stars! Huh!? Well, Hamilton had never been a literary genius, not by far, but I knew she'd been really popular despite that. Curiosity got the better of me, as it tends to do. You know how they say curiosity kills the cat? They aren't kidding. Because after reading a majority of the 500 reviews here, I had to read for myself. After all, I thought, I'm an aspiring writer, I should know what not to do, right?Well, I certainly got my money's worth in THAT respect. ID reads as though Hamilton went online and found A) the worst possible NC-17 Anita Blake fan fiction she possibly could and B) the most annoyingly whining personal Blog of some teenager and put them together as a book. It is just that bad. I tried to read the whole book, especially since my opinion kept changing, but I put it down when I hit the sex scene that literally spans five or six chapters. At that point, I no longer cared if they ever found out who killed the strippers.As for the things most reviews are complaining about, these are my opinions:1. The sex. There is NOT too much sex in this book. There is too much BORING sex in this book. If there's going to be a lot of sex it should at least be exciting, but this was not. Anita asking to be f----d when she's still \\"tight\\"...after the three other guys had already been in her pants that day, it's debatable whether she'd ever be tight again.Aside from being boring, much of it was entirely gross. And well, what was with all the conversation? During the sex? Not just conversation between the participants, either. It seemed as though everyone and his brother had to stick in their two cents...or two grand, as the case might be. No one ever just walked in on the sex scene, said \\"Oops, sorry\\" and left. No, they had to stick around and make observations!This book tries to be porn, erotica, and romance all at the same time, and fails to be any single one of them. It hasn't the follow through for porn (she does get out of a few of the sex situations, which you don't in porn). It hasn't the artistry for erotica. And this \\"love\\" Anita is claiming isn't romantic. I have nothing against alternative lifestyles, but I simply don't find it romantic, and the sex most certainly isn't, either.2a. The characters. Hamilton doesn't have the ability to keep her characters organized to save her life. That many characters in a story CAN be done, and it can be done well, but not by this woman. Every time I thought I would start to like a character-Requiem for example-they would become another Anita worshipper, telling her how wonderful she is and how much they want to sleep with her.There really is no honest character development here. Some people have cited Nathaniel, but I found his \\"development\\" entirely unbelievable. Somehow he goes from breaking down in tears when Anita won't sleep with him to getting angry and slamming cupboard doors when she bites Micah. It was as though Hamilton kept changing her mind how she wanted him to be.And his hair! Now, look, I am all for guys with long hair, I really am. It's one of the things I liked about the Anita Blake books. But ANKLE-LENGTH!? Nuh. Just nuh. That's so stupid, it doesn't deserve the \\"uh\\" half of nuh uh. After awhile I began to develop the notion that Hamilton has been watching way too much anime.2b. Original characters. Okay, I've always wished someone would kick Richard in the ass, so I don't much care what happens to him. Although I found him more tolerable in this book, but not by much. But most of her original characters have been ruined. It's really odd having Jason as the font of wisdom here, although it's more believable than Jean-Claude \\"I don't share you lightly, ma petite\\". Pfft, yeah! His jealous act would have been more convincing (maybe) if he hadn't just been urging her to sleep with Richard. Asher was absent, and we should probably be grateful for that, considering where her characters are going.Even Ronnie was reduced to a pathetic excuse for a human being. And her conversation with Anita...hoo boy. That's rich, real rich. Anita \\"I'm-so-afraid-of-love\\" Blake giving her friend advice in the vein of \\"Give love a chance\\". Might have gone over better if she hadn't just been going on and on for several pages of inner monologue on how she always screws love up because it scares her.2c. Anita. My god, the woman has become such a c--t. Aside from being a hypocrite, complaining a lot, and being judgmental of everyone and everything, she was in full on \\"offend everyone\\" mode. If, by about page 400, you haven't yet been offended by her attitude, you will be.The set up: Anita goes to a STRIP club to investigate the death of a STRIPPER. She shows up in a white t-shirt with a black bra you can apparently see really well beneath it, a skirt so short she keeps complaining about it, thigh highs, and a pair of heeled, knee high boots. But the reason the cops think she's a stripper too MUST be (at least in her eyes) because they are male and therefore sexist jerks.3. The errors. An editor did not see this manuscript. There is hands down no way an editor saw this manuscript. The publisher couldn't have seen it either. I'm having my doubts that the AUTHOR saw this manuscript.Occasional errors are forgivable. It happens. But this...how on earth to you mispell the word \\"deity\\" wrong SIX times on ONE page!? And then proceed to spell it wrong throughout the rest of the book. Word processors know the word \\"deity\\". It's Latin derivative. There's no reason it should be mispelled, absolutely none. That, along with a host of other words that never should have been mispelled.And the commas! Oh lord...here's a woman who can't use a comma to save her life. Now, she's always had trouble, but this was by far the worse. Commas where they don't belong, not where they do, commas in place of other proper punctuation...there were some sentences that were so chopped up by commas that I could not understand them no matter how many times I read them. There were also a lot of places where she put periods instead of question marks. NOT something you should be doing with 15+ books published.4. Rampant Anita Worship. Okay, it's not entirely true that the characters never tell Anita when she's done something wrong. But it depends on your definition of wrong. It goes something like this: Micah and Jason scold Anita for refusing to sleep with Nathaniel; Micah and Nathaniel scold Anita for refusing to sleep with Damian; Jean-Claude scolds Anita for getting out of sleeping with Richard; and so on and so for.What was really rich was Nathaniel's little speech, where he thanked Anita for allowing him to do all the cooking, cleaning, and grocery shopping. I think the phrase we're looking for here is \\"Ri-ight\\".5. Ardeur/super powers. Okay, as if the ardeur isn't a dumb enough plot device to begin with, it just gets worse as the book goes on. Hamilton raises her fans hopes for a page or two, allowing them to believe that it will all be okay now, because Anita has control over the ardeur. Except control apparently makes it worse, not better. And here's this convienent triumverate that she'll kill (most especially Damian, apparently) if she doesn't feed the ardeur. Sexual Deus Ex Machina...who'd have thought?And it's also true that Anita's powers grow constantly, especially towards the end of the book. Eventually she can raise a whole cemetary with the wave of her hand...no exageration. This reminds me of the Blade movies and why I never wanted to watch them: the phrase \\"All of their strengths, none of their weaknesses\\". That fits Anita well. She's got all the benefits of being a were and a vampire and none of the downsides. And although Hamilton tries to convince you that Anita thinks of the ardeur as a downside, if you're actually buying it, you won't be by the time you get to the scene with Jean-Claude in his office.There were numerous other little things that made me wish someone would put me out of my misery. For example, having known a few witches, I can say with some confidence that none of them would want a Halloween themed wedding, not if it involved Jack O Latterns, paper skeletons, and bright orange bridesmaids dresses.There was too much repetition, as well. Hamilton knows how to write a lot without really writing anything at all. Anita's constant circular ramblings had me rolling my eyes and laughing the whole way through.I did laugh quite a bit, in fact. Of course, something tells me that about 99% of what I was laughing at wasn't meant to be funny. If \\"evil chocolate\\" didn't have you rolling on the floor, \\"accidental sex\\" will. When you're reduced to the phrase \\"accidental sex\\", it's time to quite.Hamilton likes to spew excuses for this trash; she's doing it to be 'contrary', she had to scramble to meet her deadline, she didn't get to show it to her writer friends.Well, Ms. Hamilton, you shouldn't need people to hold your hand through this anymore. You should be able to do it by yourself. And the deadline excuse is crap. A woman who makes as much money as you do doesn't have to worry about deadlines. If you publisher isn't going to drop you for the tripe you're writing, then they won't drop you for missing a deadline.But if this is simply to be 'contrary' then I hope you lose every reader you've got. This book is a slap in the face to loyal readers. It's childish, selfish, and wrong. Obviously you don't write for the love of writing and sharing it with others; for you, it's all about having your ego stroked.I try not to have anything personal against any writer, I really do. But everything I've read has given me the impression that Hamilton cares nothing for her fans. The fans themselves feel that way. They've recieved no reassurance that this isn't all Hamilton's need to be 'contrary'.I may be young (19) and my readership is internet based and small (a few hundred perhaps). But the connection between writer and reader is special. It's true, a writer opens their world to their reader, but the reader takes that world, and therefore the writer, into their heart. You don't abuse that, not for your need to be 'contrary'.I hope for the sake of Hamilton's readers that this is like the book equivalent of the flu: it has to get worse before it gets better. But I won't hold my breath."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams represents a turning point, at least in this readers mind. I'm done with the series! A once interesting series has devolved into a chaotic mess where the author doesn't even bother trying to write a coherent plot or storyline any more.What's touted as character growth reads more like character assignation. Anita Blake and the huge supporting cast of characters have been transformed into two-dimensional cardboard cutouts loosing all of their original uniqueness and appeal in the process.And lastly, if the author chooses to write nothing but erotica that's fine, but market it as such and quit hiding behind the mystery and suspense elements dangled as bait in the dusk jacket.This one time fan is done and moving on."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":".....well, the sex scenes in this book were major snoozers that's for sure! Hamilton was never a great writer to begin with and I read her AB book series for entertainment value only. No more. This book is no longer bad in the good sense, it is just plain bad. Badly written. Badly executed. Boring, mechanical sex scenes. Pretty vampires and weres that sound so gay it ain't funny. And this is what you'll get from this offering in a nutshell:* Sex with vampires and weres* Anita gets some new powers brought on by (you've guessed it!) sex* Some vampire or other is killing strippers, this is supposed to be the \\"plot\\", however, the \\"plot\\" lasts for about 30 pages in the 600-plus book.* More useless sex scenes in which Anita has conversations with her boy toys while having sex* Inner-conflicts before and during the sex scenes (why bother? just accept that you're a slut and get it over with!)* Rain-making, back-breaking orgasms* Pretty boys with long hair \\"spilling\\" all over the place* Conclusion to the vampire stripper killer \\"plot\\". A bad conclusion at that.And there you have it. A waste of time, money and energy for a reader. SOMETHING mind-altering in a very bad way. Either Hamilton was under the influence of something while she wrote this or she didn't bother to create something that was at the very least plausible. Even for her who is not a good writer to begin with, she's obviously waaaay out of it.What's worse, I have the sneaking suspicion that these non-plot stories are going to monopolize the series from hereon in. I read the sample chapters of her next AB novel on her website and I have already decided that I'm off Anita Blake for good. Danse Macabre will be an outstanding novel for Jerry Springer/Maury Povich fans but not for the rest of us who prefer something a little less trashy and vulgar. It is laughable when Hamilton describes her latest efforts as erotica. Erotica?? Emma Holly, MS Valentine, Lucinda Carrington..... they write erotica!! Hamilton writes cheap porn that not even Penthouse readers would be turned on by it. My advice? Don't waste your money on this garbage. If you must read it, do what I did and make a trip to the library. But whatever you do, do not spend your hard-earned money on this tragedy of a book. And if you already bought it and are regretting it, don't buy the next one. The three sample chapters were simply something horrendous that not even Danielle Steele could outdo in trashiness, and I don't think it'll get better!! Remember: say NO to crap!!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Hi, my name is Miss Amii, and I am a masochist. I keep reading Laurell K Hamilton's Anita Blake series even though the last five installments aren't worth reading. I read Guilty Pleasures in one day. Contrast that to the THREE YEARS it took me get passed Narcissus in Chains, and after getting to the halfway point of Incubus Dreams, I can guarantee that this book will never be finished.People have pretty much said almost everything there is too say about this novel: no plot, ridiculous levels of pointless, skanky sex, awful characters, even more powers for the already God-like Anita... But as I closed the cover on my last book by this author ever ('cuz quite frankly, I don't care if she has a comeback later. Her treatment of this series and her fans is just too appalling.) it finally hit me why the Anita Blake series has failed. All the pointless sex is just a cover for the fact that this series has failed to evolve!I mean in the beginning Anita was a smug, self-righteous, emotionally immature, violent and abrasive woman, but we forgave her flaws because she fought the good fight. Now just about every flaw she has been multiplied by 10, she's a hypocrite and uses people ruthlessly on top of everything else, and she only fights the good fight if she isn't busy getting every opening on her body plugged with supernatural male-private-parts.As much as everyone giving this mess five stars crows that Anita has evolved out of her \\"formula\\" of solving the supernatural mystery she's presented with, certainly when everything Anita does is ultimately just an excuse for that stupid arduer to rear its ugly head and get Anita involved in yet another sex sandwich the novels have fallen into just a different formula. And speaking of this pattern of action, arduer, orgy, traces of the old Anita Blake series is there. It's just it seems like just when something of significance is about to happen, the action stalls in its tracks so Anita can be serviced by one of her worshipful harem members. So far, Anita has gone to a crime scene, had a meeting with clients at her workplace, and had a fight with a vampire at a night club. The ideas are there, but oops! her comes the arduer, and everyone gets sidetracked by Anita's wonderful gushing fingernail ripping orgasm, and the plot threads are never heard from again.Seriously, this series is just going around in circles. The issues and themes this series has explored since the beginning have never been answered or resolved. \\"Who are the monsters?\\" \\"Am I a monster?\\" \\"Can I still be a good girl when I sleep with monsters?\\" \\"What is love?\\" Blah, blah, as someone described this endless psychoanalysis as the \\"therapy chair\\" these issues had been run into the ground because frankly Anita is not good at making decisions and sticking with them. I mean, what is this, the third time Anita Blake and her off again on again boyfriend Richard have gotten back together? Relationships are never resolved because ultimately Anita shoves her guys into the nice little cubbyhole where she wants them, the status quo is maintained, and the author tries to fool us into thinking otherwise by shoving major plot points aside and replacing it with something else. How else can you explain the absolute laziness of placing the triumvirate of Anita-Jean Claude-Richard on the backburner to explore a ridiculous and poorly thought-out triumvirate of Anita and throbbing twitching erections #13 and # 24.... I mean Nathaniel and Damien other than being a reason to have Anita have yet another threeway with even more underdeveloped guys.The same bait and switch tactics I mentioned above also apply to Micah, the most wussy and useless were-animal leader ever who is Anita's empty \\"soul-mate\\". I mean what has he contributed to this series besides being a perfect lap dog (or cat) for Anita and having certain parts that would make a bull envious?This is getting kind of long and I could probably write a book the size of Incubus Dreams to explain just how much of a burning wreck this series has become, so I'll just briefly touch on some of the other stuff that made me laugh or snort:1) Men who cry when Anita Blake denies them access to her something that rhymes with \\"Carolina\\".2) Not only is it the best \\"Carolina\\" in the world, it has magical powers that can make you look like Brad Pitt3) How ironic it is that while Anita Blake bristles under the male, patriarchal establishment or the MAN, she is the biggest misogynist in this series. She can barely behave civilly around other women.4) Anita has sex on the floor with Damien while a couple of her harem members look on. I kept hoping they'd hold up scorecards. And the description of the \\"mess\\" on the floor made me feel queasy.5) Hamilton has a style for writing sex that I'd normally appreciate as she doesn't use vulgarity or purple euphemisms, but she has a talent for making the sex as painful as possible."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"As I find myself unable to express my disillusionment, disappointment and disgust at this thinly-plotted and badly-conceived book, I have done it instead in the style of a man more eloquent than I:Once upon an April raining, in great need of entertaining,The postman left me a sweet gift; a package from an online storeWhich I opened, gently beaming; yearning for incubus dreaming,But when finished I was screaming, screaming from the porn galore\\"'Tis some piece of junk,\\" I ranted, \\"Pointless sex shoved down my craw -Only this and nothing more.\\"All that long hard day I pondered; am I mistaken, I wondered?Did I miss the author's message, buried midst the heart of ardeur.Staunchly I reread the writing; still I found it unexcitingFiller phrases, blood and biting; Anita's screams of \`f*** me harder'Rainmakers and domination, was there truly nothing more?And where was the editor?As typos mounted by the hour, with Anita's swelling powerI went searching for an answer, whence I entered Laurell's board;Baffled by the author's reason - was it werecat mating season?Heedless that my words were treason, I stepped among the raging hordeOthers like me asked for answers; but their logic was abhorred\\"Authors are to be adored\\"Presently my wrath grew greater; with dissenters labelled traitorBy the author in a tantrum, I vowed to buy her books no moreThere was no skill in grunting, groaning , sob stories and endless moaning,Thickly spread character cloning, nor was there need to ignoreThe pleas for editing and thought; the back story of books before.Laziness and nothing more.Troubled by the cold disdain flung at those who dared complainDoubting, I could not remain to watch the praising of this hack;Whose characters were nothing more than puppets of her leading whore;To deify and to adore; these books were nothing but a lackOf plot and wit, of character - an endless dreary porn attackIf I could take my folly back!With my stomach slowly churning at the thought of deep throat learning,And my mental eyes a-burning I hurled that mess upon the floor\\"I shall no more my money waste on this bastion of bad taste!\\"If only it could be replaced by plotlines and my dear amourEdward, with a tribe of wererats, turning Micah to red goreA happy ending...evermore."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Halfway through the book I found myself skimming the pages, then I simply put it down and eventually returned it to the library -- after \\"Cerulean Sins,\\" I knew better than to spend money on the book. As others have said, the murder subplot is nonexistent, the pacing is coma-inducing with hundreds and hundreds of pages of mind-numbing talk, talk, talk, talk, and the male characters are little more than one-dimensional boy toys. The delicious naughtiness of occasional sex with multiple partners has turned icky, with something like 10 or so of the various male charaters literally lining up to [insert expletive here because that's all it is now] Anita. The ardeur has become a chore to everyone involved, which just isn't hot. Even more depressing is that Anita herself has become a whiny, indecisive bore.

This book was horrible. I had to get past half of the book, (which was mostly sex scenes), to actually find the plot of the story. This book could have been at least half the size and been much better. There was a love scene that lasted about 3 chapters.Since I love Anita I finished reading the book. However, you may be able to skip the book and not miss anything important from Anita series. My recommendation... Borrow the book from someone so that you don't feel so bad when you read it and realize that you wasted your money and time."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Thanks to all the reviews on Incubus Dreams that have informed me that because readers don't like the sex in this book, we're obviously prudes. That is so true! I had no idea, but now these helpful comments have made it clear to me that I am, in fact, freakishly conservative, hideously prudish, frigid, let's face it--I can't handle anything other than strictly vanilla missionary-style sex in my books between married people. Thank you for showing me the light!!!!The sex in ID wasn't horribly written and mechanical--I'm just a big ole prude!The sex in ID wasn't boring and repetitive--I'm just a silly ole prude!The sex in ID wasn't gross and meaningless--I'm just a mean ole prude!Snail trails are SEXY!Rainmaker comments are SEXY!Pleasuring a guy without throwing up is SEXY!Not showering between sex-a-thons is SEXY!Having sex with strangers in strip clubs and on the job is SEXY!Ripping off all your fingernails while having sex with someone is SEXY!**************************It's not the sex in the book that makes Incubus Dreams so awful. If Anita Blake, the protagonist, was even remotely likeable, was even remotely a reasonable character and not an obvious Mary Sue, then maybe the sex scenes wouldn't have been so offensive.Unfortunately, Anita Blake really is unlikable, really is unreasonable and an obvious Mary Sue. She whines all the time. She complains about everything. She's a hypocrite. She blames others for her unhappiness. Why care about a person like this?Other problems with Incubus Dreams:1) No editing. Berkley ought to be ashamed of itself. This is supposed to be a professional product written by a professional writer and published by a professional house. It looks like something someone posted to the internet during their lunch break. Not good.2) The characterization is atrocious. What happened to these people? Richard is a boot-licking, cringing apologist. Jean-Claude is weak and boring, and has some of the most embarrassing lines in the book. Jason is now a turncoat. Ronnie is now a jealous creep. Nathaniel... Lord only knows what Nathaniel is. And Micah continues to unimpress.3) The sob stories! Listen to character after character reveal their terrible, terrible traumas to Anita Blake. Everyone has been abused! Sexually, emotionally, physically, it's all there. And the reader gets to slog through pages and pages of sob-stories, all of which (save one) are transparent manipulations to get the reader to sniffle into her Kleenex and pity the poor characters. Blah.4) Talk, talk, talkity talk. People in the Anitaverse don't speak to each other like people in real life do. I'm not sure what this is, but it's not dialogue. It's more like page filler with quotations attached. Apparently, everyone in Incubus Dreams is an idiot, judging from the way they talk. And apparently everyone has to have long, tedious, dull discussions about having sex with each other BEFORE having sex with each other, WHILE having sex with each other, and AFTER having sex with each other. It's exhausting to read. Ugh.5) Plot? Murder? No way! In Incubus Dreams, female strippers are being killed by wicked vampires, but Anita Blake is more upset over who she's going to have to have sex with than that people are dying in Saint Louis. Awful. Anita needs to get her priorities straight.6) Sanctimonious nonsense. Oooh, look at the big bad stupid white male cops! Ooh, they're so sexist and racist! Oooh, look at the homophobic jerk! Oooh, he's so evil! Now, you know a book is truly bad when virtues like tolerance and diversity are annoying. Racism is horrible, sexism is horrible, homophobia is horrible--and yet, the way Incubus Dreams is written, these messages of love and tolerance are made cheap and trite, which is a true shame. Anita Blake doesn't sound like a good person, she sounds preachy, and even worse, phony. Horrible.7) Oh wow. Everyone loves Anita. And if a character doesn't love Anita, they're either a bad, bad, stupid person or they're inconsequential. You know you've entered the land of Mary Sue when all of the characters love the protagonist and tell her over and over again how beautiful and desirable and wonderful and strong she is, and the few characters who don't like her or actively dislike her are turned into psychos and idiots. Very, very obvious. It's so obvious it's insulting. Yuck.8) Anita Blake is all-powerful! She's like all of the X-Men rolled into one narcissistic jerk. She can't be defeated, and the book is filled with random plot devices that grant Anita even more pointless powers than before. Soon Anita will be able to shoot laser beams out of her eyes and dodge bullets. She'll be like Neo from the Matrix, only whinier. Can't wait.*****************If you like reading books because there is sex in them, then fine. This book might be cool. And people who have read this book and enjoyed it for the sex scenes are cool--that's good. There's nothing wrong with liking ID because it has sex in it.However, there are many reasons why a book is good and why a book is bad, and there are many reasons for a person to like a book and for a person to dislike a book. There are also many different levels that a book can be read on. If you read Incubus Dreams on one level, the level that does not scrutinize the characters and just wants the sex scenes, then Incubus Dreams does its job. However, if you read a book on another (not necessarily better) level, the level that DOES examine the characters, the writing, and the purpose of the book, then Incubus Dreams fails at its job.Incubus Dreams is not a \\"sex book.\\" It is a novel. Judged by the criteria that make up a successful novel, this book fails on every account. It is, simply, a bad novel. A good sex book? Maybe. A good novel? No.To those who haven't read Incubus Dreams yet, I strongly urge you not to read it. If you must read it, don't buy it. Borrow it. Then, if you like it enough to want to own a copy, by all means, buy one. Too many people are too angry with this book for too many reasons, though, for anyone to buy the book without having tried it first."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Unless you are interested in buying a book of erotica, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK! Borrow your library's copy instead.As was mentioned in an earlier review, the majority of the pages in this book have been used to impose what appears to be the author's sexual fantasies upon the character of Anita Blake, under the guise of the ardeur and of having the character \\"grow\\". This book is just basic pandering to the segment of the audience that just cares about \\"hot sex scenes\\" to the exclusion of any consideration of plot or character continuity. LKH apparently has taken the phrase \\"sex sells\\" to heart with a vengeance. The sexual activity is so frequent, and in such a short time frame that one wonders how Anita is even able to walk. LKH has finally managed to remove all sexual tension from a series where that was one of the highlights, by the sheer overuse of sex. It's almost as if she was working from a check list: \\"Now let's see who hasn't Anita done, and in what position hasn't she done it?\\". Bah!If you are looking for the combination horror-mystery-romance, action/adventure book that was typical of the pre-\\"Narcissus In Chains\\" books of this series, you're going to be sadly disappointed. Up until page 385, there's only 10 - count 'em 10 - pages devoted to the crime that is highlighted on the book jacket blurb. The rest of the pages are devoted to Anita agonizing about her various relationships and having intercourse or near-intercourse with five (or was it seven - I'm already losing track of them) different characters. And, let's not forget the metaphysical rolling beasts - what would an Anita Blake book now be without them? Forget that the whole concept still doesn't make any sense. With the exception of the ardeur, none of the plot threads left hanging at the end of Cerulean Sins have been picked up. The Mother of Darkness is non-existent, the vampire children are nowhere to be found, Belle Morte has apparently lost interest in Anita, etc.This book is extremely poorly edited. The pacing is very uneven. Continuity errors about, the spelling errors have become laughable, and basic writing errors are present throughout. I don't know who's at fault for all that - but there's enough blame to spread around. This is supposed to be a professional product, but it doesn't even seem as though a spell checker was used on it. LKH's favorite words and phrases are used ad nauseam, for example \\"spill\\", \\"meat\\", \\"pulse like a piece of candy on my tongue\\", and her latest \\"taking one for the team\\" (which was funny when used for the first time in CS, but did it have to be repeated at least three times in this book?).I'm not even going to go into what was done with the various characters, otherwise I'll wind up writing an epic. Richard is still emotionally off the charts, Jean-Claude is still batting clean-up, and Micah's sainthood continues to grow. Suffice it to say, that though lip service is paid to character growth, what really occurs is further character disintegration. Anita seems to be becoming LKH's avatar more and more, parroting the statements that have been showing up in the author's recent blogs. It's a very sad day when an established character, one that readers have seen evolve in a logical manner over the course of numerous books suddenly turns into something completely unrecognizable, and actually something dislikable.Will I buy the next book? Probably, because after all, I am hooked on the series. Am I looking forward to it? No. Do I expect less sex and more plot in it? No.And that's sad."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"but I enjoyed it. The sex did get repetitive and I did want to read more action and [...] kicking, but I am completely addicted to this series and cannot give it low scores. I just wish that the repetitive sex with whoever is near when the ardeur strikes would cease. I started reading this series because of the amazing characters and the way Laurell Hamilton makes your mind believe they are real, not for the sex. It is a bonus, but not what the entire book should be about.Also, please give us more Jean-Claude!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm a Nathaniel fan, and I loved this book! I think the way Anita finally realizes he is an adult able to make his own choices and accepts him that way is great. The way she has formed these beautiful, close bonds with the men in her life emotionally as well as sexually is pretty effing wonderful. I see all the hate reviews here on the review area and it's clear some people just don't like or get what this book is about, but then I checked out what the people who did like the book are saying and I know I'm not alone in liking this book. If you are an Anita Blake fan and have enjoyed her recent books, don't let the haters scare you away.The only thing on this book that I didn't like was the spelling errors and stuff. The story and characters I loved."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have been reading the Anita Blake books since the beginning of the series. The early books are wonderful and I highly recommend them. I stuck with the series through the \\"less than stellar navel gazing porn\\" novels thinking that the series would rebound. Not a chance.As the other reviewers have said, it's a meaningless, thinly rationalized, mostly boring porn film on paper. No sooner does a new character show up than you can count the seconds until Anita is \\"forced\\" to bed them for one pointless reason or another. As for plot - well, you could pull out all the pages actually related to the purported storyline, bind them together and maybe (if properly edited) have a short story of moderate interest.I'd say Incubus Dreams has driven a stake through the heart of this series - what a shame."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book completes the destruction of the Anita Blake character. This series used to be one of my favorites, but now... I mean I could take it when she had two lovers, I could understand that. When they added in Micah I'm still like okay what the heck it's still a good series with great writing, so okay I'll go along with it. In Cerelean sins Anita got like two more boyfriends and I'm thinking well it was still a pretty good book so I might as well see the series through. Now with this book she seems to be screwing every guy she sees, so enough is enough I mean, Hell, I could take all this if the story was still good, but if I just wanted porn I would've spent the money on nice video instead of this crappy book. The Author has taken a strong character and turned her into lord knows what."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Well, the destruction of the character Anita Blake is almost complete in this new book. I have become a fairly competent speed reader as I am compelled to merely glance at the literally endless, flimsy, foolishly derived sexual romps into utter silliness by the character, Anita Blake. The Anita of the first 8 volumes has just about vanished leaving what seems to be the only reason Hamilton is writing, and yes sex certainly sells, and will continue to but at such an appalling price. There are hundreds, yes hundreds of pages before the murder component of this story is even discussed after the opening dialogue.I have read similar thoughts elsewhere by reviewers but it boils down to this: If you want endless sexual interplay without any viable or plausible background then this is for you. If you want to read about the Anita with a tough but likeable personality or other characters such as Richard or even Jean-Claude then this is a waste of your time. Laurell Hamilton is a gifted writer but I am beginnging to think this series has turned into a social experiment of her own and here I am still hoping that she will save Anita and bring back an actual story? Unbelievably painful to read, even at intermittent speed reading pace."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am a long time fan of Ms. Hamilton and go here on record saying she is one of the most creative writers I've ever read. But I have never in all my reading history watched a writer more thoroughly and contemptuously destroy a loyal fan base. There is no doubt that the Anitaverse is hers to do with as she pleases but the changes she forced on Anita from NIC onwards are unbelievable. No wonder Anita fought so hard to stay free of JC, once that line was crossed the slope became slippery indeed! And we won't even go into what is now lubricating said slope.I'm not one of the fans that is screaming about the addition of sex to the monster hunting and the mystery. I never thought Anita should settle down with just one guy and raise kiddies. Her powers made her extraordinary and I wouldn't have had a problem with her being in the triumverate and loving both her men in all kinds of kinky ways. I figured Richard would putz around for a while and then come on board. He's not going to get a picket fence life either, so deal Richard! There had been a lot of wonderful sexual tension building for many books and it had to come out sometime. I was looking forward to Anita loosening up and exploring the possibilities of the TRI.But then we have the ARDEUR. It it supposed to be blamed for our chaste, modest, uncomfortable-with-nudity Anita being OK with not only sex with everyone she knows (while her friends watch), but stunt sex with JC's new vamps (while her friends watch), and then finally sex on stage at his strip club (while strangers watch). Come on, this character would never go for it. THAT'S why the fans are screaming. Not because of the addition of sex, but so much sex and in so many ways that Anita couldn't live with on her best day. All I could think of while reading this book was what would Edward think if he could see the Anita he loves and respects being passed around like this?I love the books and watching this progression is painful. With ID coming out I spent the week prior to its debut re-reading all my old books, so I tore into INCUBUS DREAMS with much anticipation. By the time I finished I had that clean white space in my head that Anita visits when she kills someone. This is one book in the series that I won't be re-reading over and over. It's just too exhausting.The book does address lots of relationship issues. It's wonderful that Richard and Anita both grew and came to realize that signing into the TRI had to be faced and accepted in all it's glorious power. Unfortunately that scene was a bit of an anti-climax since Anita accidently formed a new TRI with Nat and Damian. Why, Laurell? Why add that mess when Anita can't even cope with the TRI she already has? ID will go down as the book that is just too much of everything. (Except a mystery) Fine, we needed to have a bunch of different character heart to hearts. That done and done well, can this series be saved?Yes, it can. Just stick a cork in ...ahem, the ardeur. Anita is the big tough vampire slayer, she can get control of it and severely reduce the queue waiting to sample her favors. Then she, JC, and Richard can use all that wonderful power they've summoned up to go fight evil in all its forms. Please. Please. Please."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I saw the reviews of this book, and it made me not want to read it. I too, am tired of all the sex. Mainly because it was more like rape, not by choice.This book is about Anita's personal life. There is alot of sex in this book. I do believe that Anita chose to have sex each time, and the scenes had points to them, and done well in the most part. There is one scene near the end of the book that made me uncomfortable, and felt like she was forced into it, closer to rape then I like. But it wasn't a long scene, and they haven't done anything like it in any of the rest of the books up to book 17.There are alot of interesting things that happen in this book. Don't let the sex scene stop you from read this one. But I agree, if I wanted to read porn I would."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Very stimulating stuff. This and 100 Percent Erotica by Suzie Van Aartman really helped me make it through the night.Its the first of Laurell's books for me, but I shall be seeking out more. Thanks for a good read. also check out Zane's The Sex Chronicles."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Okay, okay...first off who did she call for help? I must be missing something. About five chapters of this novel is filled with crime solving the other 77 is LKH excuse for Anita to sleep with every male character that is willing to have her, and lets just say even the \\"I thought he was gay\\" guy shagged her. Sadly when I bought ID I knew that this was probably going to be some porn movie in book form and I was right. Although hoping deep down that things had finally changed, that this could infact be the redeeming book for Anita, it is not, SO NOT! Although it was filled with sex, the book did show a few good character devolpments. Most pleasing is Richard, he has now left my LKH should just kill him phase. Really pleased how his character has finally turned around, as long as it will last. JC showed amazing devolpment, he is now something more than just a power hungry sex-filled vampire. All in all i'm pleased with this book b/c I knew what to expect, slim plot filled with sex, really wish LKH would go back to the root of the novels so we could actually see more crime solving murder investigations like we did in OB. I really wish Edward had made an appearance, can't wait to see his take on Anita's new life, i guess he will also be one that \\"takes one for the team\\" as Jason very well did."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I've been waiting for this book to come out since I finished Cerulean Sins, and I'm completely addicted to the Anita Blake series.That having been said, this was not my favourite book in this series.Strong points: Anita resolving some things with Richard (one of my fave characters), some hot sex scenes, the opening few chapters describing Larry's wedding.Weak points: this book felt more like the Merry Gentry series, with sex for the sake of sex (or so it seemed) as opposed to it adding intensity to a relationship (even a casual one). The mystery or underlying storyline - outside of Anita's relationships with the many characters - felt almost like an afterthought. There was a lot of editorializing on the development of the triumvirate powers with Richard and Jean-Claude, as well as an examination of Anita's relationship with the many men in her life. As for the [WARNING - SPOILERS!] second triumvirate ... that seemed a little far-fetched.I stuck with it (raced through it and then went back to re-read parts, in fact) because as I already stated, I am a big fan and addicted to the series. However, if you have never read an Anita Blake novel, I would strongly advise against starting with this one. If the mystery rather than the sexual element of these stories is what you like, I would avoid this book as well ... or at least wait until it comes out in paperback.The crux of this book seems to be Anita getting more aware of her boundaries - or lack thereof - and of her gaining greater understanding of how she feels about both herself and the many men around her.Overall, I'd give it somewhere between 3 and 4 stars."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I agree...this book didn't contain as much police work and zombie raising. I'd been waiting with eager anticipation for Jean-Claude, Richard and Anita to be together. I didn't like the sex scene, not because of how sexually graphic the scene was, (hell, I love that!) but because these characters have been so close, gone through so much together and I didn't feel that...I wanted more from the scene. It didn't do these three characters justice to spend most of the scene having Anita show how well she could swallow Richard and talk about how she'd been practicing on others. These are minor complaints compared to how much I liked the rest of the story. Although the blood and guts were at a minimum a whole lot was going on.The first section of this book was heart wrenching to me, many of Hamilton's characters have been so abused physically, emotionally and spiritually. I wanted to cry with the new revelations of Nathaniel and Damian's pasts. It broke my heart to see how needy they all are and that Anita could barely come up with a happy thought to help them hold the bad memories at bay. I can't wait to see if her relationship with Nathaniel grows stronger.The further I read into the story and all the bizarre sexual activity the more entranced I became with the relationships. These characters are not one-dimensional. I learned a lot about them, their feelings, motives, their neediness...very human traits although they are the supposed monsters.With each book I've wondered how Anita could keep going; she barely sleeps, hardly eats, and when the story first began she really didn't have much along the line of supportive friends...and family is non-existent. Anita would admit to loving no one and certainly didn't trust anyone. Ask yourself how you might behave if you had gone through all she has. I'm loving the growth of her character and don't find it odd that she could love all these men. Her life has been in their hands many times and she hasn't been disappointed. What IS odd is that they are willing to share her, with the exception of Richard who also seems to be coming around. If you look at how these characters have lived, been abused, shared and tossed around by cruel masters, I guess I don't think it's unreasonable for them to be willing to share Anita who is so good to them. I have great hope that eventually Richard will accept what he is, just as Anita has had to accept what she has become. Imagine being a celibate Christian with high moral standards and needing to feed the ardeur...just to survive and prevent those connected to you from dying. What a mental and emotional challenge for Anita to learn to do this, accept it and not beat herself up over it.As far as Belle Morte and the Mother of Darkness goes...I'm sure we'll hear about them in the future, just as we eventually learned so much about Edward. If you look at what is really happening in this book, Anita, Jean-Claude and Richard are gaining power, learning how their power works, learning to trust each other and rely on each other. They're building their strength and power with the addition of Nathaniel and Damian in Anita's triumverate. The \\"Furry Coalition\\" will be a great help to fight any bad guys. Primo and Wicked Truth are also strong new additions to Jean-Claude's arsenal along with Requiem and Jean-Claude's other new vamps. It looks to me like Jean-Claude, Anita and Richard are amassing the army they will need to fight Belle Morte, Vittorio, The Dragon, Morvoren, Mother Gentle and any other badies out there that need to be disposed of. I for one look forward to seeing how all the new powers are used to fight the evil ones. I know this series will eventually run out, and I'll miss it when it does."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Got my copy yesterday and read it straight through! It's a huge book but I couldn't put it down, and I am so happy with it I had to share =) I've been a long time Anita Blake fan, and each new book just keeps getting better. This book was mostly about Anita's personal relationships and fleshing out some of the characters we've met so far. Damien, Nathaniel, Micah, all become more detailed. There is finally a sit down and hash out between Anita, JC and Richard about their TRI and their personal relationship. We get to see Richard finally get some of the powers of the other Tri members too!The relationships and the people are not perfect. They are messy, in that real way you get when the people involved have personal issues. The emotions and struggles of the characters as they try to work things out are so vivid, and the fact there are no perfect answers rings true. I like the fact this series doesn't try to put everything in a neat and uniform box, but shows the mess and the blood and the sex in all it's heat. The gory and the glory of Anita's life just sort of rushes over you and fills you up. I've never read a series that pulled me in so completely, and made me care so much about the characters involved.There are a lot of technical errors, spelling etc, but for the $16 dollar price of a hardback I'm not going to moan about that. Decent editing would be nice, but if a faster publishing date and a cheaper price means I have to put up with a few mispelled words, I'm down for that!Things that stuck out for me in this book, Anita's beginning to reconcile herself with the increasing sexual nature of her power and finally getting past the angst and into the use of this aspect of her power. Coolness =) There was a lot less of a mystery plot in this part of the ongoing series, but what there was brought home that Anita isn't a cop, and not all cases have neat and tidy ends. I liked how she had to deal with that fact, and how her new family of loved ones are there to support her as she makes the realization she can't do it all.One of my top five favorite Anita Blake books. I'm in such a happy shock right now. Later after some rest I'm going to reread it again. This was so good. Looking at some of the other reviews, it's clear it's not everyone's favorite, but if you liked the last few books, Narcissus and Cerulean Sins, and enjoy the direction Anita's life has been going, and her steady, ongoing character developement, this book will totally rock your world in the very best way!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Laurell Hamilton's Anita books have gotten longer, and the additional length is pretty much all explicit sex scenes, some of which go on for multiple chapters. This is not a criticism. Hamilton writes sex very well, and her Anita and Meredith series are the most successful erotic fantasy that I've encountered. It is hard to write a book with this much sex without having the sex \\"take over,\\" so that the plot begins to seem like a device for getting people into bed. One thing that makes it work for Hamilton is that it is very \\"female\\" eroticism. Every sex act has consequences, for the characters' relationships, and (because the magic is essentially sex magic) for their powers and vulnerabilities. So I don't find the sex scenes boring or gratuitous.But there is a problem. The books have gotten much longer, but because it's all sex, there is not more (non-sex) plot. For a thick book, this one felt kind of \\"thin.\\" It seemed like the balance between \\"internal\\" (i.e. character relationships) and \\"external\\" plot elements was off. Virtually all of the plot threads that are developed in a satisifying way concern Anita's sexual relationships with her crew of vampires and lycanthropes. Some external conflicts are introduced, but they are mostly left hanging. There is an issue with a police coworker, which is left unresolved. New vampire antagonists are introduced, but they never even appear \\"on stage.\\" The major vampire-hunting scene of the novel resolves nothing and is not particularly suspenseful. With Hamilton now dividing her time between the Anita and Meredith series, it's a long time between plot updates, and a novel that is as obviously transitional as this one is a little frustrating.There also seems to be a problem with the copy editing. I came across more typos and grammatical errors than I recall in any of the previous books. Particularly jarring is the repeated misspelling of \\"deity\\" as \\"diety.\\"Despite the criticisms, this is still an enjoyable, if not quite satisfying, addition to the series. After a dozen books, there is still a sense that Anita is growing and changing, which is quite unusual for a series character. And it is not always clear (to the reader or to Anita) that the changes are positive, which adds an element of tension that is not often present in a long-running series."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I loved this book, but it's obvious that other people do not agree. There are some editing mistakes, and a few unresolved plot issues, but I could overlook that and assume that my questions will be answered next time. If you are new to the series, you probably shouldn't start with this one, but if you do be forewarned that the sexual content is high - and grows with each book.For old readers: you will probably not like this book if you a) dislike reading about sex, b) think the Merry Gentry series is too sex-oriented [this book reminds me of Merry in terms of content], or c) you read this series mostly for the mystery/crime-solving aspect. While the mystery is present here more than in the last book, the focus of Incubus is on relationships rather than crime.One reviewer wrote that Anita used to be a crime-solver who just happened to have supernatural powers, but that the focus has shifted. This is true, but it comes as no surprise to me: with the growing connections between Anita and the boys around her, it makes sense that things would grow physically and metaphysically. Granted, there were a couple of times while I was reading that I thought, \`I didn't need to know that', but I wasn't really surprised.I enjoy these books not for the mystery, but for the characters and the supernatural aspect. What pleased me most about this book was Anita's growth. Whether through supernatural influences or not, I felt that Anita was making progress in accepting herself and the people around her. So, if you've been getting frustrated with Anita's many emotional problems, you'll probably be relieved by this book. Although action-oriented people may be frustrated by all of Anita's introspection, it helps readers understand what her beliefs are and how she's struggling with change."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Now to start off with, I'm one of the fans who's been complaining about what I feel was a massive lack of plot in the last two books in this series. In some ways, although I never said it outloud, this was my make it or break it book. And this one definately made it!I think it was the rich character developement that ran all the way until the very end of this lengthy novel that pleased me the most. No one seemed two dementional. Every character was as complex and human as people you'd expect to meet in your own life. Although there are many, many sex scenes, none of them felt out of place for me. Incubus Dreams gave me everything I'd come to expect from the series (which I've been reading since book 3, I believe there's now 12). It had sex, yes, but it also had police work, zombie raising, preturnatural politics, you name it this book had it. If you don't like the sex, period, then this book would definately be a dissapointment. But if you, like me, viewed the sex in the earlier books as an integral part of the plot, then you'll love it! Although I would highly reccomend for those who haven't read a book in this series before, try reading some of the earlier ones first. There are many references and character developements that might be hard to understand if you have nothing to reference them from. I also felt this book tied up a great many loose ends that have been wafting through the last few. It was like a breath of fresh air to know that we were moving on to entirely new stories instead of rehashing the same old, same old.In closing, I saw this book as a return from the disjointed, sloppy books I've been seeing recently to a purely enjoyable story of a strong minded herioine, placed in very hard situations, trying to remain a good person while doing everything she can keep her people safe. I'm already excited to see what's next for Anita!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Ok so first off this will be more of a \\"how can you say that?\\" lecture than a \\"this book is so wonderful\\" diatribe (and since is early in the morning and not had coffee it will be short). Ms. Hamilton and her fans already know she is awesome and could make a story about pet rocks sound riveting, so there is no need for me to elaborate on the subject. What I fail to understand is how people can get on Amazon and slam a book that they obviously did not understand (or was it that they could not read all the big words?). Here is how I see the situation, and remember I do not know Laurell so this all could be off-base! Any one who has read the series should have seen this book coming. There were to many issuses that Anita had not been facing. She needed a book to evaluate and see the relationships in her life and come to grips with what she had become. Obviously for Anita this meant that she could become a little more sexually liberated. I loved the whole book and thought the soul-searching was a great bonus--when was the last time an author other than Laurell turned a vamp story into something you could apply to your own life?And as for the comment about there being no action or mystery in this book--did you skip over the whole vamp serial killer plot, the Anita can raise a whole graveyard without a sacrifice incident, or the taking control of Malcolm's kiss (how freakin cool was that?) Keep up, okay?ok i am off my soapbox now and i realize everyone has their own opinions but i thought i should add mine. Also--why slam Laurell for typos (which i must have missed in my zeal to read--darn that English Minor) when she isn't the editor?"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I hate to say that because I love them all but this novel is what we've been waiting for. Anita faces herself and the people in her life for the very first time.She stops running, stops blaming, stops pointing fingers and for the first time she pauses to really see how far she's come, who she is, what she's done in her life and where she's going. Awesome!She learns more about the ardeur that rules her life and the lives of the people who surround her. She understands how better to control it after being its slave for so long and how it's ruled her to the point of being with people she would not normally be with. I think now she can rule it and be able to live with herself.She learns how she's hurt Nathaniel even though she thought she was saving him. She learns of Micah's tortured past and why he acts the way he does toward her. He even gets assertive at the end and tells her how he feels. Jean-Claude matures and Richard finally grows up!!!Without writing a novel about this novel I can't go on enough. I think this work is undoubtedly misunderstood. It is brilliant and much needed. There is so much resolution and so much room to move forward. I cannot wait for the next book. Laurell K. Hamilton I applaud you!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"After reading Incubus Dreams and mulling over the content for quite some time, I found that I enjoyed the book on many levels.Superficially the book has taken a departure from the early days of the series. In which the standard storyline was, Open in Anita's office, find out about crime, be horrified by crime scene, some superficial character development, mull over past hang ups, some more minor character development, another gruesome crine scene, discover something new about one's self, solve crime, wrap up and we're done. The first 5 books in the series followed this storyline almost exactly. Change out the bad guy doing the crimes, add a few more characters, change the location. But all in all that was it.I feel that Incubus Dreams is the frituion of the story arc change started in Killing Dance. In which we start to see the slow shift away from only solving crimes and we delve deeper into the characters themselves. By the end of Incubus Dreams I feel like the author has taken time to let many of her characters fully develop. I feel like much of the action that takes place in this book, is in preperation for the continuation of the series. The overall storyline and characters have grown and developed to the point that we no longer have to worry about a stagnent storyline. I feel that the author took many opportunities in this book to \\"fix\\" a lot of problems and snarls that she had written herself into over the course of a 12 book career, in which her personal view points have changed as well as her writing style.On the surface there is a lot of things about the book that many readers find startling or out of character for our heroine. But I think that if you look beyond the surface to what the author is really saying or doing that you will enjoy the book for all the same reasons that I did. There is a strong sexual overtone to this book, but in many ways I feel like that is a vehical for the suthor to move us away from that tone in future books. And personally, I enjoyed it. Read Incubus Dreams for what it is with an open mind. Don't assume and you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams begins at the wedding of Larry & Tammy (whom after this interlude are not mentioned again). Anita is one of Larry's groomsmen. Her dates are Micah and Nathaniel (hey, why bring one when you can have two?!). Anita's trying to duck out on dancing with them when she's called to visit a murder scene. Yay, a murder investigation, I thought, the book is getting back to its roots! No need to get excited, though, as it's only for a moment then we get back to the sex.As expected at this point in the series, the book features lots of sexual tension with Nathaniel (he of the beautiful violet eyes and desire to be bound and beaten) and Damien, and Asher, and Richard, and Jean Claude and Micah and . . . well, you get the picture. When the book begins Micah is Anita's #1 bedmate and partner but as the book progresses Nathaniel finally moves up a little in the ranks. I was thrilled to see this as I have a soft spot for Nathaniel.This book was described to me by a friend who enjoyed the earlier books as \\"boring porn\\" and I can easily see why she felt this way. The sex with strangers which fills far too many pages is dull, unnecessary and frustratingly vanilla. How many men does Anita need in her harem anyway? It has reached ridiculous proportions. She'd be waddling like a penguin if she were entirely human . . . If the book had been subjected to a little editing I'm thinking it could've been oh-so much better.However, I still thought it was much better than the last few Anita Blake books because the author does delve a little deeper into some of the relationships. The Jean Claude/Richard triangle is explored. Micah breaks down and becomes more than just another pretty face (though he's quickly forgotten for most of the book). Nathaniel comes into his own (take that however you will) and becomes a little less of a doormat for Anita to use for feeding her various hungers and for cooking and cleaning. Hey, where can I get a Nathaniel, anyway?The plot is all over the place. At one point Anita is called in to raise a zombie. I'd almost forgotten she's a necromancer so it was nice to see her \\"working\\" again. But that plot thread, which I found very interesting, quickly went nowhere. She's also called in to investigate a suspected vampire serial killer targeting strippers. This plot fizzles and limps to a less than fulfilling end. In between the short moments of work, Anita seems to be angsting about the way her life has turned out and dealing with the ardeur while attempting to reconcile her feelings and complicated relationships with all of her boys.Incubus Dreams managed to hold my attention for most of its many pages which is something most books can't manage to do these days so I'm sure I'll read the next one."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Who are these lame reviews who complain about the sex scenes? Do they have a brain in thier head? Did they ever actually read anything erotic before? I am so annoyed at these stupid people and thier winning about the sex. This book has a great and solid plot and it brings alot to the table that we didnt know before. How can they bitch about the sex scenes after reading her other books? This is great book for any anita fan who isnt an uptight idiot and if you are an uptight idiot then why are you reading anita blake books? GET A CLUE and read something else. Maybe your wondering why it makes me so mad, well it's becuase what they complain about is exactly what these books are about and what Laurell does well. Better than anyone else i have read in fact. We did not come all this way with Anita to just ignore her personal life and just read about monster hunting. The fact that we get to know her personaly is one of the great things about these books and the sex scenes let us know her even better in her confusion and joy. I think obsidean butterfly was one of her best books and i have never been let down by any of her books so far and Incubus Dreams is just as great in my opnion."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"next Anita book will be nicely wrapped up under a Hustler (...)cover so that people will easily understand what they are gonna get. This is my second book by Ms. Hamilton (the first one was as boring as this one -it was Narcissus Chains or something like that) and it is exciting as much as a piece of cheese going mouldy. Friends here urge newcomers to start from the beginning but I can't help feeling to wonder if an author of such a pointless driver could really write a good book. After all, even editing, which should put the publishers of this book on shame is one of the poorest I have seen in years. How could a good, self-respecting author let this sloppy thing slip through publication?I am grateful that I started these series late; because if you start from the first one, you cannot help yourself but read all the rest...regardless of how bad they may be, wasting up both your time and money. I know how it feels. That's what happened to me with Anne Rice and Patricia Cornwell...Anyway, I am leaving Ms. Hamilton here on her journey to laughable adolescent sex world. Stephen King's Dark Tower series,Lord of The Rings as well as Harry Potter are simple and effective examples how good a series can be.Ms. Hamilton, I beg you to read them...They have stories in the first place."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Okay, don't get me wrong, I'm all for a little steamy sex thrown in, but this was basically the whole book.

In the past I have gotten upset with her inability to bend, and her blatant immaturity. But you gotta love a girl that is grounded in \\"I will kill you, back off.\\" But by page 100, when only 3 pages had been devoted to a murder, the rest to sex, the development of characters, the forming of a new Triumvirate by sex of course, I begain to feel a little desperate for the old Anita. For the first time ever, I found myself putting down one of these books for no other reason than I needed a break from it.I miss Edward. I hate Richard, though he is starting to be less repellent. I know that Anita is amazing because of the ardor, but I really am tired of everything being solved with sex. I don't like it when an author uses the same dialog over and over and LKH is really better than this.Thin out the men, deep six Richard, everyone gets a hair cut except Anita and send her to Quantico for FBI training so she can be a \\"real\\" Marshal. Then write an adventure as in the old days.There are much needed developments of people in this book, it's long which I liked, relationships were changed and given some resolution which I also liked. This was outweighted by the negatives.

To be exact I'd have to go back and check. Then the series shifted away from the original premise to a new direction, that is of an erotic thriller. High on the erotic, low on the thriller. When it first started I just thought she was having a bit of writer's block and was using the erotic by blows as filler. Then the next book went further in that direction, the next further and so on until we arrive at \\"Incubus Dreams.\\"At 658 pages this looks like one of Laurell's biggest endeavors yet. Then you start reading and find that the first 94 or so pages is devoted almost entirely (with the exception of 4 or 5 pages) with Anita's sexual encounters with the two members of her entourage that she had not yet had sex. The rest of the book then proceeds along the same path. Probably 80-85% of the novel is just pure erotica, which by the way, other writers do far better.In \\"Incubus Dreams\\" Laurell initiates plot lines that appear to be interesting but then the erotica takes over and none of them ever go anywhere.Stay tuned for the next installment in the series where she has Anita take on the few uncharted sexual areas she has left to explore. With S&M; and partial lycanthropic transformation (bestiality) taken care of in this book I think that only leaves lesbianism, anal sex, scat, urination and her with numbers greater than 3 men/women/vampires/lycanthropes or any combination thereof.(...)I don't know if she ever intends to get the series back on track but I give up."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm expecting a sexier version of the vampire killer who does police work when I continue reading this series. If I want porn I can buy real porn, not a repetitive and boring misrepresented, disappointing waste of time. After Narcissus, I realized I had better save my money and I wisely turned to my library. At least I didn't waste my money on this one. After reading a bit and scanning through the same old arduer garbage, I read the other reviews and decided to move on. If I can't read about the vampire hunter who raises the dead here, I'll just find a different author. Too bad. I liked Anita and didn't mind her sexual morality changes. If only I could revisit the knives, Edward, and the shady customers at Animation Inc. I could get the read I am expecting when I pick up a part of this series. The author should have categorized the books after Obsidian including this one in a new series called Anita Blake Dreams on, Drools on."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Sex and power became boring, just to sum up the review. Anita's character was once the strong female heroine that you would love to read until Blue Moon. The series just revolves around sex, not just casual sex but frequent casual sex making it a priority due to complications which is not likable to me.Another thing that bothers me is the too-many sexual partners that Anita keeps. The somewhat acceptable setup that Anita, Nathaniel and Micah has. It's not normal but it happens. Still, I don't get the idea why Hamilton used this twist over the characters. And speaking of character, Hamilton introduced so many characters that I often lost track of who is who and often re-reads or google'd the character just to remember who they are. Hamilton should have concentrated on the main cast and improved the character rather than introduced another.The new triumvirate is not necessary if you ask me. Too much power, too much sex, too many men, results to excessive whining. If only Hamilton turned the story around, reformulated the plot and \\"fixed\\" the character, the series would have been great again.."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I absolutely LOVED the Anita Blake novels up until they all became about sex and little else. If I wanted a romance novel I would buy some of those cheesy things my grandma used to read! Anita used to be about the action and complex stories, I couldn't wait to turn the next page. Even the parts that hinted at sex or resulted in sex were well written and made the reader want more. Now, the whole stinkin' thing is about sex! Whenever Anita is around a new male character you know she'll eventually sleep with him and then complain about how disgusted she is that can't help herself for the next 50 pages. I can't believe this book is as long as it is. It could have been cut in half and still been too long. I really liked this series and truly wanted to enjoy the rest of it, but I found myself just wanting this book to get over with so that I could start a book by a different author. I find myself not even interested in the same genre anymore since the Anita Blake story, that which had so much potential, went horribly wrong. Unfortunately I will avoid purchasing any additional Anita Blake novels."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book is a travesty. I started the Anita Blake series because it was interesting - you had police work, mysteries to solve, an interesting mythology starting, and a cool character. I liked how LKH put in details like trouble with holsters, that sort of thing - it gave it some grounding.Well, that's all by the wayside now. Police work and animating are done; they really do not play a part in this story at all. The new characters are flat, and Anita is no longer interesting. There is no longer intermeshing between her 'normal' life/job/friends and the preternatural; she no longer has any normalcy at all.I'm tired of reading about these vampires and weres with long, flowing hair and how beautiful they are. It was more interesting when they had an edge of danger, ugliness, and were a little strange and scary. The male characters all come across as gay, and I'm not into gay erotica. Anita hasn't tried girls yet, but I'm sure that's coming, though, given the direction of averything else.It seems like LKH was trying to fuse Anne Rice's Vampire series and her erotica 'Beauty' series.... and not only failed at that, but ruined a good urban paranormal thriller series in the bargain.The only mystery left is why I keep turning back to this book. I'm halfway through and I don't like anyone in the book. There is no mystery to solve. In fact, all this book really has left anymore is a romance novel. \\"Oh, he's so beautiful, oh I'm forced to ravish someone now, oh I feel so bad I was forced to ravish him\\".... Gag me. If I liked romance novels, I'd go find a straight romance novel, not this book that claims to be one thing and fails to deliver that or anything else, either.Unfortunately, I'd already bought this and the one that follows, based on the strength of the series. Money down the drain, I guess. Time to find a new author.... Sorry, LKH, but I'm not a romance novel gal, and that's what you're pumping out now.FYI readers: if you haven't read Kelly Armstrong's 'Women of the Otherworld', try that series instead."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Stop typing.

I abslolutely LOVED her first 9 books + the first Merry Gentry book. But after that ? Merry Gentry nr 2 and 3 were all just about the sex, and Anita was headded in the same direction, but at least there was still a story in there, somewhere, between all those gorgeous sexy, naked men...But this one ? I didn't even like it enough to finish it !!! I got until page 100 or so, and then I just gave up, I couldn't stand it anymore.That's the problem with a supernatural series where the big bad has to be bigger and badder with every book. Once she got to the top of that, Hamilton introduced sex in her books, and made that bigger, frequentlier and with a lot more men every book. Until that is all that you have... Maybe I'm just being nave, but I like to read books for the stories, not for the sex.Laurell K Hamilton can write good vampire murder mysteries, I'm sorry to see that she had abandoned it, so she can write about sex."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton is one of the most talented writers I have had the honor to read. I have been a fan of her work for years. I took to the Merry Gentry series with gusto it became my favorite because unlike Anita we knew from day one that Merry came from fertility goddesses and was a sexual person. On the other hand we have Anita basically a good girl who has turned into this nympho type creature that feeds on lust and sex! At the beginning I thought okay the premise sounds interesting but then I began to compare both series and now with Incubus Dreams I find myself saddened by the fact that LKH can't have those fabulous heated sex scenes from before without adding so many different man to the mix. I never thought I'd be complaining about this because I enjoyed the wonderful way she writes. Above all I can never complain about her writing it is wonderfully vivid and the imagery pops off of each page. What I can't get over is what is LKH's problem that her characters need to have a stable of men they have sex with? 1, 2, 3 is plently, but we are talking 4, 5, 6 and even more. WHAT IS GOING ON? Others will say it adds to the story but I disagree. For a character like Anita to change into this makes me a little sad. Even with the Merry Gentry series (WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE) I am sitting back now wondering why does LKH find it necessary for there to be so many men for 1 woman? I know Anita's Arduer feeds, but really all these different men seem like filler to me. Instead of having a much better story we are bombarded with more and more men added to Anita's bed. Sometimes she whines about it later or blames the guy and other times it's washed over as just part of the course.I have no problem with LKH making the book full of sex. But what I do mind is so many different men. Anita is one woman and all I can think is how can she not be sore from all of that? Even with all my questions the one that sticks out most is why are so many of the Alpha males so happy to go along with this? Jean-Claude the wonderfully sexual vampire I understand, but he used to have more of a voice. Now he seems simply as if he is under Anita's power and does whatever he has to to keep her happy. Call me naive, but why does LKH need so many different men in each of her female leads beds? I'm tired of keeping track of all of them as much as I enjoy her writing style there are too many men and too little time. Being fiction even that makes me wonder how they have time to do anything other than stay in bed all day and night..."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This is one of the most boring books I have ever read. It takes a really unique writer to make sex so dull and repetative, but LKH manages in this book and CS before it. The series started with such a promising idea and Anita was a fun character; funny, tormented and strong. Now? She's predictable and bitter. LKH has stretched out this idea past its limits. She has run out of ideas for Anita and now resorts to the amatuer writing styles of lots of hot sex. But wait...it's not so hot because every sex scene is the same thing over and over. Frankly this series has been reduced to a cheap copy of Penthouse letters w/ a skimpy plot. We deserve better and LKH needs so stop cranking out crap and start writing again."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The only reason this book rates even 2 stars is that I'm a huge fan of the Anita Blake series, which I only discovered about five years ago. One of the great things about this series is that it was a refreshing combination of the mystery-horror-fantasy genres with intriguing characters, interesting plots, and the fact that it was based in my home state of Missouri made the books that much more interesting. This book, much like Cerulean Sins, just does not live up the standard of the previous novels. Where Anita used to kick ass, she now spends more time on her back servicing the sexual needs of the many \\"men\\" in her life. Jean-Claude has become little more than a foppish secondary character; and Richard has been pathetic for several books now. As much as I love a good series, there comes a time when an author needs to give thought to ending it. If all Ms. Hamilton can do is place Anita one soft-core porn scene after another (not to mention a completely unnecessary and totally stupid discussion about Richard's equipment), maybe it's time to move on. If you still like the series, wait for the paperback because this book just isn't worth the $20."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Well I just got done the copy I borrowed from a friend and I have to say I am glad I refused to but it until I did.Leaving aside the extreme number of editing and spelling problems aside the plot what little there was of it was good but it needed more fleshing out and less bare flesh and trashy and sex scenes that any fanfic writer could post.I know its harsh but this book blows chunks and the author has clearly let her writing style for the Merry Gentry series ruin this series.If I want a trash sex scene I would read her other series or better yet online free stories that actually are better staged then the author does hers.If you loved the first 7 - 8 books then avoid this book at ALL costs and do not waste your cash on this piece of toilet paper pretending to be one of the books for formely excellant series."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"What was the author thinking?

At last it's finally over."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I LOVE the Anita Blake series and I have waited faithfully for new installments over the past few years but I have to say that Incubus Dreams fell far short of my expectations. If you can get through the first 90% of the sex book, there is a nice little vampire mystery at the end of it and a tantalizing hint of Anita trying on her new powers. I would get to one of those scenes and think, \\"Oh good, now the book is going to start and Anita's going to kick some you-know-what,\\" but it never really did. The other 90%... well, it's a lot of panting, sweating, claws and fangs. The only reason I read the whole thing is that I kept thinking we'd eventually work out of it. We did, for about the last 100 pages. Hardly a satisfying vampire hunter novel.Don't get me wrong, I think Laurell K. Hamilton can write a fantastic sex scene and, when done correctly, they really propel the plots of her books. Merry Gentry is a great example. But in Incubus Dreams the first 400 pages are nothing BUT sex with occasional breaks for air, food or a fight with Richard. Jean Claude's pronouncement at the end that Anita might need to start feeding the ardeur more often put me in complete despair.I have to believe there are ways to tell this story, including the sexual component, without having the whole book be nothing but sex. There's only so much development a character can do on her back... or her knees... or her stomach... you get the picture."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have now read all twelve of Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake novels. I love every single book in the series, except this last one. Anita and her creator couldn't possibly have a bigger fan than I. However, \\"Incubus Dreams\\" is unworthy of our protagonist, her preternatural cohorts, and Ms. Hamilton. It was a huge disappointment for me. After \\"Narcissus In Chains\\" and \\"Cerulean Sins,\\" which are among my favorite Anita novels, I had high expectations for \\"Incubus Dreams,\\" especially since the next book won't be out for another year, and this one has to tide me over. There is just no central plot here. Period! What we have are many sub-plots looking for an anchor. And the scattered mini-storylines aren't even connected.As the novel commences, Anita has achieved the level of master necromancer, enhanced her status as human servant to Jean-Claude, and acquired a vampire servant of her very own, Damian. She is Bolverk of the Thronnos Rokke Clan, Nimir-Ra, (with her own Nimira-Raj - Micah), of the Blooddrinkers Pard. She, Jean-Claude, the Vampire Master, and Werewolf Ulfric, Richard Zeeman, finally married their forces and have become a triumvirate, powerfully tied to one another. Anita merged her blood and her being with two extremely vital creatures, for whom blood lust and sex are major motivators. The two preternaturals took on a touch of Anita's humanity in this exchange, and she, in turn, has become more otherworldly - her sexuality included - especially the part inherited from Jean-Claude. He has within him elements of an incubus, and is able to feed off sexual energy. Anita now has this same capacity and need, called the \\"ardeur.\\" She has become more adept at controlling this drive, although she still needs to have a trusted man around to allow her to feed when the urge overcomes her. And the men who love her appear quite willing to share all of her charms with just about anybody. Now, Laurell Hamilton has caused me to suspend my belief in reality over and over again - but with this premise, she's over the top!! She gives new meaning to the concept \\"to share!!!\\"I want to emphasize that whatever enjoyment one gets from \\"Incubus Dreams\\" depends on a level of familiarity with Anita Blake and those beings she hangs-out with. These are not stand-alone books. Author Hamilton has developed her characters over a period of eleven-plus years, and one should read at least a few of her early works, beginning with \\"Guilty Pleasures,\\" before tackling this one.\\"Incubus Dreams'\\" main point, I think, is that the initial triumvirate of Anita, Jean-Claude and Richard finally merge \\"all the way\\" - yes, they take the final step, except for the fourth mark. Richard acquiesces to a menage. Thus their joint powers and abilities have increased manyfold, but none of them know just how much yet, nor how strong they have actually become individually. The three, unknowingly, also exchanged personality traits when they merged. Richard now sometimes sounds like Anita when he speaks - especially his new sarcasm. Anita and Richard have become more practical and laid-back, a gift from Jean-Claude, and our Master Vamp has become more human and sensitive - just a tad. Asher, who was a major character in the last novel is nowhere to be found here - and he comprised a significant part of a threesome with Anita and Jean-Claude. Has he been dispatched so easily after such an important role? OK. Just a question, now back to the major point of \\"Incubus,\\" (IMHO). Since most of the city's vampires are from Belle' Mort's line, they are beautiful and seductive - but by no means are they powerful warriors. If a strong master vampire, and contingent, challenge Jean-Claude as Master of St. Louis, they probably would have the forces to defeat him - thereby endangering the city's lycanthrope population and Anita, who are allies of Jean-Claude's. Therefore Jean-Claude needs to acquire warriors of his own, although this new more powerful merger of the triumvirate will assist him significantly.It take over 600 pages to make this point. On these pages, Anita participates in more threesomes then I care to enumerate. She forms another triumvirate, which I believes lessens the importance of her relationship with Richard and Jean-Claude, and/or Jean-Claude and Asher. Then she couples with guys I don't even know, and neither does she. I don't understand why these disposable characters have been added. I do not know what purpose they serve, other than to cater to Anita's \\"ardeur,\\" and she already has more than enough known men chomping at the bit, willing to help her out here. She also sleeps with vampires and lycanthropes to prevent them from dying. Give me a break!! There is just too much written about too many recently introduced folks I don't care about, and not enough info about those already developed in prior books. And so much physical intimacy, of the gratuitous kind, is boring and not at all sensual.There is also a serial murderer on the loose - a vampire is killing strippers and lap dancers - so what else is new? However, this sub-plot only takes up a few chapters, and is given such short shrift, that I wonder at its inclusion.I am rating the book 3 Stars - not less - because I could probably read pure trash if Anita, Richard, Jean-Claude, etc., were included in the cast. I am addicted. Also, Laurell Hamilton's classic dark humor is prevalent throughout and she is funnier than usual. I really liked the scenes with the above three characters, the initial triumvirate. I will now go through withdrawal waiting a year - or more for the continuation. If you're a fan of Anita Blake's and have kept up with the series, you will probably want to read this, although you may not enjoy it as much as the other novels. One can just as easily skip this one and not miss much.JANA"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book is one of two things, either a depressingling pathetic end to a great series, or a sagging disaster in the middle of one. After the foreshadowing in the last book, I had high hopes for this book, but it is nothing more than baddly written sex scenes. I can only hope that this book is a rushed attempt to keep the series going under publishing pressure, rather than something the author thought was a good continuation of the story."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am lost on this book for the fact it has me so frustrated!!! I'm frustrated with the direction of the book and the lack of likeability of these characters! Everyone is whining about this and that, plus they all seem so needy and want to argue all the time. BLAH! I want to read a book that takes me out of the BS of life by having a good storyline and read one that does not annoy me. I'm not even half way through the book and I want to move on to the next. I find myself skipping whole sections of it just to get through it so I don't miss anything before I start the next book.OK now I'm whining. ;-) I like the author and know it's not easy to continue a series this long but I really miss her old style of writing. However.....I will finish this series one way or another!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Sadly, Hamilton's worst book by far, and I'm a HUGE fan of the Anita Blake series.It's a big PIGF*&K.;If I didn't enjoy the earlier books so much, I would've never finished this. I wish I had listened to all the poor reviews. Hamilton really does \\"jump the shark\\" with this one.Every criticism/observation that previous reviewers have made is TRUE.It's needlessly LONG.The story lacks continuity. The book could've been cut by 3/4ths in fact and it would have been less infuriating.Anita Blake becomes the opposite of what she used to be and she is overwrought, overly annoying, and tortures the reader on the ponderousjourney.Even the sex is boring after too long.It's self-indulgent, and I could forgive that but LKH seems to be very defensive about this disaster she produced. I kept reading hoping to see flashes of the old LKH, but she was not to be found. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, IT DID!(When Nathaniel has to tell Anita to stop by at a drive-through burger joint on the way home, in order for her to remember to eat, you know you've hit rock bottom in creative writing.)In a nutshell:Anita screws everything and everybody, she doesn't know how to balance her life and feed herself or her desires. She thinks everything to death but then just spreads her legs at the drop of a hat. Even the pitiful excuse for a murder/mystery remains unresolved.It's almost as if LKH didn't write this at all."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I sometimes wonder when a series becomes popular if editors standards and the ability to tell an author, \\"No, I can't publish this because it is not an actual story.\\" disappears. I do not think I am alone when I say this series took a huge turn for the worse after \\"Obsidian Butterflies\\". Suddenly plot became an after thought and sex became a vehicle to add in a horde of characters I do not care about. I am happy that Anita has a crazy drama filled sex life but I do not want to read about that in lieu of a storyline."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"What's \\"neurotica\\", you ask? It's my name for a genre of fiction in which characters have lots and lots of pointless sex, and whine and kvetch the entire time they're doing it.Man, this book was PAINFUL. I slogged through it just hoping that someway, somehow, LKH would find a decent plot and run with it. But that never happened. I was left wading through hundreds of pages of tawdry, gruesome, unappealing sex acts, wherein Anita, once a badass, snarky, moral-yet-conflicted character I used to enjoy reading about, went from someone who had had one boyfriend in her entire life, to a woman who is compelled to do as many different men as she can in a 24-hour period. I lost count at 5.And yes, when I say \\"gruesome sex\\", that's precisely what I mean. Ick factor, goes up to 11.It's as if LKH started writing a mystery novel, but realized she just didn't have enough plot to meet her word count, so she used hundreds of pages of mindless, maudlin sex as filler...never bothering to weave it into the mystery plot. Ho hum.Plus, I kept thinking, what if the gender roles were reversed? Seriously. I'd be so deeply offended if all of the female characters were hot, sexy strippers or good-girl former prostitutes ala Pretty Woman, all of whom were salivating, and begging to be used, and literally nearly devoured, by a single, closed-off, man who hoarded them like squirrels hoard nuts for the winter, and forced them into typical roles--wife, mistress, casual fling, sex-kitten, etc. Even with the genders as they are, I'm not loving the way these characters have \\"developed\\". And I'm even less happy with the direction this series has taken.Usually, when a writer runs out of original ideas for a character in a series, or is no longer able to churn out storylines that will satisfy readers, it's time to end the series. Sure, all mystery series have their ups and downs. I stopped reading the alphabet mystery novels around the letter \\"O\\", because I thought the stories had gotten way, way too formulaic, even for genre fiction. But Anita Blake's stories have morphed from fun, action-packed, horror/mysteries with a spash of romance, into uninspired porn vignettes with a dash of bestiality and, oh yeah, a murder or two that Blake will solve almost as an afterthought.Sure, Anita Blake was never Sherlock Holmes, or even Nancy Drew, for that matter, but she used to have to work at solving crimes. Now that she's gotten so powerful that she can just magick the answers out of everyone, what's the point of even putting the mystery in there?Honestly, *Incubus Dreams* reads more like an adult, fan-written comic book series than a novel: ID is ENDLESS, meandering, with too many characters, too many unrealistic plot twists, and not enough narrative structure. And even though these novels take place in an alternate world where the metaphyscal rules are different from ours, there used to be an internal logic to Blake's world, which no longer exists. Not to mention the fact that LKH can't seem to remember how to spell some of the characters' names sometimes, let alone what their personalities used to be.Oh, and I'm so, so, so, so tired of the unending cliches and overused euphemisms here. Between the \\"I could tell he was happy to see me\\"s, the \\"so much meats\\", and the \\"if all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail\\"s, these books have more verbal tics than Rainman.On that note, in the age of Spellcheck and Grammarcheck, there is no excuse for not knowing where to place an apostrophe.And, seriously, the phrase is \\"between him and me\\" not \\"between he and I\\" or any such combination. Sheesh.Can you spot the pronoun error in the following sentence? \\"And, truthfully, he never did see much point in he, himself, getting flowers from anyone.\\" Ignoring for a sec the other structural problems with sentence, tell me, which pronoun comes after a preposition. If you can, could you please tell LKH or her editors. Please. PLEASE?I'll try one more book. But, frankly, it's more out of morbid curiosity than anything else."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Don't waste your time or your money.

I wish I had."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"My biggest complaint is that Ainta has been turned into a total slut and I am just sick of it. As Jean-Claud puts it, she sure has a hell of a lot of accidental sex.I didnt even finish this book. I just dont respect her as a character. I had no problem with sex being added to the series, nor to her dating more than one man but now its ridiculous, enough is just enough. Anita is now nothing more than a whore who whines and complains that she just cant help herself.I actually read reviews on the books ahead before deciding to totally abandon the series, and from what I have read it doesnt get any better. There are too many people all vying for a spot in Anita's bed, and worse they are all getting it.There isnt much suspense and dective work and stuff like that left and I just cant stand Anita anymore."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"There are porn directors out there that are saying \\" This book needs more plot and a little less sex\\". I do not know how I actually got through half of this book , but I did and it was one big sex scene. There was about a page and a half devoted to a mystery, but after that it is Anita and the \\"ardeur\\" all the way. I sent this book back to the library ( I have not spent money on an Anita Blake book since \\" Obsidian Butterfly\\") unfinished, which is something I rarely do. I did decide to check out \\" Danse Macabre\\", and it seems to be better. There is still way too much time on the stupid \\"ardeur\\", but wayyyy less than \\" Incubus Dreams\\". My advice to a reader is to skip \\" Incubus Dreams\\" and either go on to \\"Micah\\" or \\" Danse\\", because this book does nothing for any of the characters and does not add to the storyline whatsoever. Or, if you want to be really smart, check out a new author like Keri Arthur, Charlaine Harris or Kim Harrison. They do some really solid work in the supernatural/mystery/romance line."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm not sure what I expected when I began this book, but after a few hundred pages, I realized that it would have been especially helpful to begin with the first book in the Anita Blake series (Guilty Pleasures). It didn't take me long to sense that I must have missed any character development that had occurred in previous stories.In this particular novel, there is very little focus on pursuing the serial killer that has slain a number of strippers from local strip joints. Instead, the reader is drawn into many different ways to have sex with nearly every living and undead character in the book. While I found it a mildly entertaining read, there was very little plot to sustain the many forays into steamy, bloody, slimy, and sometimes confusing sexual encounters.I'll go back to the first book in the series, to see if Anita Blake truly is a detective -- rather than devloping as a complex character, she has simply devolved into a one-dimensional sexual predator in this particular story."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Thick with rich detailed characterization of many favorite cast members in the Anita Blake series. Answers a lot of building relationship questions between Anita and Damian and Nathan and moves them on to a closer and more intimate bonding. Revolves more around Anita's coming to grips with her Ardeur and personal relationships than fighting bad guys, but there is also the murder mystery de jure, which seems to be unsettled with the main big bad getting away, but follows an established theme from the earliest books with the loose end of escaping threats that may show up later in the series. A good solid read for anyone not put off by Anita's very sexually infused life. I'd recommend this book for new fans who like the current Anita Blake books, or older fans who enjoyed the newer books as well as the older ones."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm surprised at all the negative comments on this book. Anyone who has been reading this series surely realizes that after The Killing Dance the sex content skyrocketed. This book was another wonderful novel in my opinion. Alot of relationship issues are addressed finally and Anita begins to accept her otherworldliness. This book is a whopping 678 pages, but I wish it had been longer. All of her books are cliffhangers to a certain extent but this one is the worst. The crime she is investigating is still unresolved at the close of the novel which was very frustrating for me. Other than that though I found nothing to be wrong with this book and I highly reccommend it for fans of the series."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"At this point you begin to look forward to the next book!

The writing perhaps is lacking slightly but Anita seems to be resolving her problems and creating a good basis for the next book. It seems a little like an editted (though not very well) stream of consciousness as opposed to a well planned affair but all in all worth the money as her life seems to working and so in the next novel we have to expect something a bit more substantial in terms of story."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I feel that this series is going in the way that it should go. If you like one dimensional characters that have no spontineity then you really should not read LKH. In the past Anita has pushed aside her personal life basically saying she'll take care of it later. Well later has come. Not as much monster hunting as usual but you can't please everybody. Every book before this has been monsters center stage and love life last. This novel changed that and at least for one book made the love life center stage and monsters last. but the monsters were still there. Can't wait for the next one and also in the Merry Gentry series."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I psychotically LOVED this book. The Ardeur is truly its star, as it forces Anita to face some of her most pressing control issues.

But, it's not just that. There is a lot of just leading up to it or discussing it. I know that some people are offended and have been refering to this book as \\"porn\\", but you must keep in mind that Anita needs to feed the ardure. She has done something accidentally that now makes her need to feed more often.I'm glad to see that Nathanial is becoming a little more dominant than he was. It was also nice to see Richard show up and not be a total jerk throughout the entire book. I really would have liked to see a little more of my \\"favorite pretty vampire\\" Jean-Claude. I know he was in her head a lot, but I'm talking him and Anita and even Asher, face to face. I'm just a sucker for vampires and I guess I always will be.I wasn't entirely sure at the beginning of this book if I would be purchasing the next book, but after finishing it, I know that I will.

Yes there is allot of sex, but what adult does not have sex? What vampire novel does not have a hint of sex? It's about time we have a novel that goes in to the sex of the vampires and there slaves. I would like to see more writers write about the sexual acts of there charters with out having the shallow writing of the Pornographic novels. Sex is something most people say is not that important in life but I disagree in the US the divorce rate is getting higher and higher and what is the number one reason for divorce? Sexual Cheating, if sex is not important then why risk your marriage?I also like how we are starting to see the people change and a mix of there personalities. Anita was always a cold bitch. Fang face was always deviant. Then you always had the sulking fur face. Well it's nice to see Richard getting up and standing up for himself. Anita braking down. I would like to see more growth."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The morning of Sept. 28 I practically ran into my local book store and snatched this book from the waiting clerks hands. (I never buy books there anymore I always order them through amazon.com. But not one of these, I can't wait that long for snail mail to get to me.) The clerk was bewildered. Apparently I wasn't the first to have this reaction today; what was all the fuss about? I told her that this was the twelfth book in the series, we've been waiting a year for it, and not too damn patiently either.The clerk was curious. Perhaps she should see what all the fuss was about and read this book herself. I said no, not this one. I said if you want to know what this series is about then read another in the series, Obsidian Butterfly would be a good one. It stands mostly on it's own without that great a dependance on the others. I said if she liked that then read all the books and get to this one last because this particular book is a part of the whole series, a step along the way.Sadly, it's two days later now and, despite having my work to delay me, the book is over for another year. The waiting another whole year is always the hardest part. This book was worth the wait; this series is worth the wait.This book is a part of a serial. This particuar one is a part of every other one that has come before it. For those of us who have read them all it brought back wonderful memories, it took us further on our journey through this story and it was just great. It sets the stage for what will come next. For anyone who hasn't read them they will not appreciate just how wonderful this small part is. For anyone reading this and wondering should if they would like this series: please don't start with this one then come in here and bitch about the fact you just don't get it. Do you watch fifteen minutes of the middle of a movie, turn it off and say, I just don't get it, what's all the fuss about? Who were all those characters and what do they have to do with this story?It was great to be able to see so many different parts of the series brought together and the threads of the story continuing. I'm sure that all of us who feel as if we know these characters personally now feel glad to see them all grow a little, learn a little, gain a little. We'll wait again, and damned impatiently, for the next part of the story to unfold from Ms. Hamilton's extremely talented imagination. Then we'll run down to the bookstore and snatch the next book from the waiting clerk and it will all begin again."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I personally enjoyed this book. Yes, Anita does have an awful lot of sex, but it's really not that much of a surprise or that big a deal. She's been leading up to it in the previous two books. I'm actually glad that Anita's finally starting to get over the sex hang-ups. And while I admit that she's definitely gone from one extreme to another, it has added lots of spice to the story.Because of the extreme violence (which started out strong in Guilty Pleasures), it's not like you'd recommend this to your teenager to read anyway.While I approve of the increased sexual content, it would be nice if she could have recreational sex a little more often, without the adeur, the beast, or something else life-or-sanity threatening appearing (poor Nathanal!).I am looking forward to both Micah and Danse Macabre coming out and I hope she keeps it up.Those of you who have issues with the sexual content should think about reading Dean Koontz or someone similar. He writes strong female characters, there is almost always a supernatural thread and they never have sex (at least not the good guys and the bad guys usually don't either).P.S. If you dissaprove of the last three books, I would NOT recommend you reading the Meredeth Gentry series at all!!! Of course, I am looking forward to more of those too!!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Dispite a lot of negative reviews by other people, I read the book and enjoyed it. The cast in the book have grown from the first introduced characterizations to more complex and layered personalities. This is something rarely seen in an ongoing series, where a main character and crew usually stay \\"status quo\\" no matter what, like an old time tv show where the character is the same in every episode no matter what. Anita Blake changes as she gains more power and more experience with the highly sensual, and darkly sexual world of vampires, shapeshifters, and magic users. Yes, she becomes more sexual as well, and more sexually involved with multiple characters in the series. That may bother some people with narrow definitions of how a woman may behave sexually. This is not the type of story those who want \\"one true love\\" plotlines. I'd suggest going to the mainstream Romance section if that is what you want. Anita gets down and dirty when it comes to both fighting and killing and sex. She is not a squeaky clean heroine, but one covered in blood, sweat, tears, and the wetness of sex.This latest book actually gets in depth with Anita's personal relationships with the men closest to her, and how they are adjusting to the unsual situation of being involved with each other with one queen bee and several breathtakingly sexy and yet very individualized and powerful males. Because of the hunger of the Arduer, a new characteristic of Anita that makes her life more complicated with the NEED for sexual energy, even while it provides her with new powers, Anita now shares an ongoing and sexually intimate relationship with a number of people that are also important to her in different ways. In this new book, her own inhibitions are challenged and she is working conciously to adjust to not only her own strange needs, but to those of the people bound to her through love, passion, friendship and supernatural political alliance.I find the whole series very fascinating, and the newest books a breath of unique and very fresh air. There is literally nothing else like LKH's Anita Blake books. If you want traditional adventure, the bookstore shelves are stuffed with the normal fare. But for that startling leap into the sweetly forbidden realms of blood, sex, and supernatural that doesn't just push the bounderies, it breaks them down and makes it's own, the Anita Blake series is the one to read."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'll warn you right now -- the first 100 pages of this book would test the patience of a saint. Hamilton sets up Anita's most unpleasant characteristic -- her tendency to whine -- so she can resolve it and bring her to peace with herself. The mystery element isn't the point of this book, unlike the others. The point is resolving Anita's massive internal conflicts believably. Though it takes lots of magic.She's also in two triumverates, and she goes to bed with lots of men in this story. She seems to have picked up Merredith Gentry's tendency to keep a harem. But I thought the sex was very well done without being pornographic.Now, if you're one of those people that doesn't like sex in fantasy/SF, you're probably not going to like this book. But for those of us who genuinely love Anita and LKH, it's great watching Anita get her head together.Also, the writing is smooth and professional, particularly if you can get through those first amazingly angsty pages. (I strongly suspect those who gave the book those negative ratings didn't get through the first chunk, or just hated the sex. I probably would have bailed myself, but I just like Anita, so I stuck with it. I was glad I did.)So. If you like highly erotic storytelling and Anita, I think you'll like this book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I read some of the prior reviews and I am not sure what books they have been reading. The entire series is just one giant book with each individual book simply a chapter.Incubus Dreams is the logical next step or next chapter. Richard and Jean Claude are present and accounted for.... questions about Damien, Nathaniel and Jason are answered...(sort of) and we get clues about the future. It is almost as if the books are happening in real time.Incubus Dreams made sense and was throughly enjoyable. I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I thought this book was great. Relationships between different charcters and Anita were cemented, new and more intriguing characters were introduced, and Anita was less whiny (that I loved!). Yes there was sex, but it wasn't pointless. I never saw Anita books as mysteries so the absence of a long drawn out murder mystery did not bother me in the least. If you enjoy Anita Blake novels and want to know what's going on in Anita's world then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I enjoyed all of Incubus Dreams, some of the questions regarding the arduer, Anita's role as Nimir Raj, and the powers of the triumvarate are resolved. Other questions are raised about Anita's growing powers and the power of the now two triumvarates she is a part of. I've read a number of complaints regarding the plot of this book, but I do think it is consistent in that it does stand alone, Anita is involved in helping the police solve a murder case, and best of all - the mystery is resolved at the end. Of course, if you love this series you will want to buy & read book 13, but you don't have to buy it just to know what happened to someone from book 12.There are again many complaints about the sex in the book. I felt that LKH was showing just how powerful the arduer is and how much it can control Anita at this point. I also felt that in showing the sexuality, she was demonstrating how far Anita has come into her own acceptance of this metaphysical power. To me, the acts of sexuality were a part of the plot, using action to demonstrate character growth & changes in the nature of Anita's own powers with the creation of the new triumvarate & a continuing change in the manner of the first triumvarate with Richard & Jean-Claude. I also felt that Richard's character finally revealed some of the reasons for his self-hatred and also demonstrated the beginning of his own acceptance for what he is. I felt that the sex was a strong backplot to the book, meant to help resolve some issues & also demonstrating to readers the final, grudging acceptance of their own sexuality & desires. Last, but not least, the sex scenes were very good. The scene with Anita & Nathaniel in her office evoked a surreal quality, a deja vu moment for Anita in recognizing her own beast and what happens when it takes over. All in all, I would give the book a 8.5 out of 10 score.The only part I did not like, or felt was difficult to tie in to the rest of the book were: the attack from the Dragon & Damien's old master. Regarding the plot, I felt somewhat confused regarding the motives of Vittorio in killing the strippers. With the letter of his lover to Jean-Claude some of those motives were touched upon, but still not completely clear. I think these are minor issues compared to the high quality of the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Lots of sex. Lots of plot. Lots of fun to read if you have enjoyed the last few books of the series and don't have a problem with the developement of Anita's powers and personality becoming more intensely sexual. While there is not much mystery, there is a great deal of world building and focus on the supporting cast of the series, as well as more character growth for Anita in her personal relationships. This book is full of information, clearly setting up many upcoming storylines.Loads of sex, but that didn't bother me. I'm pretty happy to see Anita finally get past the hangups she has had before and finally begin to take pleasure in the necessity of feeding her Ardeur, and make the power it brings her into a useful tool instead of a cross to bear.I think I got a lot of entertainment and enjoyment for my money's worth.

Vampires who break the law can be killed as soon as a federal marshal, who is a vampire executioner, catches them. One of the most feared vampire executioners is Anita Blake, a necromancer whose powers just keep growing thanks to the triumverate she is part of. The other two members are St. Louis master vampire Jean-Claude and Richard the werewolf, who desperately wants to be human again.A group of vampires, one of them a master vamp sneaked into the city unnoticed; they are killing strippers so the Regional Preternatural Investigative Team of which Anita is a member is assigned the case. When Anita is not looking for the rogue master vampire, she somehow forges a new triumverate in which she is the master and the vampire and the shapeshifter add their powers to hers. Richard, Anita and Jean-Claude try again to make the triumverate work because they know the whole is greater than the individual parts.The heroine's life is obviously never boring as she jumps from one lover to another and one crime scene to the next one always knowing this could be her last leap. Anita Blake is one of the most original characters around and she remains as fresh as if this is her first appearance. INCUBUS DREAMS is highly erotic with plenty of sex scenes that add to the plot and the prime player as it enables the audience to see her growing power and its impact on her two lovers. This gender bender will appeal to romance, fantasy, and mystery and of course horror fans.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm not even halfway through, but I've been reading Anita Blake since book 1, and I have to say that LKH has done some great character development things in ID, and I'm somewhere near page 260. We now know more about Anita, Nathaniel, Damien, and Ronnie than we did in previous books, and I'm confident it's going somewhere... that's up to LKH's muse. I am really impressed with how much Anita has grown up. She really seems to have learned to choose her battles in this outing.Lots of people are distracted by sex, grammar, and spelling errors. Yeah. They're all there. Not much you can do about grammar and spelling errors these days unless you go OCD over the proofs after they come back from the compositor. No one's perfect (although as a book composition and page layout expert myself, I'm questioning the quality of the comp-house vendor chosen by the publisher). But I think it's a real leap from people who don't know how the business works, to lay all of this at the feet of the author.Sex wasn't so integral to the plot in the first 3-4 books or Obsidian Butterfly. But here's the thing... Like Merry Gentry, Anita's power and magic seem to be more and more sex/metaphysical-based instead of element/physical-based, and since the power and magic are changing Anita from the \\"it's all black & white, right & wrong human\\" to the \\"hey, here's another gray area human with supernatural powers\\", the sex is pretty integral to moving the plot along, metaphysically speaking, as it were. ;)If you don't like books about sex-based metaphysical magic, then you may want to consider finding a series you do like rather than bashing an author for following through with long-term plot and character development plans. Just a thought."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I've read both the Anita Blake series & the Merry Gentry series. I like the way Ms. Hamilton is developing the books; however I understand the frustration of some of the fans as to the high erotic content (but which I really liked). Primarily, I was expecting this book to carry the storyline started in Cerulian Sins (CS) further - the one about the vampire mother - and I wasn't clear if the Dragon is the same lady. It didn't seem like it. Also, the murders are generally more resolved, this one felt like it was just dropped to finish the book. The timeframe of the book is very short - just a couple of days - usually the books cover several weeks or months to give Anita a chance to solve more of the murder mystery.Also, while I think Anita is developing well and in line with her experiences - she could not feasibly maintain her strict morality and judgement given her relationships - I think that it was suprising how many lines were crossed within this one book. It felt like we were being drawn away from Richard in CS and given the option of alternate sides to the triumverate; yet he was made sympathetic again in this book. For me, I'd prefer more Jean-Claude and Asher.Finally, Damian seems to be a dropped story line - he's dominant in the opening of the book, and then he's almost completely absent except for a couple of references to Anita's need to feed more often. Given Anita's sensitivity, she should have paid him more attention than just a gift check. Hopefully Damian's role will be expanded in another book, he has been present in so many and is so tied to Anita that it seems like he should be given a chance to win our affections as well."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I love Laurell's work on this series, but I have to say the past two books (including this one) are moving away from what she originally started with the series. I have been a fan since Guilty Pleasures and have turned many friends on to reading the series, but I'm starting to become disappointed with the way Anita's character is going. Personally I think we need to have Edward make a long awaited appearance in the next book!! I still thought the book was great, but it's not a 5 star like I've given most of the other books in the series."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Actually, I enjoyed this book and have read it twice already and so it probably deserves more from me than 3 stars but I am also disappointed in the book. I was expecting to issues to arise regarding the Mother of All Darkness. The last book certainly had a lot of fore shaddowing that was basically ignored in this one.There is a lot of relationship resolution though. However, I am a bit surprised at the direction that Ronnie has taken in her life. As other reviewers have mentioned there is a lot of Nathaniel in this one (not one of my favorites).My biggest disappointment was the unsatified feeling that I was left with at the end of the book. There is a lot of fore shaddowing in this one, too. I ended the book feeling that the story hadn't been told yet since there were so many unresolved issues.Ms. Hamilton has created an intreguing world with fascinating, well developed characters. I have been a loyal fan since the publication of Guilty Pleasures. I just wish that this one had more story and less fore shaddowing. Eagerly awaiting the next one!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Here's the things with the Anita Blake books - they've changed. The focus of the early books was firmly on Anita's work as an animator and her police work. Any book after about about number 7 is different. Most of the reviews for those books are funerals for the fact that the later books are not the same. Seriously, people, build a bridge and get over it.The good stuff about this book: Anita and her estranged best friend Ronnie have an intense conversation about her lifestyle, which Ronnie does not approve of. It felt to me like Laurell K Hamilton was talking to the readers who have been obscenely verbose on hating the new directions she's taken Anita in. It was an interesting read and I don't disagree with Hamilton - this may not have been where she envisioned Anita ending up, but we're all here now and she's making the best of it. I enjoyed seeing Richard give up some of his sulking about being a wolf. Wicked Truth is a really fun set of vampire names. Anita's increased powers with the dead were an interesting sideline. Micah was developed more in this book and actually has more of a personality now which makes me like him more, him and his kitty-cat eyes. The scenes where Anita is working with the police were snappy, interesting and well researched. I liked most of the sex scenes too. They were a bit drawn out but on the whole, pretty solid (ha). I liked the emphasis on Anita's personal development and hearing how she's changed but I get that not everyone is into that.The not so good stuff: There was no resolution to the big \\"mystery\\" of this book. It just sort of died out, which was not good. There were spelling errors which were unforgivable (and not the author's fault). Hamilton needs to stop using the following phrases: \\"flat out does it for me\\" and \\"sweetie\\". I don't really like Nathaniel. Too many people are attracted to Anita who for all intents and purposes is an average looking woman. It just doesn't make sense that all these ridiculously beautiful men want her. One or two yeah, but ten or fifteen? No.My advice is to enjoy the books for what they are. If you only liked the first seven or eight, read them again or branch out into other authors. I'm enjoying the ride and will continue to read on."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dreams by Laurell K. Hamilton, Book 12 in the Anita Blake Series. Great plot and suspense. Anita's powers continue to grow stronger and new one's emerge, especially after forging a new triumvirate with Damien and Nathanial. Will Anita go the next step with gorgeous Nathanial? Will she finally become Jean Claude's biting post? Is Richard still going to be a part of her life now? Those were some on the questions I asked before I read this. Although some of my questions were answered, most of her open-ended relationships with the men in her life are still left with no finalization. I still enjoyed the book, but I am still left needing some concrete \\"something\\" with all of the men. This book is certainly not as good as the last eleven volumes, but I will continue to read this series, because I love the main character, and am interested to see how much she changes in the next."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"It did take much longer than expected to receive the book , bit t came in good condition."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm giving this a 5 because I checked it out from the library instead of buying it. This leaves me far more favorably disposed to the book.Here's what I'd like to see in the next Merry Gentry (oops I meant Anita Blake) novel:1. More threesomes - You heard me, this book didn't contain nearly enough threesomes for my taste. Also, I'd appreciate it if all of the additional threesomes were 2 guys + Anita (as I and I'm sure most readers can't get enough of that)2. More guys joining Anita's harem. Also, more of those guys who are hetero being written into the 2 guy/Anita threesomes - especially if it makes them super uncomfortable like it did Richard.3. Less zombie raising4. Less fighting/violence (other than the additional biting/chewing/sucking in 2 guy/Anita threesomes)5. Less detective/police stuff (this takes away from pages that could be better spent giving even more elaborate descriptions of the threesomes)6. More discussions about impending sex before the sex. Yes, I think most readers find a chapter or two of dialog about an impending sexual encounter beforehand to really add to the story. While Incubus Dreams did include the pre-sex chapters for the most part, there were a couple of threesomes that were just slipped in there without adequate discussion.6. Fewer female characters besides Anita and corpses. Live women/vampires shouldn't be included in this series anymore. Ditch Ronnie and the lady cop too. After all, they'll never make it into the threesomes (since Anita doesn't do women), so why bother us with them in the first place. Lose the female therapist - get a guy and get him in a 2 guy/Anita threesome. The same with Dr Lillian - a threesomable male would be far better."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"It is nice to see Anita doing some character developmentment instead of just killing and having sex constantly.Don't get me wrong, she does just as much of that in this book, but she does talk about why she's doing so more in this book. So, it's nice to see her confront her motivations and reasons for a change.I'm getting pretty disgusted by the indiscriminate sex. Am I the only one to find this kind of a turn off? But I will say that coming up with the \\"Ardeur\\" plot point has allowed LKH to keep this series going a lot longer than it would have ordinarily and more to to point SELL MORE BOOKS.Do all the men have to be gorgeous? And attracted to Anita? Couldn't one of them be ordinary looking and kind of turned off by his attraction to her? The men are used kind of like Ken Dolls in her novels.I can't stand Richard, but I never did like him, so....oh well. Whinyness is such a turnoff.Please, please, please, Laurell! Do fire your proofreader and editor! They did a horrible job on this novel. I can't believe it went all the way through printing with so many typos, misspellings, and grammatical mistakes. I can see it in a paperback, but a hardback should be worth the $25 +/- we have to pay for it.In spite of my self-disgust, I will probably continue to read these books. They ARE ADDICTIVE!!!Best read late at night in one continual sitting. Yes, you will be sick in the morning."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Two and a half stars. I'd thought Incubus Dreams would really, really bad after reading some reviews here. Surprisingly, when I finally got to read the book, it was a lot more readable than I'd been given to expect.I agree that there are some fairly major problems. There is a notable lack of follow-up from the previous book Cerulean Sins, as though Hamilton decided to drop the previous plotline and start something new all together. Asher doesn't even get an appearance here despite having been a major player in the past few books. Instead, Byron and Requiem are introduced as unnecessary new characters who do nothing to move the plot forwards and are basically just there as new sex partners. Not to mention their rather unbelievable \\"Britishness\\". Plus, the other leopards in the pard, except for Nathaniel, are still largely MIA ever since Cerulean Sins; even Micah, who has some screen time here, basically does nothing much.The ardeur is also getting very stale as means of fueling the plot. Before this, I was still pretty torn between deciding that the ardeur was an unusual plot device or wishing that it never happened. But when Anita is just having sex, about to have sex, thinking about sex, or talking about sex all the time except when she's out solving murders, then I really, really wish the ardeur had never happened. The entire ardeur thing could have been chopped out from this book and the plot still work perfectly. Yes, even erotica is boring if there's no decent story to hold it up.Some technical problems too: I think Hamilton is still trying to pack too much action into too short a time. I mean, how believable is it that the entire book spans only, what, 1 or 2 days? It gives a whole new meaning to the term 'fast-paced': Anita hardly has a chance to eat or even sleep during the entire novel, and she still manages to find the energy to go up against 6 or 7 killer vampires? Also, Hamilton seriously needs to improve her vocabulary. It has gotten to the point where I'm cringing every time she uses the word 'spill'.But if you can overlook all these, contrary to other reviews, there is a sense of something resembling a plot going on this book - Anita sort of resolves her problems with Richard, at least he's realised he's been a bit of a bastard (major understatement here!) and they've both finally decided to stop being childish and to try to get the triumvirate to work. Nathaniel's getting more independent, and we see more clearly what his role is in Anita's life. Ronnie and Anita get around to rebuilding their collapsing friendship. What I like most of all is that we get some new insights into Anita - the overpowering rage she has that she tells Richard about, her new qualms about her role as the Executioner, and how she is resolving her attitude towards vampires (are they really 'alive' or are they just 'cute dead guys'?). Zerbrowski, with whom Anita shares the latter thoughts, makes a very good new RPIT team leader - more humourous, more interesting, and less emotionally screwed up than Dolph.The murder investigation in Incubus Dreams, although sadly seeming more like a subplot than the main plot, and rather irritatingly left unfinished, brings back fond memories of the series' better days in the earlier novels when Anita was solving more crime and having less sex. I think Hamilton has a really good idea going on here - Malcolm and the Church's questionable practices, the loss of control over church vampires, and the potential for murder. If only Hamilton had dropped the tedious bits regarding the ardeur, she could have expanded more on this story arc. Hopefully she will remember to continue this arc in the next book.So, Hamilton should have dropped the most of the ardeur and sex scenes, and she definitely needed to have made the main plot of the murders far more substantial. But overall, Incubus Dreams still scrapes through as a fairly decent read to pass the time with, if treated as the lead-up to a more substantial story arc. I'm crossing my fingers that Hamilton really does intend Incubus Dreams to be a 'next link in the chain' and does not just drop the storythreads as she did with Cerulean Sins. I wouldn't buy Incubus Dreams even in paperback, but I'm willing to give her a chance and see if she will get around to finally picking up the loose bits of Cerulean Sins and Incubus Dreams in the next book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I, like many long time readers of this series, have looked forward eagerly to each installment. I must admit, Incubus Dreams was something of a disappointment. I wasn't drawn in to the story the way I've become accustomed to, the momentum was constantly interrupted and the ending seemed like more of an unwanted obligation that had to be got through than anything else. I was left feeling cheated.There is so much in this book that is left hanging: new ideas without resolution or obvious development beyond the initial introduction, old ideas that we've been waiting years to bear fruit and are still waiting (though with even less idea of where they might be headed)! I'm all for growth and change in a character but radical shifts from their previous behaviors and belief systems are more than a little jarring to say the least. Anita has changed so much throughout this series and, for the most part, those changes have made sense. In this book, she's taken giant leaps beyond herself and, having gotten to know her a little, this seems basically out of character.The endless rounds of sex got tedious but I was willing to work my way through them, assuming there would be a point somewhere and, thankfully, there generally was, though I could do w/less emphasis on the constant need to feed the ardeur and what that means for Anita's boundaries becoming ever less clearly defined. I don't know why I'm more comfortable with her becoming a colder and colder killer than with her becoming a more...adventuresome lover but there it is.I was sorry to see so little of Jean-Claude and nothing at all of Asher. It was odd that Anita should go through so much self realization and end up not really exploring/experiencing that with Jean-Claude or really any of her usual cast. The scene with Richard and Jean-Claude, as much as I have been longing for some sort of resolution in that relationship, was mostly difficult to get through and even worse to try to incorporate into the existing history between the three without feeling like some significant things had been left out/overlooked completely.All this said, I'm still giving this book 3 stars. I like that Anita is learning to accept herself as she is, I like that Nathanial is finally growing up, I like that Richard is becoming less of an ass, I'm really fascinated with the idea of a new triumverate and the implications of that, I like the idea of Wicked Truth because I feel like we're being set up for some pretty nifty things to come and I'm hoping the upcoming books will develop these ideas in the usual unexpected but enjoyable ways."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Just think of this book as a break from the main story line. Laurell gives you 2 stories. The titles could be: \\"Anita Does St.Lois\\" and \\"The One That Got Away\\".The first story is an erotic free for all,The second Anita really bombing a case. Hopefully,the next book \\"Danse Macabre\\" will resume the story."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"After reading all these reviews, I though it was a mistake... the book couldn't be THAT bad!well, I was wrong. What happened to the plot... suspense... the wonder? The only thing I was left wondering is who is left that Anita can have sex with?I felt the need to read it because I've every other book in the series, so I guess you can read it if you want to waste your time. But please don't spend money on it...EVERY situation Anita was in she had sex... maybe not \\"American\\" sex, but it's sex. And I don't mean ohhh sexy erotica sex, I mean I'm uncomfortable reading this sex. I think 95-98% of the situations Anita was in ended in some sort of sex/feeding. NOTHING could be simple... walking down the street was complicated. Having sex was complicated! Who, what, where, when, how, what does it mean... what does it means!?!? I wanted to rip pages out!!!Please, Ms. Hamilton, explain in detail what everyone is wearing down to their unseen underwear. Please, Ms. Hamilton, explain Anita's every thought about everything even though it all contradicts. Please, Ms. Hamilton, tell me about Anita and how her powers keep growing and growing. I feel she has to reach God status in maybe two more books. In the other books she gained one, maybe two, more \\"powers\\". I think every time she had sex she got a new power in the books. I can't even count that on two hands.The only thing I can give credit to, is that some of the characters know Anita is a dummy. So, obviously Hamilton knows Anita is a dummy (she could fix this...). These characters stand up to Anita and tell her to shut up and think like a normal person.It's just too bad she (Anita and Hamilton!) don't really listen."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I don't really have much to say that \\"Jonkadane\\" hasn't already said , but I just had to add my two cents worth . I agree with saidreviewer almost ver batem(?). I was slightly disappionted with this book . There was sooooo much sex and not enough supernatural stuff going on . It just seemed to me that Anita has become a sex machinethat can't get enough and that was most of the focus of this book . There were some good things about the book also , like the new tryumverate formed between Nathanial,Damien and Anita . There were also some new characters introduced that look like they could be very interesting . Laurell gave us a hint of info on Damien's \\"The One Who Made Me \\" . Some new developement with new Powers that Anita received as a result of her new tryumverate. So I can't say that I hated this book , that wouldn't be fair of me , although I was disappointed in all the sex . Don't get me wrong , the sex in the other books was hot , but all tings in moderation . With that being said I still look forward to the next installment and will purchase it as soon as it hits the shelves , the world that Laurell has created is a very fascinating one and I'm hooked !!! , but please less sex and more villanous(?) confrontations !!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm a fairly rabid fan of these books. The whole series has been an interesting exploration of the whole vampires/werewolves/witches are real plot device and Ms. Hamilton has pulled it off with panache. The characters are believeable and she has done a great job making believeable characters out fo the monsters who actually seem to think differently than we do. Beyond that, the books are generally filled with rich dialog and are well written in general.So, what happened?! For one thing, not much happens in the book save the development of the relationships between the various characters. Now, this is nothing to sneer at, since it's those characters that I have come to enjoy. However, the action-plot is an afterthought, taking up maybe a tenth of the book. So, it's a quieter book that will focus on the characters, an interlude if you will. That would be fine except the first half of the book focusses on the B-Team characters that I just don't care about. Damian, Nathaniel, etc? Don't care what happens to them. It's not until the half-way mark that Richard finally enters and then the book begins to work. I care about the primary triumverate, not the lesser characters. When it starts focussing on Jean-Claude and Richard, I became interested. I'd also like to see a spinoff series about Sgt Hudson and his SWAT team, please!My other problem is the sex. I like the sex in these books when it is fairly restrained. In this book, it just goes on and on and on and. . . In small doses, it works. When we get the 5th sequence in the book describing in exhaustive detail every last grope and stroke between some screwed-up sexual encounter, it gets boring.Honestly, I think this book is a placeholder. We have Jean Claude, Anita, and Richard finally beginning to come together. Their powers have increased significantly. We see the they have begun to recruit warriors instead of strippers to their ranks. We know that malcolm has unleashed a ticking timebomb of screwed-up vampires all over the country. It doesn't take a genius to see that something big is coming, something really big. This book strikes me as a somewhat clumsy attempt to get these characters ready for that encounter.I give the first half of the book 2 stars and the second half 4, so my average is 3."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"when I first thought of a female vampire hunter, I imagined a powerful, self assured woman and unfortunately Anita Blake is slowly turning into the village champion of mattress tag. Originally I was intrigued with the characters of Richard, Asher and Nathaniel. Now, again unfortunately, I'd like to slap Richard, send out a search party for Asher and send Nathaniel over to a better novel. For all of Richard's intelligence, he is an awfully common man who seems like a self absorbed jelly fish content to wallow in his own gloom and doom. Somewhat disappointed in this book, though I don't have really high expectations for this genre."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I own all the earlier LKH books, but after the disappointments of latest books, I decided to wait and just check this one out from the library. I'm glad I did. The first part of the books was actually pretty good and on track; I didn't see why so many people had problems with it, other than the spelling/grammar. Then it really bogged down, and I started to understand.***SPOILERS***Yeah, it was fine to have Anita and Ronnie patch up their differences, but the scene dragged on and on and ON. If that's the kind of boring relationship I had with a friend, I'd probably just let them go on their merry way. And what was with the sex with new characters? It just seemed like LKH needed some filler, so she decided to throw in gratuitous sex scenes. If she had just omitted the middle section of the book, it would have been a much better read. Just because a scene has sex in it doesn't mean it can't be boring. Several new characters were added with no apparent purpose. Wicked and Truth? Byron? What's the point? Unless they're going to play major roles in future books, they could have been left out. They were just more padding. It seems like LKH got paid by the pound for this one.Not as bad as many reviewers said, but I don't know that I'll even add a cheap used paperback version to my LKH collection."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I agree that this book wasn't on par with the previous Anita books, but it did have some good aspects: First, Richard has finally moved past whining baby and took a role in the story. In addition, Anita comes to terms with her relationship with the \\"monsters.\\" She was a little too self-righteous before (she didn't think vampires were alive, and most deserved to die, but she was in love with Jean-Claude?) Now she seems to see that a white picket fence, married with 2.5 kids doesn't have to be everyone's life, even hers. Plus she became more accepting of her friends' natures. And unlike other reviewers, I was glad Edward didn't resurface--he's a minor character and should stay that way. He is too one-dimensional to be more than that.That said, the book did have major issues. The typos were definitely a pain. The editor, not the author, should be shot! After Damian took center stage as part of a new triumverate, he did just \\"disappear\\" from the plot. I don't mind a lot of sex among the principles (Jean-Claude, Anita, Asher, Micah etc.). However, Anita having sex with people she just met was a stretch! Why did she have sex with Byron when Nathanial was right there? And Requiem!? Come on!I recommend buying the book if you are a completeist (I have them all in hardcover so...), or a die-hard fan. Otherwise, wait for the paperback. It IS worth reading as a bridge between Cerulean Sins and the next installment."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"There seems to be a lot of unhappiness about this book, and oddly I had expected myself to be among those most unhappy. Yet I am not. I am stunned by how good this book is, how meaty and important it is in terms of character development. Yes there is still too much sex, there is less mystery plot than there should be, and the technical and writing errors are appalling. But the book manages to tell a story that rises above it all and moves the series forward in way it hasn't moved since Burnt Offerings. This book also seems like thematically the next in the series after Blue Moon - if we hadn't wandered into personal problem hell.Given the poor direction of the last five books, and what I saw as Anita's inability to deal with her issues, while wallowing in them; combined with her refusal to open herself up emotionally, not only to the important characters in her life, but more critically to the readers. I had no hope that this book would rise above the level of a hard, violent, pointless sexfest aimed at worshipping in the church of Anita of St. Denial. And lets face it LKH isn't good enough at plot, description, continuity and the mechanics of writing to tell a good story without the strength of her skill with characters. Anita began to really close down in OB. Because of the first person narrative none of the other characters could really be on display without her. We readers had been robbed not only of Anita and her gang, but of the new characters, and even the villains and the walk-ons. Everyone after Blue Moon is just blurry to me. Sex had been added to distract us, but frankly it lacked any emotional grounding, any tension or excitement. It was all insert Tab A into Slot B, bumping and grinding with strangers. Well, Hell has finally frozen over because Anita has made major leaps and bounds in dealing with her issues and accepting who she is. Anita is finally growing up.In many ways this book was much more connected to the earlier books, perhaps The Killing Dance with its emotional sharing under the Circus is the closest, than to the most recent books even though superficially it seemed to be yet another (over)sexually themed book. She started right in the first chapter and through-out the whole book to have intimate, searing, emotional discussions with many of the important people in her life: Micah, Jason, Nathanial, Marianne, Ronnie, JC, Richard, Damian, and she listened to what they had to say, and she dealt with her issues honestly for once. Anita didn't hide, deny, project or use anger as a cover. LKH didn't pull the alarm bells to send her off to an emergency to save her from having to deal. Anita the judgmental hypocrite did not survive this book.Another big theme of this book was acceptance of who you are and not hiding or lying about it, also not imposing your views on those you love. She stopped trying to make them fit a mold they had no say in constructing or adopting. Anita came clean about her enjoyment of sex, about her darker desires, about her many men, and about her guilt and shame that she wasn't normal. But rather than pine for what isn't and will never be, she began to learn to appreciate what she had. She began to use her strengths rather than fight them, or deny them. So rather than engage in macho stupidity that wouldn't work and try to beat the confession out of a vampire suspect, she took a walk inside his head, using touch and her ability to borrow the powers of others. Yes she did it in public and in front of the cops, so perhaps it looked like kinky sex but it was business, how she does business now. Deal. In terms she used throughout the book: she has stopped trying to use every event as a hammer to shape her life into the specific type of nail that society wants it to be.She stepped out of her role as lone savior and protector and began to give credit to those in her life who also made it all work. She started to make a home for herself and her crew, not merely a safehouse from the bad guys or a place to crash. She finally accepted Nathanial for all of who and what he is, and she started to think about his needs as well as her own. She accepted her discomfort and realized that compromise and negotiation are the basis for an adult relationship - not holding onto an image of sanitized perfection. She has used perfect images in the past to deny the good that she has since it will never measure up, and she also used the images to bludgeon her less than perfect partners with. She finally realized that those who think they know absolutely right from wrong and how everyone should react in every situation are only fooling themselves, often at the expense of those who love them. She repeatedly asked for and accepted the help of her crew and she didn't hold it against them afterwards. Anita the self-centered, whiny lone superhero, teflon princess and user did not survive this book.There were so many other good things in this book: she and Ronnie started talking again, she went back to work, she may be able to raise Zombies in the future without killing animals, she did several stints of police work, she got to kill bad guys- and she started to feel bad afterwards, she let her lovers comfort her emotionally. She shared and swapped power with her tri(s) and did I mention she asked for help. She and Richard and JC talked and worked out a relationship. The sex scene with them, with the emotional vulnerability of the sharing between Richard and JC is alone, worth the price of the book. She got control of the Ardeur. She and the big 3 are sharing each other's personality traits - which is working to balance out their personality problems. JC got more powerful. JC gets to sleep with Asher, and maul willing women for food (power or blood). We met 3 new vamps who have come to town (I want more Wicked Truth), and met long distance, a couple more council members. The humor was back. I actually laughed out loud and I haven't done that in ages. JC is back in velvet, lace and leather - gone is the horrible vinyl and cheap see-through shirts. And that is just part of the wild ride. There is something here for just about everyone if you read it with an open mind.Yes there is still too much sex, and it takes too long, and it happens too often. I am so sick of her acting like each event is the best of her life, of the lengthy description of how it feels, of how rough she wants it, of how large each man is, and of hearing about everyone involved screaming. If all this were true they would be mute, and bowlegged for weeks. I dislike the second tri and the increase yet again of her powers, though some of that is explained as borrowing from the tri.Did anyone else wonder after the sex of the tri if they may also have taken the 4th mark? At the end of the chapter Anita says she and Richard and JC are bound and they didn't need to \`bleed the vampire'. That is a description of the 4th mark, yet nothing else is said for the rest of the book. So are they immortal, and who is in charge, or has their magic found a way around the rules again ?Yes she uses the same words over and over, and there are places where words and letters are missing, or out of order, or extra added and you can't really tell what she is trying to say. There is also a place where she uses a scene from an older book - verbatim. The entire scene and all the old words are just pasted into the text. On top of that there are spelling, grammar and word choice errors. There are also a few new YABBIs. Some of this is her publisher's fault, but some of it is hers as well. It seems to me to be the height of arrogance from both parties to put something this poor out as a professional product and charge hardcover prices. Whether she needs a new editor, a new typesetter, or to turn her stuff in sooner and in better condition I don't know, but LKH needs to take an active part in solving it. Because binding it and putting a fancy cover on it are just putting lipstick on a pig.With all the story problems and the ongoing technical curse, I am still heartbroken the book ended, I loved the longer length. I can't even think about waiting a whole year for #13. I don't think all these positive changes are going to make Anita perfect or problem free, but I think in the next book we will actually be looking at a story that is not centered around the relationships and the personal problems of the main characters. There are so many hooks for non-personal stories: Edward and Olaf are still out there, The Vampire Church has screwed up in operations and recruitment and Malcolm is coming across more like Willy or some cheap tele-evangelist. The serial killer is still loose and Federal Marshall Blake may need to take another road trip. She is still having problems with Dolph and the cops. She has congressional hearings hanging over her head, and someone from her past is going to impact her life and s/he still unidentified and out there. The wolves are starting to ease back into the monster community, and Anita has become the Lupa again. The council vampires are sniffing around and testing them. The options are endless and now Anita is in a good position to pursue them...I can't wait."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"i started this series with circus of the dammed and have been hooked every sence, untill now. I love the charaters and will continue to read the series, with reservations. I'm 48 and i let my teenage children read the series becuse their was logic in the violence or the sex until incubus dreams. after i got over the first of my disppointment and anger, i thought this must have been ghostwritten. the charaters are all blured the sex for the most part pointless and she wasn't able to solve a crime this time. yet the biggest shock was the turn her relationship with jean claud. what was that, was it a love confession, between equals ? I don't think so,he's been mastered, and thats just wrong. what happen to all the plot lines left from cerulean sin? my favorite book is blue moon, and cerulean sins. not this one. I would warn people not to read this one, just wait for the next one"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am a big fan of Laurell Hamilton. I have read all of the Anita Blake novels and found them all page turners except this one. It seems to me she got Anita mixed up with her other character Merideth Gentry who is trying to get pregnant. I can understand Meredeth's preoccupation to couple with the guys. Her life and kingdom depend on it. Anita has always impressed me as a tough woman who was a protector of the innocent first and plaything of the undead and lycanthrope second. In this book the murder mystery barely made it into the story for all the triumverate bonding going on. Between her own bloodletting and other body fluids flowing it is amazing she was still alive, let alone able to function and save the day (or night as the case may be)."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Okay, I'm into the Vampire books. So I thought to myself; I will try Laurell K. Hamilton - give her a whirl and see what Anita Blake is all about! Well let me say; I'm half way through this particular book and it's KILLING ME! I'm not even sure if I can finish it; this book is THAT bad! Basically I guess the book is about the following: 1. over analyzing your feelings 2. kinky/porn sex 3. talking about kinky/porn sex with friends or girlfriends 4. talking, talking, talking, talking about the Aurder but not really telling anyone what it is 5. having sex anywhere when the mood strikes you and not minding that several others are either in the room, participating with you or are just watching you have sex with one or more people. Anita needs to feed the aurder, well what is the AURDER? Maybe I need to start this series from the beginning, but like I said; I'm halfway through this book and I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT'S GOING ON! I will finish the read; but it's doubtfull that I will purchase any more of this series. A good author would be able to bring a reader in on the 12th book as well as the 1st book if the circumstances and events were explained; however this book doesn't do that. I give this book 1 star because over 600 pages is a lot of work. Try Christine Feehan - excellent Vampire Series, it's called her Dark Series, you can find a complete list of her books on her website."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Once upon a time, the Anita Blake:Vampire Hunter series was an uber-cool mix of paranormal mystery, horror, action, and supernatural crime drama. The heroine was strong, capable, snarky, and she kicked a lot of butt. About 4 books into the series, the author added a dash of romance into the mix, too, which was fine by me. (Romantic and personal entanglements tend to \\"humanize\\" characters for me -- make them feel more \\"real.\\") In any event, I loved the characters, loved the books, and gladly signed up for the thrill ride that was the AB:VH series.Two books ago, the author decided to introduce and inflict a condition known as the \\"ardeur\\" upon Anita (a poorly-conceived, contrived plot device if I ever saw one), which forces the heroine to have sex or sexual contact every few hours. I thought the concept was ridiculous, and as a woman, I found it mildly offensive (since it often strips away Anita's dignity along with her choices of who -- or what -- she has sex with). But, . . . I tried to roll with the punches as the author arbitrarily upped the sex quotient. I even liked Cerulean Sins to an extent (vampire politics always entertains me), and I was eagerly anticipating ID's release.But Incubus Dreams, . . .ugh. It was about 70% sex, 20% angst, and only 10% plot. The entire \\"mystery\\" of the novel was summed up in a kiss-off letter written by one of the bad guys, who had skipped town and gotten away. I slogged through 658 pages of whining and meaningless sex to have the entire mystery spelled out in a 1-page letter?!? I just don't get that.It's clear to me now that the author has decided to shelve the action/mystery aspects of her work and try her hand at erotica. It's also very clear that she's still \\"practicing.\\" The sex in ID was some of the most repetitive, mechanical, talky, often icky, and just plain poorly written sex I've ever read.Now, I have ZERO interest in telling the author what to write or where to take her characters, but certainly, when an author CHOOSES to write a continuing series, there ARE certain . . . expectations. Like maybe -- for instance -- the genre, tone, and style of the books shouldn't change quite so drastically? I have NEVER read a series before where one genre was supplanted by another, and where the characters had to be twisted completely out of shape in order to accomplish the task. I've got to mention here that some weird reverse sexism has been going on in the past few books, but it all comes to annoying fruition in ID. Almost all of the formerly strong, independent male characters have either turned into or been replaced by simpering, needy messes that need Anita to save them, reassure them, or have sex with them -- usually a combination of all 3. I don't know what agenda the author is trying to push here, other than the obvious: Anita is bigger, badder, and better than everybody. (I am woman. Hear me whine, scream, and beat every thought to death.) But honestly, all LKH has accomplished is to take some great characters and turn them into one-dimensional parodies of their former selves.All in all, Incubus Dreams was a huge disappointment. The central mystery plot was quickly forgotten and wasn't strong enough (as it was written) to carry the book. The sex scenes were long-winded, tedious, and far too numerous. There were way too many continuity errors, character inconsistencies, and inexplicable new powers thrown in for the hell of it. The book was also highly unfocused and disjointed; it felt like a bunch of random scenes just slapped together. Plus, as many others have stated, the overwhelming amount of spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and repeat words and phrases was downright laughable. ANY professional writer should be embarrassed at putting out such a shoddy piece of work. The book honestly looked like it hadn't been edited at all.But the greatest crime of all was that the book was boring. With little in the way of plot to clutter the landscape, characters either meandered about complaining and re-hashing the same problems they've been whining about for several books now, or they had screaming, writhing, back-breaking sex (during which, something was inevitably \\"spilled\\"). By about page 350 or so, I simply wanted it all to end.I NEVER thought that an Anita Blake book would bore me. I NEVER thought that it would take me more than 2 weeks to force myself to finish one. For me, ID will probably be the death knell for a once beloved series -- and that just makes me sad."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The 12th book of the series has 81 chapters. Count 'em. Six to eight contain some fairly interesting action.Another 15 to 20 chapters amount to an encyclopedia of bondage, domination, and S&M.; We're used to the idea, by now, that Anita must have sex-play every few hours or somebody dies. We miss the good old days (three or four books ago), but feeding the \\"ardeur\\" is de rigeur, now. It gets annoying, but that's not the problem!60 chapters of CHATTER are the problem.Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. Girl talk. Relationship talk, usually about who, why, and how Anita must \\"do\\" next and why she shouldn't feel guilty. It's girl talk between Anita and her boy-friends, mind you, not Anita talking to other girls. She's not into girls, darn it! The boys are prettier than she is, so maybe they count as girls, somehow. (But not with me.)LKH's writing is still competent for the most part, but the dialogue? Yikes!! Every other page, she resorts to transparent prompting, such as \\"What do you mean?\\" or \\"Define intimate\\" when it's already obvious. We must hear every detail; we can't rely on what we already know about BDSM, Anita, the boyfriends, or anything else. Discussing trivia goes on for 3-4 CHAPTERS, and it's often the same trivia as ten chapters ago. Or twenty.MY ADVICE: Read one sentence per page until you find some action. Read that chapter, then go back to one sentence per page. It will save a lot of time and maybe your mind, as well.Sadly, I had no one to give me advice like that."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. I, too, loved the previous Anita Blake books, but found Incubus Dreams extemely boring and disappointing. The mystery part of the book was barely touched on but pages and pages of sex with almost anyone, in any circumstances, got boring very fast. I do hope that Laurel Hamilton gets back from her sexual fantasies and gets better plots."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have read every book in this series but the last several have been a struggle which is getting harder to deal with.What started off as a wonderful mix of gothic horror, pulp detective, bodice ripping romance, and humor(not an easy gumbo to hold together)has become a porn riddled series with long boring, Oprah/Dr. Phil passages There is just enough horror to keep me interested but even that is failing.Like so many other reviewers I feel there is simply too much sex involved. The first two hundred pages of this installment could have easily been cut since they did virtually nothing to advance the series. On top of that there was only a page, if that, alluding to what is suppose to be the plot, a supernatural serial killer.My strong suggestions, as an original fan;Cut the sex which is getting not only boring but is devaluing the entire series and concept.Cut the cast way back. There are just too many characters.Strengthen the horror aspect. Anita is supposed to be a vampire hunter, not monster whore,in both senses of the word. Play up here animator talents. They have been all but purged.Bring back the humor. It is sorely missing.At this time I have no intention of buying another copy of the series. I only bought a copy of this title as it is a signed first edition. The copy I read actually came from the library (which probably would not have carried it if they knew the content)"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I normally gobble up all the Anita Blake books because (up until now) they've been a really good balance of suspense, sex and drama. This is a massive book, and I settled down to wallow in it but soon got bored. The plot holes are massive, and the main mystery in the book was unresolved. When the sex scenes take up 75% of the story, it leaves you feeling unsatisfied and uninterested. At least the phrase 'bench press a car' took a holiday this time (whew! it was rather overdone previously) but all the other cliches were there. They were the only thing that reminded me we WERE actually following Anita's story, and not some weird Viagara-induced dream. I agree with all the other reader reviews, and hope that Laurell reads them and takes on board the feeling that we have that she 'phoned it in'. I hope the next book returns to action and plot, and doesn't escalate further into monotonous, very repetitive sex. Btw, apart from being referred to in the third person, Asher doesn't appear, and Jason only makes a cameo appearance. As a read goes, it's okay, but nothing like the usual extremely high standard of Laurell's work."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have to agree with my esteemed peers below. I especially agree with the idea of deepsixing Richard and sending Anita to training. This book would have been half as long (it is 658 pages) if the unnecessary sex was cut out. Ms. Hamilton seems to be searching for ways for Anita to have sex with new and different people. I still enjoyed the mystery and Anita's ascerbic wit, but the sex was excessive."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Well... It was long.And I appreciated that. Really. Because I like this world so I wanted a well rounded feel. So that Ronnie was back (a little) was nice. That Richard seemed to be dealing more was nice. That Anita was not as judgemental and seemed to be growing up and becoming an adult was nice. Change is good.There are so many characters at this point that I really can't care about all of them. Maybe, as the reader - from Anita's POV, I'm not supposed to though. More edittig could have gone into this, however. At points there was a lot of repeat writing, which I guess can be excused because it's in Anita's head but... lord. And EVERY guy was just SO impressed by her. She was just so great in bed. Good for her, but she must not be somebody's type.Oh well. Still liked visitting the world. Still miss Edward. Still think her harem of men should be trimmed down just a bit."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The stories in Laurell Hamilton's first Anita Blake books were incredibly interesting and captivated me with humor, intelligence, creativity and action. However, since creating the subject of \\"ardeur\\", the only action Ms. Hamilton seems to be able to come up with for her heroine, Anita Blake, happens between the sheets. Instead of chasing unusual monsters and saving people from fates worse than death, we are \\"treated\\" to intense sexual exploits every other page. Come on, Laurell, Anita used to be a lot more interesting when she was not constantly horizontal. I have read all of the Anita Blake books and sincerely wish I had not read this last book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I've been a fan of Laurell K. Hamilton since I first picked up Guilty Pleasures over ten years ago. But with her newest novel I have to say she's lost me as a reader. Over the last few books Mrs. Hamilton has focused more on sex and less on plot. Her latest book Incubus Dreams is now 95% sex, and 5% plot. Anita is now sleeping with 6 people on a regular basis, and a couple more on a not so regular basis. I don't mind sex in the books that I read, but if I wanted to read a book that is all sex I'd of picked up a book out of the erotica section. This book is supposed to be about a vampire serial killer. That plot line is barely touched on in this book at all, and it's conclusion is not particularly satisfying. Suffice to say, If I decide to read her next book I'll take it out of the library first.Save your money."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book is terribly flawed and DISTURBING. Starting with the author and the editors lack of editing and finishing with the content. All of which is to say the least, disgusting and infuriating for what it costs to buy this book. DON'T.To start, Incubus Dreams is loaded with traditional stereotyping, bigotry, across the board put downs of many religions, counterculture lingo and stereotypes, as well as the age old Euro versus American stereotype views about sex.It is OVERLOADED with gender bending, weeping men, role reversal, sexism, chauvenism, and is blatantly mysoginistic. All cheerfully preached or exampled by the female protagonist, Anita, who is to say the least, a shrew.Written in a style that is annoying and frustratingly repetitive and is some of the purplest prose I've read in 20 years. It reads likes the author was paid by the word and not for the book itself.To add injury to insult the book is PACKED start to finish with some of the worst attempts at erotica there are. The sex scenes are not erotic or even remotely romantic, but they are disturbing and just plain nasty. Nasty as in yuck and stomach rebelling yuck. As are Anita's justifications for going so far, which sound closer to a serial rapist than a woman in love. Just because it speaks common doesn't mean it's not a beast and the female ejaculating business with its subsequent aftermath in the storytelling and sex scenes leave alot to be desired. No and all pun intended.There's no character growth, and unless they're shagging Anita, the rest of the cast barely gets a passing mention. Characters featured in previous books do not appear. Recurring favorites are unrecognizable and go against their prior development. NONE of the characters in this book are likable or enjoyable to read about. ALL of the cast, including Anita have become static, predictable, and boring as heck.If you've never read an ABVH book, don't start with this one. It is confusing and all over the map, poorly edited and amateur in every way. If you'd like to read about Anita Blake Vampire Hunter, start with Guilty Pleasures and stop at Blue Moon. After that it's a half arsed, muddled soap opera and not worth the bother."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Incubus Dream finally got me to a point where the sex is starting to aggravate me in this series. I think Hamilton can get her point across about the ardeur without having the whole book be nothing but about sex. What I missed most in this book was the good police mystery part. Don't get me wrong, there was a mystery but it want barely there as if the sex stuff had been written and she found a way to write in an actual case to work on. It just took away from the other stuff I love so much about Anita. I enjoyed her finally getting it on with Nathaniel because her moral choices just don't make much sense, which the character admits herself, and Anita really does love Nathaniel. It's just frustrating when the story didn't seem to have a point a lot of the time except for all of Anita's new powers which revolve around sex. Most people have talked bad about the way the character was going before now but it was really, really evident in this book. I'm going to continue with the series but only because the past eleven titles have been so great."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"WOW! I only recently got into the Anita books, say about two weeks. I bought all of the books in the series and blew threw them, even this one. From the beginning of the series Hamilton has built up to the sex scenes up to the point that sex was all this book was about; over 600 pages of sex. I'm not a prude in any sense of the word, but it was just a bit much. All the other books had a big bad that she struggled against throughout the entire book. This book was just one sex scene after the other, and if she wasn't doing it she was thinking about it or talking about it or about to do it. It's almost as if Hamilton is stuggling for a plot and she just couldn't do it in this book. Hopefully, Hamilton can pull herself out of the sated after sex haze before she looses readers."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I guess my feelings about \\"Incubus Dreams\\" can be summed up with one phrase: not bad, but not terribly good either. It's actually kind of sad, considering that the series used to be *so* good and has now become merely mainstream erotica. Anita has turned from a powerful, kick-ass character to one who is whiny, shrill, and eye-roll inducing. And, well, to be honest, I think every character got on my last nerve during reading this--Micah, especially. Does anyone think he and Anita have any actual chemistry? Because they kind of come off with all the combined sex appeal of curdled milk.The second trio was another low--ummm, what about the first one which was infinitely more interesting and actually relevant to the series? What this AB series needs, if it's going to continue with any readership at all is for Anita to get control of the ardeur (as, relegate it to the background), shed the misc. boyfriends and, once again, get a spine and a clue."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I preordered this book months ago because I love the Anita Blake story line and Laurell K. Hamilton as an author. However, it took forever to read this book, because it was hard to get into and hard to follow. I found that this book jumps around way too much with a whole lot of sex thrown in between what is actually suppose to be going on. The vampire serial murders would have been more interesting if there was more time spent on that story instead of rushing it at the end, and the serial killers getting a way.I was hoping to see more of Asher and Edward in this book since there were strong characters in a few of the other books, but they were barely mentioned in this book like it was an after thought. I would have also liked to see more of the \\"old\\" Anita, doing her Zombie raisings and giving Jean Claude a hard time, but there was only 1 raising in this book, and Jean Claude has become way to sweet to be a Master Vampire. I was also disappointed that Richard still has not developed a back bone and grown up to embrace his beast, I think he was more whimpy in this book than ever before.All in all, I did not enjoy this book as much as the others, and sure wish I would have waited for it in paperback. I hope that Ms. Hamilton takes more time with the next Anita Blake novel, and realizes there is more to Anita then just sleeping with so many characters throughout the book. I also hope that she does not forget about the old characters as she adds new ones to Anita Blakes life.I did notice that there were a lot of misspelled words throughout the book as well as a few words out of place."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Man, that was $16 down the drain. I really liked this series before, but this book, well, it was about NOTHING. Another reviewer has already posted the sexual body count, but LKH barely even addresses the actual dead bodies - you know, the murder victims? What happened to - Anita, champion of those helpless against supernatural evil? Now its all - Anita, product of sensitivity therapy and nymphomania.I just don't know if I will buy the next one. She might have killed it for me. Hopefully she won't mess up her Meredith Gentry series like she did this one."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have really enjoyed this series of books - up to this point. I am really dissappointed in Ms. Hamilton's repetitive use of ideas. I mean we went from a vampire slayer with high morals and intense romantic relationships to having sex with 5 or 6 different guys in one book! And she can't just have sex with one guy, it has to be two at the same time. And why is it everytime Anita shows up to a crime scene there is someone there that has some sort of beef with her being there. Ms. Hamilton also gets really wordy in this book. She uses analogies until they are dead, and all in the same chapter. There are some good storylines here hidden in all of this stuff. Anita developing new powers is pretty cool. The book should focus more on that than feeding the \\"ardeur\\". How many times do we read about the ardeur? It starts to get really old. And all of the sex she is continuously having with all of these people, pretty old too."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I have been a big fan of the Anita Blake books since I read the first one a few years ago. I was hooked from the first chapter and have devoured every other book since... until now.In the begining the Anita Blake books were solid supernatural crime thrillers with a smattering of erotica to spice it up. The formula worked wonderfully. Sure sometimes you wanted the sexy stuff to go a bit further, but overall it just flowed so well.Lately however the books have been shifting.. more sex, less supernatural. With Incubus Dreams the pendulum has swung way way to far to the sex side. I mean, I am a guy so I like reading erotica (heck I openly admit I have bought books just for the steamy stuff), but with this book I found myself wanting to skip through whole chapters to get back to the supernatural. And it isn't like it is a chapter here or a chapter there. I would read a chapter with nothing but sex in it, but I would be thinking ok next chapter will move the story along.. but nope, the next chapter was more of the same. Overall it was like 100 pages of sex for every 5 pages of story!Now I can see that Laurell Hamilton has tried to make the sex a part of the story and the development of the character... but really this was too much.So in summary I am afraid I must say this book was disappointing. I really enjoyed the parts not dominated by the sex, but these were too infrequent to carry the whole book."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"When I first started Incubus Dreams, the details about Larry and Tammy's wedding were pretty cool. Add in Micah, the Nimir-Raj, Nathaniel and Jason, and well, very cool. But after the parking lot scene in which Louie tells the gang he and Ronnie are on the rocks, things seem to go down hill from there. Between Damian going bezerk, becoming a day walker perhaps, and watching Anita flog Nathaniel onstage then have sex with Jean Claude in his office, I seem to have lost the whole point to this newest book. A second Triumvirate is formed but there's no real reason given as to why it was formed. Too many new characters and not enough of the older, more developed characters, were found in here as well.I sincerely hope the next AB:VH book will return my confidence in Ms. Hamilton's ability to make this series worth the money I spend on the books."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I'm probably one of the few men who love*d* LKH and her books.

Seriously. I thought at any moment that Anita would just drop anything and start having sex with random people - Oh, wait! She DID that!I can't believe LKH could publish this book and walk out into the light of day after doing so.

Is there a lot of sex in Incubus Dreams? Yes. Is there a lot of angst and a lot of talking? Yes. But the plot (what there is of it) still moves along, and Anita Blake is still an interesting character; and although I've long ago stopped reading these books for the mystery (which is practically nonexistant) I will continue to buy books in this series when they come out just to see what Anita is up to.Laurell K Hamilton is a good writer, but she needs to focus more on the mystery elements rather than who Anita is going to sleep with next.If you want good supernatural mysteries without the sex try the Tanya Huff Keeper series, the Jim Butcher books, or the Sookie Stackhouse series by Charlaine Harris. Especially Charlaine Harris as the Sookie Stackhouse books are almost like what the Laurell K Hamilton books used to be before they turned into little more than erotica."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Does anyone else think that this ardeur is a stupid, contrived excuse to get AB to get laid with all those monsters? Of course you do, hence all of the negative reviews. It is poorly written and a cheap excuse to turn AB into a Wonderslut. Getting laid seems to be the forefront of the story; she even saves lives by having sex. Shyeah. Micah shares a painful part of his past? She's all shocked and sympathetic but really she just wants to get laid. There's a vampire killing strippers? She wants to find the vamp but not before she gets laid. She wants to straighten out her life and relationships with her men, but there are more pressing matters in life for her, like getting laid. This ardeur needs to be stopped. It's a good thing LKH is already a bestselling author 'cause she never would have gotten a book deal if she had started with this garbage. I think I'll pass on the other books."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"When I started reading Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series with Guilty Pleasures, I was impressed by the level of story and plot behind her tales. No more. You still get your vampire murder mystery, but it ends up being a subplot to the sex. Ever since Cerulean Sins, and perhaps before, the books have been concentrating less on plot and more on sex scene after sex scene.We do get to see the mystery develop within the first few chapters of the book. Someone (or something) is killing strippers, and it looks like it's a serial killer. Unfortunately, the plot is then interrupted with 300 pages of sex. Sex in cars, sex in beds, sex on the bathroom floor, it doesn't matter. We finally get back to the story and the mystery, although solved, does not conclude in a particular satisfactory manner.I certainly don't mind reading mindless sex stories, but this is not what I initially got into this series expecting. I still read them because I've gotten myself invested into the characters and I want to know what happens to them, but I've become sorely disappointed with the way the author has taken her novels from action and mystery to sex and erotica with a plot being secondary. If you haven't read Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake books before, start with Guilty Pleasures, not this book. Ms. Hamilton is also writing another series, also rather erotic and in a similar (if not the same) world as the Anita Blake novels. Going into the series with the knowledge it will contain more sex than plot, I enjoy the Meredith Gentry series more sometimes. If interested, pick up A Kiss of Shadows."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"What does this review title have to do with this book. Not a thing, but ironically enough, it fits perfectly, as the title and summary of the book is very misleading. As with many of the other fans, I stumbled upon Guilty Pleasures years ago, and quickly became hooked on the series, so much so the the point that I resorted to buying hardback copies of the books so I could get them when the first hit the shelf. *sigh* I used to read the books as soon as I got them, staying up half the night to finish my newly purchased copy, and then re-reading it several times until the new installment came out. CS took me about a month to get through, ID, close to two.If you are considering buying this book because you are among the die-hard Anita Blake readers, you may be disappointed. Don't expect the mystery, zombie raising and crime solving from her earlier novels. It's almost non-existent. Do expect Anita's legs to be open more than your local 7-11.Character change is inevitable, especially in a series that goes on so long. Of course there are going to be characters we like, those we love, and those we don't. That's what makes the series so great. In the beginning, I didn't like Anita that much, she was a bit too prudish for my taste, and she seemed to need to boss everyone around, but she started to grow on me like fungus on some French Cheese. Now she's just starting to grate on me like that same cheese over a... well... grater.I LOVE sex scenes with my horror. When Jean-Claude and Anita finally had their first go round I wanted to smoke a cigarette afterwards, and I don't smoke. However, in ID, I'm not getting sex with my horror, matter fact, I'm getting very little horror. What I'm getting is mindless sex, for no other reason that to satisfy this mystic power. Or is the mystic power just there to justify the meaningless sex scenes? The multiple almost unknown partners isn't the real problem, it's the fact that:1) Anita constantly whines about having sex with all these people, yet continues to have sex with all these people.2) The scenes don't seem to hold any purpose other than for Anita to get her freak on with random people and then whine and complain about it.3) She doesn't just get her freak on and be done with it, she has to anaylze it within an inch of it's life first, creating four and five chapter of dialogue, with Anita moaning and groaning the entire time about how she can't, shouldn't, won't have sex with the guy she has sex with in the following chapters to come.4) After the sex scene, there are several more chapters of the anaylzing and whining about what she did.5) Why is it every man Anita meets wants to sleep with her? Are we to believe that she is just that ravishing?6) Why is the sex ALWAYS great? with all the partners she's had she's had to have come across one V8 moment.6a) Why are all the vampires/were creatures drop dead gorgeous? Asher is as close as we get to an ugly vampire, and even he is beautiful. Even the \\"bad guy & girl\\" vampires are beautiful. Heck even the children vampires are adorable. Just once I'd like to see one of the vamps be ugly and fat.7) New vampires are introduced for the sole purpose of Anita having sex with them.If the sex scenes drove the plot, I would happily read along, but it doesn't. Matter of fact, their doesn't seem to be much of a plot at all. We see the crime scene at the beginning of the book, fast forward almost three hundred pages later and it returns,--albiet briefly--fast forward again to the end and we finally get back to what can loosely be called a plot. In all actuallity I viewed this plot the same way I thought of Drew Barrymore's role in scream. The serial killer vampire plot was reduced to nothing more than a guest spot in its own book.I don't have a problem with the ending, I like that Anita finally doesn't always get her man (of course if I was doing that much sleeping around I wouldn't get any work done either), it makes her more human and less of a Mary Sue. Matter of fact, let Jean-Claude, or Asher or even Nathanial have to save Anita from time to time. What I'm afraid of is that like CS, this vamp serial killer will not be mentioned in the next book. There have been some great characters (baddies) created in some of the previous LKH books. However, instead of bringing them back bigger and badder than before, they have fallen into oblivion. Talked about, but never to be heard from again.Another thing that has become quite annoying is that it seems LKH believes her readers must be total and complete morons. Why do I say this? Because you can bet your bottom dollar in every chapter there is a scene where one of the characters (usually, but not always Anita) will make a statment, and another character (always someone she has or will sleep with) asks for an explanation, or says they do not understand what she means. We (the readers) are then treated to a lenghty disertation on something that is not only beyond trivial, but the majority of us already grasped the meaning behind the statement. I don't like being spoon fed in really life, and certainly not in my books.I LOVE the growth of Nathaniel. The more his character develops, the more I like him. I would like to see more Jean-Claude, and would like to see him flex more supernatural power, other than the ability to instill and invoke lust and sex. I'd also like to see Asher (wasn't he supposed to be seeing someone about his scars--oh, say--five books ago?), Jason & and Edward. It would be interesting to see how the new Anita and Edward interact, (as long as he doesn't sucumb to the need to bed Anita). I have yet to understand what role Micah plays other than to be another of Anita's playthings, and her leopard King/mate (although it's apparent he's beyond whipped).What I REALLY can't stand is the way some of the key, and supporting characters have been drastically altered into one-dimensional excuse characters (i.e. Richard and Dolph). Although Dolph never expressed any \\"love\\" for vampires, he was certainly never this closed minded. An intellegent character is now just a vampire hater--with no background as to why other than his kid married one-- and is used to further justify Anita's love of the undead. Likewise Richard, who was very likeable when introduced in CotD, is nothing more than a self-hating whiner. He hates himself, or at least his werewolf half, yet he's the head werewolf in charge? Does anyone else find this more than mildly ironic and well, unbelieveable. If I were a member of this pack I would either revolt a la Julius style, or find a new pack to join. Like Dolph his purpose now seems to be merely to justify Anita's actions, and frankly the constant whining and *itching is really getting old. Werewolf up already! Geesh! In BO loyal readers would have missed Richard, now most of them (at least from the reviews I've read) would rather see him dead.It feels like the author is trying to make some point with Anita; as if saying a woman can do anything a man does. However, what she doesn't seem to realize is not everything a man does needs to be repeated by women. Sure as a woman I can have series of one night stands, but why would I want to, especially since I don't have a mystical power to blame it on? It would be more interesting if Anita were sleeping around, and not have her justify it with the Aduer. Now it just seems like a cop out, and a worn out plot device.I've read better Anita Blake fan fiction than what LKH has been cranking out, and what's better is I don't even have to pay for that.Will I read the next installment? Yes. Will I purchase it? Only at a yard sell. The next book will be borrowed from my local library. Actually thanks to the numerous warning from those that read the next installment \\"Danse Macabre\\" I didn't even bother reading it."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"All good things must come to an end it seems. And (like Anite Blake would think) it saddens me to write a line like that about one of my favorite writers and her series.I am one of the early readers of Anita Blake and bought 'Guilty Pleasures' years ago when bookstores didn't have a separate display for just Anita Blake books.I remember telling friends about this series with comments like 'this girl get into confincing fights, gets totally beat up and sometimes seriously wounded, ends up in hospital wrecked, and then bites down, limbs out of the hospital Dirty Harry-style for the showdown and beats the bad guy(s) and it works! Read them!'And being about vampires the erotic element could not be left out. And it was nicely done, visual and descriptive but in a tasteful manner.With each new book the erotic atmosphere gradually developed from smouldering background feelings to leading elements in the storyline and for a time that also worked quite good.Laurell K. Hamilton has a nack for erotic writing and with every new book in the series she got a bit more decriptive and daring. It must have been her confidence growing.Now, 'Narcissus' already was a strange book, but once again mostly a rollercoaster-ride of voilence and darkness. The Sex Club part fit in well. And for putting shrink-talk into her books, the 'human' side of Edward part was done in such a way that he became more scary that way.But in 'Incubus' I am at a loss. What is the function of the ongoing analizing of Anita's friendships and complex relationsships/sex life? It doesn't seem to serve any other purpose than to confince the reader that Yes, Anita Blake is still human.But it mostly annoyed me and made me wonder if this would be the last Anita Blake book I will ever buy.I'm not shocked by the 'F' word, but this is one of the first times I consider it over-the-top. There's is nothing to justify the use of this word so much besides total frustration on a Ricky Lake level. But, if that was the only problem with the book, I think I could live with that.It's the inner turmoil and (sexual) relationship chapters that push this book over the cliff.They seem to compete with the main story (remember, vampire hunting, bad-guy killing, murder solving) in such a way that it feels like two different books mixed inside one cover.And the sex/relation stuff is winning the fight and taking over the stage and just keep on boring and annoying the reader (well, me at least) with dialogs and sexual exploits I would have traded for some decent fights, chases and hunts in the night.In my opinion the series could have done without this book, or at least without the 'deep' dialogs. The character Anita Blake is not gaining anything by this constant display and analyzing of feelings and doubts every A.B. fan long time ago already discovered she had.It's just tedious prattle unless it's your thing I guess.So two stars for being an Anita Blake, nothing more.And lets hope that in the next books Edward is coming to town for some serious mayhem, to make up for this one."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I am a die-hard Anita Blake fan, but I have to agree with many reviewers who feel that Incubus Dreams is a nightmare! The storyline is practically non-existent,and why? Ms. Hamilton has shown us often in previous novels that she is an accomplished storyteller, capable of creating an interesting and well-written plot.I have no problem with the sex scenes, per se, but they should be in the context of a recognizable storyline, not just randomly inserted. Why does Anita need to copulate with complete strangers who seem to wander in and out of the story like passengers on a subway? Little attempt is made to develop the relationships between Anita and the men that she is purported to truly love.I am far from a prude,and I consider myself somewhat of a feminist.I feel compelled to say that I find it tiresome to read about a woman who has meaningless sex with people that she neither knows nor even likes.Some real character development and a MUCH stronger plot could have made this a truly enjoyable novelIn the meantime, where is Ms Hamilton going with this? Some place that I don't think I really want to follow. And by the way, I'm not a player-hater, I have long hair too! I hope Ms. Hamilton is listening to her fans, or 13 really is going to be a very unlucky number!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"To me this was the worst book in the series.

I read the reviews on this site and just knew the harsher comments were over blown. They weren't. Lots of sex scenes do not make a good novel. They just cover the fact that the novel is weak. Sure-- we learn more about the characters and how flawed they are which makes them 'human' and more likeable but the story... the murders... are like a side dish thrown in as a filler. More plot, more story line is needed.

I'm no prude and have enjoyed the sex in the previous books, but they weren't the main thrust (pardon the pun) of the story, and didn't go on endlessly- the stories were mysteries and that is what I liked about them.

I have been a devoted fan of yours since Guilty Pleasures came out, but lately I have been very disappointed. The last few books have been almost about nothing but sex.

It is not only in the Anita series, but also in the Meredith series.What happened to the well-written, adventure packed books you used to write so well that no one could put them down? I miss those.

I love this series but I was highly disappointed with Incubus Dreams as I have seen others to have been as well.First of all...I like steamy scenes, I will admit it, but not 350 pages of it -_- Maybe a chapter here or there with purpose. And not with every freaking man who Anita catches wind of.Another thing, GET OVER RICHARD. He obviously isn't interested in someone who is more comfortable with \\"The Monsters\\" Than he is. Enough said on that. And Nathaniel...My god woman..He isn't a little boy. -_- And you aren't his mother. Even though you are Nimr-Ra. *Sigh* I will stick with this series because I am a die hard fan, but I can seriously offer to keep the sex scenes with the Merry Gentry series. Its more fitting that way, LKH please give us back our old Anita, when the novels truly surrounded a forsenic case!!!!"},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Sex is a good thing, but honestly, there is too much sex in too much detail in this extremely long book. I vaguely remember the plotline, but kept losing track of it as I marvelled that the woman who does not have sex with someone \\"unless it MEANS something\\" was sleeping with yet another man/shifter/vampire. She did not shower much either. I was left with a sense of \\"yuck\\", and what happened to Damien's storyline, Gregory & Stephen's father, Louie/Ronnie. All they did was have crisis after crisis related to the ardeur and anita not \\"feeding\\" it enough so she had to sleep with someone else to avert disaster.

It definitely was not her best effort."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"While I could never \\"hate\\" LKH's work, this was not my favorite. If you are looking for answers or continuity from previous books, you won't get it. It was high on prose and porn, low on plot or storyline regarding the serial killing advertised in the jacket of the book, or even a mention of what happened the last few chapters of the previous book.I was very frustrated with the lack of backround storyline, and missed Anita dealing with people in every day life ...meaning relationships and meeting new people without having sex.The 8 to 10 different partners, on multiple occassions within a 48hour time frame, without the luxury of a shower was too much for me.I'm far more interesed in the Merry series and the unveiling of the world of fae as well as the people we are meeting in those two courts than I currently am with the world of Anita.If you love Anita, buy this book, but don't expect it to be anything like the first few books.

If that's not enough, the spelling errors (which average about 1 per sentence) and grammar errors (same average) really ruin being able to just sit and read... assuming you can stomach WHAT you are reading. Personally, I've never wanted to vomit because of a book before... until I read this feces filled book. The book is no longer about any kind of plot, but 'how many people can AB have sex with\\", 'how many different positions', 'how many sexual fantasies can the author push into the book'. That's it. And if that isn't bad enough, the writing is so horrible any one of my cats could write with more intelligence and less errors.But, honestly, no matter how much I detest this book, what I truly feel sorry for is that I wasted all that money on the older books, with high hopes for a good series.

An as readers we should do the same by not buying her books.Untill Miz Hamilton grows up an stops acting like a six-teen year old girl everyone is well advised to avoid her books.\\"Hamilton: In my books, the reason the eroticism is so high is that people in the publishing industry were disturbed by erotic content. Not for its own sake, but because I was a woman writing from a first-person woman's point of view. Had I been a man, they would have been okay with it.

I MISS tough Anita who was the underdog who succeeds against the odds. Super Anita who easily wins because she out sexs, out magics, out supers the bad guys is getting OLD fast.The Meredith Gentry series is actually getting more character and less orgy driven and Anita Blake is going the other way.

I have even bought the paperbacks, then went back and bought the hardbacks to keep as part of my permanent library. But, I have got to agree with the bad reviews on this book.Ms Hamilton, please get back to stories with a plot (maybe a visit to her old home-town and family).I was 200 pages into this book and had yet to find a plot! Then when I thought I had found the story-line, off it went again. The night-club Incubus Dreams from which the book got it's name, wasn't even mentioned until some where around page 500.The plot was lost in the emotional musings, pointless and tedious sex passage and past issues being re-hashed and re-re-hashed. I mean really! If a sex scene goes on for pages and pages and even stops in the middle of the action for a past issue discussion, it gets tedious. And there are just too many males she is having sex with to keep track of.And by the way I can't stand Nathaniel. He in no way advances the plot (once you find it), and should be the first regular character to be candidate for getting offed. Micah is next on the list, followed by Daimen.I have not sworn off the series yet but any more of this caliber and I will not waste my money."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"There's so much I like about Laurell K. Hamilton. She is good at bringing in interesting detail. She conveys dark situations very well. She can write good adventure when she chooses. Her main character, Anita Blake, is hard to resist.The 'ardeur' (a sort of savage lust) is becoming arduous indeed. This time it takes up two-thirds of the book. Anita is entangled in a web of monster loyalties, and any time a monster is badly off, Anita must have either sex or pseudo-sex to bail out said monster. I just got tired of the sex, and for me that's really saying something.Oddly, in the last third of the book the author decides to write a real Anita Blake adventure where she does something besides lust and slake, lust and slake. And it's a pretty good one, if not quite as good as the early books. It shows us what is still possible.Perhaps the worst thing is the proofreading, which is just awful. Hamilton should be angry both with herself and her publisher/editor. If your main character is going to be part of a 'triumvirate', it behooves you to spell the word right. There are enough typos to distract the reader.I wish this series could get back to greatness, but I'm thinking it doesn't. Not at this rate. But Ms. Hamilton, next time hire me to proofread your final galleys, and I will be your Typo Executioner. I'm better than whoever you're using.

They were the first books I read that had a strong female protaganist set in modern times (alternate reality, but still...) and jam-packed with titillating, fascinating, and intriguing characters. Her mysteries were interesting and her storylines coherent. Then things started focusing on the ardeur and the story lines shifted from mysteries and character development to sex and more sex. Her sex scenes are actually quite interesting in and of themselves, but to have hundreds and hundreds of pages devoted to nothing but graphic sex under the guise that this makes an interesting storyline? I don't think so. I bought Incubus Dreams in hardback, read it 80% through, then stopped. I have lost interest in finding out who is killing the strippers because I don't want to wade through what has become almost repetitive sex scenes. Sure, the partners and positions change, but enough already. I think that is a pretty sad statement about this book that I can't even be bothered to read the last few chapters when I was a rabid Laurell fan from the very beginning. I don't think it's fair to potential readers of her books anymore to market them as sci-fi, fantasy, or mysteries. They are erotica.

Something the reader can care about.That being said...what happened?! All that we see in this book is redundant relationship angst and pointless intercourse based on what's looking more and more like an contrived excuse for Laurell to, ah, live vicariously, through Anita. Before I read the book, I figured all the bad reviews were just fans being prudish. But now, I agree with them. And if you knew me, you'd know that my complaining about too much sex, *ever*, means it's bad.I read the book, and I wouldn't say I hated it, but I had a very hard time even finishing it.

Such a shame."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The absolute love I have for the series through Narcissus in Chains is what gave me the resolve to complete the last two. I remember with fondness the days when Anita Blake was at a disadvantage when confronting a master vampire; now, however, it seems she has more vampiric powers at her personal disposal than the council. It is no surprise, then, that she spends so very much of her time fulfilling the requirements of her internal conflicts, leaving so little for, you know, helping the police, or otherwise acting as a champion of anything at all.The series used to deliver something exciting and unique; sex is fun, and Laurell K. Hamilton writes it well enough, but in the written word it can also be had in any of the thousand trash romance novels that hit the shelves each year. Most readers haven't been \\"enduring\\" the first half-dozen books in the series hoping things got to be a steamy sex-fest. Rather, they have been enduring the last few in remembrance of the joy gleaned from those preceding."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"LKH puts one more nail in the coffin of a once good series, now more valuable as bogroll than book.The book is basically nothing but badly written sex scenes, no plot,barely anything which isn't personal relationship related.Plot has disappeared to fit in sex! How, in less than 200 pages in her first episode of Anita Blake can she have had more plot than in 650 pages in ID. It's funny how every single police case merges with the problems in her personal life. It's funny how many male strip clubs she manages to go into, and quite how many new sex clubs are introduced each book (just how big is St Louis and quite how kinky are it's occupants).It's funny quite how little of Anita's normal everyday life is told. We don't need to hear whether a certain toilet trip was for number one or number two but it would be nice not to just have;personal relationship scene ((phonecall)) it's the police ((murder scene)) return home shattered ((sex scene)) relationship scene ((sex scene)) move locations ((sex scene)) more police work ((sex scene)) relationship stuff ((climax)) new power ((phonecall)) resolve police case ((sex scene))badly written epilogue failing to tie up a million loose ends to the plot.I wish she didn't just one-liner some of the interesting developments in Anita's life or the lives of the other characters; for example meeting Dolph's son and vampire daughter in law, or in NiC having the whole book leading up to whether she is going to shapeshift then only having a paragraph in the epilogue to mention that, no, in fact she didn't.They say that the hero of every author's first model is themselves.Think about it, I'm sure most of you have written at least a fanfic if not a 50 chapter novel...did the main character resemble you, or at least resemble your ideal person with a few of your personal traits shoved in (you might have grey eyes but your character has 'eyes like a stormy sea; one moment dark, cloudy tempests, the next the shining deep azul of a Caribbean paradise')LKH, who is not a first time author by any stretch of the imagination, seems to write all her books with the same character in the leading role. All her heroines (and they are always heroines) are short, big breasted, curly haired, and mustn't forget all the other traits modelled on herself; plucky, witty, intelligent, well-read and ultimately lucky *gag*. It's very annoying that even Anita's bad traits are constantly complemented by the other characters. Because LKH writes her books in the first person there is only so much self appreciation and flattery she can put into Anita's thoughts, she gets in many more by an incredibly flattering cast of secondary characters. Most of the complements are such set-ups they are noticeably distinct from the flow of the chapter (that is if the chapter has any flow apart from a once/second in/out flow...)grammer/spellingDoes she type or write her stories? If she types, has she mentioned a reason why pressing the spellchecker button is so offensive? If she writes then surely her publishers need to hire some better typists who know where the spellchecker is? Has LKH ever given an excuse for the bad state of her sp/grammer?The Lord of the rings was a monstrous epic written by an extremely educated man who spent decades writing it. It was his pride in his work and his protection of his work which meant that he orderred so many reprints to rectify the tiniest spelling, grammer and plot errors.It is said that you are less likely to find a mistake in LOTR than in any other published work. Why wouldn't LKH appreciate her work being tidied up?Plot errors are obvious to any fan, so perhaps it would be wise if she got some people who actually care about the story to proof read. Her often mentionned writing group the alternate historians and her friends and family are hardly the best critics; you can't trust your friends and lovers to crush your spirits several times a year over some silly stories (they tend to wait for insignificant personal relationship stuff like get-out-of-the-bathroom-you've-been-in-there-ages or I-told-you-we-should-have-gotten-of-at-the-last-exit to start ripping giant chasms in your emotional wellbeing)I just don't think that LKH was ever that good a writer. She has ...had... marvelous plots which excused her -in my mind- from the spelling/grammer mistakes.Some authors have the ability to make their words so entertaining that the plot is largely irrelevant, Terry Pratchet for example uses witty angles throughout his stories which makes HOW the characters get there as important as WHERE the characters are going.I used to hold up LKH and TP as examples of how two authors with completely different styles can write equally enthraling stories, but without a plot LKH's work goes from bookshelf to bogroll because she doesn't have the literary ability to make up for it."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Could someone please explain to me how a series that was so great has been reduced to such rubbish? If I read one more time about Micah's \\"kitty cat eyes\\", or about everything being like \\"candy on my tongue\\", or how giving oral sex is one of Anita's favorite things to do I think I will scream! I enjoy a good, erotic, tension filled sex scene but there are none in this book. This is just one ridiculous, tacky sex scene after another. Nobody (even Anita the great) could be having this much UNBELIEVABLE, MIND-BLOWING sex continuosly with seven guys (or is it 8- I've lost count) Not only should Anita have trouble walking by now, but she should also have some serious hygeine/health issues. Oh but rest assured Jean Claude does not share Anital lightly. Is LKH for real? I don't even like the characters anymore. Reading about Anita buying pearls and a white frilly apron for Nathaniel just turns my stomach. I'm so sick of all these girly men with hair down to their feet. Not to mention Micah (of the kitty cat eyes) with his feminine facial features - I just don't go for guys who could be mistaken for women from the neck up. Another reviewer said it best- Edward should just come and shoot her dead. I've had enough."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"What a disappointment. This latest book is the wreck the series has been sliding toward for the last two installments. I kept buying, hoping plot and something besides conflicted, indiscriminate sex would eventually surface, but have given up. Anita has changed from a bright, tough but loveable character with a soul to a gyrating, clawing, cartoon that doesn't have any more depth than a heroine from a bodice ripper, if that. GAK. I am done with this series. I expect to be engaged intellectually and emotionally when I pay that kind of money for a hardback book, I don't expect to have a cheap stroke-book plot foisted on me. Skip this one for sure, and borrow the next book just in case. With any luck, Edward will kill everyone off in the next book, and leave Anita to get her life, and her legs together."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"OK - only 220 pages into this and alreay hate it. Anita, the kicks ass and takes names hero is gone -- turned into a sniveling whiner. I don't mind a little porn with my vampire action novel but this one goes on and on and NOTHING happens. The entire first 200 pages could have been done in a chapter. AND MOVE ON ALREADY!!! WE GET IT!!! Man, this is a boring read. And note to Berkeley Publishing: hire a damned proofreader! Diety is NOT a word! Get a spell checker for Pete's sake. For $25 I expect you to at least use the English language properly."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"When I read the tenth in the series, Narcissus In Chains, I was left with the distinct feeling that Anita Blake's world was out of control. The eleventh in the series, Cerulean Sins, did not comfort me. Now, book twelve, Incubus Dreams make me wonder if Hamilton is just plain over the series. The book is jumpy, and pretty much a jumble of porn shorties. LKH's editing help has always been less than stellar, but one expects more after the success she's had with this series. The typos and inconsistencies are really bad, and I'm no champion speller. The book did delve into some of the triumverate's power sharing and the effects on their personalities. Many of Anita's boundaries fell in this book, lines were crossed that were drawn many moons ago. One of the most intriguing elements of this series is that the characters are not stagnant. They grow, they evolve, they learn from experience. It is a double edged sword, as Hamilton has Anita's character crossing lines that she would have killed over previously, in fast forward motion. I really had issues with the introduction of several new characters, while there are so many supporting characters already in place to explore. The invention of The Wicked Truth, two legendary vampire warriors is promising. However, there are many old tweaks, and plot bunnies to resolve, and introducing too many new characters is not a great idea. I was most shocked my Anita's sexual escapades with relative strangers (new characters). Richard's metamorphasis into being comfortable with sharing Anita was completely out of character. It was so not Richard. Many fans hate Richard because he questions Anita. Not me, I admire Hamilton's abilty to create complex characters that cause such knee jerk passion from her audience. Something distinctly missing from this book was the lack of eroticism that was such a draw at the beginning of the series. It was basically insert A into slot B. Many of Hamilton's efforts at sex scenes are such, there is little real foreplay, well, for Anita, anyway. Perhaps it was more evident in this offering because of the plethora of sexual scenes. And still with all the sex, Hamilton still chickens out on addressing the situations which occur involving multiple partners, many of which are bisexual. It's been intimated at, but never addressed. I hope future offerings live up to the ovular fortitude of Hamilton. She pokes sticks at traditional gender roles, embuing the male love interests with traditional and oft used female character traits. Jean Claude is a clothes horse and the wicked temptress. Richard is the boy next door that wants the white picket fence. Many of the males have been sexually abused and/or exploited. My favorite poke is Nathaniel, the submissive, violet eyed innocent that just wants to be loved, ala the Barbara Cartland era heroine crossed with the hooker with the heart of gold stereotype."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I hate to say it, but this book was too much of a disappointment for me to keep. I fell in love with this series a long time ago, and it saddens me to say that it's falling apart. Anita's life, and the series, is in shambles. I actually really liked CS, because despite the personal drama, there was very much a sense of things being larger than Anita and her boytoys. The Mother, Belle Morte, even the crime of the week had larger ramifications for everyone. This book really dropped the ball, in more ways than one!Even though there are some interesting plot developments, they were BURIED in the drop-by-drop, blow-by-blow descriptions of the preternatural sexathon! LKH was careful to sort-of explain why Anita is suddenly banging every mobile male in the near vicinity (the ardeur, the power drain of the newly formed triumverate, etc) but I still found myself shaking my head in disbelief. Perhaps I would have been a bit more tolerant if the sex scenes were a little less graphic. I'm no prude (BELIEVE ME), but the clinical dissection and presentation of the couplings just left me cold. And she just didn't STOP! After the sixth or seventh scene I started skipping through the sex, trying to pick up the plot again. Trying to actually reconnect with the characters.It's a pity, because deep inside ID is the scattered remains of what might have been an intriguing story. I'm horrified by the Church of Eternal Life, and I would have liked to hear more about Malcolm's misguided (or deliberate) policies and less about Anita's new &#60;ahem&#62; swallowing techniques.If I ever read the phrase &#34;flat out did it&#34; ever again, it'll be too soon.Good for Nathaniel standing up for himself and finally getting a little of what he wants for a change. And boo boo BOO for bringing Richard back into the picture!!! From what I've seen in the past, Richard is a spoiled, petulant monster... someone who gets really aggressive and vulgar whenever he doesn't get his way... someone who will stick the knife in and twist it, and then turn around with the wounded-puppy face whenever he thinks that will be more effective. Anita has always been very naive about Richard; I think she's idealized him as some paragon of normalcy, and is too blinded by his good looks to see the abuser beneath.I really fear for Anita. I fear that she'll stay down there in the satiny sheets and never resurface. We'll never find out if Malcolm will start a vampiric jihad. We'll never find out where Valentina disappeared to. We'll never find out just what it is that Katie saw in Zerbrowski, and why he got that degree. Or maybe, Mommie Dearest will wake up, and Anita will realize that not every problem can be solved with multiple orgasms."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"I never thought I'd say this but Ms, Blake needs to get her life back.

There was no plot. So far Anita has had sex with 8 men/animals, mostly in groups...Uh,the murders and conversations with cops only took up maybe 2 chapters per murder but then Anita jumps into bed, or floor, or car, or whatever is handy, and that takes up about a hundred pages each escapade.The book is not worth buying, check it out from your local library instead but make sure to get it back on time because it is not even worth the late fees. :("},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"The thing I liked best about the Anita Blake series was the fast paced, tight storylines that left me feeling satisfied and longing for more books in the series. I doubt there were 20 pages in this massive book dedicated to a coherent storyline.Over 50% (out of 391) of the readers of this book gave this book 2 stars and under. That's pretty bad for a great writer with a great series.The last book I enjoyed thoroughly in this series was Obsidian Butterfly. The next few books had nothing substantial underneath it all to hang the long pages of sex on. The sex is great, no doubt but I found myself skimming all the detailed pages of sex to get to the story. Alas, I skimmed 80% of the book.What had hooked me and kept me coming back book after book was the well-written story line, tight plot, and unique characters. These have disappeared from Ms. Hamilton's work.I am very curious about the tendency of authors once they have a famous series of books (Robert Jordan, Terry Gookind, JK Rowling, Anne Rice) to write increasing thicker books that lose the quality of writing that made the series so popular in the first place. Is it because the authors have more say over what is edited out of their books?I don't know. I do know that I don't read any more books of the above named authors. Sadly, I think the Anita Blake series is now on that list."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"Maybe I'm being harsh, but what the heck happened to the refreshing writing? If I want porn, I'll surf the net! I don't need to pay for it... especially to keep reading about a good main character turned slut. Hamilton needs to realize she had something amazing going and she's ruining it and watering it down with all the \\"F-me!\\" garbage. I can see where she was trying to go with it all, but honestly, she should just glaze over the sex scenes and move on with the plot, not spend 70% of the book on it. I'm near the end now and she's just now getting to the murder investigation! WTF happened to the story? I put good money into that book and I wanted a good book.

I'm a big fan of the earlier books in the Anita Blake Series, but this book isn't one I'd recommend to anyone. Incubus Dreams doesn't actually have a storyline. It's basically about Ms. Blake's need to screw everything in sight.

I am a diehard Anita Blake fan and I suffered through Cerulean Sins and now this? The first books in the series were so much better. Anita was still a believeable fictional character. There was an actual plot, denouement, climax, and conclusion. This is thinly veiled pornography with Anita as some sort of supernatural vixen who has to go to bed with practically every man she meets because of the ardeur. I won't part with the first novels through Blue Moon. I even liked Obsidian Butterfly, but this is to the point of ridiculous.Don't bother buying one new. I can't believe I purchased this in advance. Check out one from your library or check out an online auction. My copy's on eBay and I really hope to part with it soon. I think I'll be moving on to another author.

Hamilton's novels to a friend -- I would definitely steer them towards her earlier work. I found this book to be too Anne Ricean (you know -- stream of consciousness writing, poor editing and a cast of thousands). The many gratuitous sex scenes are monotonous and uninteresting (they seem to be tacked on just to fill pages) and there appears to be little or no plot -- creating an unwieldy and excessively long novel.Hamilton used to be an innovative and amusing writer -- with good character development and plots that involved the reader. Her stories were filled with snappy dialogue, fun twists and turns and nice characterizations -- in short, they were cleverly written and never boring. Unfortunately, I can't say that about her books now -- she seems to have lost her way. A once good author, I hope she goes back to her earlier style of writing."},{"Title":"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)","review":"This book is an embarrassment to the publishing industry. The advertised plot, takes up about 100 pages of a 658 page book that is loaded with typos, habitual misspellings, missing words and phrases, and repetitive purple prose. Over 20 of the same \`pet' words and phrases and fill in the blank effects like \`...' and \`-\` are used repeatedly. Reading this book was as annoying as reading a 5th graders science report.The protagonist Anita, is the most unlikable, self righteous, weak, and hypocritical female character ever brought to life in fiction. She makes mistakes, blames them on everybody but, takes no responsibility, and faces no consequences, as usual. \`I didn't know' is her patent excuse. She comforts or confronts her many lovers and hangers on while her internal diatribes are; \`why should I care', \`I don't want to deal with this', and \`he doesn't agree with me so he doesn't love me'. Blake is not somebody you would want to meet or call friend, not because she is dangerous, she's just an ugly person.Damian is just a South Park's Kenny rip-off. He doesn't die, but gets close every time we see him. And only Anita's shagging can save him.Nathaniel is introduced as a boy soon becomes the authors attempt at a pedophilia fantasy.The rest of the core cast have been reduced to 2-D supports with no personality. No one is safe from the refitting to fit the new vision. More characters are introduced, some with the sole purpose of shagging Anita in the throes of her latest metaphysical emergency.The long awaited m&eacute;nage a trois between Anita, Richard, and Jean Claude, is awful. It's awfully long, awfully repetitive, and an awful disappointment to all her fans who waited to read it.The book is full of graphic sex and is blatantly pornographic to the tune of \`rainmaking', bestiality (Anita does furry), a sad S&M; scene, plenty of oral encouragement to the under enthused members by Anita, and the obligatory \`it's not really sex because it didn't include intercourse' scene(s). The repeated use of the f word and the \`eff me' rampage with the ardeur throughout the scenes with Anita's breasts, which are mentioned and investigated more often than the mystery.After learning that 'rainmaking' is rare, every sex scene from that point forward makes mention of how wet she is, which is the vast majority of the sex scenes in the book. Her many lovers are sure to check too.Anita did no investigating or vampire hunting except to run and look at bodies between shagging men. The last four chapters are a message to the series' detractors and her disaffected fans alike, you complain and I will do the opposite just to be contrary. She does take the time to consider traditional Christianity and basic morality often and slam them all. The new focus and plot of the ABVH is the ardeur, as EVERYTHING leads to sex now. When given the chance to lose it, she CHOOSES to keep it. It is a part of her now, thru and thru. She doesn't want to be without it. It is tied to every single page, regardless of anything else going on.The book as a whole, is plotted for the ardeur and the authors message. Not Anita or her story, not the publishers or the agents, the author. The protagonist, Anita, often and blatantly morphs into the author's avatar and voice. A quick read of the authors \`blog' for any given month is proof of that.This book is a reactionary piece of fiction and if the pen is truly mightier than the sword? Then the message to the committee of the ABVH core fan base, disaffected fans, and critics is razor sharp; You complained about it all, well here you go, in your face, now shut up and go away."},{"Title":"In Dreams I Run","review":"Outstanding!

It picks up history turns it into a minor degree of fiction to enhance realism and drama and culminates it with the infamous bombing operation, openly argued as the lab and crucible of the European war and a preface of events to come in Warsaw, Rotterdam, Pearl Harbor, Dresden and Tokyo.The use of primary accounts by motley eyewitnesses absorbs the reader into an increasingly suspenseful pace. A restaurant owner, a manufacturer of weapons, a liberal priest, a radical Republican officer and an empathetic nun-turned-into-nurse make up a most credible, yet unconventional &quot;dramatis personae.&quot;The book also provides a generous and abundant narration on the evolution of the strategic buildup of the mission, the tense politics between German pilots and Spanish Francoist officers, the military background in the Basque valleys and villages, and the depiction of Erwin Von Richtofen (cousin of the highly decorated and ultimately fallen Red Baron) as the mastermind of the raid. The book is intelligently written."},{"Title":"Guernica: The Crucible of World War II","review":"In the height of the Spanish Civil War the relatively peaceful town of Guernica has retained a certain level of normalcy. That peaceful faade is about to be shattered as a prelude to World War II. The town and its people are about to become the laboratory for modern-day terror from the sky. The fascist regime of Spanish General Francisco Franco has entered into an agreement with Nazi Germany to use Guernica, a defenseless and non-strategic pueblo, as a test of Germany's ability to wage war from the air. German pilots fly the planes, which marked in the guise of Spanish livery, test their new theory of terror bombing from the skies as a rehearsal of the soon-to-be rampage of Blitzkrieg (lightning warfare) across Europe in World War II. In the process, Guernica is visited with death, destruction and the loss of innocence. Witts' telling of the story is a graphic, horrible account of the devastation, especially in human terms. After the merciless attack, Spanish painter Pablo Picasso created a disturbing painting entitled \\"Guernica\\" to memorialize the event and express the true horror of war in which the innocent are most frequently the victims. I would suggest that the reader look at Picasso's \\"Guernica\\" both before and after reading this book."},{"Title":"Guernica: The Crucible of World War II","review":"This book was excellent- extremely well researched and very readable.

Stewart travelled to the Philipines in the 50s to carry out further research related to his psychology thesis. I'm not qualified to comment on the theory he was testing/formulating. My imagination was caught by his lyrical prose, the amazing descriptions of people and landscape, the obvious self-awareness and wry wit and the fact that he faced real danger. The book left me envious - he travelled in a time prior to most modern communication technology and, while travelling, was often completely immersed in local tribal culture and dependent on local guides. Most of the time he was short of money and this triggered some amusing and ingenious strategies. It's one of the books I've categorised as 'to be read every few years'."},{"Title":"Pygmies and dream giants","review":"Kilton Stewart plunged into the jungles of Luzon island in the Philippines back in the 1930s, when it was an American colony, back when those jungles harbored isolated mountain tribes of various kinds, many of whom were notorious headhunters. A lapsed Mormon with a great faith in social engineering, he had delved into psychological testing in the US and in Hawaii, (in fact he was asked to leave several locations) and he decided to test the Filipinos to see if they were \\"up to the human standard\\". OK, in those days, people still thought like this. Stewart had guts, he loved adventure, he had little money and a lot of chutzpah. He thought nothing of hypnotizing people whose languages he hardly knew and hoping for a therapeutic result. Stewart ate the food, danced the dances, sang the songs, walked the jungle trails, was cured of a dangerous jungle disease, and climbed the enormous rice terraces of Banaue when they were still in full use. He also slept with more than one local girl or I'm a monkey's uncle, but he remained a bit coy about this part of his travels. All the same, the reader can see that he often suffered from culture shock. What Stewart didn't have was doubt. He never questioned his techniques or the battery of psychological tests developed in America, thousands of miles from the milieu of the Ifugao, Bontoc, Ilongot, Kankanai and Negritos. He talks about them all as \\"primitives\\" with differing \\"levels\\" of mentality, and at first, he wondered if they could be called human. To his credit, at the end, he believes he has discovered \\"Universal Man\\"---his tests showed them all pretty much like people in America. He never mentions history, accepting the image of the \`timeless primitive', though most of the people he met had had extensive contact with outsiders. While I too believe that dreams are important and that trance can be an important part of healing, ritual, and religion, I grew tired of a certain level of \\"mumbo-jumbo\\" in Stewart's work. By the time he got sucked into a tropical river and washed down over a giant waterfall and into a humungous whirlpool, losing his pants in the process, I lost my patience. He emerged with a new view of the world, having solved the inner problems that had probably motivated his entire search in the first place. I emerged convinced that PYGMIES AND DREAM GIANTS is a great adventure or travel book, well-worth reading. If you're looking for serious anthropology or modern cultural psychology, however, give this one a miss. It's completely outside all the cultural discourse of the last 75 years."},{"Title":"Literary lapses","review":"This book contains a collection of ironically satirical essays. Satire is not my favorite form of humor, so it took me a few essays to get &quot;into the swing&quot; of the book, but I can say that once I came around to the appropriate frame of reference, I quite enjoyed the book. When reading this book, you must also remember that it was originally published in 1910; the humorous themes of the essays have aged well, but some of the settings have not.As I read the essays, I kept having the nagging thought that the author's style reminded me of a contemporary author. Once I reached the &quot;How to Make a Million Dollars&quot; essay, it hit me: I would not hesitate to call Stephen Leacock the Dave Barry (Miami columnist and author) of the early 1900s. They both have the same sort of perverse logic to their points of view.

If you like slap stick humor, please look somewhere else."},{"Title":"Literary lapses","review":"Stephen Leacock was a Canadian author who wrote his works with an optimistic yet realistic view of life. His light-hearted, bubbly diction impressed me all the way through the novel. Each short story was unique and had true-to-life situations and entertaining characters to whom readers of all ages can relate. His stories are full of good advice for everyone from the socially elite, eager-to-please teenager to the hard-working businessman to the overprotective father. Leacock exaggerates in many of his sketches, but that aspect of each story fits in perfectly with the separate ideas he presents. I recommend this novel to anyone who agrees that life should be lived to the absolute fullest, taking all chances and having a good time. As Stephen Leacock says, &quot;Eat what you want. Eat lots of it. Yes, eat too much of it. Eat till you can just stagger across the room with it and prop it up against the sofa.&quot; (Leacock Literary 31)"},{"Title":"Literary lapses","review":"A truly wonderful collection of pieces, ranging from silly to savage, by the Canadian equivalent of Robert Benchley. I say Robert Benchley because, like Benchley, Leacock has a wide range of interests that include poking fun at himself (the first essay, where he makes a fool of himself opening a bank account, is a classic for a reason), poking fun at social trends (the then-new fitness craze, the then-new obsession with doctors and medicine), and--at his best--sheer lunacy. (Like Benchley, he will launch into storytelling mode in order to mock entire types of stories--such as one about a nobleman's secret, which builds up the suspense and then ends with no one caring about the secret after all.) While some of his obsessions have dated, these pieces are almost perfectly constructed: they are all very short and efficient so as not to wear out their welcome. And from a construction point of view, not a line is out of place, not a single joke feels less than perfectly aimed. It's truly impressive and wonderful; humor collections this strong are rare. If you like the writers of the Algonquin Round Table, his Canadian equivalent is also their equal. I can't see anyone regretting owning this."},{"Title":"Ancient Coin Collecting III: The Roman World Politics and Propaganda (v. 3)","review":"This is a good introduction to the fascinating world of ancient Roman coins, aimed at the general reader and beginning collector. Contains a useful photo gallery of Roman emperors and major usurpers as well as tips on how to attribute coins, read inscriptions and figure out the various images that may appear on reverses. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ancient Coin Collecting III: The Roman World Politics and Propaganda (v. 3)","review":"I've read all three books in Wayne Sayles's series on Ancient Coin Collecting and all of them have been a joy to read. I'm a new collector so I am a good prospect for these books as they are introductory in nature. Each book has hundreds of photographs which are very good. There is a history of the time, the coins, art, and much more. The author loves coins and history but what I like most is the treatment of coins as works of art. One can like and enjoy this book without really being interested in coins as such. The layout of the book is the best I've seen in any coin book. It is amazing how much information is contained in about 200 pages. I think all three books in the series are equal in quality and value. I have about 40 coin books and these three are in my top 10. New collectors should check these books out first. Many, if not most, coin books are very advanced and may not be of much interest to the new collector."},{"Title":"Ancient Coin Collecting III: The Roman World Politics and Propaganda (v. 3)","review":"This book has a lot going for it, it has over 300 illustrations, it is still only about 200 pages and is in the familiar format of it's two predecessors. The helps are good, it has a comprehensive portrait gallery and is written in Mr. Sayles usual easy to understand and engaging style - that of a writer who loves and cares about what he is describing. The one drawback is that the author felt it necessary to give at least a short bio for every emperor and to read it through can get redundant after a while as much of their history overlaps and repeats, particularly for those with short reigns.However, if you decide to skip over the emperors who don't interest you and use the portrait gallery as more of a reference section than something that must be read - then it is a great and easy read. If however you really do love the regnal history of Rome - this might be a section of great interest to you and you may love it. Each emperor comes with his own brief bibliography and abbreviated family tree.Like volume II, the section on &quot;masterpieces&quot; is beautiful and the focus on the coin as artform is a valuable contribution. If you enjoyed either of his previous 2 books this will not disappoint. This is a nice reasonably priced and accessibly written introductory work. It should prove enjoyable and useful for the newbie and experienced collector alike."},{"Title":"Ancient Coin Collecting III: The Roman World Politics and Propaganda (v. 3)","review":"Mr. Sayles has written a beautifully presented introduction and reference to the hobby of ancient coin collecting. Any book on coins should have photographs and that's what's included in this book, along with terrific written explanations of the coins. Since ancient coin collecting is about history, Mr. Sayles spends a large part of the books detailing the backgrounds of the emperors who appear on the coins. There is also a section on &quot;Masterpieces of Roman Coinage&quot; which presents wonderful photographs of individual engraving art. All in all this is a &quot;must&quot; for anyone interested in ancient coins."},{"Title":"Ancient Coin Collecting III: The Roman World Politics and Propaganda (v. 3)","review":"Wayne G.

All the stories about the criminals who were too stupid to get away with their crimes were my favorites. It's understandable that older people might not enjoy it as much, although I still think it's a fun book. It's no Charles Dickens, but it's not meant to be. It's just a fun book to read when you need a break, or when you need to be reassured that there are people who have done dumber things than you have."},{"Title":"Bloopers, Botches & Blunders","review":"From the Brazilian robber who glued himself to the floor, to the thief who dropped a 600-pound safe on himself, to Goldie Hawn spilling wine all over Sly Stallone at a dinner attended by George Bush, Sr., the anecdotes in this little book are interesting, to say the least. However, they're just not funny. Maybe it's the sarcastic headings that introduce each anecdote, or maybe it's the rabidly factual wording and style that characterizes the entries, but the bottom line is that - somewhere between the whimsical and the factual - the humor has been lost.On the other hand, this does make an interesting sociological/psychological reference book. What would make a job candidate want to arm wrestle his interviewer? What kind of person would invent &quot;Gorilla Balls protein supplement snack&quot;? And, above all else, what would motivate a person to make and market spinach french fries?Regardless, this book does bear testimony to the fact that - as the introduction of the book aptly states - &quot;it's a blunderful world!&quot; It's just a pity that those blunders can't be retold humorously.A final note: the authors of the book are supposed to be Allan Zullo and Allan Evllo. If the corresponding first names, and the matching &quot;llo&quot; in the last names don't tip you off, then when you receive the book and see only Allan Zullo's name on the front you just might begin to suspect that this blooper isn't quite accidental. Is there some kind of witty interplay going on here, are they just trying to pull your leg, are they gently poking fun at themselves, or was this indeed a mistake?

Halberstam rips through transhistorical definitions of lesbianism to reveal a multitude of queer 'masculinities,' from female husbands, FTMs, butches...She's been accused of fetishizing masculinity and not critiquing it at all, but I find this to be untrue. I think that, in separating so-called masculinity from maleness, she reclaims what can be striking and powerful about the genders we've labelled \\"masculine\\" and in doing so critiques the ways domination has been embedded in traditional male masculinity. This book is truly breakthrough, and I urge you to buy it, and read it, and mull it over. Amazing."},{"Title":"Female Masculinity","review":"Halberstam's ideas around being a masculine female have helped me gain acceptance of my own masculinty. For this reason, the book was groundbreaking for me. However, it's a difficult book to find pleasure in reading because of the hyper academic language and its emotional distance from anything personal or of human interest. The books that are close to my heart about gender and that have been pleasureable to read are Persistent Desire and Stone Butch Blues because they tell a story about the human side of being a masculine female. I'm glad someone's picking apart gender in 1950's film, but it doesn't do to much for me."},{"Title":"Female Masculinity","review":"When picking up a book that does not purport to be anything other than academic, one must be prepared for the contents to be just that - academic. Halberstam writes well, her ideas are important, and she adds complexity and insight into several areas of scholarly research and debate. I would strongly recomend this to anyone interested in feminism, gender, difference and social justice."},{"Title":"Female Masculinity","review":"A highly readable and stunning history of female masculinity in Britain and the USA, considering court cases, literature, film, pop culture and drag king performances. I learned that the most interesting masculinities are not male, and that the history of the occlusion of butchness is a crucial foundation for understanding gender construction of all kinds."},{"Title":"Female Masculinity","review":"The fact that this book was not written by a person of color in no way reduces the racial-inclusion in the book. Halberstam dedicates the book to Gayatri; perhaps having a lover of color influences her racially-diverse perspective. Then again, maybe its the influence of the ethnic studies professors at her college, UCSD. Whatever it was, it's great. Halberstam makes a point of saying how butches of color face different issues from white butches. She states from the start that works on masculinity as it affects men of color and working-class men were much more informative to her research than books on hegemonic masculinity. Halberstam even criticizes white lesbian academics like Faderman when they fail to confront racism in their academic subjects.I only have one big problem with this book: Halberstam's discussion of the Latina character Vasquez in \\"Aliens\\" is all wrong. Halberstam implies that Vasquez is lesbian and she goes on to state that Vasquez dies first, dies tragically, and was in general not dynamic. In the film, they show Vasquez panicked over the death of a man, impliedly her lover. They very consciously render her straight. She was one of the last characters to die, not the first. Further, she died valiently (and heterosexually in the arms of a white man) by killing herself in order to kill more aliens. In such a strong book, I don't understand why Halberstam felt the need to fudge the facts."},{"Title":"Female Masculinity","review":"Despite my huge frustration that Judith \\"Jack\\" Halberstam utterly dismisses the masculinity of heterosexual women (and so should be called Lesbian Female Masculinity if it were being honest), there's a lot of good research and history here, including an interesting look at Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness and interesting commentary on the boundary lines between butches and FTMs."},{"Title":"Female Masculinity","review":"this book will not hold your hand as you discover your masculinity. it will, however, inform you about the bredth and depth of female masculinity from a variety of perspectives. it is thorough in it's look at the affects of class and race and also contains a very interesting and important chapter on the tensions between butch, transgender, and FTM. this book is an important read for any student of women's or queer studies."},{"Title":"Female Masculinity","review":"I'm not a big fan of Halberstam's structure of argumentation, but if you are interested in female masculinity, you need to read this book."},{"Title":"Female Masculinity","review":"This is a ground-breaking academic book. When I purchased this book at amazon.com, I was worried that it would not reach me before my departure from the USA. Fortunately, it reached me as scheduled. I love this book, for it enables me to know more about American culture, which, by the way,to be frank, is sometimes confusing."},{"Title":"Female Masculinity","review":"Essential reading for anyone studying gender theory, cultural studies, or LGBT studies. Halberstam's writing is very clear and easy to understand while being incredibly insightful and brilliant.

Undoubtedly theoretical in nature, but very readable, I would highly recommend this text."},{"Title":"Female Masculinity","review":"Though it is part of a larger assortment of resources now, when this book of critical thought was released very little work had been done in the arena of analyzing the masculine female. The collected articles draw on a range of popular culture sources- books, film, tv, and art. It can be a dense read at times, but anyone with a background in gender or queer theory should recognize some of her reference material. I also found that occasionally Halberstam drifted into the realm of sweeping generalization about masculine females that seemed unsupported. All in all, a thought-provoking read on the masculine female as depicted in popular culture and what it means to society when a female has male privilege."},{"Title":"Female Masculinity","review":"This is a good introduction to the topic. Helps you think through the difference between masculinity and maleness. Wish there were more about how race and class effect masculinity."},{"Title":"Female Masculinity","review":"Halberstam's latest book is a rather lackluster rehashing of the latest trend in queer theory. Instead of endless pages of highly problematic ethnographic research, Halberstam would have been much better served if she had included a fem perspective in her unabashed celebration of butch subjectivity. A rather ho-hum effort from an otherwise promising young scholar. One only hopes that she can live up to the promise of her earlier book, Skin Shows."},{"Title":"Female Masculinity","review":"i think judith makes some good points, but she tends to lean toward male bashing instead of raising up female masculinity sometime.

A stable industry was thrown for a loop as new laws were implemented, and the old ways were thrown out. Such venerable companies as Pan Am, Braniff, and TWA went out of business. Predators in the business (Ichan and Lorenzo) bought up companies and vowed labor confrontation to bring down costs. Some companies(United, American, and Delta) became giants in the industry. This book describes the immediate aftermath of the airline deregulation act. More people flew and were employed in the business, but many lost their careers and incomes in this consolidating industry.I think the authors did a wonderful job of depicting the industry up to 1991. I would have liked some more information on the early part of the industry, since this may have shed more light on their various philosophies. Overall a great book on the industry."},{"Title":"Rapid Descent: Deregulation and the Shakeout in the Airlines","review":"The authors do a fine job of presenting the whys and wherefores of airline deregulation. Perhaps this is not a subject that fires passion in a lot of people, but if you're like me - eager to understand not just the \\"how\\" but the \\"why\\" things happen - a lot of the mess that is air travel today will make more sense once you understand how the industry got here.As a 20-year airline professional who started in the mid-1980s, I see the situation today as nothing short of tragic. Judging by their policies and actions, many airlines seem like their managers must be sitting around in meetings trying to figure out the next best way to alienate their customers. From pricing to fees to using regional jets on longer and longer segments, it seems to never end. Many years ago, I worked in Revenue Management and joked to a colleague that if the powers-that-be could figure out a way to strap people in standing up, they'd do it. That was funny until somebody DID figure it out, or almost. Google \\"airline saddle seat\\" to see what I mean.Okay, off my soapbox except to say \\"Rapid Descent\\" is as good a book on the complex realities of deregulation as I've seen.

He describes witches as worshippers of the goddess Diana, and refers to a specific group as the &quot;good witches&quot; of Benevento. Leland points out that &quot;bad witches&quot; also exist and he includes several spells to illustrate this.Etruscan Roman Remains carries a feel of antiquity as Leland introduces ancient lore and its revelance to the witches of Old Italy. This book was the first of its kind to present material drawn directly from people claiming to be witches during the 19th century. Along with Leland's Aradia; Gospel of the Witches, this book presents the foundation of many concepts now found in modern Wicca, including a full moon sabbat, the worship of a god &amp; goddess by witches, ritual use of cakes and wine, and witches as healers and magic users. After reading Leland's accounts, there can be little doubt that Gardnerian Wicca was founded, at least in part, upon the writings of Leland on Italian witchcraft.In addition, Etruscan Roman Remains contains a great deal of information on old superstitions, folk spirits, and folk magic. This book is an important addition to any library on Witchcraft."},{"Title":"ETRUSCAN ROMAN REMAINS","review":"This is a wonderful addition to any home library for anyone interested in the religion of Antiquity and Italian folklore. All of Charles Leland's writings are wonderful, but this book in particular is of great merit. Leland travled the Italian country-side and recorded many of the tales from rural folks, some of which still practice the &quot;old religion&quot; both overtly and covertly within the Roman Catholic structure. It is through his recording of these stories that we can see the evolution and continued existence of the Gods of the Ancients. This is a must read for any serious mythographer, folklorist or modern day observer of the Old Ways."},{"Title":"ETRUSCAN ROMAN REMAINS","review":"Leland provides great insight into suppressed information related to the old Etruscan Paganism of the Early Roman Empire and Italy. The first part of the book contains descriptive insight into over 60 Gods and Goblins of the old religion, whereas, most other texts only contain up to 25 and often confuse the details. A greater number of suppressed names and deities are discussed in detail in this work, then in any other text I have researched in relation to this old way of life. The second part offers various Incantations, Divinations, Medicines, and Amulet Creation. The book is heavily illustrated which is another thing that is uncommon in books on this subject. This book is highly recommended for anyone studying the occult, and makes for a great desk reference for followup research."},{"Title":"ETRUSCAN ROMAN REMAINS","review":"Another fine example of the work of Leland, and an excellent source document for those who seek pre-Neo Wiccan non-fluffiness.

I would not however recommend it as a BOS to follow ,mainly because we do not know the real context of these spells. Even though Leland has written them down they are from another time and one we are no longer a part of. This is just my opinion and I recommend if you do use a spell from this book you should know why you are using a certain herb, object etc. and WHO you are calling on!Just a precaution I would take.

This was the movement that so effectively and violently strangled the German Revolution , perhaps the one and only chance Wilhelmian Germany could shed its oddity. Of course , there were both domestic and international factors directly or indirectly affected and hindered the \\"German Revolution\\".Yet, we can not possibly argue that without various Freikorps units, certainly counterrevolution could not be so successful. Waite's book is perhaps the only serious study in Anglophone world exclusively deals with Freikorps movement. you will encounter lots of new and interesting historical know such as Baltic expedition, Black Reichwehr, and sinister Feme so and so forth. Since it was written in 50s, there are some erratas and anachoronism such as some dubitable sources written by ex-Freikorps members.

I devoured each book as I could afford it, always eager for more. I was thrilled when the trilogy expanded. When the PBS station out of Washington DC started playing the BBC TV show, I was in heaven. And when the NPR station I listened to at college started playing the original radio show, I rigged up a way to record the shows on audio cassette so I wouldn't miss an episode.So you can understand my embarrassment when I admit that I have yet to see the movie. But I've done the next best thing-I've read the book about making the movie. And I want to see the movie even more now.This book is incredible. The pictures include not only final set designs, but the various stages that the designs went through. The Guide itself is pictured in every incarnation it went through. The Heart of Gold is shown in all its splendor. The costuming for Marvin, everyone's favorite paranoid android, is shown in enough detail to make me feel very sorry for the actor who had to wear it. Concept sketches abound. Any book that shows the actual bypass plans for both the Cottington bypass (inside front) and the Hyperspace bypass that requires the demolition of the Earth (inside back) has to be on every fan's must-read list.The justification for changing parts of the \\"original\\" story are made in the book as well. True Hitchhiker's fans need no justification, though-we know that none of the various forms that the story has taken agrees with any other version. It should come as no surprise that the movie is different from the books, which were different from the TV series, which was different from the radio show, which is different from the lunchbox...Anyone who watches movies and wonders \\"How did they DO that?\\" needs this book. Any Douglas Adams fan needs this book. Anyone who has ever written Vogon poetry needs this book.The movie came out on DVD on Tuesday of this week. It's been out two whole days, and I haven't bought it yet.

Why would you want to buy a book on the movie?Well, maybe because you want to see how they did some things. Maybe because the still shots in the movie give you time to look at what you are seeing for a while instead of being forced to go on to something else.The making of a major motion picture like this is a big effort combining the talents of a lot of highly skilled folk. If you're into movies, knowing how they had to import material for Arthur Dent's pajamas from Turkey makes a very good trivia point to have at your fingertips.I guess there's really no good good, solid, sound reason to buy this book. Except I like it, I found the pictures and writing to be fun to read. I've loaned it out to a few other fans. Good reason or not, I think you should go out and buy it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Filming of the Douglas Adams Classic","review":"I've been obsessed with H2G2 lately, and as soon as I heard about this book, I had to get it. There are many pictures in here, from concept drawings to in-depth photos and diagrams of practically everything. It explains the Vogons and what they had to do to get them moving, the Guide's appearance, each character's personality and clothing, Magrathea's factory floor... even everything about Arthur's house.My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that Arthur, Zaphod, and Trillian get four pages of coverage, while Ford only gets two. Then again, I'm a huge Ford fan, so I'm biased.If you're a fan, you must get this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Filming of the Douglas Adams Classic","review":"The very first time I saw the original presentation of the Late Douglas Adam's hilarious book(s) was on PBS. It was all the rage, being a BBC production, like the then current Monty Python!. My friends and I were all big Sci-Fi fans, and this sort-of-a-satire was over the top LOLROF funny! We found out (before the internet!!) that Douglas Adams also wrote for Monty Pyton, as well as 'Doctor Who' and 'Red Dwarf' -- quite a Big Deal if you're British!Years go by and wouldn't you know it, I stumble across a brand-new-sealed-in-plastic DVD set of the original BBC production of \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy\\"! Well, suffice to say that we all loved it. The pure simplicity -- actually, downright TACKINESS! -- of the sets reminded us of the early Star Trek days. The writing was very much in synch with the books that Adams wrote, which is to say Delightfully Funny! i.e.: \\"Early civilizations thought that the Universe began by being sneezed out of the nose of the Great Green Arkleseizure, and therfore lived in dread of the day they called The Coming of The Great White Handkercief!\\" Eventually there were six books in -- as he called them -- the Increasingly Inaccurately Named \\"Hitchhiker's Trilogy\\"!But onward to the 'modern' or Digital Version. Actually, VERY well done. As an aside, it should be known that Adams was in the process of negoiating for the film (and probably for the screenplay as well) when he suffered a heart attack and passed away. The entire and correct backstory remains a bit fuzzy, but most of what I think he would have wanted is there. A bit of a twist on the characters, the lovely visual effects, and the generally outstanding sets make this a Sci-Fi lovers' delight. If the verbage is mostly sarccastic, it's meant to be. If it is also rude at times, then read the books for verification! Adams had a rather quirky view of the Universe, and while Einstein said that \\"God does not play dice with the Universe\\", Adams had other ideas. The two-headed Zaphod Beetlebrox is one, the nasty and unrepentent Vogons another (mirroring what some may say are modern day civil servants!), and dare we say that The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe is very anti-Einstein, not to mention entirely non-Newtonian! And then there is the \\"Infinite Improbability Drive\\" of the Universe's Greatest Starship... Leaves warp speed in the dust, but with no sense of direction!There are just too many little idiosyncrasies to mention, but most of what can make a decent rendition of the Adams' books are here. I loved the pure vision of the film and only wished it had gone on longer!If any of what I have written strikes your fancy, then you might want to investigate Douglas Adams' other works -- most likely only available in the U.K. -- \\"Dirk Gently's Holistic Dectective Agency\\" (which spoecializes in finding lost cats - at a price!) and another great mystery/adventure called \\"The Long Lost Teatime Of The Soul\\" (\\"the demolished air terminal kiosk looked like the work of a God... But which one?\\"). Either of these mostly unknown gems would make a great film on their own! Ask Amazon for help in getting these books. They should be modern classics of a kind not usually seen in any universe!Even in 'regular' DVD resolution the film is VERY good. I bought my first copy long before Blu-Ray was available and someday hope to jump into the more detailed version . However, don't YOU wait! Just hitch a ride in The Heart of Gold and -- whatever you do -- remember where your towel is!!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Filming of the Douglas Adams Classic","review":"As a long time Hitchhikers reader/viewer/listener this book comes in rather far down the enjoyment list. I have not seen the new film, but have the older DVD based on the BBC program, saw the original BBC shows, heard and recorded all the radio programs and have the original books. Perhaps the book documenting parts of how the new film was made would be useful to movie people, I'm not a very friendly viewer of movies and usually prefer the books and radio stuff to feed my imagination. So with that bias put out for all to see, you can judge how useful these opinions might me for purchasing the book.Books can't do much to get us inside the realy technical stuff of a modern special effects movie. So it is not a surprise that this gives a fairly superficial treatment of the technical aspects. What is less understandable is why central characters get an equally surface only treatment and it really escapes me as to why Marvin the paranoid robot is made to look like a childs cartoon neutered blob. What audience were the producers trying to reach, and how can we imagine pains down the diodes on the left side of a blob! Even more puzzling is the lack of a systematic framework about life, the universe and everything. So yes, I am not glad I purchased the book."},{"Title":"Deux Hommes","review":"A Rose for Emily was a weird story about a crazy woman who is self boarded up in her house and doesn't believe her dead loved ones are actually dead. This is a very strange and disturbing tale. Especially the ending. I read As I Lay Dying, that was the only book by Faulkner I have read. I wasn not expecting what I read in A rose for Emily. IGood story."},{"Title":"Al Lopez: The Life of Baseball's El Senor","review":"I found this book to be wonderful. While it is a biography, Singletary addresses the subject like a historian. This book examines both the positive aspects and the negative aspects of Al Lopez's life and the time period when he managed. This is not some simple hagiography extolling him. The research is thorough, yet presented in an extremely palatable manner. What sets this book apart though is the straightforward manner in which the author has written it. It is very easily read and not filled with arcane or difficult tidbits."},{"Title":"Al Lopez: The Life of Baseball's El Senor","review":"Al Lopez died last fall, four days after the Chicago White Sox clinched the 2005 World Series, their first series appearance since Lopez himself piloted them there in 1959. These southsiders were led by another Hispanic, the fiery competitor Ozzie Guillan. How different Guillan was from the calm, serene Lopez, I thought. That proved cause enough for me to give another read to Wes Singletary's popular biography, Al Lopez: The Life of Baseball's El Senor. As baseball books go, this is a strong one written in a scholarly fashion and it should appeal to anyone seeking to know about the man and his times. While others have suggested that the author stayed too long with material that they percieved as having little consequence - issues of race, coming of age - Singletary correctly chose to address these issues and did so in a well planned and reasonable fashion. His frank discussion/analysis of Larry Doby's accusations of racisim and prejudice on the part of Lopez was alone worth the price of the book. Singletary's recap of Lopez's years as a child in Ybor City, emerging though the minor leagues, becoming one of the best and durable receivers of his day, and then his evolution into a manager par excellence, first at Indianapolis and then in the bigs with Cleveland and Chicago was well researched and conveyed. And I came away with the realization that El Senor was anything but serene. In fact, he was a fierce competitor who took losing every bit at badly as the loquacious Guillan, but possibly did a better job of concealing it. Lopez is one of the great, hall-of-fame managers; he was a great guy, and this book reminds us how he got there.This is the first and only biography of Al Lopez to date and as such it was sorely needed. In a time when our heros must come from history, particulary in baseball, Al Lopez provides the ideal. As Jerry Holtzman asserts in the forward, \\"he is among baseball's nobleman, perhaps the noblest of all.\\" This book does him justice."},{"Title":"Al Lopez: The Life of Baseball's El Senor","review":"THIS IS A BOOK ABOUT AN INTERESTING MAN. A MAN WHO HAS CAUGHT MORE GAMES THAN ANYONE IN MAJOR LEAGUE HISTORY EXCEPT FOR CARLTON FISK. MUCH OF THIS BOOK IS WASTED ON MR. LOPEZ'S MINOR LEAGUE CAREER. ALSO THE TIME SPENT ON HIS PLAYING AND MANAGING CAREER ARE SHORT LIVED. HE IS THE ONLY MANAGER TO BREAK UP THE YANKEE DYNASTY OF THE 1950'S. THEN THE LAST PART OF THIS BOOK IS WASTED IN WHETHER MR. LOPEZ IS PREJUDICE AGAINST BLACKS. GIVE ME A BREAK. HE HAD BLACKS ON EVERY TEAM HE MANAGED. I AM NOT CONCERNED ABOUT PREJUDICE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST AL LOPEZ. HIS TRULY REMARKABLE PLAYING AND MANAGING CAREER SHOULD BE THE FOCUS OF THIS BOOK. I THINK THEY ARE TARNISHED BY THE LAST PART OF THIS BOOK. I THINK MR. LOPEZ DESERVES BETTER THAN THIS SO-SO STORY."},{"Title":"Al Lopez: The Life of Baseball's El Senor","review":"Play by play type of book, rather than life anecdotes. You have to enjoy the history of baseball to enjoy this book. But if you do, then it will be very good reading. If you wish to understand the persona, read a short quip on the web about his great accomplishments."},{"Title":"Al Lopez: The Life of Baseball's El Senor","review":"Al Lopez was my favorite MLB manager when I was a kid. I used to listen to the Sox games every chance I got in 1960-1964 on WCFL (\\"The Voice of Labor\\") with Milo Hamilton & Bob Elson, that is right after I finished listening to the Cincinnati Reds.That said, I didn't care for the book. For me it concentrated too much on his earlier life and not enough on his big league managerial career. Most people living now will not be remember for his playing career. The book itself summarized the scoring of selected games through Al's seasons in the minors and big leagues as a player & manager. It didn't have enough interviews with former players. I was so bored with the book I finished it one evening."},{"Title":"Al Lopez: The Life of Baseball's El Senor","review":"Al Lopez was one of baseball's greatest managers, capable of building contenders out of teams that had pitching and power (1954 Indians) or fielding and speed (1959 White Sox). The problem with this account is the focus on Lopez's minor league career, first as a player, then after a highly successful ML catching career, as a manager gaining experience. Lopez's seasons managing Indianapolis are described in detail that is excruciating unless the American Association is your interest. If Mr. Singletary had devoted as much relative space to Lopez's great years managing the Indians and Sox, the book would be invaluable. Instead, whole seasons when his team was a contender, such as the 1952 Indians that finished 2 games behind the Yankees, are disposed of in less than a sentence. Game-by-game accounts of the 1954 and 59 World Series make up the majority of the chapters on Lopez's ML managing career. These can be found elsewhere (e.g., \\"59: Summer of the Sox\\"). The author was apparently inspired to write the book as a booster of Lopez's hometown, Tampa. This may account for the greater detail given to Lopez's early Florida minor league career.Singletary does better than most baseball biographers in getting facts about old-time players right, though his real understanding has gaps (Del Ennis was a power hitter, while Dave Philley was a center fielder par excellence in his heyday-they were not the same type of player. GM Hank Greenberg famously disliked Lou Boudreau, a fact that had great bearing on Lopez's career, but which the author fails to note.) The author had conversations with \\"el senor\\" - would he had gathered and printed more baseball anecdotes. Good- but if only Jerry Holtzman had written the book instead of the foreward."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of the Marine Aquarium","review":"I have positively oodles of books on fish behavior, diversity and ecology. When I brought this book home the wife asked \\"why do you need another fish book?\\" I will tell you like I told her.This is the best book I have seen on the fishes commonly found in the aquarium industry. The fishes are arranged according to systematic (evolutionary) relationships, so it is in a format that is familiar to me, and more useful to people that are not already familiar with fish groups. Organization, however, is a minor part of a book. But the information in this book is also top notch. There is important information on hundreds of species referencing, feeding, care, availability and compatibility that is important when considering an addition to your salt water aquarium. There are also excellent sections on general aquarium keeping and reef inverts. This makes this a must have for any hobbyist. Lastly this is also a VERY attractive book, it now gets to be in the living room (near the aquarium where it should be) instead of in my library.I didn't use those exact words with the wife, but you get the picture. If you're looking for a book on salt water aquarium fishes this is a great choice. Hopefully amazon will begin carrying it soon."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of the Marine Aquarium","review":"I have been in the aquariast hobby for quite a few years. Though I haven't had a tank set-up for almost 10 years since retiring from the US Navy and moving from Va. to Ga. I decided for the sake of the fish in my 150 gal tank it was best left behind in the care of my neighbor and best friend JD. I am now in the research and planning stages of setting up a 250 gal. reef tank. Since so much has happened in the last 10 years I felt it was wise to get some reading material for varied opinions and fact gathering. I now have 5 reference volumes to refer to. This book by Vince is not only a beautiful book with outstanding pictures but is my favorite. Crammed with every possible aspect of this hobby. From beginner to advanced the info is superb. In fact a Newbie could take this book as a stand alone reference from your very first Marine Fish only tank to an explosively beautiful Reef with Fish, Inverts, and Corals. It gives info on all the types of filtration from the Jaubert System,(My Favorite), to the extreme hi-tech route..Plan on spending major bucks if you go the hi-tech route. in my opinion the Jaubert System is as close to natural as you can get and the results I have seen from those using it match if not excel over much more expensive set-ups, but hey, back to the book. Every possible life form is fully described in easy to understand detail, inhabitant compatibility, location of origin, feeding, disease care, all of it. The way it is organized makes it superior for that \\"gotta have info right now\\" scenario when one of your prized specimens needs immediate attention. Though the diseases coverage is brief it is concise and easy to follow. This book is now among 2 that sit out on my coffee table. It gets read or at least browsed through alot by my visiting friends. Kids love the pictures. I highly recommend it for anyone from beginner to advanced. You can find higher priced books but non better. It's great buy at twice the price."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of the Marine Aquarium","review":"This is a terrific book about saltwater aquariums. Being a beginner hobbist, I found it very useful. But for building my first fish tank I needed to use other books, as this book isn't intended to be a step by step guide. What is great about this book is that the author gives a score from 1 to 5 to each fish and invertebrate depending on how hard it is to keep each animal on the fish tank. Being a beginner, this was simply super. Other great feature from the book are the fact it is hardcover, top-notch paper quality and outstanding pictures -- one for each animal being discussed.On the down side, it could cover more invertebrates -- event thought the information provided is enough for a beginner like myself --, the author is from UK so many stuff that he talks about is clearly based on the UK market (like recommending a Specific Gravity meter manufactured in Germany that can't be found in the US). The author also emphasizes on cientific names and technical terms, sometimes making it hard to follow for a layman like me.All in all, it is a great book to have, but not a real complete one for a beginner."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of the Marine Aquarium","review":"Well, I must admit, this book has great photos regarding fishes but little on corals.

The layout of the book is ingenious.Donna Hay's recipes are simple yet stress good quality ingredients. They're not too detailed or complicated yet still gourmet and delicious.I also really fancy this cookbook because of the photography. Being a photographer myself, I really appreciate the effort gone into producing such beautiful yet simple like the recipes photographs.Having recently moved, I haven't had a lot of time to cook but when I have, I've devoted it to trying more recipes from this cookbook and I've not, so far, been disappointed.

It does seem inconsistant in what it does explain or embellish. It is like they are trying to explain the techniques, concepts and ideas that are outside of marine geology and assumes more knowledge on geological concepts. What is starting to become somewhat of a valid concern is that some of the data is getting dated and is lacking, naturally, related research since 1988 when this edition was published.

They were in perfect condtion now myu set is almost complete! It is always nice to find quality books for a good deal!"},{"Title":"Magic of Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"This was actually the very first FR book I bought featuring the new d20 ruleset and my collection has grown from there.While 'Magic of Faerun' contains alot of useful information it also contains, like alot of the WOTC product, alot of unnecessary fluff. So what are the actual contents?Chapter 1: Understanding Magic - This chapter covers the primary deities who have magic as one of their portfolio's. There is also a couple of pages devoted to discussion on the various types of magic (i.e. Dead, Wild, Shadow).Chapter 2: Magic Variants - This chapter delves into some of the more obscure matters related to magic - such as Elemental magic, Elven magic, Gem magic. There is also a lengthy discussion on Mageduel's. Then there is a brief discussion of Rune magic and Spellfire. The chapter ends with a small section on the concept of 'Spellpools' (an excellent concept - but not as detailed as they could have made it - making it a missed opportunity).Chapter 3: Practitioners of Magic - This chapter is devoted to those d20 staples 'Feats' and 'Prestige Classes'. When I first bought the book I thought \\"Great!\\"; but having seen how bloated the gameline has become with 'Feats' and 'Prestige Classes' I now look at them as mostly unnecessary. Whereas once upon a time, being a War Wizard of Cormyr or a member of the Guild of Magists in Waterdeep would have been a character concept, they have codified them (and many others) into the ruleset which IMHO detracts considerably.Chapter 4: Places of Power - This chapter's name says everything really. The chapter details such things as 'Mystic Maelstroms', 'Sparks' and 'Fey Mounds'. It also discusses at length topics such as how Nature is venerated, and Places of Prayer, Bastions of the Arcane and the silly concept of MageFairs (what's the point of adventuring if you can buy your magic items? Like I said, S - I - L - L - Y).Chapter 5: Spells - This chapter deals with the real crunchy stuff, spells. Eight pages of new spells (in list form), broken down by character type (i.e. Assassin, Bard, Blackguard, etc). To my way of thinking there are already hundreds of spells avaliable and so the inclusion or exclusion of these few is not going to affect the average campaign. However, what I used these spells for was for a mystery factor. I didn't let my spellcasting PC's know about thses spells and only unleashed them in very select circumstances...like the excellent 'Gutsnake'! or in a different campaign I used them as 'undiscovered' spells - when a spellcasting PC wanted to create a new and unique spell I would use this list (once s/he had outlined their general thinking) to suggest some.Chapter 6: Magic Items - This chapter deals with the second favourite PC topic. This is an excellent chapter that features hundreds of new items, from swords through to rings and potions to artifacts. In addition to some really excellent and well-thought out items, there are lots of plain silly and overpowered items - but there is certainly enough to keep any player (or GM) very happy.Chapter 7: Creatures - This chapter details three new creatures and three new creature templates. Nothing really WOW in this chapter, although the 'Crossroads Guardian' is an interesting creature as is the 'Magister' template (templates being much more role-playing orientated rather than 'Prestige Classes').Overall, a very useful book, packed full of ideas, seeds and general information. Probably the best part is that this book could be used in just about any fantasy setting, for example, I'm using the 'Spellpools' concept - although I've expanded it considerably - in a new 'Birthright' campaign.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Magic of Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"When I first saw the title &quot;Magic of Faerun&quot;, I thought the whole book would be mostly magic spells and a few magic items. I was very pleasantly surprised to learn upon reading it that I was wrong and that the book contained feats, prestige classes, quick adventure ideas and other various magic related information.Rather than focusing solely on spells or items in the beginning of the book, &quot;Magic of Faerun&quot; takes some time to fully describe the situation regarding magic and its history in the Forgotten Realms. This gives some great background for the slew of prestige classes and ideas that follow. I was impressed by the new feats which can add both role-playing and more choices to a campaign. The new skill descriptions (and ideas for skills) were wonderful, since I love the D&amp;D 3E skills. The various prestige classes were numerous and some seemed a bit repetitive, but on the whole they're great and they would be terrific to use on creating some NPCs. I especially enjoyed the &quot;magical places&quot; section which described temples, mage fairs, mageduels, and other such things. I can't wait to intergrate some of the ideas into my own campaign.The magic spells and magic items take up the largest section of the book, but that is to be expected. They were mostly a touch above mediocre, but there were some wonderful additions. I think what I liked best was that some of the spells seemed to add spell choices to classes (such as druids or bards) that helped expand their spell lists greatly.While I wish more of the book had been like the beginning rather than mostly spells and magical items, I still think this is a great tool for both DMs and players. No matter what world your campaign is in, consider picking up this book. It can only help your game."},{"Title":"Magic of Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"This book would have been a 1 or 2 without gnome artificers. It is a dry resource as far as spells or prestige classes, but the interesting ideas about different types of magic like spellfire or the shadow weave are intriguing. The mage killer was a diappointment as I have had straight-up fighters or preists that could have made a better living disposing of mages. The gnome artificer is a must have for anyone who is tired of mages and is looking to add in an exotic flair to their game.

There were interesting prestige classes, feats, skills, and other extras that i felt were a very good addition. The only real problem, and i think it's a big one, is the fact that after having initially bough the Faerun World book, and THEN the Magic of Faerun, there were many spells in the first book that were NOT in the Mag. of Faerun!! I felt like the writers should have placed all magic spells from the Faerun World book into the Magic of Faerun spell list. It only makes sense. Had i known this i might not have bought it. It pisses me off that much."},{"Title":"Magic of Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"The quality of the book was fine, a little pricey IMHO, but of acceptable quality, however, I was sorely disappointed in this product's lack of meaty rules and real content and am returning it. Returning it you ask, when most folks seemed to enjoy it, why? Well, for starters I purchased this product mainly for new and expanded rules on magic. While there were some new rules, sadly most of the rules were actually descrtiptions of things to do with existing materials and not any thing new. The Wizards duel rules and the Weave Rules had some interest however, the elemental magic system was glossed over, the moon magi were just silly, over all I felt the rules provided were weak and unfinished. The descriptions of various groups in the Forgotten Realms setting was also thin IMHO, I think the campaign setting book itself does a better job of describing Forgotten Realms characters. The final reason I despised this book was because the majority, almost 2/3s of the pages, were taken up with long lists of spell descriptions and new magic items. I dont know about you, but I find lists of new spells and magic items to be annoying and simply a waste of good paper. If you are really in search of a new spell or magic item, I suggest you try the internet. There are vast amounts of material available for free. So my recommendation is, unless you are a die hard collector of all things Forgotten Realms, skip this product."},{"Title":"Magic of Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"When I first read about the release of this product, I made up my mind I wasn't going to buy it.

The clerical spells have some nice flair (a L1 healing spell for the faithful that cures 8HP plus a level bonus-nice! and they've finally given blunt weapons a keen-like enhancement spell, Weapon of Impact). Rangers, often thought to have gotten short shrift in the new D&amp;D, get some good stuff in this book: spells that give their melee weapons +3 enhancements, and a spell that makes their next ranged shot critical, so long as it hits (I ask you, what ranger wouldn't want that?).Of course, new feats are part of the package. The metamagic feats are mostly for panache (like the feat that allows you to give your spells a 'theme' which makes them harder for opponents to identify, but has few other mechanical benefits) but they still add to the overall feel of the realms play.The prestige classes in this book are, in contrast with previous offerings, broad-based and allow for customization. Whereas there are few differing ways to play a Pale Master (from Tome &amp; Blood), there are countless ways to play a Mystic Wanderer (a clerical prestige class, with a splash of the arcane) or the Mage Killer (a shadowy spellcaster who has a bone to pick with arcane types). With a campaign world as a backdrop, prestige classes can really explore their potential as world-building as well as character-building tools.In the 'Places of Power,' chapter, we are introduced to ready-made settings for magic events in Faerun. A magical bazaar where PC mages can buy and sell magic, as well as participate in Mage Duels. The Mage Duel rules are a great idea, although the rules are a complete aberration with the core rulebooks (spellcasters are allowed counterspells without readying actions, for example). The dueling rules promote a free-flowing and non-lethal way for mages to settle their differences. However, since a duel is unlike anything that exists outside of the dueling arena it is unclear if it will serve as anything more than the thrill-seeking stunt that it currently is.A chapter is devoted to explaining Faerun's peculiar magic backstory, which is useful for immersive campaigns and can serve as inspiration for spells, items and adventures alike. Rules for Gem Magic detail an expensive way for a magic user to store (and trigger) spells in gems-much like scrolls. Gem Magic increased cost (it uses gems, after all) comes with increased flexibility in use. A gem with a stored spell can be triggered when a certain creature approaches within 5', something a scroll cannot do.All in all, the book is chock full of what you would expect, more magic for the Forgotten Realms setting. The book is gorgeous, in keeping with the FRCS' look and feel, and the text does not disappoint. If you play the realms, this one's a keeper."},{"Title":"Magic of Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"MoF is excellent. I've played D&amp;D through its various incarnations since 1977, and the Forgotten Realms since the early 80's. The price tag was a bit high, so I took a peek at a friend's copy first. What I saw convinced me to buy it.The spells and cleric domains add a lot of dimension and color to D&amp;D3e. I was expecially interested in the new prestige classes. A couple of them seem better suited to NPCs, such as the Master Alchemist and the Mage-Killer, but the write-ups are balanced and well thought out.The magic items chapter is quite good, too. There is a lot of flavor added to the list, and not simply more powerful items, or more ways to cheat the rules. Too many past supplements from the previous versions of AD&amp;D have introduced items and spells far too powerful for most campaigns. This supplement is very well balanced.The feats are good, too, Spell Thematics especially (but get the errata download from WoC!).My only disappointment was there weren't very many monsters, but that wasn't the thrust of this supplement, so my disappointment is very minor.Overall, this book is worth the price, and very handy for both players and DM's who want a better understanding of the magic of Forgotten Realms."},{"Title":"Magic of Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"You know, I didn't really mind paying for this. Sure, it's overpriced, but it's darn useful.This book is, rather obviously, intended primarily for Forgotten Realms. I still think that the setting is on the rather obnoxiously silly side, but the material is more or less first-rate, and thus easily stealable for better d20 settings.The meat of this book is the massive number of new spells, a great number of which are useful. There's Speed Swim (1st-level spell, gives a Swim speed of 30), Hunter's Mercy (ranger spell, 4th-level, if the arrow hits, it crits), and the utterly awesome Wieldskill (1st-level spell for clerics of Gond, gives +10 competence bonus to ANY skill, or a half rank in one skill you don't have, *or* any feat). All classes get good spells, and some are multi-use; Mace of Odo, for example, can be used for damage or to block incoming spells.You'll also find a good chunk of the book devoted to the various methods and practices of magic in Faerun, including sample temples, mage guilds, mage fairs, and odd schools of magic. These are okay, but not particularly great.There are also nifty prestige magic-based prestige classes, like the mystic wanderer, mage-killer, and the Harper Mage and Harper Priest. There are mostly okay, though some are too dependant on the setting to be useful elsewhere. The Guild Mage of Waterdeep is an almost exact copy of the Mage of the Arcane Order from Tome &amp; Blood.Magic items and stuff are also well-represented. There are a great many new weapons and armor enchantments, as well as specific varieties of items. Some aren't particularly useful; the Rod of Cats springs to mind as one of the more pointless items (yes, darkvision is nice, but there are easier/cheaper ways of doing that...). The magical materials available are greatly expanded, including special weapon/armor materials and gems that enhance spells. Last, but not least, you'll find a selection of monsters and templates that appear in the setting.All in all, this is a pretty decent book. The production value is very high, and they obviously put a lot of effort into it. If I liked Forgotten Realms at all, it'd get 5 stars."},{"Title":"Magic of Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"This simply is more meat, more flavor, for the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting - and of exceptional quality.MOF knows the importance of discussing the more aesthetic points of magic in the Realms, shows many intriguiging prestige classes like the Master Alchemist and Mage-Killer. It also has many spells and magic items that contribute to a true Realms feel, using the names and based on the history of powerful characters or events of that world. For example, powerful magic rings created for the great military commanders and soldiers of Cormyr, and new magical enchantments for weapons and armor such as Impact - a version of Keen that exists especially for increasing the critical damage potential of bludeoning weapons - and Magic Eating.Highly recommended supplement to the FRCS that will see a lot of utility by both players and DMs who enjoy the high-magic world of the Realms."},{"Title":"Magic of Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"I admit that I was worried when I purchased this book. Supplements such as Tome of Blood and Sword and Fist had made me leary of the paperback supplements that were being released for Dungeons and Dragons. After reading through the reviews here, I decided to purchase a copy.The information presented was increadible. This had many of those things I thought to be lacking from the FR Campaign Setting Sourcebook: spell charts including the new spells (as a bonus it also includes spell charts for the prestige classes in the DMG, such as the assassin), actual descriptions of mythals and how the ones in certain areas behaved, and a great deal of additional information (such as Mage Duels, Magical Roads, and a Mage Fair) that I can apply to virtually any campaign.The book itself, despite being a softcover, is absolutely gorgeous and has been done in the same style as the FR Camapign Setting Sourcebook. If it were hardcover, it would be perfect and well worth the price tag. As it now stands, it is a wonderful supplement to games both inside and outside the realms."},{"Title":"Magic of Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"Ok, after Tome and Blood, WoTC has come out with a great Realms book to follow up the FR hardback. This is a big one, 192 pages, and chock full of spells, magic, rules and prestige classes that should keep anyone busy for a long, long time. Lots of artwork (some very good, some not as good) and a nice layout, very attractive. This makes up somewhat for the terrible spell selection in Tome and Blood with some interesting ideas. Hope they can keep this up for future products."},{"Title":"Magic of Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"Pound for pound, this is one of the best D&amp;D accessories Wizards of the Coast has produced. I made the mistake of buying Tome and Blood just before this beauty came out. This book is superior to Tome and Blood in too many ways to count.First of all, just look at it. The book is filled with gorgeous color illustrations that immediately let you know that you're holding something special. Reading the book gives you an intensely epic feeling that has been so absent from some of Wizard's other publications. Forgotten Realms, an already rich campaign setting, really comes alive in this book.The books starts by giving a background to what magic really is. It describes the Weave, a magical force created by the gods from which magic comes to mortals, and the story behind some of the legendary gods and wizards behind it.Being an accessory, there are also tons of new spells, feats, and some brilliant and well developed prestige classes (much better than Tome and Blood's &quot;Candlecaster&quot;). Greater Mage Hand, a spell I invented a while ago because I felt it was needed, was also invented by the book's authors, along with some other really creative and useful spells.This is undoubtebly the best D&amp;D accessory I own. The people in charge of the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting are already making it something special. This book is expensive (and it's a paperback), but worth every penny."},{"Title":"Magic of Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"This is one heck of a Forgotten Realms supplement.

The new spells in the book are fun and vel balanced, the rewrite of the Polymorph spells are better than the Players Handbook version.The new prestige classes are interesting, the Gnome artificer and War wizard my favorites. There is also a very good section about new materials to use in building magic items.The book rounds off with some very cool new magic items, and last but not least some info about Moonblades(nice!).So buy, buy, buy, buy, buy!!!"},{"Title":"Magic of Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"There is a lot about this book, Magic of Faerun, that recommends itself to the D&amp;D enthusiast. Aside from adding a wealth of new detail to the Forgotten Realms setting (particularly new to those who have not familiarized themselves with it outside of the new edition game) it also sports a plethora of new spells, useful new prestige classes, and a small smattering of even more magical monsters and templates. Even more useful is the fact that this book goes out of its way to suggest ways to work different aspects that it lists into any given campaign. &quot;Useful&quot;, of course, is subjective, since while it aids the Dungeon Master, it may also cause the DM to be reluctant to hand the book over to any of the players, since they might stumble across ideas that are to be used in the next session, possibly ruining the adventure. That, however, is a minor point.My primary - perhaps only - complaint about Magic of Faerun lies in the illustrations. They range from outstanding (in one or two cases) to acceptable, to downright unpleasant and distracting. And not &quot;unpleasant&quot; in a gorey way. &quot;Unpleasant&quot; in a &quot;poorly-illustrated&quot; sort of a way. The slightly abstract pictures of Michael Dubisch struck me as particularly poor, and I do hope that his work won't be making a return in any future D&amp;D or Forgotten Realms books. I'd much rather that Wizards of the Coast stuck with the more traditional paintings and sketches, ala Core Rules and even the FR campaign setting.The drawings, however, don't detract from the usefulness of this product; merely from its attractiveness.In sum, this is a well-written campaign accessory that is worthy of your attention. Simply be prepared not to judge it by its illustrations."},{"Title":"Magic of Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"As I have oft stated in my gaming reviews, I'm a fighter...

He covers all the bases and does include brief commentary on some controversial issues such as Lordship salvation, and eternal security. He is courteous in his writing and although he does mention some particular individuals by name, he is careful not to engage in reckless polemic.You will find his writing clear, well organized, and refreshing.

The author repeats things over and over to gain word content, but says very little of substance."},{"Title":"There Must Be a Pony in Here Somewhere","review":"I would get this book prior to any trip...it is well-written with an irreverent, breezy style and an eye to the clever phrase or interesting anecdote. It is fun to read. The author, Kara Swisher, not only chronicles the AOL-Time Warner transaction but also provides interesting perspective on the late 90's and early 00's. One could ask why my comments and why this particular book? The book has value in that the author lived through this period, understood the genesis of the acquiring company, AOL, and importantly, was a keen observer of Time Warner (including its key players, Jerry Levin and Ted Turner among others) and the transaction that took place. To give you a sense of her style and perspective, she describes the merger as \\" a company without any assets acquiring a company without a clue.\\"What makes the book worthwhile is the author, her style and most importantly, the relationships she established with almost all of the main players. She had extraordinary access to them over time and they were comfortable enough with her to provide their own perspectives in something other than a self serving manner. There are no heroes only fools, some more gullible than others.Buy it, you'll enjoy it and you will remember to look for Kara Swisher's by-line when you next read the Wall Street Journal."},{"Title":"There Must Be a Pony in Here Somewhere","review":"Much of Kara Swisher's lively chronicle of the biggest media merger in history is focused on two visionary company leaders: AOL's Steve Case, who made the company into the 800-pound gorilla of cyberspace but could never seem to turn that power into genuine respect; and Time Warner's Gerald Levin, whose efforts to take the venerable media company into a Net-based future met with one failure after another (FSN, Pathfinder). In theory, the merger should have given both partners what they wanted. So what went wrong? Swisher counts the ways, from bad timing (the tech boom of the late 90's was already starting to wane when the merger was first announced) to tumultuous ego clashes between the &quot;young turks&quot; of AOL and the feudalistic &quot;old school&quot; hierarchy of Time Warner. And then, of course, there's the money. Swisher details AOL's &quot;creative&quot; accounting practices, Time Warner's less-than-diligent due diligence (possibly a product of Levin's determination to make the merger happen, no matter what), and the desire on both sides to create a &quot;synergy&quot; of old and new media, with no clear idea on how to make it happen. Synergy was AOL-Time Warner's Holy Grail, all-important but ever-elusive, and when the company failed to get it, the stock price tumbled. Swisher's prose style is accessible and informative. When she offers personal anecdotes or opinions, they are never intrusive or self-important; instead, they add dimension and context to the narrative, fleshing out the how-high-can-we-go? headiness of the late 1990's. My only complaints are minor ones. First, I wish the book contained a &quot;cast list&quot; of the major players for quick reference; when the surnames start flying around (Pittman, Parsons, Colburn, Crawford), it would have been nice to have a reminder of what positions each person held. Also, and this is no fault of Swisher's, the book went to press before the ideal ending could be included: the decision to drop AOL from the company name. (In fairness, Swisher did predict the name change would happen, and she expected it sooner rather than later. Perhaps the paperback edition will feature an extended coda.) When the merger was first announced, Ted Turner, a major stockholder and Warner board member, compared the experience to &quot;that night when [he] first made love some forty-two years ago.&quot; By the end of There Must Be a Pony, readers may have much earthier metaphors in mind."},{"Title":"There Must Be a Pony in Here Somewhere","review":"This is a very good book on the AOL Time Warner merger. This merger is unusual, because it is the acquirer (AOL) that got weakened much more than the acquired (Time Warner). Also interesting, it is not so obvious why that was the case. Right after the merger, the AOL executives got the upper hand over the Time Warner ones. This was logical, and was a confirmation of who bought up whom. So, given that the AOL executives had the upper hand, and that AOL was doing great before the merger, what triggered the demise of the company post merger?The author makes a well detailed and successful case that the unraveling of AOL was associated with the bitterness of the Time Warner executives as the result of not being treated as equals. As a result, they conducted a quiet mutiny by consciously underperforming on all the projects and ventures related to AOL. And, they succeeded marvelously.The author also makes a case that AOL is not over. And, that it has still a bright future within the internet and technology domain. Here the author is on much thinner ice. Her case is more about subjectivity and personal likings than anything else.Nevertheless, this book is overall an excellent and easy read. The author style is very lively and makes for a fast page turner. It is also very personal. She seems to know and meet everyone in the industry and have interesting personal opinions on them all. This renders the book so much more interesting then just an extended Harvard case study which so many books of this type end up becoming."},{"Title":"There Must Be a Pony in Here Somewhere","review":"This book chronicles the saga of the much maligned merger between AOL and Time Warner. A deal that exemplifies the era of dot.com speculations, shady accounting, and wealth created by the absurd free-for-all that was the mid to late \`90's. When the bottom dropped out of the dot.com boom the merger left few standing and the biggest single financial loss in corporate history.The book looks at the storied and unlikely emergence of AOL, through an often dizzying and phoenix-like rising from the ashes of one failed concept after another. Throughout, the narcissistic antics of the leaders of the company are legendary. David Colburn, the famed deal maker at AOL, used particularly colorful language in his wholesale assault on those he sought to best (Page 46), never content to merely close a deal but demoralize people in the process. He is but one of the many examples.Time Warner head Jerry Levin, who took most of the blame for the disastrous merger, was himself a study in what happens when leaders insulate themselves from feedback. The sections on Levin are perhaps the most interesting. Devastated by the murder of his son, and the events of 9-11, Levin occasionally demonstrated \\"jerry mcguire-esqe\\" moments of humanity, including a plea for the organization to dedicate itself to serving the public good. (Page 207) A plea that was met by outright hostility as it was timed with the release of the admission that the new AOL-Time-Warner would miss all of its projected financials. Steve Case, himself a unique individual, is profiled as an enigma. Both eventually take the fall for the financial debacle.Throughout the book the author provides powerful, yet subtle, glimpses of how real life values and meaning intercede in the \\"hamster on a wheel\\" joke that is the true character of many corporate executives. Despite the money and the power, it is clear that many of these leaders were disillusioned and left wondering what life really means.Of particular interest here is perhaps the best example ever assembled of the power of culture. The culture clash between Time and Warner was never resolved even prior to the even worse clash of the AOL deal. An executive describing the cultural issues existing at Time Warner prior to the deal underscores the magnitude of the gap: \\"At Warner, if you didn't make mistakes you'd be fired because you were not taking enough chances; At Time the attitude was - don't make mistakes\\". (Page 73) The clash with AOL was even more severe.The AOL executives were hated with a passion usually left to sports rivalries and terrorists, and often employees compared the merger to the \\"Nazi's invading Paris\\". When several key AOL leaders were ousted it was compared to the fall of the Taliban! There are simply way too many examples of failed due diligence, obviously on the financial and contractual aspects of the deal, but also on the total lack of insight into the devastating impact of the culture clash and poor integration and leadership. Blame flies unabated off of nearly every page on whose fault it was; the brash arrogance of AOL or the stodgy lack of vision at Time Warner, but regardless it is a textbook case study on how important culture and creating shared vision is to success.I recommend this book highly. There are many lessons to be learned here, and it is an engaging and fun book to read. Well done."},{"Title":"There Must Be a Pony in Here Somewhere","review":"Swisher is a remarkable writer. She is able to capture the personalities, hubris, technological hype, and all the other elements that went into one of the worst merger deals in history. She has a remarkable ability to capture both the substance of the deal points, how both entities came to the position that they did and yet offer larger lessons on corporate America. The book is entertaining and instructive. It would be a great read if you are interested in any of the following topics - the internet bubble, corporate egos, corporate finance, the new versus the old media or if you simply want to read a very entertaining book."},{"Title":"There Must Be a Pony in Here Somewhere","review":"This along with its predecessor, AOL.com, are fun, information-packed, chronicles of the original 1990's dot com era and its aftermath. Kara Swisher has access to the right folks, these pioneers and tells a great story. There are a lot of lessons in this book that should be studied in every business school. One flaw- Google is only mentioned once in this book, on page 279, an interesting omission of the time when this was written. History repeats itself and it is hard to stay on top in business, especially in technology."},{"Title":"There Must Be a Pony in Here Somewhere","review":"This is a witty, gossipy book that is a fun read about a very unfunny merger between the Internet bad boy AOL and the venerable Time-Warner entertainment conglomerate. Unfortunately it is also terminally superficial. As has often been observed more can often be learned from failures than successes. So one would have hoped for a little substance in this book than Swisher was apparently willing to deliver. In part this may show how journalism has changed over the years.In 1971 two reporters wrote of the failed 1968 merger of the Pennsylvania and New York Central Railways (Duaghen/Binzen, \\"The Wreck of the Penn Central\\"). In this book a good deal of detail was provided on how borderline criminal financial operations, lack of detailed operational planning, and a massive failure of management caused the merger to fail almost before it began. Because of the detail provided in this book it to this day can be a guide not only for mergers, but for any type of major reorganization.In Swisher's book one learns only that the AOL-Time Warner merger failed because a lot of superheated egos were unable to cope with crash of AOL stock when the \`dotcom' bubble burst. There surely is more to the story than this. This reader would have liked to have read more about the issue of AOL acquiring access to Time-Warner's broadband cable assists and the whole problem using AOL resources for delivery of Time-Warner content. What serious thought and planning actually did either side of this merger actually do other than looking for a quarterly stock jump. If that is all they did that would be worth noting as well. Business reporting ought to be more than gossip about the personalities involved in any venture that is what \\"People Magazine\\" is for."},{"Title":"There Must Be a Pony in Here Somewhere","review":"It's nice to read a book on a potentially technical subject that is written in a more colloquial manner. The author of this book has taken that too far, though. The book is interesting in places and seems at least somewhat well researched, but the style is simply too cute, and distracts the reader with irrelevant (often autobiographical) side stories that seem to be written for people who would rather not be reading a book on this topic in the first place. I would like to think that, buried in her writing, there must be a pony somewhere, but I don't think it's worth the trouble of digging it up."},{"Title":"There Must Be a Pony in Here Somewhere","review":"Swisher's account is lively and engaging. The only quibble I have with it is that she injects herself into the story at several points, inappropriately, it seems to me; she's supposed to be a journalist, isn't she? The story is really not completely objective. But that's a small quibble; the basic facts are fairly presented as they occurred. I did enjoy reading the book."},{"Title":"There Must Be a Pony in Here Somewhere","review":"This is more than a page-turner about the ill fated deal. Ordinarily an objective reporter, Swisher gives her prescription for redeeming the consumer friendliness of the AOL Internet service -- abandoned by its management for deals: &quot;advertising&quot; and positioning deals with upstart dot coms needing IPO credibility; and the calculated megadeal of putting Time Warner's valuable &quot;traditional&quot; media assets under the dot com &quot;bubble&quot;. Inadvertently, Swisher also makes another important point: believe what you read, but be skeptical about believing it as truth. Thanks to her superlative reporting for the Wall Street Journal out of Silicon Valley, the &quot;street&quot; (if not the public) understood the radical importance of the Internet, but lost its critical faculties about which players had real businesses. Concurrently, Time Inc.'s &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine also chronicled many newsworthy Internet stories. Too many must have believed the media hype, and regrettably, too many entrepreneurs crashed when reality set in. Swisher tells the AOL Time Warner story thoroughly and dramatically. Her book should be required reading in business schools."},{"Title":"I Never Liked You","review":"In this age of post-modern, ironic, dconstructionist storytelling, it's refreshing to see someone such as Canadian writer\\\\artist Chester Brown honestly recount his early life. 'I Never Liked You', graphic novel, is an excellent and enticing introduction to both Brown and the comics medium. The story and art mesh together effortlesly and all the sentimental cliches are carefully avoided. It's a quick read, which may dissapoint you at first, but, as you find yourself needing to reread it, you'll realize that it's a virtue. 'I Never Liked You' is poetic- flowing and graceful, yet meaty enough for you to dissect any line or image and learn more about what has shaped Chester Brown to make him the great artist he is today. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"I Never Liked You","review":"This is probably the best comic book I've ever read. In I Never Liked You, Chester Brown recounts his own adolescence. He doesn't rely on quirks, self-pity, overanalysis, or an edgy drawing style. His work is simple and understated, one incident flowing into another in an apparent anecdotal fashion which, by the end, reveals a large picture of Brown's seemingly hidden feelings. It is his relationship with his mentally unstable mother that fuels this book; Brown thoughtlessly antagonizes her (as teenagers do) and struggles with his inability to say \\"I love you\\"--at least to the right people at the right time. In his youth, Brown was best able to express himself through symbolic drawings which he infused with meanings he would later claim weren't there (\\"I never use symbolism.\\") This grown-up effort seems an extension of that, as a bittersweet memoir and perhaps explanation/closure for his emotional distance."},{"Title":"I Never Liked You","review":"Chester Brown's seemingly simple graphic novel is actually a brilliantly written and drawn tale about adolesence that touches deep into your heart. Brown's ability to go deep into his past and dig up the things that haunt him most is simply incredible - it all seems so subtle, yet it's so personal and powerful. Like the recurring biscuit-eating scenes which might not mean anything but provoke so much feelings, of melancholy, loneliness, simple joy, etc.Brown's art is as much a joy to look at as his writing. The freely (yet skillfully) drawn brush work, together with the loosely (yet cleverly) laid-out pages complement the story almost to perfection.I have read and re-read the book a number of times on different occasions and personally I feel it's best when you read it in a quiet afternoon when you're all alone.Together with 'It's A Good Life, If You Don't Weaken' by Seth, 'I Never Liked You' is one of those rare graphic novel that will let you feel as if you k! now the author personally after reading it."},{"Title":"I Never Liked You","review":"I love reading graphic novels, especially from the publishing company of I Never Liked You (Drawn & Quarterly). I've read maybe a dozen or so that they've put out.

Though, as most cartoonists are outcasts and that is often shown in their work, this doesn't make a graphic novel that special. Other aspects of the book...his mother, how he dealt with other people, etc....were what really struck me as sad. Yes I've read lots of sad stories in comics, but this one just seem to ring a little truer or deeper. It may be his minimalist approach; this lets you interpret many actions for yourself in that there is not often any definite reason or meaning behind the things that happen. Nor do you really know what's always going on in the speaker's head. These things, for me, made the book much more personal, because I was interpreting the events from my point of view, not necessarily seeing exactly how the speaker was interpreting them."},{"Title":"I Never Liked You","review":"Chester Brown depicts his adolescent years with a distinct sadness and criticism. In many ways, this is a young adult's depiction of adolescence, not capturing adolescence so much as that point where you grow up enough to first realize that everyone you've ever blamed for your problems is mostly innocent and that you're the jerk. (granted some people never get to this state. THey are called sociopaths) Later on, you gain some more perspective and feel some affection for your younger nasty self. This is not that book. Chester Brown wrote this book in a state of hatred for his teenage self. You can see it in every drawing of himself as a sallow skinny jerk. You see it in his way of treating Carrie and Sky. Even the things that might be admirable like his refusal to swear are explained away.THe Chester Brown of the book is caught between two female friends - Carrie and Sky - with Connie providing a conscience that isn't really adhered to. Carrie loves him and she's depicted as a beautiful romantic creature whose only fault is bad taste. Sky is the friend that he eats with and its obvious early on that his interest in her is her breasts. He says he loves her but it comes so fast that you know that he's simply abusing the word. As an undercurrent, his mother is slowly losing her mind and as she deteriorates, the narrative keeps her off camera as she becomes less prominent in Chester's life.The fact of the matter is that this is a fine book about depicting a teenager who keeps his messed up emotions in check. However, it's not easy to stay so close to a repressed individual who doesn't allow himself to feel anything but the most superficial emotions."},{"Title":"I Never Liked You","review":"I Never Liked You is simply a recounting of various poignant moments in author Chester Brown's adolescence. I really enjoy this sort of visual narrative and found the book to be quite well done. I sat down and read the whole thing in about an hour."},{"Title":"I Never Liked You","review":"this novel is excellent. i brought it after reading the similarly accomplished 'louis riel.' of course the number of books detailing youthful angst are incalcuable, but this novel posses a quality that is so special and differnt it simply isn't fair to lump it in such a category. brown's ability to capture a sort of quiet sadness and wordless continuum of youth and suburbia is second to none. highly recommended."},{"Title":"I Never Liked You","review":"Chester Brown, I Never Liked You (Drawn and Quarterly, 1994)Run! Teen angst!Well, okay, maybe... don't run. I Never Liked You is, in fact, a stew of teen angst, it's true, and even more, an autobiographical stew of teen angst. The words \\"recipe for disaster\\" are all over this project like flies on October zucchini. And yet it manages to avoid devolving into either cheesy goth poetry or smarmy nostalgia.This is, of course, a huge mark in I Never Liked You's favor. What Brown is doing here, he's doing well-- easily as good as artist du jour Craig Thompson or the king of this particular hill, Harvey Pekar. If you're a fan of either, I have little doubt you're going to enjoy this book a great deal.The biggest problem with it, on the other side of the same coin, is that no matter how well it's done, it's been done, and it's been done in a charming, sensitive, mature way, and as much as the personal nature of the work might make you want to get all fluffy-bunny-and-cuddly-puppy, the reason you're identifying with Chester Brown's shy, awkward teenaged self is that we all went through the same stuff, sunshine.Many writers have trod this road. Some have done it better, or as well. Others have done it considerably worse, and there are many of them. This is in no way a bad book, and if you enjoy memoir-style writing and illustrating, it'll be right up your alley. ***"},{"Title":"I Never Liked You","review":"Why is Chester Brown so good? I just don'tunderstand... first Ed the Happy Clown, then thePlayboy, and then I Never Liked You...all masterpieces. No other cartoonist has maintained such quality over this many long works. He's working on Underwater right now, an incomprehensible but fascinating (don't ask me) story from a baby's point of view. My guess is when it's complete we'll all be gaping with awe at it, like I am (and you should be) over the rest of his books now"},{"Title":"I Never Liked You","review":"As stated by several previous reviewers, there are many graphic novels about teenagers coming of age, but none do it as well as Brown in this book and it's companionThe Playboy. Coming off the insanity of \\"Ed the Happy Clown\\", Brown shows how subtle a cartoonist can be in his auto-bio work. The sparse drawing and dialogue give the reader just enough without hitting you over the head. The understated beauty of the drawings work perfectly with the story told... cartooning at it's finest. And, as with most of Brown's works, repeated reading brings out understated story points that might be skimmed over upon first reading.When dealing with a medium such as comics, you are often confronted with loud, screaming, obnoxious drawing and storytelling. With this book, Brown successfully avoids all that and shows comics can be an artform. Several of the previous reviewers (who mistakenly call this work \\"overrated\\" or \\"bland\\") should take this to heart. Or, if not perceptive enough to pick up on the nuances of Brown's work, perhaps should just stick to \\"Batman\\"..."},{"Title":"I Never Liked You","review":"It's always nice when a writer can depict an unflinching look at all of the most profound moments of their lives, or at least the ones that are good examples of what shapes us. I love stories about awkward moments that end up showing us more about ourselves, but this book offers nothing more than that. The art leaves a lot to be desired, and there is absolutely no story nor much of a moral here. In fact, the main character is so positively stupid that it is near impossible to relate to his irrational stumblings through life.DON'T BUY THIS BECAUSE SOME INDIE-LOVING BOOKWORM TOLD YOU THAT IT'S GREAT. It's not. Much like many other indie comic books, it's just celebrated because it's different, and not because it's of much quality at all."},{"Title":"I Never Liked You","review":"Typical adolescent angst.

One is left scratching their head wondering why Chester Brown wrote this? The basic plot that goes nowhere is that Chester is bugged by a group of bullies who want him to say the F word and S word. Some skinny chick really digs him but, cause of that age he says he loves the girl with big boobs. As a side plot that over all had mabye 6 pages dedicated to it his mom dies......It's a very fast read cause theres nothing to look at or read....Just terrible. After reading some of his work in American Splender this was just a big disapointment.

His approach to establishing family &quot;rules&quot; is exceptional. Read in conjunction with another of his books - Five Signs of a Functional Family, you cannot go wrong.

I'll admit, I went looking for a quick fix with this book. The other Love Languages books have a quiz in the back to help you identify your language, and that's right where I went with this book: to the back. I was disappointed to find no quiz in this book, but Chapman explains that teenagers would be quick to figure out how to manipulate the system if they knew that we were trying to figure them out. The book discusses the five love languages as broken down in Chapman's other books in this series, but directs them specifically at how teenagers are affected by them. I learned so much from this book about how to talk to my kids and that both of my teens are quality time people. During the course of reading this book, I've seen a change in my daughter already. She's spent more time talking to me, because I've spent more time listening to her. This is a book I will purchase for my own bookshelf and continue the practices in it for the next 17 years (until my three-year-old turns 20)."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages of Teenagers","review":"Every parent and person that works with youths should have this book. It is THE manual for understanding teenagers. Chapman does a fantastic job of explaining that a child's language does not change when they become a teenager, but they do adopt a different dialect. How fascinating! His advice and techniques are solid and effective. Get this book and watch the way it improves your relationship with all the children in your life. It is worth its weight in gold."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages of Teenagers","review":"As a teacher, I can appreciate what this author is attempting to do, and congratulate him on succeeding in the same. This is a wonderful book!Having worked with teenagers for over twenty years, I can say that understanding the teen begins with understanding their language; not what they say--but what they mean and understand. The author has done his research here.The chapters on the use of time, and the use of praise, alone are worth the cost of this book. We are reminded that our teens are not different people than they were as children, but merely older children whose needs evolve rather than change.Rather than summarize the book (which many others have done), let me just encourage the parents and teachers of every teenager to read this book and take the suggestions to heart. The author comes from a Christian perspective, which made me appreciate his findings all the more.For Christian parents who want to delve more into helping their teenagers understand the bible rather than trying to understand their teenager, may I suggest \\"Dragons, Grasshoppers & Frogs!\\", a youth-oriented commentary on Revelation.Again, Chapman's book should be required reading for every teacher, parent, and youth minister of teenagers. I only wish my mentors had sought to understand me in this way those many years ago.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Bessie's Fortune","review":"Since getting my Kindle, I have become a MJH fan.

What many of us may not know are the particular incidents, decisions, and qualities which created the most extraordinary figure in out political history. In this one - volume biography of Abraham Lincoln, Benjamin P. Thomas presents all the significant events and achievements in the life of one of the greatest presidents, and greatest men, in American history. These achievements, Thomas maintains, are a matter of record. There is none of the easy myth - making and hero worship that often mar both longer and shorter biographical treatments. In Abraham Lincoln readers will find little of the lyrical and romanticized Lincoln, nor will they encounter the historically possible but imagined situations which sometimes adorn Carl Sandburg's narrative. What they will find is a full account of the rise to power of a skillful politician and complicated man, who took on an enourmous amount of personal and public responsibility during the greatest crisis in our nation's history. Clearly an admirer of our sixteenth president, Thomas allows the story of Lincoln's successes and failures, and his priviate tragedies, to take its natural course to a regrettable and unnatural end. He permits both the character of the man and the weighty, worrisome decisions of the president to speak eloquently for themeselves. In summing up the Lincoln legacy, Thomas achieves an eloquence of his own: Lincoln saw his countrymen as inheritors of a trust. To them it had been given to make democracy succeed, to cleanse it of the hypocrisies that deprive it of its just example in the world. For in democracy, made genuine, he saw our last, best hope of frustrating any tyrant who seeks to regiment or debase or mislead any people, anywhere and of achieving peace on earth and good will among men and woman through the universal liberty of mankind."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln a biography","review":"I have been studying Abraham Lincoln for nearly 40 years. Many Lincoln scholars consider ABRAHAM LINCOLN: A BIOGRAPHY by Benjamin P. Thomas to be one of the three best one-volume biographies of Lincoln written to date. The other two books are LINCOLN by David Herbert Donald and WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE by Stephen B. Oates."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln a biography","review":"Very readable one volume life of Lincoln. Pulled things together in a way Sandburg's six volume masterpeice could not. A case of not being able to see the forest for the trees. And made utterly clear exactly what Lincoln was fighting for: that democracy as evidenced by the people's vote at the ballot box might survive as an example to the world. If all the states had voted in elections to let the succeeding states go, then OK. But there was no such election. It was always the Union, never slavery, that was his purpose, although he understood slavery to be at the heart of the matter."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln a biography","review":"As a teenager I remember to have read a biography by Emil Ludwig that I disliked because, by the end of it, Lincoln had become a spotless person and whatever he did or said was praised beyond measure.Thompson's biography is different. Pursuant to Michael Burlingame's foreword, this work, which was written more than half a century ago, has passed the test of time with brilliant qualifications. In my opinion, this is a sober biography of Lincoln, showing him as a good and very balanced, down-to-earth, person, but not a saint or angelic figure, a long-limbed man of wit, shrewd politician, somehow socially awkward... A man in flesh and bone with virtues and defects.I think that the professional historian and the educated layperson alike can savour this book, and my rate is 5 (content) and 5 (pleasure).In addition to Thomas' classical biography, I also suggest reading the following books: 1) \\"Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era\\" by James M. McPherson (nowadays the standard, very readable, one-volume history of US Civil War); 2) \\"Perilous Times: Free Speech in Wartime: From the Sedition Act of 1798 to the War on Terrorism\\" by Geoffrey R. Stone, specially chapter II \\"The Civil War: Mr. Lincoln's First Amendment\\" (in fact, all the book is worth-reading); and 3) \\"Lincoln's Constitution\\" by Daniel A. Farber (not enthralling if compared to McPherson's and Stone's, but nevertheless interesting)."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln a biography","review":"Over a half century after this book appeared, it is still the standard by which all one-volume Lincoln biographies are measured, and a reminder of how much we lost by the author's premature death when he was just hitting his stride as a Lincoln scholar and writer."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln a biography","review":"I have previously read a couple of books about Lincoln, enough to whet my appetite for a thorough biography. I am half way through this book and I'm enjoying the treat of reading about a man who moved ahead in politics while holding uncompromisingly to his principles and ideals which were to a very large extent influenced by his reading of the Bible. I doubt this man would last two weeks in politics today. He clearly possessed superior analytical thinking ability and he definitely earned and deserved the nick-name 'Honest Abe' which makes it easy to like him. The book itself shows honesty in not portraying him as something more than human. The errors of his youth are included in the story enabling the reader realistically to follow Lincoln's learning curve in life.The book is well written and on rare occasion adds a word to my vocabulary which I appreciate. If a very uncommon word happens to be the exactly right one, the author uses it, to the benefit of the reader. After all, words are what we think with.I chose this biography because it was first published in 1952. I expected, correctly as I think it turned out, that the book would give a more straightforward picture of Lincoln. It is without the tendency of some modern authors, who admire Lincoln but don't share his esteem of Scripture, to surmise, for example, that his frequent borrowing of Biblical expressions was merely a matter of Lincoln playing up to his listeners and not evidence of personal convictions. This attributes to Lincoln an insincerity of which he was obviously incapable.The story of course also visits a mentality that existed amongst a substantial population in pre-Emancipation days. It portrays widespread reasoning and attitude toward race that today is appalling. Yet, as Lincoln acknowledged, it was largely based on people inheriting their circumstances and environment, not personally inventing it. He had initially hoped, in vain, that the passage of time and increase in public understanding would gradually shrink slavery right out of existence. We can wonder what widespread reasonings and attitudes people are accepting right now that will later be shown up as appalling.I'll add a little more to this when I've finished the book. It is a superb biography and even the physical book itself is very well made.Additional Comments: Having now finished the book I can say it is a very satisfying read and teaches much about the era and its issues as well as the man. It ends rather abruptly following the assassination and I would have appreciated a bit more about its aftermath, but altogether this book met my high expectations."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln a biography","review":"This book is fifty seven (57) years old but it is still living and breathing today.

This book is providing me with answers to all the questions I felt were unanswered on the TV biography."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln a biography","review":"I have read several books on Lincoln. Recently I purchased this book at my father's request, who is far more expert than I am. Other biographers refer to this as the definitive book, which is why he had to have it.Battle Cry of freedom is a 'cracker of a read' by James McPherson, according to my father, and won the Pulitzer Prize. This author has written several books on Lincoln, and the Civil War.As for this book, it's very good, and Benjamin Thomas is very concerned with factual accuracy. For example, he will not make up stuff if he unsure on the details. He will say he does not know, so it's easy to distinguish between fact and conjecture.The books I have read tend be more about the assassination. If that topic interests you, I recommend:If you have further interest in this topic I recommend the books:Blood on the Moon: The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln, a tremendously lucid account of events, which ties up the loose ends, particularly what happened with John Surratt. He was tried for the same crime, in a civilian court but not on the same facts. He does explore the legal standards in defining what a conspiracy is which I found helpful, and many other things.American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies:, explores not only the conspiracy, but also the life of John Wiles Booth, giving a full background. He did play the role of Brutus in a play, and so there are parallels between art and life.Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase for Lincoln's Killer (P.S.)(P.S.), which reads like a fast paced thriller while sticking to the facts.To a somewhat lesser degree The Assassin's Accomplice: Mary Surratt and the Plot to Kill Abraham Lincoln. I have browsed through this one numerous times at the local bookstore, yet have been reluctant to buy it. For one thing, she glosses over the habeas corpus issue, giving it half a page. She does not tie up the loose end of what happened with John Surratt like Steers does. She also concludes Surratt's guilt, yet I found her reasoning somewhat suspect. Her book ties in with the movie,The Conspirator (Two-Disc Collector's Edition), yet I prefer that Redford allows us to make up our own minds.I hope this review was helpful."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln a biography","review":"Abm Lincoln was excellent.

The second time was when the female developed cancer and had to be put down. The third was just recently when our 17 year old \\"little boy\\" died suddenly at a friends house when we were on vacation. I have never read a book whose author understands the love a person can have for a dog better and more eloquently.

People who truly love their pets understand and will find this book helpful."},{"Title":"Maya's first rose: diary of a very special love","review":"I wrote a blog about my beloved Manda. I needed help finding THIS BOOK - Maya's First Rose. I read it many years ago just because I worked at a vet hospital and wanted to understand more what folks losing their pets were going through. It helped me to understand even though I had never experienced such a thing.Now, in my life, I have lost one dog to brain cancer. His quick illness lasted a total of five days before I had to make the excruciating decision to have him euthanized.Now, I am watching my beloved 17 year old dog fail. She has kidney failure, heart failure, a collapsing trachea and is anemic. She still loves life, is happy and with medical help isn't suffering.I'm so thankful to author MIRALEE FERRELL for helping me find this book:Here's the blog I wrote which triggered this whole thing and helped me find this GREAT BOOK!!!Has anyone read a book called: MAYA?I can't remember the author and I'm not 100% that is the entire title. The book is a great story about a guy and his love and devotion to his dog. It takes the reader through his last days with Maya. I would love to get my hands on it again...to re-read it during this time.As I am care-taking Manda, my 17 year old Pom who has had our hearts since she entered this world, I am reminded of this book. We have been through so much together over the last 17 years! As you've read in previous blogs about my dogs, they are a huge part of our lives and bring me much joy.Manda shows so much love and dedication to me, how could I even consider turning my back on her now? While she is so ill, she is still bright and alert. She still runs to greet me with a wagging tail and kisses. She still spins in circles with excitement.Is it a lot of work? Is it inconvenient? Is it worth it? Is it keeping her from suffering? Yes to all of the above. She will begin at home \\"sub-q\\" treatments next week.Is she going to get better? Is it an investment that is going to offer financial returns? No to both. We have no idea how many days, weeks or even months she may be with us. We want each and everyday that she has left to be as good as possible.Manda had bloodwork done this week. She has been receiving treatment for over 1 year for her heart and trachea. Now, she is in full blown kidney failure and she is anemic along with being in heart failure. The meds to treat either the heart or the kidneys work against each other and the other organ involved. We are simply doing the best we can for our dog who has given so much to us over the years.It's not that I have tons of money and it is easy to just spend money on her. It is a sacrifice that we are willing to make because it needs done.I feel God gave me this little creature and it is my responsibility to take care of her in the best way possible. That doesn't mean I ignore signs and symptoms allowing her to suffer, wishing the problem would go away and wait on her to die. That doesn't mean I go to all possible life saving and trial measures such as transplants.The veterinarian cried with me at the clinic and over the phone with results. I'm a major animal lover. I'm one of those who doesn't even kill a fly or spider that gets in the house. I catch them and put them back outside. I cried when a opossum ran out in front of the car and my hubby couldn't miss it. I really wonder where I came from sometimes. I have no idea where or how I developed such a love for animals. I didn't grow up with animals lovers but at a young age I began rescuing animals! For some reason, God made me this way!I hope I can have the courage necessary to continue taking care of her in the best way possible. I find myself trying to touch her more, look at her more and enjoy our last times together even more."},{"Title":"Maya's first rose: diary of a very special love","review":"If you're looking for a book that is creepy and horrendously dull, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Maya's first rose: diary of a very special love","review":"Mourning the loss of my own dog, I thought of myself as one who loves animals, likely too much, maybe even on the fringe of lunacy. I now know how well-adjusted I am, because in the author I have discovered the real lunatic fringe. With each passing chapter, my empathy decreased, reaching absolute zero when I read on page 81, \\"What I will not understand as long as I live is why some people value the life of a person over the life of an animal.\\" And this comes after he tells us that he feeds his dog hamburgers! When were cows exiled from the animal kingdom? Yes, I can see preferring the love and unconditional dedication of a dog to putting up with finicky humans, but equating the value of a dog's life to that of a person's life?Should the reader expect a story of Maya's life and love, the proportion of the book that deals with dying will come as a surprise. We learn precious little of Maya herself, but lots about her owner and his compulsion to make her comfortable to the very end. Neither do we learn how to deal with the death of our own pet. Indeed the more guilt-ridden readers are made to bathe in even more guilt once they realize, in comparing their own behaviour to the author's, how unloving they must be."},{"Title":"Maya's first rose: diary of a very special love","review":"I had heard the book was good, and I was sickened with it when I read it. The author gets quite melodramatic with his story. (Of course, I may be slightly biased, as I had the grave misfortune to have worked indirectly for the author shortly after the book was published. I seem to remember the author not treating people nearly as well as he apparently treated his dog.) I found the book to be a lot of whining from a man who became unusually attached to a dog; probably one of the few living creatures he couldn't offend.

As the current owner of a 14-year old airedale mix with not much time left on this earth, reading about Kosins' story with his beloved Maya really hit home. A short book and an easy read (I suggest one sitting), this relentless tear-jerker is beautiful and almost poetic. While it is true that Kosins' sometimes over-the-top behavior to make his dog's life better in her later years (quitting his job, cutting himself off from friends) may be difficult to identify with, this also helps us realize the level of devotion Kosins felt. A wonderful -- though heartbreaking -- read for any dog lover, preferable on a rainy Sunday afternoon with that special someone (somedog?) curled at your feet."},{"Title":"Maya's first rose: diary of a very special love","review":"A friend gave me this book after I lost my first dog, a rescued collie-shepherd mix who had became my asthma alert dog and saved my life several times.Yes, it's sappy and emotional, and anyone who has never truly bonded with a dog will not understand it.

To persons not in a state of grief (or facing the old age of their beloved pet) it may come across as over-the-top; but for those living with the sharp and intimate pain of losing a beloved companion animal--all I can say is, I read this and cried my eyes out, and somehow it helped."},{"Title":"Maya's first rose: diary of a very special love","review":"I will keep this short and sweet.

I've read his famous dog prose on the 4 stages of a dogs life before (which is not in this book) and been touched, but this book was so much more than I ever expected. His final poem in the book, which is also called Maya's First Rose, is a haunting and memorable work of poetry that I have saved and will send out to those people who I know who have loved and lost a dog.I was shocked I must say to see the callous hearted \\"reviews\\" some people have here at Amazon about this same lovely book.

I have always loved animals and have had a special connection and love for those that share my life. Many times I feel a bit \\"crazy\\" for loving my animals the way I do but reading this book made me realize that I am not alone. The connection we get from our pets is something that we just can't get anywhere else; it's completely special in its own way. The devotion this man showed toward his dog is an inspiration.

This book was published in 1996, but the so-called hero treats his wife as though the feudal system of the 1800s is alive and well - she is his PROPERTY, and everybody had better remember it! is his attitude. This \\"hero\\" is a domineering bully, a manipulative [...], and the more cruelly he treats his timid wife, the more she declares her love for him! The masochistic \\"stand by your man\\" type of woman will just love this book. The hero Logan treats her like a child whose every decision must be made for her, and ONLY his own opinion and needs count for anything. Of course, the \\"heroine\\" is a wimpy spineless creature who can't stand up for herself against either her psychologically abusive husband OR her unfeeling father. Naturally, the books ends with the cliche to end all cliches - she is hit by a car, and at her bedside, Logan declares his undying love, and she naturally declares she will love him forever.

It's so bad I actually knocked half a point off the book's final rating. DAW, who usually came up with top-notch artists to do Moorcock covers, really dropped the ball in the Runestaff series, and this is the nadir. Cover it, school-textbook style, before reading.That said, the book itself is top-notch, one of the better novels in the whole Eternal Champion cycle. Dorian Hawkmoon, reluctant servant of the Runestaff and another incarnation of the Eternal Champion, is off on the quest to find the last piece of the puzzle he needs to strike back at the Granbretanian army, an artifact called the Sword of the Dawn. Needless to say, getting his hands on it will not be easy...The same cast of characters from the first two novels returns, along with some throwaway characters, a new villain or two, and all the adventure one could possibly want. As well, The Sword of the Dawn is set on a new continent in the purview of the Eternal Champion, Amarehk (yes, it is what you think it is), and Moorcock's descriptions of the city of Nawlin (yes, it's at the delta of the big river) are perhaps the most detailed urban descriptions in the whole series.The novel could probably stand on its own without too much of the ongoing plot being lost, but aspiring Moorcock readers are encouraged to read the whole series (preferably after those of Elric, Corum, and Erekose, at least). ****"},{"Title":"THE MAD GOD'S AMULET.","review":"Michael Moorcock created a whole mess of heroic characters, the most indisputably famous being that moody albino, Elric of Melnibon&eacute;. But there were also Corum and Michael Kane and Jerry Cornelius and a host of others. But above all of them, it was Dorian Hawkmoon von K&ouml;ln whom I liked best. And it's not because he's more heroic or better or whatever. Maybe it boils down to something as simple as that Dorian Hawkmoon isn't as tragic or alienated a creature as the other Eternal Champions. Hawkmoon is just the easiest to like.Hawkmoon's exploits are chronicled in The History of the Runestaff and the Chronicles of Castle Brass, seven books in total. The world he inhabits is a post-apocalyptic Earth set in the far flung future, sometime after the Tragic Millennium. In Hawkmoon's time, depraved sorcery and mad science are at work. Europe is brittle, fragmented into warring kingdoms. The detritus of England has evolved into the island kingdom of Granbretan. Called the Dark Empire, Granbretan, ruled by a foul immortal being, has set its eyes on global conquest. It's making it look easy.In the tiny, faraway province of Kamarg, Count Brass doesn't concern himself much with the insatiable encroachments of the Dark Empire. That is, until he receives a visit from Baron Meliadus, a treacherous emissary from Granbretan. Seeking to worm into Count Brass's good graces and coveting his beautiful daughter Yisselda, the Baron oversteps himself and is unceremoniously ejected from Kamarg. The incensed Meliadus, skulking away, vows bloody vengeance. And he swears this oath on the Runestaff. O crapdiddle.It must be understood that when one makes a vow on the Runestaff - that ancient artifact said to guard all the secrets of destiny - one then sets strange forces into motion. And so, in the course of time, the unwitting players of Meliadus' revenge play are swept away into a terrifying future, signified by blood and death and hellish war and by foulest black magic and twisted technologies. And the young Duke of K&ouml;ln, Dorian Hawkmoon, bedeviled by a black jewel on his skull, and who once rebelled against the Dark Empire, will play a central role.In the 1960s Michael Moorcock became the clear successor to E.R. Burroughs and Robert E. Howard. Moorcock is, honestly, somewhere near the top of my list as a master craftsman of sword and sorcery adventures. In the Runestaff novels, the Englishman's imagination is predictably outlandish and inventive, and his pacing is such on overdrive that you might not even notice that character development hardly ever darkens these pages. Crack these books open and feast your eyes on passages of pure escapism. Moorcock writes some wild images; the landscapes are peopled with marvelously exotic and freakish creatures; the evil empire, with its sinister science and sorcery, seems truly malevolent. And then there are the ghosts and the alternate dimensions. Hawkmoon ends up enduring some really harrowing stuff. Thru the course of four novels, he'll embark on one quest after another, seeking to unearth several peculiar talismans. The Red Amulet. The Sword of the Dawn. And, finally, the destiny-shaping Runestaff itself.So, yeah, crack these books open and see how Hawkmoon's strange cloak of apathy is pierced. Then see Hawkmoon meet his boon companion, Oladahn the tiny giant. See him also cross paths with the enigmatic Warrior in Jet and Gold and the renegade Frenchman Huillam d'Averc, and also see him soar to the skies on the back of a flamingo (although, hmm, that last one does sound a bit foofoo). The Duke of K&ouml;ln's fight against the Dark Empire is chronicled in THE JEWEL IN THE SKULL, THE MAD GOD'S AMULET, THE SWORD OF THE DAWN, and THE RUNESTAFF, and these are the four books which constitute The History of the Runestaff. They're absolute must-reads if you're a fan of sword & sorcery epics, although when I mention \\"epic,\\" I don't mean to imply that these books run at 500 pages each. Back in the day, brevity was the habit and the writer was able to tell a rousing story before your page-flippin' fingers formed calluses. I pretty much hold Stephen King responsible for the likes of Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind.But blood and thunder, I think, sum up the Hawkmoon chronicles. Actually sums up most of Michael Moorcock's works, come to think of it. The biggest difference is that Dorian Hawkmoon comes off as a likable and comparably uncomplicated guy, his baggage not as crippling as Moorcock's other heroes. Sometimes, the sheer angst gets to me. Really, would it hurt Elric or Corum to smile once in a while?"},{"Title":"THE MAD GOD'S AMULET.","review":"Not a lot here to really make this book shine, and a few things that let it down.Very lazy plotting - we just get thrown about here and there. That could be part of the fun, and there is something of the D & D silly campaign where a hundred unlikely events are meant to happen to our intrepid adventurers. Still it gets a bit too silly for me, and I'm getting to not really care that much about the Warrior in Jet and Gold who can just turn up magically along with any era shaping magical item. Same with the deadly foe - far too lazy in just saying, \\"Oh, sure, they all got routed and defeated, um, and a million of them got killed ... but, ah, NOW there's, um TWO MILLION, and the bad guy didn't really die, and they're back!\\". I mean, who cares? Either something magical suddenly shows up that will defeat them all, or, even if you do, suddenly they'll just somehow regroup to be back to threaten again in the next sequel. The heroes are embarrassingly standard in the way they can fight all day hugely outnumbered with dwindling remains of their army being cut down around them, but, of course, not suffer a scratch and have nothing more than a bit of fatigue. Yisselda as heroine becomes utterly clich&eacute;d: here, let me just stand to one side being feminine and either helpless or emotionally/sexually supportive. Oh, and Hawkmoon starts getting all broody - save me from broody heroes! Ugh.I was just about never \`in' the story, I was always outside looking in, and frequently shaking my head at the level of guff.The casual background of atrocities gets a bit sickening after a while, and also feels lazy and contrived, \\"Oh, yeah, THIS guy was so bad, he, um, got people's babies and killed them. (Hang on, I've done that one). And then he ate them! (Oh, done that one too). In front of the mother!!! (Yeah, that'll do).\\" This gets offensive pretty quick, especially when I think it's meant to be, you know, hard core - Moorcock saying his bad guys are, well, really bad - it's spotty nerds who've never punched someone in their life trying to impress each other with fight scenes. The author feels nothing for these throwaway victims, we're not really meant to either, they're just a bit of local colour (cf. the similarly blithe use of comic atrocity in Goodkind's second rate Wizard's First Rule). Thus D'Averc can simply flip from villain to hero because all those people he blithely killed were, remember, only MINOR characters.It's all pretty bleak: I could maybe cope with the lazy plotting if we were having some fun on the way (as Fafard and the Grey Mouser at times do without this oppressive background), but the only hope of the book is the action. It's hard to care about the action when we know the author can and will just randomly pull out something from nowhere with no reference to a wider world (oh, hey, here's an ancient civilisation with vastly superior technological weapons we've stumbled onto. Phew, that was lucky).So, after giving The Jewel in the Skull a bit of a rap I'm not so keen to move onto volume 3 (except to work out whether I should just clear this stuff from my bookshelves altogether).2*"},{"Title":"THE MAD GOD'S AMULET.","review":"Michael Moorcock, The Mad God's Amulet (DAW, 1968)The adventures of Dorian Hawmoon, last duke of Koln, continue in The Mad God's Amulet, the second novel in the Chronicle of the Runestaff. Hawkmoon, with the immediate dangers of the first novel neutralized, wants nothing more than to return to the Kamarg and his friends. Of course, this is fantasy literature, where nothing is simple. He gets sidetracked a couple of times, we spend some more time in the company of the mysterious Warrior in Jet and Gold, things blow up, old enemies return, new enemies crop up, and then there's the Mad God of the title. All of which, of course, happens at the same time that the full might of Granbretan's army marches on the Kamarg, the last European outpost of independence against the depraved King-Emperor Huon.Fun stuff. Very easy reading. All the womderful things I said about the first book still apply. Unfortunately, so do the pervasive typographical errors in the DAW editions. Whoever was asleep at the wheel the first time must have lapsed into a coma, because they are even more frequent here.

I can't say enough about what this ancient and yet revolutionary process of working with the subconcious mind has done to manifest real and lasting results for me. Having now worked with these concepts, I understand that this process not only works but has given me a new, more peaceful and emotionally secure way of life. Although I recieved this book as a gift the cost is insignificant compared to the results I've been able to achieve. The book is structured very well with a step by step process described in each chapter. I have also found that the organization that produced the book has other publications that are available on the same subject and in more detail. It's an easy read but very powerful when practiced."},{"Title":"Henry VI, Part I (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"With The First Part of Henry the Sixth Shakespeare comes into his own and displays the full mastery of his talents.Staged action used to show dramatic tension characterizes and defines Shakespeare's style. We read Shakespeare with difficulty because he wrote plays meant to be seen and heard. Christopher Marlowe and others wrote plays that are easier to read because their lines are merely recited explanations, or at least that is my impression when I read Marlowe's Faust or Edward II. A Marlowe play has the main characters walk onto the stage and explain what is going on in their lives, while Shakespeare's plays presents people doing things as they would in the world, albeit in eloquently condensed and dramatized form. All the world's a stage and people merely players, says Touchstone in As You Like It. Shakespeare puts as much of the real world, action and all, on stage as he can.Henry VI part 1 holds the earliest scene we can identify as typical Shakespearean drama. In act II scene four, Richard Plantagenet, Edmund Beaufort Duke of Somerset and others walk into a garden away from eavesdroppers to debate Richard's claim to the Dukedom of York. His father had held this title but was executed as a traitor and had his titles stripped from him. Richard protests his father was falsely accused and wrongfully condemned. Somerset holds the courts were just and Richard has no claim in law. No one else dares speak. Plots and machinations could get someone killed. So since no one speaks, Richard plucks a white rose from the garden and urges those who support him to do the same. Somerset plucks a red rose.Shakespeare is not _explaining_ to us why the civil war that will tear England apart for four plays is called the War of the Roses. Through the physical actions of the players, he is _showing_ us the reason why. Never mind that this is pure invention, it is dramatic.Henry VI Part One opens his cycle on the English civil war and continues it with Parts Two and Three to finally close it with Richard III. Anything as momentous as a war lasting four whole plays must have a cause. This play begins with the funeral procession of Henry V and shows his son losing all of his fathers conquest in France. England is sinking and Henry VI's courtiers are all busy fighting each other for control of England rather than for her good. Henry VI is presented as a nice, generous, human being but nice guys finish last.The hero of this play is Talbot. Only he among all the King's knights is fighting for England. He needs help. While this duke bickers with that earl about whether or not he has anything he can risk, Talbot falls in battle and dies, confirming the loss of France.The villain of the play is Joan of Arc. Today she's a saint (literally) she is to France what George Washington is to the United States, and she is a feminist icon. Shakespeare portrays her as an immoral, opportunistic witch who deserves in the end to be burned at the stake. That wouldn't go down well with a modern audience and this might explain why the play isn't performed often these days.Vincent Poirier, TokyoNote: Jane Howell's BBC production is a must-see. She directs all four plays in the cycle, Henry VI Parts One through Three and Richard III, and directs them as a single cycle. She uses the same basic set for all four plays but has this set gradually degrade with each play. It goes from clean colorful solid decors to an assemblage of dingy dark broken walls, illustrating the collapse of order brought on by Henry's weakness.VP"},{"Title":"Henry VI, Part I (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"\\"Henry V\\" and \\"Richard III\\" seem to be the most popular history plays of Shakespeare. But I myself lean towards this one. The play starts with the wedding of King Henry VI and Queen Margaret. At this point in the war between France and England, France has gained the upper hand, but England does still control Calais, Anou, Maine, Normandy, and some areas around Bordeaux. Well, the virtuous Gloucester (and the only remaining son of King Henry IV) is shocked that Anjou and Maine have to be returned to france as well. This angers York, and he thinks this is just reason to act on his claim to the crown. (In history, York was VERY LOYAL to Henry VI, and it was SEVERAL things including some threats from Margaret that made him take up arms.)Moving on, we later see that Glouceter's wife has her eyes on the crown. Meanwhile, Margaret is growing weary of King Henry VI, and her affair with Suffolk becomes more prevalent. Act 1 ends with the dramatic scene of Pagan Prophecies and Lady Glouceter's arrest.Act 2 begins with the comical scene of the false miracle. Though the comedy breaks when Gloucester learns of his wife's treason. York gathers his alies Salisbury and Warwick and plans his moves to seize the crown. In one of his stronger moments, King Henry VI orders the execution of those who plotted against him. Though he is smart and treats Lady Glouceter more gently. (Public Penance)Later, we learn that England has lost all of its land in France. (Thoughin history they still held Calais, and would continue to do so even in the later reigns of King Henry VIII and his son Edward VI.)Moving on, York, Somerset, the Cardinal, Suffolk, and Queen Margaret all accuse Gloucester of treason. He defends himself with dignity, but is arrested. King Henry VI is often rebuked for his weakness here, but he does recover to banish the vile Suffolk. Perhaps one of the greatest scenes is 3.3 when the Cardinal dies in the midst of insanity (quite possiblyover the guilt of Gloucester). Yet King Henry VI forgives him: \\"Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.\\"Act 4 is dominated mostly by the rebel Jack Cade. He has launched an uprising against the king, and is quite theatrical and offers some comical moments. He gets far, but is eventually defeated by Buckingham and Clifford. Cade escapes, but is soon killed by Iden.Onto the final act. York returns from Ireland in arms, but Buckingham convinces him that King Henry has consented to his demands and imprisoned Somerset. This proves not to be, and York and his sons Edward and Richard take up arms, and the war begins. York does gain the advantage here, but things aren't over. King Henry VI and Margaret escape. And Young Clifford finds his father killed by the Yorks. (And now Clifford wants revenge.) This passage on revenge combines hatred, beauty, and sorrow well.Overall, this is arguably the strongest of the history plays."},{"Title":"Little Fox Goes to the End of the World","review":"Little Fox is tired of having to play in the same area day after day.

But they are clear and attractive, with suitably theatrical imaginary landscapes, reminiscent of Mercer Mayer's &quot;One Monster After Another&quot;.My own children liked this book when they were young, even though they knew the other, arguably better books I have mentioned. There's no harm in re-working familiar material when it is this well done."},{"Title":"Eblaitica: Essays on the Ebla Archives an Deblaite Language (Publications of the Center for Ebla Research at New York University) (Publications of the Center for Ebla Research at New York University)","review":"There are four volumes in this series; if you buy this book you will be getting volume 2 (volume 1 was printed in 1987, volume 2 in 1990, and volume 3 in 1992, volume 4 in 2002).If you are looking at this book, you may already know about Ebla, but if not... Ebla is an ancient city of Syria dating to the Early Bronze age -- ~2400 B.C. In the 1970s an Italian excavation team discovered 7000 cuneiform tablets (busted into about 15000 pieces) in this ancient city. The Ebla tablets contain a new language, and are relevant to Biblical studies for their linguistic ties to Hebrew. Sadly, the publication of the Ebla tablets in translation (English translation) has been slow going -- instead of a book of translated tablets, we have these fine volumes at our disposal. This volume is a collection of technical essays (not all in English) on Ebla and the tablets. Some of the highlights of this book include an article on the gods of Canaan, a discussion of Northwest Semitic studies, and a paper by I. M. Diakonoff on Ebla and linguistics.This volume is nice, but one is left wanting more (as in more of the actual translated Ebla texts themselves)!"},{"Title":"Attracting Hummingbirds and Butterflies to Your Backyard : Watch Your Garden Come Alive With Beauty on the Wing","review":"I received this for Christmas and have read it three times since then, referring to it constantly as I build our new hummingbird/butterfly friendly backyard. Sally Roth has changed the way I garden - her relaxed style, her obvious pleasure in her subject, the wonderful photographs, great descriptions of hummingbirds, butterflies and the plants to sustain them, have made organic gardening accessible and understandable. I have always had a no-spray garden, but always felt some distress when things started getting chewed, as will happen. Now I look eagerly for the first signs of 'munching' on the passiflora I just planted, hoping for some fritillary action. Host plants are now mixed in with the nectar flowers - and I can't wait to see a monarch caterpillar on the milkweed! Thanks, Sally! I have hung up the big giant strawberry feeder with pride!"},{"Title":"Attracting Hummingbirds and Butterflies to Your Backyard : Watch Your Garden Come Alive With Beauty on the Wing","review":"This is a super resource. It has great info on both the host and nectar plants of butterflies, talks to the different needs of hummingbirds and the plants they like, how to set up the garden to be most inviting. There are full chapters on things like \\"the lure of water\\", \\"the shletering garden\\", garden designs, butterfly & hummingbird behavior, etc. There's a section on hummingbird feeders as well as butterfly feeders (rotting fruit - they love it!) It's a great into to the lives of butterflies and hummingbirds, explaining the cycles they go through and their needs and has really straightforward info/ideas on how to create the habitat that will be right for them. The photographs of the caterpillars, butterflies and hummingbirds (even one feeding young in a nest) are fantastic. It also tells (a little bit) about how caterpillars overwinter. Really one of the best books I've seen on the topic - glad I bought it - its a lot of fun! I highly recommend it for anyone looking to set up a garden to attract these folks or augment an existing garden. Build it and they will definitely come! We've had great succeses!"},{"Title":"Attracting Hummingbirds and Butterflies to Your Backyard : Watch Your Garden Come Alive With Beauty on the Wing","review":"I've read a number of gardening books lately, as I have decided to start gardening. This is one of the best. There are beautiful photographs and illustrations of flowers, butterflies and hummingbirds. The author has an obvious love of the subject.

It analyses one of the most important caracteristics of literature to be studied: the relation between trivial books and classics, based on the concepts of surface structure and profound structure. Beyond this, he conducts an always critical discourse, supported by a humanistic and detailed knowledge of phylosophy, history, psycanalisys and marxist theory of economics among others. His benefits on many human knowledge areas are uncommensurable but uncommonly unrecognized. This book is truly one of my must-read. I recommend it; more than a fantastic and enjoyable reading, you will live a new experience."},{"Title":"Is there Pre-Columbian Writing at Teotihuacan?","review":"This book discusses whether symbols at Teotihuacan are a writing system or not. I won't give away the answer, but if you're interested in this part of the world (Mesoamerica) or in this part of history, it's worth checking it out. You can see all the different pictures at the site and there's a discussion about how linguists go about deciding whether it's a language or not. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"America's Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I have been using a crock pot for years -- but this is the first crockpot cookbook that I have come across that has such simple recipes and instructions, and very helpful hints. Everything I have made so far is wonderful, and I love being able to prepare the recipes the night before. I started with the &quot;Comforting Shredded Beef&quot; (without the brandy and with red cooking wine)which was a real winner with my family, especially with my oldest son who is an extremely picky eater (he can't wait for me to make it again). I just can't get over that something with so few ingredients could taste so good. I served it on toasted sausage rolls with melted motzeralla cheese. I never had a chance to try the Philly Beef Wraps because my (picky) son kept eating the leftovers every day after school as a snack. Next I tried the &quot;Chicken Stew with Rosemary Dumplings.&quot; (I used boneless-skinless chicken breasts.) The chicken was absolutely wonderful. But make sure the broth is bubbling when you add the dumplings - I was too impatient and the dumplings looked like pancakes (but they still tasted good). And yesterday I tried the &quot;Southern Barbecued Pork on a Bun.&quot; And it was another winner (with the whole family)! I have just put together &quot;Rich Vegetable Broth with Meatballs&quot; and can't wait to try it tomorrow. To have everyone agree that a dinner was great is a miracle - and I've had three miracles in the past ten days (since I received this cookbook). I just want to keep trying recipe after recipe. Unfortunately, I can only try one recipe at a time in my favorite crockpot (a large oval that looks like a roaster). I hope that if you read this that you have as much luck has I've had. I wish to thank the other reviewers because this is why I decided to purchase this cookbook."},{"Title":"America's Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"Slow cookers really do make great food and they allow you to manage your time and your life, but if the recipe doesn't work then you've just wasted 6 hours of cooking. I've tried easy cabbage roll casserole, texas-style barbecued brisket sandwiches, savory orange turkey breast and roast pork with tangy cranberry sauce-they were all easy to make and tasted great. But best of all were the desserts-I've made baked lemon sponge and cranberry apple cobbler. My family ate it faster than I could serve them. All the recipes I've made worked and my family loved how they tasted. This is a book I would recommend to all of my friends."},{"Title":"America's Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"There are so many mouth-watering recipes in this book that when my husband and I sat down to read &quot;food poetry&quot; to each other recently, this was one of the books we used. We both enjoy cooking and eating good food, so naturally we collect a lot of wonderful cookbooks. Besides reading a cookbook for a recipe, we might also read one as if it was a novel or a book of poetry. (If you have a significant other and love good food, try reading \\"food poetry\\" to each other...you might like it.)Ever since I was a young adult when \\"crockpots\\" first came on the scene, everyone had a copy of Mable Hoffman's &quot;Crockery Cookery&quot;. Slow cooking has always been a part of my cooking life. I still consider Hoffman's cookbooks the standard by which all other slow cooker cookbooks are compared. With this book, however, Donna-Marie Pye is giving Mable a run for her money.Recently I purchased yet another slow cooker...this time a really BIG one. Of course when I purchase a new kitchen &quot;toy&quot;, I have to buy a new book to go along with it. As I perused all the slow cooking books on the bookstore's shelf, I pulled Hoffman's newly revised \\"Crockery Cookery\\" book out by instinct. I looked over it and thought it was, as expected, very good. Then I reached for Pye's book. \\"Mmmm, this one sounds really good too\\" I mumbled. After much comparison, Pye's book won out and came home with me that day.As the above title suggests, there are a lot of &quot;comfort foods&quot; in this book. That's one of the beauties of slow cooking. But there is more than this in Pye's book. She has put a lot of creative thinking into these recipes, giving slow cooking more versatility and flavor than ever before.Slow cookers and crockpots are not just one of those \\"gimmicky\\" kitchen appliances, as some have suggested. It is here to stay thanks in part to people like Donna-Marie Pye.Mable, I still love you too."},{"Title":"America's Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"The recipies in this book are excellent; the novice can follow them with ease yet they are interesting enough for the experienced cook to not get bored. Many are very easily adaptable, and they run the gamut from well-known BBQ to a delightful curry dish most people don't often try for fear of complexity.Slow cookers are the busy person's blessing. No time to cook? Toss it in the cooker, and head to work, school, wherever. Great for college students, who can't often have a toaster oven in their dorms, but a small cooker provides little trouble. It is also an excellent place to begin one's journey into the land of crock pot entrees.A few regrets: I wish the spine was sturdier; mine is bent from reading and using and nearly falling apart. While the title says &quot;America's Best Slow Cooker Recipies&quot; interestly enough, the author was apparently either Canadian or has lived in Canada during the writing, and so the book talks about various Canadian holidays and such.I have to say that out of all my slow cooker cook books this was money well spent. I use this one before any others. Since I am extremely picky about my cookbooks, I am sure that most folks will find this a true gem of their kitchen.I know that I couldn't live without my crockpot; with this book you won't be able to either."},{"Title":"America's Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"If you work all day and are responsible for feeding everyone at dinnertime, it's so nice to come home to a cooked meal (even if you did it yourself.) That's the beauty of the slow cooker. Problem is, not every regular recipe works in the crockpot. The evaporation of water is less in a closed pot than in a rapidly boiling pan on the stove. That's is why your favorite stew recipe may come out watery when you make it in the crockpot.This book has two of my favorite recipes (stuffed cabbage and barbecued brisket) that my mom made for us when we grew up, but perfected for the slow cooker. This means I can make favorites in the crockpot but know they will come out correctly.The artichoke dip is great--and the slow cooker keeps it warm during a party. That's another great use of the crockpot. It can keep foods warm for parties and buffets.I can't recommend this book enough; it really helps me get more out of the slow cooker and better results, too."},{"Title":"America's Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I've made several recipes from this cookbook, and my 8-year old loved all of them. So did I, and so did her rather picky father, so this is the book for our family. (This is no surprise, since she is a working mother who seems to cook this way for her children.) It includes many recipes that are similar to ones I have, so that I can adapt them easily to the slow cooker. I had no success with Mabel Hoffman's original cookbook - the times didn't seem to be right, and things would come out scorched or funny tasting. The recipes I made from this book came out delicious. They're easy to make also, not requiring a lot of preparation. Many use healthy canned goods, such as tomatoes or beans.

However, I didn't give it 5 stars because the book itself could be better. There are only pictures for about 10-15% of the recipes and the text is sometimes redundant (almost all the recipes say to add a salad and crunchy french bread (or roll, etc.). Don't see why this is necessary since it's repeated again and again. Also, the text is a very bland-looking font and black and white...this could be improved. The book also is difficult to lay flat.

The last one is the only one I'll bother to repeat. The others were edible, but totally boring and overcooked by the time I got home, even though I followed the cooking recommendations (I even read the intro). I was hoping against hope that this book would allow me to come home to wonderful meals. One thing I can say is that the food I cooked was probably very healthy.

I made the \\"Aunt Beatty's Apple Betty\\" tonight, and it was absolutely delicious. I can't wait to try more of the recipes. They're easy but they range from comforting to elegant - and trust me - if I can do it, anybody can! Thank you, Donna Marie Pye! (My husband of thirteen years is amazed.)

While the intro gave me some spot-on advice about the art of slow-cooking, I find the recipes seem to have been a bit neglected by the author. I made the Burgundy Beef with Wild Mushrooms, and although it turned out reasonably well, it was only because I altered the ingredient quantities when the stated amounts were obviously wrong. It was painfully apparent that this recipe had NOT been tested prior to publication. I think this book could be useful to the seasoned cook who will be able to see when the recipe is noticeably unbalanced, but it might cause some heartache for the less experienced cook who will surely end up make some very unappetizing dishes through no fault of their own.

To me it is an indispensable commodity that makes life so much easier for the those of us who work outside the home. I can toss all kinds of nutritious goodies into that marvellous wonder and come home to a ready cooked meal! Readers will not be disappointed in the recipes contained in this book; they truly are some of the best I have seen for slow cookers. There is something about the rich, flavourful taste which comes from slow cooking that cannot be duplicated in quite the same way by any other cooking method. The pork roast with peach chutney was my favourite recipe, but all of the main meal recipes I tried were delicious. This is a fantastic book and most deserving of a five-star rating."},{"Title":"America's Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I love using my crockpot, but have had a difficult time finding good recipes that don't call for a can of creamed soup or other highly processed ingredients. I like this book pretty well for reasonably healthy and varied meals, but I have definitely had mixed results. With a little bit of adaptation, I have been able to make most of what I tried work.A couple of the most successful ones have been the Cheesy Tortellini Bake, the Rich Vegetable Broth w/Meatballs (though why it is called \\"vegetable broth\\" I do not know, because the recipe calls for beef stock!), and the Bargain Beef Stroganoff. They are delicious and I've made them several times each. I had high hopes for the salmon loaf but the only word I can use for that recipe is...vile. The crockpot does not treat canned salmon kindly. It was pale, wet and way too fishy. The \\"Thai Chicken Thighs\\" were also seriously underseasoned, but I was able to correct that. Last week I made the \\"Basic Spaghetti Sauce Italiano\\" which called for 2 pounds of ground meat to one 28 ounce can of tomatoes. Once I got it assembled, it clearly needed another can of tomatoes - without it, it would have been a sludgy mass of ground meat. Adding another can of tomatoes meant I had to adjust the seasonings. Once I did all that, it was delicious. Today I made \\"Fia's Pasta Sauce\\" which has the opposite problem - it calls for four 28 ounce cans of tomatoes AND a cup of red wine. I put three cans of tomatoes in my crockpot and saw that I would not have room for another, and the cup of wine. I just wonder if someone tested these recipes before this book was published?In short, experienced cooks and people comfortable with substitutions and adaptations can use this book as a jumping-off point for crockpot recipes. A novice cook who needs to follow a recipe exactly and have a good result will want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"America's Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I've used this cookbook at least a couple of times a week since I bought it.

It has everyday recipes with &quot;normal&quot; ingredients. There are very few crockpot recipes that you can just pour all the ingredients in and it makes itself, only bread makers have that feature. Recipes do require prepping, but it is still quicker and easier than slaving over the hot stove after working all day. A short period of prep, leave for the day, possibly another short prep time and a home cooked yummy meal in less than 30 minutes total of your time. Especially nice if you have the bread maker set up too, and add a bag of pre-packaged salad and you are good to go."},{"Title":"America's Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I love a good slow cooker, and this book has some interesting recipes to take full advantage of it.

There is certainly a crime: for the eight days preceding the opening of the book a murder has been committed in some part of the country at the same time every day, presumably by the same terrorist group. Now economist Daniel Dupont has been murdered, or has he? Wallas is sent from the Bureau to solve the crime---or is he really the assassin? The book has action and even an ending, but there the similarity with the mystery novel ends. It is more like the British television series \\"The Prisoner\\" that aired in the 70's.The action goes back and forth between flashbacks, characters, and ruminations. The same scene is described over and over from the viewpoint of different characters...or is it an imagined event? One character climbing a stairs dissolves into another character climbing a different stairs (or is it) dissolves into another (or is it) character obsessing about how he will climb the same set of stairs. The sound of a buzzer dissolves into the sound of a woman's voice. Another character plans a detailed suicide, but it is only in the imagination of the local police inspector, who realizes there are social limitations to who can be accused of a murder and is determined to report a believable suicide. And is it the hero staring into the canal or the bartender staring into the fishtank?In the end we are left to sort out the fantasies from actual happenings and possible motivations. The author gives cryptic clues: a picture of lightning striking a tower as two figures fall out of it resembling a tarot card, and the mutterings of a drunk who spouts riddles about Oedipus \\"What animal is parricide in the morning, incestuous at noon, and blind at night?\\" Who is betrayed, and who is a position to betray? And what about the theory of the inspector's assistant that an illigitimate son has committed murder to collect the inheritance?If you like 'The Prisoner', you will like this. If you want a mystery novel with predictable dialogue and action, pick up Agatha Christie or Mickey Spillane."},{"Title":"The Erasers: A Novel (An Evergreen Book)","review":"I read this many years ago after borrowing it from a friend and had to buy it now to own it and re-read it. My friend read it for a class and came to love it. He told me about and I found the plot intriquing. It's more than that. It's fascinating! Robbe-Grillet writes in such an unusual style which you soon grab on to, and then it pulls you in. As another reviewer said, take nothing for granted. Everything is important. If you like trite stories with no plot aside from the &quot;been there done that&quot; type, then don't buy this. You'll probably hate it. But if you enjoy being captivated by a story, and want a story and plot line to take you somewhere, this is it. This is a story which requires you to think. The story and the plot fold in and on themselves and becomes tangled, but then unfolds and reveals the brilliant mind of the author. A literary masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The Erasers: A Novel (An Evergreen Book)","review":"The narration and elaborate descirptions in this book lure the reader in more and more. You cannot let one single aspect of the narration escape you, it's too important to the impact of the ending. There is also a plot within a plot in this book; the unfolding of events is extremely well done. I couldn't put it down because as the reader, you feel more omnicient than the characters and can't wait to see the final outcome."},{"Title":"The Erasers: A Novel (An Evergreen Book)","review":"Although his first novel and written when Robbe-Grillet was still quite young, *The Erasers* has most of the stylistic and thematic elements that characterize his later and greater work. Which is to say, *The Erasers* is a good deal more conventional a text than one might expect from one of the leading practitioners and theorists of the \\"New Novel.\\" What you have here is a novel that reads something like a David Lynch movie--there is a discernible storyline--beginning, middle, and end in the old-school sense--but like a splintered mirror, the shards reflect a picture back upon itself in what seem an infinite number of possible explanatory scenarios.In *The Erasers* a \\"special agent\\" named Wallas arrives in an unnamed town to investigate a murder linked to a series of similar assassinations believed to be carried out by a terrorist group intent on disrupting the nation's political and economic stability. But that's only one theory why Professor Daniel Dupont was shot to death in his study. Another theory is that he committed suicide. Another is that he isn't dead at all since no one--including the cynical local police commissioner--has seen the body, which has supposedly been lost in a labyrinthine bureaucracy. What witnesses exist are entirely unreliable. Wallas himself apparently looks a good deal like a stranger believed to be the killer. And the city with its frustrating layout of look-a-like streets and canals that seem to duplicate and double-back on each other becomes a maze through which Wallas wanders as exhausted physically as he is mentally.Robbe-Grillet always a master of atmospheric foreboding provides plenty of it in this \\"existential\\" thriller. The story has that disturbing fever-dream quality about it where trivial phrases and incidents repeat themselves so obsessively in contexts and combinations so unexpected that they eventually take on an enigmatic significance that begs for interpretation and eludes it at the same time. Is Wallas really a dupe of the agency he supposedly works for? Does such an agency even exist? Is he the murderer? These are the kinds of questions *The Erasers* forces the reader to ask and you're still asking them after reading the final page. The mystery is too big for one man to figure out; the world cannot be understood ultimately by any single mind even with the \\"help\\" of others--there are too many variables, too many unpredictable testimonies, too many hidden agendas, too many \\"suspects.\\"Missing the dark, S-M tinged eroticism that would later become his trademark, as well as earn him a certain degree of notoriety, especially in his films, *The Erasers* is not quite as exciting--or as stylistically innovative--as the novels in which Robbe-Grillet fully developed his theories and vision. But it's an interesting avant-garde literary thriller that still retains enough conventional mystery elements to make it enjoyable even for the intelligent, if somewhat less adventuresome, reader."},{"Title":"The Erasers: A Novel (An Evergreen Book)","review":"I can see why some would dislike the style of this novel. For one, it is (purposely) written in a dry, deceivingly impersonal way. The scenes and even the sentences are fragmented. But that's what this story is all about-taking the fragments and putting them back together. Can also be read as a very fragmented version of the Oedipus story-in fact I think reading it as such will add much understanding to the otherwise confusing tale. I loved reading this book. This was one of the few books that I enjoyed the style of the writing more than the story and characters. I found it delightfully confusing. Like being a little drunk, this book was fun though disorienting. Besides the fragments, there are flashbacks, same scenes described by multiple characters, scenes in which you are not sure if the information is accurate. It was very dreamlike to me. Though you know before most what happened to Dupont, it is still mysterious how it all unfolds. As I said, I loved the style of writing even more than the story. This was my first encounter with Robbe-Grillet and I will actively seek out more of his books."},{"Title":"The Erasers: A Novel (An Evergreen Book)","review":"In an odd twist of fate, Alain Robbe-Grillet died the same week that I finally finished reading his debut novel, The Erasers. I don't ascribe any importance to that, it was just odd.The Erasers reminds me of Black Sabbath's Black Sabbath or The Stooges The Stooges or Metallica's Kill \`Em All or Public Enemy's Yo! Bum Rush the Show. There is something great here, it isn't perfected yet, but there is hint of something amazing to come. This grand experiment will yield a Paranoid or a Fun House or a Master of Puppets or a It Takes A Nation of Millions....In many ways, The Erasers is the most \`conventional' of Robbe-Grillet's novels if for no other reason than it was his first stab at the New Novel. On the surface, the story can even be perceived as a more intricate form of crime fiction. In a small seaside town, Daniel Dupont, a professor, becomes the ninth victim in nine days of an unknown assassin. Theories abound as to the murder's true identity: a terrorist group unhappy with the professor's political leanings or a long lost bastard child. Arriving in town the day after the murder is one Detective Wallas who has been sent to investigate the murder. And so it begins...Over a 24-hour period, Robbe-Grillet has us following Wallas, wandering down blind alleys, retracing steps, replaying scenes over and over again, as he would in Jealousy and In the Labyrinth. We are introduced to the assassin, or are we? We meet many witnesses, but have they actually seen anything? Soon we are forced to ask a disturbing question: Is Wallas in fact the assassin? Is he investigating himself much like Gian Maria Volont&egrave;'s police inspector in the classic Elio Petri film, Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion.The twisting labyrinthine plot - what would become Robbe-Grillet's hallmark - draws you into the story, taking it to a psychological level that most crime novels (and lesser authors) are unable to achieve. You are forced to consider the possibility that Wallace has a dark side to his character that even his own brain will not reveal to the reader (something RG used even more effectively in The Voyeur). Only by \`tailing' Wallas do we start to see the pieces of the disjointed puzzle pulled together and ultimately the grim, inevitable outcome.In The Erasers, Robbe-Grillet has not completely abandoned traditional use of character and plot. There is a storyline here, but it is condensed into a frenetic series of meetings, arguments, subterfuge, and yes, murders. We are left with dead ends, miscues, faulty memories, and cryptic messages that the confound the reader as much as Wallas. It is this aspect that can turn someone away; the plot is not laid out as a simple series of events and an impatient readers quickly shut down. But compared to Robbe-Grillet's later novels, The Erasers is a great entry point to his writing, the rabbit-hole if you will.As I said, I don't consider The Erasers to be Robbe-Grillet's finest work. He is a young sprite, playing with new ideas. He wouldn't hit his stride until Jealousy and In the Labyrinth. But my god, what a hell of a debut. And still more infinitely fascinating and perfectly executed than the endless train of \`meta-novels' unleashed in years after by lesser writers. It stands in the shadows of Robbe-Grillet's later work, but still exists as one of the great experiments in novel writing. And more importantly, the story is still intriguing, fascinating, and addictive."},{"Title":"The Erasers: A Novel (An Evergreen Book)","review":"Sometimes stunning and often frustrating. Probably a great deal is lost in translation but the opening is pure brilliance."},{"Title":"The Erasers: A Novel (An Evergreen Book)","review":"I found reading this book to be an unrelieved chore. The plot is thin at a micron level of thinness. Perversely, this is compensated for by the enormous swell of pretentiousness accompanying the sundering of the narrative into disconnected incoherent pieces. The book starts well - a murder disguised as a suicide but in fact the victim is alive with a shoulder injury. This promising start slips quickly into a maze of meandering pieces about the investigating special agent's meanderings along the canal and side streets of the crime location. Character motivation serves little purpose in explaining the plot - since the latter is largely inaccessible how could it? The book is sprinkled with oddities - characters whose role never rises above talking heads. A backdrop of musings and information on the operations of machinery that shifts about a canal bridge are unnecessary distractions. The existence of a 'gang' killing prominent citizens is not grounded. In short the book is a mess. Don't be fooled by any comparisons with Sartre or Camus. Any comparisons are more than canceled out by the miasma that defines The Erasers."},{"Title":"The Erasers: A Novel (An Evergreen Book)","review":"This book was agonizing to read, every turn of the page inflicted pain on my sensitive green eyes.

It was written for college students and is an excellent resource. It is not an exhaustive text - many times the author states the disclaimer that a topic is too involved to go into in detail, but this is not a serious drawback.

And then additional sections fill in the details.This is excellent strategy for presentation of material, allowing the reader quick reference and review.When one can see the biblical picture of events in sequential order, it provides clearer perspective when one is in the middle of the scripture narrative.I would recommend this as a great resource book."},{"Title":"The Process of Business/Environmental Collaborations: Partnering for Sustainability","review":"This book builds on the concept of achieving win-win solutions.

A young Italian orphan, Chico Filippo, a monk and a donkey did in the fascinating tale, The Small War of Sergeant Donkey.In 1944, Italy and Germany were in a great war with the Allied Forces. In that context, Chico, is befriended by his \\"enemy\\" Sergeant Missouri, a soldier with the U.S. Army, and his prized donkey. Because it is in training as a solider for the transportation of military equipment, Chico nicknames the Missouri-native beast, \\"Sergeant Donkey.\\"One day, Sergeant Missouri is ambushed by the Nazis while taming donkeys to follow orders and remain silent though carrying heavy loads through the Italian mountains. If Sergeant Missouri takes one path he'll fall into a chasm and as he advances he comes under enemy fire. Thus, he is trapped, badly wounded and few resources. His only hope is to radio for help...As the radio squawks in the distance, Chico searches for his new friend back at the U.S. Army's Remount Depot. Instead, he hears Sergeant Missouri's voice pleading for help and indicating his position as beyond the current Nazi stronghold adjacent to the mountain-ridge Abbey of San Isidoro. Immediately, Chico journeys there with Sergeant Donkey packing supplies, including grenades, provided by soldiers and arrives after nightfall.Upon arrival, he meets his good friend, Brother \\"Honeycake,\\" a Catholic monk, who for years had provided honey (thanks to Chico's deliveries) as nourishment for the sick and elderly townsfolk. Brother \\"Honeycake\\" agrees to pray for Chico while he rescues Sergeant Missouri. To distract the Nazis, and as an act of prayer, Brother \\"Honeycake,\\" plays the Abbey's organ so loudly that the Nazis do not detect Chico and Sergeant Missouri mounted on Sergeant Donkey safely returning to the depot. As a reward for saving his life, Sergeant Missouri gives Chico his \\"heroic\\" donkey.Finally, through teamwork, three ordinary individuals - an orphan, a monk and a donkey - save the life of a badly wounded soldier."},{"Title":"The Small War of Sergeant Donkey (Living History Library)","review":"I purchased this book for my fifth grade students to read and then do a book report on.

The subject matter is dark, depressing, hallucinegenic, and yet the collection's overall feel is uplifting. Johnson could have written some cliched grotesqueries about the drug life, could have piled on the filth and dirt of it all, but he doesn't. The down-and-out characters, most of them junkies and criminals, are given a healthy dose of humanity, where a lesser writer would have turned them into abominable caricatures. Unlike most post modern writers, Johnson cares deeply about his characters and this comes out in every story. He doesn't follow the pomo aesthetic by declaring that life is inherently meaningless or hopeless, far from it. What we come to find in this amazing collection is the presence of hope in all things, no matter how low or degraded things might appear. And that is precisely what Denis Johnson shows us. There is beauty in everything, and if we can't see that, then we are not fully human."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"This slim book can easily be read in a few hours. The short stories are all vignettes out of the lives of the addicted and the desperate.What this book does, better than any other book I've read, is capture the beauty and tragedy of these lost lives. Johnson is great at imagery, whether the misty, sunlit dive bar on a rickety pier, or the deserted drive-in in the snow. He's also great at writing from the inside of these characters-- their tragic worldview makes sense through their eyes. The hallucinatory beauty of these &quot;prose-poems&quot; goes hand-in-hand with the altered perceptions of the characters-- these people live as if in a dream state.If you're ready to write off people on the fringes of society, then you probably won't appreciate this book. Like he did in &quot;Angels,&quot; Johnson takes these forgotten people, and makes them live and breathe on the page. Many times, his characters seem more truly alive than those who would write them off or forget about them."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"I've never read anything by Chuck Palahniuk. I know about him, however, because the movie 'Fight Club' is based upon Palahniuk's novel of the same title. Chuck Palahniuk is a big fan of Denis Johnson's collection of short stories, 'Jesus' Son.' A recent article about Palahniuk in Poets & Writers Magazine says that Palahniuk 'has read 'Jesus' Son' over and over'more than two hundred times.' Palahniuk says, in that article, 'whenever I'm stuck, that's a book I read to sort of jump start myself.'Palahniuk's endorsement was good enough for me. Any book that someone has read more than two hundred times must be worthwhile, or at least worth taking a look at. Besides, this remarkable collection of short stories is only 160 pages long, the pages are small (I measured it and it was about 7' x 4'), and there are not many words on each page. It doesn't take long to read. If it matters, I also always knew Denis Johnson was out there, a highly regarded poet and novelist, ever since 'Fiskadoro' had been published more than a decade ago. I had to read something by him sometime.I sat down last night and started reading 'Jesus' Son' and didn't put it down until I was finished. It didn't take me long and was worth every minute. 'Jesus' Son' contains eleven short stories, all written in the first person, all connected by the common voice of the same narrator, a young, strung-out misfit whose pathology permeates every story. The stories are grim, just like the dark, desperate life of the narrator, just like the violent, disconnected, drug-clouded lives of the people who surround him. They are stories in which the narrator seemingly transcends his life, his drug- and alcohol-induced cloud of unknowing illuminating an at times crystalline-pure vision of the world. The physical world becomes continuous with the mental world in rushes of stunning prose. Thus, in 'Car Crash While Hitchhiking,' Johnson's narrator, sitting in the back of a car: 'Under Midwestern clouds like great grey brains we left the superhighway with a drifting sensation and entered Kansas City's rush hour with a sensation of running aground.' And later, while in a hospital emergency room, his mind drifts in a kind of hallucinatory fugue: 'It was raining. Gigantic ferns leaned over us. The forest drifted down a hill. I could hear a creek rushing down rocks. And you, you ridiculous people, you expect me to help you.'The writing is brilliant, attaining remarkable heights of intensity and clarity. At the same time, the characters and the events are dark and disturbing, the narrative interrupted and discontinuous. There is drug addiction, alcoholism, violence, torture, murder, voyeurism. There is a disturbing coldness, but also a profound clarity. It is writing from the bowels of life, writing that achieves its power through prose that is as hard, as pure, as the finest diamond. 'Jesus' Son' is not an upbeat collection of stories, but it is resplendent with a writing style and an imagination that celebrates the power of fiction written with stark feeling, written so it reflects the real lives of its desperate characters."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"At first, I confess, I didn't know what to make of the stories that make up the collection \\"Jesus' Son\\". What does one make of stories about someone who is an addict through and through, determinedly ruining his life because it no longer seems to matter what happens to him? During the first fifty pages I had a visceral reaction to this book that was making me not only dislike it, but become angry at it; why should I care about people who won't help themselves, what is there to like about any of these people, etc. Then I began to notice tiny glimpses of carefully disguised humanism that leaked out of Johnson's prose, and went back to see if I had been missing them all along (sure enough, they had been there the whole time). I can only guess that my initial reaction was too volatile to pick up on subtle nuances of hope, and I am glad that I stuck with it long enough for that to die down because \\"Jesus' Son\\" is actually a remarkably heartfelt work despite its visceral tone. The characters are damaged and desperately unhappy people underneath their angry, hardened exteriors -- desperate for a connection that they can't bring themselves to hold on to, nor are they willing to put themselves out to get it. We never get to see why any of them are so damaged, which is mildly frustrating, but since it doesn't matter to the plots of the stories anyway it would have been out of place to get a lot of exposition. The misadventures and sometimes untimely demises of these characters are seen through the eyes of an unnamed narrator who lives among them, drinks with them, does drugs with them, uses them and is used by them. He is angry, confused, and suicidal, making his narration a spellbinding excursion into the pathos of the addict. When he remarks in one story that \\"I could understand how a drowning man might suddenly feel a deep thirst being quenched,\\" it tears you up inside. I just wish it were more clear how he ended up in such dire straits as this, hopelessly using himself to death.At 160 pages \\"Jesus' Son\\" goes by in a flash, but it's an emotionally draining journey and the collection packs a hefty punch despite its brevity. Happily, it does end on a hopeful note, which lets the reader breathe easily even though it is unclear how long that note can be sustained. Denis Johnson is clearly a gifted writer, and he has crafted a brutal gut-punch of a story collection that is as harrowing as it is realistic about the nature of an addict's life. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"That Denis Johnson chose such an unorthodox, non-linear strategy for his little book &quot;Jesus' Son&quot; is as much a testament to his genius as any of the often Dylan-esque prose-bites. Look at it this way: it may be said that every life becomes over time a jumbled series of unhinged recollections that change a little each time we use them; we suffer our decaying memories and willfully correct them like bad little children when we see something wrong with them. How much worse for the career junky? The sense of the absurd is strong here. The taut syle employed is reminiscent of Albert Camus' &quot;The Stranger&quot; and James M. Cain's &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice.&quot; I admire most spare, non-judgmental, unsentimental writing and try to write that way myself. When done right, the ring of truth is everywhere and if you're looking for Hemingway's &quot;one true sentence,&quot; you'll find veins bursting with them in &quot;Jesus' Son.&quot; Go for it."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Logic dictates, by my own standards of applying stars, that a 5 would denote a book that is either thoroughly exciting or will be an enduring whole over time. Not providing this book with 5 stars doesn't necessarily exclude this book from either category--it IS exciting in the way it is almost physically stirring and utterly sharp and suprising in its details. And I would hope that this work would endure, at the very least as something to be passed amongst aspiring writers as hope that highly structured, workshop-tight prose is not the only writing in the world given any value.This string of interconnected short stories, following the happenings of a barebones narrator out to take in the most of a bleak existence, is certainly very Camus in flavor (and overly generic description), but Johnson reaches a level of intensity and pathos that he was merely aspiring towards in a book like _Angels_. In the previous book, Johnson tried too hard to mix a character's cruelties with moments of soul, and so the attempts at pathos came across as a little too manipulative. In _Jesus' Son_, however, characters are stark and mean and inhumane while also showing glimmers of a purely poetic soul, and I like the challenge Johnson undergoes of presenting a narrator who can go from chewing on stolen hospital pills to seeing a world of promise where \\"the sky is blue and the dead are coming back.\\" This intense dichotomy is not necessarily dual but seems satisfyingly unified in this book, to make this a book of horror and soul. The narrative can get quite precise at some times, distracting at others, but the single-minded drive that bulls its way through this, though a little too much to take at times, which will then inspire an occasional reprieve to recollect one's bearings, is quite a marvel."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Let's imagine that Raymond Carver (the short story writer) and Charles Simic (the poet) produced an offspring who immersed himself in Beat literature and dropped acid. Such an offspring might be the author of this book. Like Simic, Johnson pins down the surreal, the grotesque; and like Carver, he makes use of a narrative style at once plain and poetic. And like every serious writer before him, Johnson brings to light some of our most urgent human emotions: fear of death, desperation, loneliness, fear of taking responsibility for someone else as well as for oneself.\\"Jesus' Son,\\" marketed as a collection of stories, is really one disjointed story whose various settings include hospitals, abandoned houses, a seedy bar called The Vine, and the highways and country roads connecting them. The story isn't told chronologically, so I'd recommend reading the book two, three more times. Characters in one story make flash cameos in another, and specific happenings in earlier stories are alluded to in later stories. Fantastic stuff.Each story works as a kind of prose poem: terse, cadenced, elegant. Johnson wastes not a single word or image. The best of these stories (to me, at least) is \\"Emergency,\\" which is truly nothing short of a contemporary masterpiece. It begins with a man wandering into a hospital emergency room with a knife in his eye, and ends with two hospital workers driving aimlessly in the country while caring for near-dead baby rabbits. I'll give away nothing else, but brace yourself: the dialogue is hilarious and the portrayal of the medical establishment (in all its humanness) isn't too flattering. And the ironies and complexities of the book's title will keep your mind active long after you've completed the last sentence. In short, a great book, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"I read this book for the first time about eight years ago, and I still find myself thinking about certain lines and images from the stories. It's great writing and very concise. Despite the dark subject matter, I find the stories inspiring and they resonate with me although I don't find drugs or crime very romantic. Johnson's novel, &quot;Already Dead&quot; is also very amazing, and a more elaborate story."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"I&#65533;ve never read anything by Chuck Palahniuk. I know about him, however, because the movie &#65533;Fight Club&#65533; is based upon Palahniuk&#65533;s novel of the same title. Chuck Palahniuk is a big fan of Denis Johnson&#65533;s collection of short stories, &#65533;Jesus&#65533; Son.&#65533; A recent article about Palahniuk in Poets &amp; Writers Magazine says that Palahniuk &#65533;has read &#65533;Jesus&#65533; Son&#65533; over and over&#65533;more than two hundred times.&#65533; Palahniuk says, in that article, &#65533;whenever I&#65533;m stuck, that&#65533;s a book I read to sort of jump start myself.&#65533;Palahniuk&#65533;s endorsement was good enough for me. Any book that someone has read more than two hundred times must be worthwhile, or at least worth taking a look at. Besides, this remarkable collection of short stories is only 160 pages long, the pages are small (I measured it and it was about 7&#65533; x 4&#65533;), and there are not many words on each page. It doesn&#65533;t take long to read. If it matters, I also always knew Denis Johnson was out there, a highly regarded poet and novelist, ever since &#65533;Fiskadoro&#65533; had been published more than a decade ago. I had to read something by him sometime.I sat down last night and started reading &#65533;Jesus&#65533; Son&#65533; and didn&#65533;t put it down until I was finished. It didn&#65533;t take me long and was worth every minute. &#65533;Jesus&#65533; Son&#65533; contains eleven short stories, all written in the first person, all connected by the common voice of the same narrator, a young, strung-out misfit whose pathology permeates every story. The stories are grim, just like the dark, desperate life of the narrator, just like the violent, disconnected, drug-clouded lives of the people who surround him. They are stories in which the narrator seemingly transcends his life, his drug- and alcohol-induced cloud of unknowing illuminating an at times crystalline-pure vision of the world. The physical world becomes continuous with the mental world in rushes of stunning prose. Thus, in &#65533;Car Crash While Hitchhiking,&#65533; Johnson&#65533;s narrator, sitting in the back of a car: &#65533;Under Midwestern clouds like great grey brains we left the superhighway with a drifting sensation and entered Kansas City&#65533;s rush hour with a sensation of running aground.&#65533; And later, while in a hospital emergency room, his mind drifts in a kind of hallucinatory fugue: &#65533;It was raining. Gigantic ferns leaned over us. The forest drifted down a hill. I could hear a creek rushing down rocks. And you, you ridiculous people, you expect me to help you.&#65533;The writing is brilliant, attaining remarkable heights of intensity and clarity. At the same time, the characters and the events are dark and disturbing, the narrative interrupted and discontinuous. There is drug addiction, alcoholism, violence, torture, murder, voyeurism. There is a disturbing coldness, but also a profound clarity. It is writing from the bowels of life, writing that achieves its power through prose that is as hard, as pure, as the finest diamond. &#65533;Jesus&#65533; Son&#65533; is not an upbeat collection of stories, but it is resplendent with a writing style and an imagination that celebrates the power of fiction written with stark feeling, written so it reflects the real lives of its desperate characters."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"I first read this book at the age of 22, having been turned on to it by a friend. Over the years, I have read this book again and again, and probably, it is the book that I have reread more than any other. I am compelled to do this primarily because of the effect of the sentences upon me. Johnson is a master at communicating in one short sentence what other writers would babble on about for pages or chapters. It is language evaporated, reduced. While the stories themselves are good, and the characters are interesting (especially for anyone who likes a good book about druggies), the best part about the book is the style and the voice."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"The short story collection that changed short story collections. The literary world paused the moment Jesus' Son was published, a pause that still makes hesitant every short story writer's every word. Fiction had responsibility after Jesus' Son. Best described as a collection of linked vignettes, Jesus' Son follows a lonely drug addict through his lonely life. Simple. But through the words of a poet."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Denis Johnson writes like a sharpened razor. It feel good as long as it's running smooth and gives you a gentle babyface. But, once in a while he slips and slits your throat just enough so you want to get off the chair from the bleeding, but your neck is shackled and you can't get up. Any second he'll rip your artery. Your are frozen and mesmerized."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"...and you can end up with a really tiny, really beautiful book like Denis Johnson's drugged-out short story collection Jesus' Son. Johnson's perfect word choice draws even the most square reader into a world of addiction, hallucination, and the emotional fallout from spending too little time sober and too much time chasing excitement. The first story, \\"Car Crash While Hitchhiking,\\" couldn't be a better intro; it's violent, luminous, and transcendent, and at its unbelievable climax the narrator forges a brief but profound connection as he faces a dying man he has never even met. Johnson can switch from heaviness to humor as in the hilarious \\"Emergency Room,\\" one of the many tales in this book centering around two lowlifes bumbling around to find their next score. It's a book about risks, youth, boredom, and the pulsing humanity of even the most screwed-up bum sleeping it off on a park bench. Plus, you can fit it in your back pocket."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Jesus' son is a very short collection of short stories that should take the average reader no time to get through. It is great in two ways. First, it is very effective in demonstrating the lost and agitated mindset of a drug-addicted lovable loser bumbling his way through the '70's. Second, Johnson's writing manages to be somehow both florid and lean, with exactly the right details magnified for effect. A quick, but engrossing read, Jesus' Son could be a 5-star book, but it's too short."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"This is one of the great works of fiction of the last quarter century. I've owned three copies of this book, and have lost all three so far. Two went out on permanent loan to friends, and another got run through the washer because I carried it around in my pocket with me all the time. Don't just read it. Reread it. And while you're at it, buy Johnson's other great book &quot;Angels.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Denis Johnson drags the reader through a series of short stories which only sort of meld together into a novella. But that's the point. It isn't a novella. There isn't a climax, resolution, and denoument. There are only the stories, moments, events loosely tied together by the beautiful and scarred characters Johnson creates for us. Read it."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"It's what Huck Finn's life would have been like if he'd been in his early 20's in the 1970's. A really beautiful series of dark and shimmering stories that move you and amuse you. The characters are great. It almost takes as long to read as it takes to watch the film, but one should do both since each is, in its own way, a treasure."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"I read this book of short stories because I am a huge Chuck Palahniuk fan, and I read somewhere that this was one of Chuck's fav's. It is a bunch of short stories about pain, suffering, and recovery. The main character ....is a heroin addict just trying to be, and is at times quite poetic. The stories range from a car crash, to shooting dope in hotel rooms, to falling for another addict, to an unforgetable emergency room chapter, to rehab centers. Subjects range from the beauty of life itself to abortion. It is a short book only takes a few hours to read, but it is a treat, it is something different and unpredictable. I suggest that you read the book and then check out the movie, staring Billy Cruddup, the dude that was in Almost Famous. All in all, great original stories that in the end will leave you feeling good, and most of all alive."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"I can't say I understood them all--and I certainly couldn't identify with the lifestyle of the main character--but I was riveted to his meandering, plotless adventures. It gives insight into a world completely foreign to me, but somehow manages to make it semi-appealing, much as Trainspotting (an altogether completely different work) did, just because they seem to be having so much fun. The centerpiece is &quot;Emergency,&quot; an over-the-top (almost farcical) piece about working in the ER."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"I'm not usually a reader 'high literature' and yet I found myself completely sucked into this collection of short stories about a perpetual screw up. The writing is minimalist, so every word counts. There were times when I thought a story was underwritten, but overall I found myself holding on to this book after I read it. I won't even lend it out! It's definitely a book I will read again. Also check out The Losers' Club by Richard Perez, WILL@epicqwest.com (a medicated memoir) by Tom Grimes (which Denis Johnson recommends, too)."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Johnson's style is a masterpiece of mystic concision.

Thus goes the line from &quot;Heroin&quot;, by the Velvet Underground, the song from which Denis Johnson borrowed the title for this interconnected connection. The title seems to be not the only Velvet-like trait here. The writing is spare and moody, banging away again and again at themes of physical, mental and spiritual isolation. But for some reason, Johnson doesn't strike the chord with the same intensity as the Underground. There is nothing wrong, per se, with the language. It is, in fact, finely crafted at many points, but overall, it just doesn't do it for me. Johnson's work reminds me of that of Dennis Cooper. If his topics click with you, then yahoo, you've got a lot of solid work to read, but if it doesn't, then perhaps you should start packing your bags, because the scenery doesn't change much. Copious amounts of drug abuse and affectless sexual unions abound, and the tone here is that of a dark back country road. Hope shines dimly and infrequently, like lights way off in the distance"},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Simply put: this is genius!!! It's not a book for people who loved The Fountainhead.

I can still hear Disch ranting. Two topics, every time we passed: get a Chris Whitley CD; get Jesus' Son. Disch was right, on both counts. I know that now.Jesus' Son is really no more than a series of short stories about the exploits of one guy schlepping through his life. And the guy is a piece of work. He's a mess. A drug addict. Usually broke. And with a penchant for just bad situations. But I don't know. When you're reading it, it seems perfectly normal that he should be driving around with the equivalent of O'Connor's Misfit, watching the dissection of roadkill and suffocating bunnies. Not just like it could have been you, but that it is you. And that's the magic of Johnson.... The only problem with the book is that it ends. The main character wanders from bad to worse and back again in a series of vignettes that read like redemptions. And they are. Not just for the character but for literature. Here's the thing: the book is like reading one long, perfect poem. The imagery is obscenely precise. Reading it is like taking a legal ride on a hallucinogenic. I know they say nothing is original. Bull. Johnson is and I'd defy anyone to argue the counterpoint.Okay, so it isn't a book you give to Grandma. I'll give you that. If you are an avid reader, you'll like it. But if you're a writer, you should be smacked if you haven't read this yet. It's a writer's book. Most writers are masters of technique. Some are masters of art. Johnson is both, and then some. Without sugar, without contrivance and with so much edge you can cut yourself on the words.If you write and you can put this book down without regret during your read, you should find another profession. Johnson is just that good."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"A loosely connected collection of stories about a drugged-out low-life and his buddies, &quot;Jesus' Son&quot; is not the kind of book I usually read myself to sleep with... but I can't deny that the author is enormously talented. The stories seem random and fragmented, but they do manage to add up to a coherent whole, and this elliptical quality, I think, largely accounts for the book's power. Johnson manages to say a lot about the strange mystery of life in these pages, where comedy and tragedy frequently collide, lightning can strike anyone at any moment, and even the doomed can be saved.Even so, the author sometimes strains too hard with his prose, which can be pretentiously &quot;poetic.&quot; The stories are also a tad uneven in quality. Still, I'd recommend this book to any serious reader of fiction."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"This book was recommended by Junot Diaz. I suppose a trained writer might appreciate it.

Took me all day Wednesday to unravel the whole mess. First I suspected the dope. Always knew that Bonehead was an erratic supplier. But I smoked some more of the same stash yesterday and it was fine. Pretty good, actually. Then I remembered the company I kept that day. The two fistfights with Stoner wasn't what you'd call a highlight, but then his hands are so fat, it was almost like he had boxing gloves on. So the problem wasn't Stoner. Course it could have been the pint of blood I dontated to the Lion's Club on Cindy-pie's dare. On the other hand, I've given more than that involuntarily several times, with no ill effects. So probably it wasn't the Lions. Then, eureka! It hit me like a ton of fishmeal...I'd read \\"Jesus' Son,\\" by Denis Johnson right after breakfast, and that's when things started to spiral out of control. Damn that book sucks. I tried reading the stories in order, then out of order, then just the catchy titles, e.g., \\"Out on Bail.\\" Nothing worked; everything sucked. Don't know exactly what to call it. Amateurish wordsmithing, for sure.

At least in the first short story, he intuits events before they happen. Maybe he gets his psychic powers from drugs or maybe from his disposition or maybe he really is the son of Jesus who is famous for detached spiritual resolve and mystical parables. In some ways he resembles Jesus: he doesn't seem to belong here in this world and senses a calling from some other world, some other metaphysical or spiritual dimension."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"A very funny novel about (what else) the twisted yet profound labyrinths of human nature.

It sometimes takes time to get through his work, but it's worth it."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"I love the movie that was based on these stories.

His rhythmic, hauntingly eloquent, and at times completely simple style is unforgettable and undenyable. Jesus' Son just reinforces it. While, yes, it is at times incredibly depressing, through and through, depressing or not, this book is incredible. It shows Johnson's absolute mastery of the language, and his complete skill as a writer. No matter what pointless, stupid, horrific, and depraved acts the narrator performs, we still love him, we still root for him and his hopelessness. Not a hero, not an antihero, the narrator has little or no admirable qualities, but his way of looking at the world enthralls the reader. I don't know how many times while reading this book I said &quot;Why the hell didn't I think to write that?&quot;"},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Jesus' Son is a terribly depressing and hopeless work. Mr. Johnson shows us a vision of America through the eyes of a (sadly) postmodern character: burnt out, a criminal and an adict.Despite the hopelessness, I remained enthralled by what I suppose to be Mr. Johnson's skillfull turning of English and his seeming struggle to evince meaning from a meaningless world.The final story I thought ALMOST made the entire reading worthwhile. Mr. Johnson presents his junkie protagonist fighting to escape the quagmire of depravity, convinced of the reality of (at least) beauty, and in the midst of rehab. Through his peeping-tom-ish final escapade, Mr. Johnson, through his character, gives the reader a refreshing and unique picture of the Universal Man and His creature, if as Aquinas says, it is disquised as the creature's longing for joy.In the end, I don't feel myself better off for having read this book. I don't deny Mr. Johnson's genius (he is one of the best writers I have read in a while), but most of these stories are depressingly depraved and hopeless. It is, sadly, a marvelous depiction of the end result of postmodern American culture.My recomendation: pick up the book and read the first and (particularly) last stories. It will save you a week or so of suicidal tendancies."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"These are the stories like Raymond Carver would write if he had this kind of vision and gift with words. Johnson is a poet, turned prose writer. His novel, Fiskadoro, is a feat of imagination; he conceives a new, post-apocalypse world and he invents a new vocabulary and syntax to go with it. This collection of short stories is even better. And don't sniff at the title--Jesus' Son--these stories are entirely legitimate. Most were published in the New Yorker, The Paris Review, or Esquire. Several were selected for the &quot;Best Short Stories of..,&quot; where I first came across them.The character are low, mostly drunks, addicts, and users. The setting is the west, Seattle or Tuscon. A lot of the tales begin, and end, at the Vine, a dive bar downtown.In the story Work, two friends earn their drinking money by pulling the copper wire out of an abandoned house; not a burglary, one points out, but a salvage job. They watch in amazement from the attic as a woman skis by,nude,her red-hair streaming behind her. It may be a dream, one character suspects, but its turning out to be one of the best days of his life.In another story, a young man hides in the bushes to spy on a young house wife as she showers. He admits how low this is, but he expect to go lower. He returns every day of the summer, hoping to catch the woman and her husband in the act. He sees something entirely different.Emergency is my favorite of the collection. A man walks into the hospital with a knife in his eye socket,lodged there by his wife. An orderly, stoned after indiscriminately sampling the hospital's pharamcopia,casually removes the knife while the frantic surgeons are still scrubbing. Driving around later with a friend, they run over a pregnant rabbit. &quot;We killed the mother, but saved the babies,&quot; one rejoices. They get lost in a snow storm, and find themselves at an empty drive-in, the speakers all squawking.Not all the stories are this grim or bleak. And even at their blackest, they are funny. Mostly they are visionary, and beautiful. But its a dilated vision, over real and harsh. If &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; left you cold, so will this collection.Reading Johnson feels like a visit to an acupunturist; he chooses his words precisely, like needles, to stir dead feelings and revive your imagination."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"If you ever went to a theatre, you know that feeling of anticipation, when curtains slowly start top open, scene is dark and there are no characters yet on stage, but somehow you are filled with thrill of awaitment, of exciting new misteries, experiences that awaits you when play actually start.In the dark and stormy night (:-)) a person enters the isolated hospital, with knife peering from his eye bulb...night is warm and mentioned person just strolled down the few block that separate his apartment from the hospital and now patiently sits and awaits medical care. But somehow there are no doctors avaliable, what whith vacations and everything and score of other reasons. One unqualified member of medicinal caste, just pulls the knife out, and patient normally walks away, thanking them, optical nerve intact. It was on of those nights where everything goes wrong, or maybe it goes the way it wasn't supposed to go.And Johnsons stories are just like that. Dark and majestic, fluent and mysterious, presenting mysteries of everyday existance and complexity. His characters are drug addicts, criminals, alchocholic, yet they live and breathe and have same doubts (but slightly weirder thing happens to them).With a words of Lou Reeds \\"Heroine\\" Denis Johnson creates appealing yet troubling world of darkness which calls for you again and again, mostly becouse that is the world that we are living in."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Probably the best book I've read. Johnson explodes any idea of narrative and plot, picking through the remains to create a hazy, sad world of junkies and loners. In every sentence he seems to find some new, uncut gem in the language- like an alien suddenly fluent in English. Sometimes scary, sometimes ugly, sometimes doe-eyed, it's hard to say what the book is; it's not a novel, not a collage, and not just a collection of short stories. Screwed-up and great."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"How do write a prescient narrator, drug-induced hallucinations, about the wandering imperative that ruins some of us for any regular job that lasts more than two months? Grab a handful of the doctor's best stuff and see what it does to you, that's what Johnson's prose is like, but good stuff, taut, poetry for those who want to rush. You can read these stories in an hour or two. Then you can read them again, again. Don't stop. Forget what a mess life is? Here it is, in perfect concentration, stories that haunt because they hurt, do they ever hurt"},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"I had not heard of Denis Johnson until Philip Roth, on his retirement from writing, singled Johnson out as one of the great active American writers. This slim volume of stories serves as an easy and excellent introduction to his work.Johnson has a unique style. He writes very short and jarring stories (in the first person) about addiction. The stories are more moving and colorful than those of a guy like Raymond Carver. An addict lives and thinks in an irrational way, but convinces himself of the rationality of his actions. Johnson puts us into such a mind. Thus, some of the characters do incredibly evil and stupid things, but we come to understand how they think. We can't simply dismiss them as monsters -- they are humans to whom we can relate but who do evil and stupid things. In that sense, they represent all of us.Johnson pulls this off because he must have lived all this. Also, he is a poet whose prose is full of some remarkable phrasing. The metaphors are jarring, not flowery. And he writes with great economy with a good ear for dialogue.The stories are so emotionally powerful that it's hard to read more than one at a time.Roth didn't say what he liked in particular about Johnson -- just words to the effect that \\"wow, then there's this Denis Johnson.\\" That about sums it up."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"My review won't do this book justice.

Very simple sentences weave in and out of a drug-induced haze of short stories. My first foray into his work, but definitely not my last."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Jesus' Son by Denis Johnson is the kind of book I would have liked if I were still getting high. It's a collection of short stories about a lost soul swaying and drifting through life, not unlike Kerouac or Burroughs.But with no chemicals coursing through my veins, these stories are merely depressing. They remind me too much of my own past, lost life - too much wasted energy for a too much squandered existence, blindly chasing a feeling right over the edge of the cliff.The first surreal story about a highway crash during a storm set the tone for the rest of the book. The background is fear and the colors are self-loathing, and it's only going to get worse before it gets better, so, please, hurry up and get the worst over with so it can start getting better.These stories, just writing this review, leaves me with a dull ache in my heart and a knot in my throat. Thank God those days are over and God please guide me so that I never have to experience such heart-rending despair again.Written by David Allan ReevesAuthor of \\"Running Away From Me\\""},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"This was my introduction to Denis Johnson's work and I was blown away by his ability to create characters in believable situations.

Thank you.Brummbaer"},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"I was first hit by my discomfort for the first person. I was a drunk, an addict, a sleazeball and maybe I did some time. I is a young man - always aware of that quality of life that isn't in the material world but in the realm of consciousness, altered mostly but not always. There is a painful roughness to these \\"I\\" lives, of men who know they will never \\"make it\\" and don't seem to aspire to it. What they do want is a kind of transcendence in living intensely where violence, sex, and desperation crowd another for primacy until that moment passes and there is just a cotton mouth and the tedium waking up into a damp, cloudy morning.I must comment on the title, \\"Jesus's son.\\" Jesus as God's son is half divine and half man but is Jesus' son one fourth God? There is divinity in all these men and they cry out with \\"Jesus!\\" or \\"God\\" as if expecting a divine spark to save them from their mess. That never comes but these men do touch the divine even in the horror of an auto accident, in the hospital or peeking through a bedroom window. We aren't allowed to pity these men, they partake too fully of life and aren't sorry for themselves. These aren't men stuck completely in a determinist prison, buffeted by forces they don't understand. They are actors, making things happen and veering off into questions of what comes next in a world unmoored by not much of a stake in the outcome."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"If you want to read a book other writers appreciate, read these stories.If you want to peek behind the curtain and watch the prose being made on the factory floor, read these stories.Or even if you just want to watch an achingly beautiful struggle between hope and despair, then still read these stories."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Completely worth reading, I just wish it was longer. Regardless the length is not a problem as the book manages to pack in so much into a small space"},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"At the end of almost every story, you are bound to be shaking your head at what just happened, and wonder how you got there from where you started. A book that I find myself reading over and over again, just to get that feeling. Somehow, when lent out, it never seems to return.Johnson writes about low-lifes better than anyone.

I was going to spread out my efforts over a week. I read the first story and devoured the book twice in the first night.I'm a creative writing minor at Chico State University, California. If I were to state any influences, Dennis Johnson--and especially this book--would be it. He writes in a poetic-prose that's hypnotizing. When I dug into the first paragraph of \\"Hitchhiking in the Rain,\\" I was the cobra and Johnson was the flutist.In short, if you like gritty, drug laden prose, buy this book. If not, go back to your Anne Rice novels and leave the true lovers of literature to their devices."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"This item was recieved MUCH quicker than was told or than I anticipated. The book arrived in absolute perfect condition and has been extremely helpful to me in my university class.

If your looking here you must have an interest, so do yourself a favor and pick one up. You won't regret it at all."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Denis Johnson does a wonderful job of bringing the reader into the world of off-beat characters. Many are under the influence of drugs and alcohol and their actions are mostly irrational to the average person. It is humorous but at the same time scary! I would recommend this book to anyone with a strange sense of humor."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"It seems to me that the more ugly, grotesque, and hopeless your work is, the more people will praise you, call you a genius, and hand over their money to you. Denis Johnson is no exception here. Even though he can put a good line together once in a while, the praise surrounding his work is a lot of overblown hype and his stories lack any depth. I was attracted to this book because I'd read that Johnson was similiar to Thom Jones but is nowhere close to Jones's work. The &quot;dark side&quot; of life is only interesting for so long, and only if there's some meaning behind it, even though the privleged middle class seems to be obsessed with probing the depths of this from their secure suburban lifestyles. Isn't there enough disposable literature out there today?"},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"i bought this after an excellent review on NPR. last time i'll do that. while there's nothing wrong with the prose, there's nothing especially inspiring about it either. my biggest complaint is not specific to Johnson. i'm sick of books about stupid characters. maybe there are so many such books because it's easier to get stupid people into trouble, but frankly, my dear, i'm BORED."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"This was seen on a recommended list by a somewhat famous author. I was sadly disappointed. The book had a number of short stories of which NONE inspired me. One of the stories mentions how one can't just sit on the bus as 'you've got to have a destination'. It's too bad the author of this book had no true destination. I was simply lost in nonsense. Don't give this your time--it's a waste of time. I felt the same way the author did on the last page of the book when he wrote 'Sometimes I heard voices muttering in my head, and a lot of the time the world seemed to smolder around its edges'. That's for sure...what a shame."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"While the stories are jagged and hard to follow, there's something in the writing that makes you keep reading. The descriptions are very well done. You can't logically figure out what they're saying but from the sound of them you often know what they mean."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"The high ratings given this book by other reviewers is more a reflection of our adoration of addicts than of the quality of the writing.Huh? Consider how often Larry King guests a 'star' fresh from rehab. Frankly, we give losers too much attention and give far too little credit to those who make good life choices. Jesus' Son is a case in point. Or rather, lack of point.Let's get to Hunter S. Thompson. He will take you through a drug experience with a purpose---even in his least lucid moments he was most lucid.Skip this book, save the time and trouble. Read Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. And, if you really want quality introspection, read Camus' The Stranger."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"If you, like me, are tired of the predictable, unchallenging and sedative nature of most popular literature then I strongly encourage you to find and read &quot;Jesus's Son&quot;. How could I possibly express what I feel about this collection and not come across as ludicrously overwrought? I reluctantly admit that even though I had heard wonderful things about it I hesitated to buy it, put off by it's diminutive size. What realized when I finally did buy it and read it was that it is neither a word too long or a word too short. The length is perfect. I read it over two days and on the third day I read it again from start to finish. I wondered, and still do, at how Johnson could do so much in such little time and with a simple approach. Each successive story strengthens the ones before it, and every one is at once amusing, disturbing, and moving. Those words are used often to describe mediocre material but &quot;Jesus' Son&quot; constantly provokes each of those reactions in a very palpable manner. The prose is so flawless as to seem simple but there is nothing simple about it, such perfection could only be the product of carefully executed inspiration and genius. Denis Johnson is the best writer in America today, &quot;Jesus's Son&quot; is his most important work."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"If you're a fan of Johnson's manic, drug-fueled poetry, you know that he leans toward the comically surreal. His short fiction offers more of the same, but with an added plus of real, believable, fallible characters doing the best they can with what they've got.I was once told by my creative writing teacher that there are only nine stories in the world. My teacher obviously had never read Denis Johnson. He offers eleven fresh, inventive stories, each a successful reinvention of the form. If you like the grittier side of Raymond Carver and Andre Dubus, or Thom Jones or Larry Brown's \\"Big Bad Love,\\" you'll see \\"Jesus' Son\\" as a Godsend."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"I was originally attracted to this short-story collection because Denis Johnson is one of the fairly small number of current American writers to have multiple works deemed &quot;canonical&quot; by Harold Bloom in his &quot;The Western Conon.&quot; Three of Johnson's make Bloom's list (this one, &quot;Angels&quot; and &quot;Fiskadoro.&quot;) While I'm not much of an admirer of Bloom's critical methadology (which seems to be a sort of warmed-over Freudianism), and I'm not sure that the idea of a &quot;Western Canon&quot; makes much sense anymore, if it ever did, his critical acumen in identifying enriching and important works is superb, and he is right on with Denis Johnson. &quot;Jesus' Son&quot; is a series of short pieces, hardly even short stories, episodes in the life of a twenty-something dealing with heroin addiction, violence, and broken relationships. It's an understatement to call this a dark vision of America. Johnson's vision calls to mind Celine, Camus, Burroughs, maybe Kerouac as his literary predecessors. There are gems of description and dialogue on almost every page. The nameless protagonist goes from a near-fatal car crash, to addition, to a near-fatal OD, to some kind of tenative truce with the fates: &quot;All these weirdos, and me getting a little better every day right in the midst of them. I had never known, never even imagined for a heartbeat, that there might be a place for people like us.&quot; I have just seen the movie of the same name based on this, and it too is excellent, but would recommend that the book be read first. This is easily the strongest collection of short fiction I've read in a long time, and I think, with Harold Bloom, that it will some day be deemed &quot;canonical.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"This is one of the most accessible and enjoyable collection of short stories I have ever read. He's got a great way of quickly getting to the main event that drives each story (usually something foolish, rediculous, and dangerous). This makes you feel that you don't have get through a learning curve with each new story. Having a main character thoughout all the stories helps too.The writing itself is stripped down and beautiful. You can tell his background is in poetry. He doesn't spend long paragraphs on physical descriptions, but he does a great job of getting into the head of his desperate, foolish, but decent main character."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"I love this book. The ending lines about \\"I never knew -- never imagined even for a heartbeat -- that there was a place for people like us\\" deserves to stand alonside the closing lines of Gatsby as one of the great finishes in American literature."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"I tried to like this collection, and there were moments, some pretty dog-gone good ones, but there were other moments, lots of them, where I wanted to wing the book across the room and say, \\"You're kidding me! This is the stuff that has folks yakking for ten years now?\\" There's a lot of the stuff of the novice writer in here, pages and pages of it... In a literary sense, the book remeinds me of a kid who comes down a Sunday morning to the stale remnants of his parents' wild party and smokes a pretzel and sips flat ginger ale while dealing himself a hand. I mean, don't we have any adults writing?I don't think I have ever been as convinced that Am. Lit. is in need of a new voice, a new sensibility. I think the spareness that so many write about in praising Mr. Johnson comes from his gut instinct that he has nothing to add.By the way -- I read 'Tree of Smoke,' tried to read it, but found it not only unbearable, but false. 'Jesus' Son,' at least, is not false."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"The eleven short stories in Jesus' Son hold together as characters appear in more than one story and all the stories appear to have a common narrator. They are minimally written and appear to be influenced by the Beat writers. Johnson is also a poet and his beautiful use of language sparks up the stories of drug binges and car accidents.I worked in a methadone program for 9 years and many of the hair-raising stories told to me by addicts are reflected in similar stories in this book. Drug addicts trying to function in the world while intoxicated and hallucinating; make love; fight; double cross each other; run from the law; and exhibit reckless life with little regard for consequences. Yes, these are full blown sociopaths! Yet, throughout the book, Johnson rewards us with his minimal style and his poetic imagery. Despite the accidental deaths, drug overdoses, double-crosses, and despiration; the beauty of the world continues to haunt the characters, like a ghost, that enters the world as a smoky dream. The text moves from stark objective narration, to dream-like states, to drug induced hallucination. There was one scene where two drug addicts who work in an emergency room are caught in a snow storm. They see a graveyard with all the markers the same size and then realize they are car-mikes in a drive in theater. The film is playing through a snow storm to an empty parking lot. The description Johnson evokes is haunting and beautiful. The story \\"emergency\\" is frigtening and funny and sounds only all too true regarding health care in America.The film Trainspotting reminds me of this book. The death of the baby in Trainspotting while all the junkies were getting high is very similar to what you will read here.The narrator's search for the beatiful in deformed or crippled women reminds me of the photography of Diane Arbus. While photographing the deformed, retarded, disabled; Arbus found the beauty of the person and tried to capture this beauty in her photographs. She reportedly had sex with many of her models. Johnson follows a similar pattern as he describes a dwarf woman with beautiful eyes or a spastic paralyzed woman who raises her twitching arms and curses out of the side of her mouth when she has orgasm.I think the book was entertaining and jolting. I find the lives of people on the edges of sanity, society, and sobriety as fascinating because I think how my own life would have been if I had become a dope addict or alcoholic or professional thief. At some point, some of the characters have had enough of the low-life, but they are the exception and are very few and far between. They are usually persons who love dope addicts and finally have had enough. Even the narrator tries to come out of the dreamy world of crisis in the final story. He describes the sober world as silly yet healing; boring yet ultimately beautiful."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Jesus' Son is a loosely-tied collection of short stories about the underside of the Mid- and Southwest. In most of them, the narrator is a strung-out twenty-something hospital worker who is either always looking for drugs, or hanging out with people who already found them.Johnson does a great job intermingling beautiful language with tales of drug-addled losers who constantly fail themselves at every turn. His narrator's voice (always first-person) is genuine and engaging, never condescending. Where other authors struggle with matching less-educated narrators with their own writing skills, Johnson thrives, allowing his narrator to use subtly profound images without seeming authorially over-bearing.Perhaps the book's greatest asset is its originality. No one else is writing about these people, and Johnson writes with the perspective of someone who has lived (grown?) among them. His portraits of hospital orderlies and back-country heroin addicts are windows on a world most readers will never approach, and that is exactly what books like this are for.You can't really ask for much more in a short story collection -- interesting characters, original plots and settings, and varied explorations of a few themes, all drawn with subtly careful language.In taking some settings that we all have unquestioned stereotypes about -- the midwest and hospitals, for example -- and scratching the surface, Johnson provides us with stories that almost *have* to be interesting. What happens when you follow someone home on the subway? What happens when you hide in some bushes, and watch a married couple eat dinner, every night? Johnson imagines some great answers to these questions.In this way, he seems to have something in common with AM Homes, who writes about similar situations involving well-to-do suburbanites. But Johnson trades the soccer moms for people who escape easy type-casting, and thus, are mostly forgotten and ignored.The book is an incredibly fast read -- you can probably get through the whole thing in about 2 1/2 hours, maybe less."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Denis Johnson - in what seems like an act of unconscious will - is a storyteller of an ancient lineage, a kind rarely encountered. He takes the minute, the discrete, the unattended, and, 'the things that are not, and calls them as though they are.' In this brief narrative, he assigns grace and lyricism, deep pathos and a twisted, fragile goodness to those characters we're obliged not to notice. And thus they endure, the unwashed. They lie down and rise up among the sick and the diseased knowing that things cannot go worse for them by doing so. They sell whatever is at hand to afford another drink, a fix, or just a window of time in conversation with someone who has no interest in throwing them out, but no choice not to.The narrator in \\"Jesus' Son\\" makes us witnesses to testimony that insists the human soul is a good and real thing, and that it is inalienable, and that it is - as it must be - alone in its pain. He writes: \\"I had never known, never even imagined for a heartbeat, that there might be a place for people like us.\\"Amen. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"This ain't your mother's nightstand reading. With a book that is certainly out of the mainstream popular fiction genre, noted minimalist Denis Johnson provides a bare and stripped back work with Jesus' Son that has an anger and passion component that, with works such as these, excites me literarily, to my core. Following an unnamed character through an alcohol and drug fueled rampage before he stumbles upon an epiphany of sorts while in rehab, Johnson strikes a chord here with a ferocity and realism that I've not read since Infinite Jest. This type of unguarded surrealism and paired down honesty offers a contrasting and welcome literary experience and it's one that appeals to me on an almost spiritual level.To say it again, this isn't normal or even redemptive fiction but it is profound and important nonetheless...it is writing and literary craft that seems to circumnavigate the outer bounds that define the contemporary novel with fragmented and counter intuitive stories that resonate with a stark intensity and dark backdrop that hook you and drag you in. I found this, again, to be imminently appealing.These eleven stories bring a certain rage, a dystopia that's seemingly always attempting to reach the surface but constantly failing. They'll confuse, entice and enthrall you all at once...the sheer intensity of this writing coupled with the despondency made these essays riveting. The reader, as I admittedly did, enters another realm of consciousness with this work...and this becomes frustrating as I am one who hopes to catalogue literature for future reference. This work, however, defies all categories...is it post modern? Visionary? Transendant? However it becomes classified, it is nevertheless a compelling read and one, if given wide birth at the beginning, will be rewarding at its completion."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"A collection of thematically linked short stories is often the goal of young writers, especially writing program writers; apparently there's something appealing about saying your collection is &quot;meant to be read as a novel&quot;--i.e., even if you are not able to write a sustained work of fiction, even if you're capable of writing only sound bites, you can still qualify as a novelist if you write a lot of sound bites about the same thing and give them separate titles. See, for instance, anything by Sandra Cisneros.Johnson has produced something altogether different. These stories are less stories than visions, and the resulting collection is less a pseudo- or quasi-novel than an epic--albeit a diffuse, fragmented epic with many of the battles and escapades forgotten or omitted. The overriding question that begins each new story is, &quot;How did he get there?&quot; That fragmentation is at the heart of the book and makes the experience similar to listening to Bob Dylan's 1974 album, &quot;Blood on the Tracks.&quot; Fuckhead's experiences are as frightening, spiritual, and desperate as those of Dylan's narrator in such songs as &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; and &quot;Shelter From the Storm.&quot; Johnson gives us a new kind of poetry, a new kind of prose, a new way of story-telling, and a new way of putting it all together in &quot;Jesus' Son.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"I think I've bought this book about five times since 1994.

I'll probably have to buy a copy of it again soon."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Everything Johnson writes about sounds like he lived it (which he probably did, as all his other works have a decidedly different voice), and yet like the best drug stories you could ever make up.And once it's over the brilliant imagery of who the character is begins to shine through. The jesus references portray the fabled messiah in a more human light than anything i've EVER read.Imagine if Jesus was God's gift of himself to Humanit in the form of a human, then Jesus' Son would be even MORE human, no?The title comes from a Lou Reed penned tune called Heroin (which also frames some of the tragedy in this book) and specifically the line, \\"When I'm rushing on my run, and feel just like Hesus' Son\\" and i can't help but think that the song was moe that in inspiration for simply the title.There was also a brilliant movie adaptation of this incredible group of stories that reads as well as one novel as each story does independently."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Reading this book, one experiences the shock of recognition that comes with any great piece of literature. It changed the way we thought about and understood fiction. This ranks among the best collection of short stories in the English language, and &quot;Emergency&quot; is the finest, most original and most compelling American short story since Cheever's &quot;The Enormous Radio.&quot; This book quietly spawned whole schools of hacks and imitators; every third issue of any given fiction magazine contains yet another pale attempt to emulate Johnson's genius. But this is the original. In the several years since its publication, Jesus' Son has taken its rightful place, quite simply, among the 100 or so essential English-language works of fiction."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"More than the actual stories, I think what's most impressive about Johnson's writing is his fragmented approach to time. Consider the first story, \\"Wreck While Hitchhiking\\" if you will. While some people may suspect that the prevalence of drugs is an attempt to shock, and thereby gain sales, I suspect that it has more to do with the secret growing casualness society has with narcotics.I borrowed this book for a night.

Another guy gets shot in a farmhouse, for no reason. A third guy overdoses. Prison looms for everyone. And it all takes place in the gloomy flatland of the Midwest, circa 1971.\\"Jesus' Son\\" is one of the ten funniest books I've ever read.But, you sputter, it's a bummer. Indeed it is. And if you think heroin addiction is tawdry (and it is, it is) and the people who use hard drugs are losers (and they are, they are) and there is Nothing Funny about an overdose, then these eleven stories are so not for you.But if you have a taste for Black Humor or an appreciation of outlandish characters --- or even an ear for brilliant writing --- this 160-page book will give you the most delightful two-to-three hours of reading you've experienced in a long, long time. Well, maybe not three hours. Maybe a lot more --- for if, like me, you occasionally find yourself in need of the kind of laugh that only a book can provide, your eye goes instinctively to \\"Jesus' Son.\\" Your hand involuntarily removes it from the shelf. And before you know it, you're lost in the world of this remarkable book.Let's just consider the first story,\\" Car Crash While Hitchhiking.\\" It is exactly that. The narrator is a hitchhiker who, on one leg of his trip that day, has been fed pills by a salesman. He is now wired and omniscient:I knew every raindrop by its name. I sensed everything before it happened. I knew a certain Oldsmobile would stop for me even before it slowed, and by the sweet voices of the family inside that we'd have an accident in the storm.The accident occurs. Predictable events follow. Then comes an ending that confounds all expectation: \\"It was raining. Gigantic ferns leaned over us. The forest drifted down a hill. I could hear a creek rushing down rocks. And you, you ridiculous people, you expect me to help you.\\"That last line --- directly addressed to the reader --- announces that these will not be \\"traditional\\" stories, with characters who describe their troubles and fix them. This is a world of the lost: freaks abandoned by God, people who connect with holiness only (in the words of the Lou Reed song that provides the title) \\"when I'm rushing on my run.\\"The power of these stories is the writing, first and foremost, but there is also the sense that these stories are real. As Johnson recalls, \\"I was addicted to everything....When I was 21, I went into my first psych ward for alcohol.\\" Then he moved on to drugs. \\"But I was not a constant junkie. You can't just go into a drugstore and say, 'I'll have some heroin, please.' You have to be prepared to enter into all kinds of adventures that I wasn't strong enough for.\\"Those adventures included study at the University of Iowa with Raymond Carver. He wrote \\"Jesus' Son\\" because he owed the IRS $10,000 and had these stories in his head:\\"I never even wrote that book, I just wrote it down. I would tell these stories apropos of nothing about when I was drinking and using and people would say, \\"You should write these things down.\\" I was probably 35 when I wrote the first story. The voice is kind of a mix in that it has a young voice, but it's also someone who's looking back. I like that kind of double vision. So I worked on them once in a while, then I started using stories I heard other people tell, and then I started making some up. Pretty soon it was fiction. Then I just forgot about it. I thought, I'm not going to parade my defects, my history of being a spiritual cripple, out in front of a lot of other people. But once in a while I'd write a little more --- I would just hear the voices.\\"He wrote books before, he's written books since, but \\"Jesus' Son\\" is the one that readers cherish. Is it that there's something about hair-raising stories told by addicts that we just can't resist? Or is it just the voices?

It got quite a laugh from both Johnson and the crowd, but that's how powerful this book is. It's so good that I've never read any of his other work, because I don't think I could bear the disappointment. So I keep re-reading \\"Jesus' Son\\"...it's almost as if I'm addicted."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"I was skeptical about this book because it was assigned reading for a college rhetoric class, but I was pleasantly surprised by the results. In a world of cliched, formulaic fiction, it is nice to see an author with the fortitude to push the envelope and tell a story that defies established genres.This collection of stories that revolve around a nameless protagonist (a wandering drug addict in search of a higher purpose in life) transport the reader into a bizarre world that, though grotesque, is almost uncomfortably realistic. The abrupt transitions from situation to situation can be dizzying for someone not prepared for them, but they truly paint an image of the main character's distorted, cynical view of the world and serve to plant the reader squarely into his confused and disturbed psyche.A fantastic read with turns that you will never be able to predict, Jesus' Son delivers an explosive charge of intriguing fiction that will make you think, guaranteed."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"If you've lost interest or faith in literature, if you're tired of reading supposedly great works that are instead like bus trips across Texas, if you're tired of cute, anecdotal, and elegantly mundane rot about shoelaces, hemorrhoids, and vases, if you're weary of the smothering callow glaciers of creative writing talent, if the moldy classics, Booth Tarkington and John Dos Passos, put you into a coma, drop it all, take it back to the library, return it to Barnes and Noble, and reenter the world of fun and inspirational reading through the portal marked \\"Jesus' Son.\\" True, it's another heroin song, another loser whistling past the window, another stick of dynamite blowing up in the drugged fingers of American poetry, but it's what all of us, the producers and the consumers, the talkers and the listeners, the refined and the vulgar, the innocent and the lost, are looking for, one word: MAGIC. Johnson is a titanic verbal intelligence. Through manic comic desperation he manages to glimmer out one epiphany after the next, the burn of holy water, abortion secrets, the gay soul of the hetero. There's a sense in reading this of participating in something almost shamanistic. And it's true isn't it, that the shaman in every tribe is not only the figure with the most intimate death experience but also the one who possesses both the drugs and the magic? One note of caution. Be wary of Johnson's other work. He writes better than all of his contemporaries put together, but the plots of his novels are as tangled and frayed as the threads in the wind-whipped flags on Madman Island. Jesus' Sons is absolute proof that no matter how smart or talented you are, you need something to write about, some mystic purchase or core to crystallize around. Good writing is often an example of a cultivated accident. Amass the best story collections of the twentieth century, The Magic Barrel, A Good Man is Hard to Find, Winesburg, Ohio (yes, I know it's classified as a novel, but these are really stories), Like Life, Nine Stories, etc, and force me to own only one, my choice would be Jesus' Son."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"This is one of the more powerful and fascinating collections I have ever read. It's not exactly right to call it a collection, since all the stories appear to have the same narrator, and sometimes one will pick off where another left off. They are remarkably powerful, especially, \\"Work,\\" in which the narrator, known only as F*ckhead, helps a man rip the wiring from the walls of his destroyed house in order to sell for scrap, and the best story in the collection, \\"Emergency,\\" where a man comes into the emergency room with a knife sticking out of his eye. A beautiful story, although it doesn't sound like it would be."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"First, this is a review of the book, not the movie. The book the movie's based on, not the movie which is based upon it. Got it?Secondly, the book is about a drug user, and contains lots of profanity. Some people consider the title blasphemous. If that bothers you, stop reading this epinion and write your own. Please don't take your problems with the book out on me.Now I can get on with it.Jesus' Son: stories / by Denis Johnson is a collection of short stories by Denis Johnson (?!), strung together like paper dolls. They were originally published in The New Yorker, Esquire, and the Paris Review, among others.The stories center around the meanderings of a heroin junkie--a dude named F'head (Apostrophes signal omissions, 'member?)--who never really knows where he is, or what's going on. Like the protagonist in the movie Trainspotting, which is very similar to Jesus' Son, F'head realizes his life is going nowhere, but he finds himself trapped in a cycle of hopelessness and addiction and fantasy.And I quote, quote: \\"I'm not ready to go into all that,\\" I said. A yellow bird fluttered close to my face, and my muscles grabbed. Now I was flopping like a fish. When I squeezed shut my eyes, tears exploded from the sockets. When I opened them, I was on my stomach. endquote, p.12.F'head's friends, Tom, Richard, Jack Hotel, hang out at a shady bar called The Vine and get involved in junkie intrigue: shootings, pill-poppings, and meetings to hatch petty heists. Much of the miserableness starts there. Later (earlier?), F'head works as an orderly in a hospital and a nursing home. Now I understand my health care professionals better.As a narrator, F'head is incredibly uncredible, sprinkling hallucinations into his stories, telling stories that he later realizes never happened, and often going \\"unstuck\\" in time, Vonnegut-style, throwing any sense of continuity right out the window. Knock, knock. Who's there? A surrealist. A surrealist who? Banana. Like that, just smarter and silly-less.Denis Johnson's prose is magnificent. Look:...this afternoon was the best of those times. We had money. We were grimy and tired. Usually we felt guilty and frightened, because there was something wrong with us, and we didn't know what it was; but today we had the feeling of men who had worked. p. 65.Jesus' Son's F'head is probably the most sympathetic anti-hero you'll find. You'll laugh at the dead-on dialogue, smile at F'head's innocence, cry at his loneliness, wonder at the wonderfulness of the writing, and act out any other verb that can be associated with a butt-busting good read.So, read this book."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Initially, I was a little wary of sampling yet another foray into drug culture, for this is how the book comes billed - don't be misled, the scenario of seediness and drugs is contingent: Johnson places his character in extreme situations (both internal and external situations) in order for his decisions to matter, and they do, they matter deeply, as do his thoughts and words. Here is a character who is lost and who is searching, and who has the courage to face what constitutes himself, however appalling that may prove to be. There is also much humour, and a good measure of tolerance.*Also, contrary to some opinions, the stories are structured, with startling juxtapositions of seemingly incongruent ideas actually shedding insight one upon the other, and signalling where the narrator's capacity for direct examination falters, being replaced by an examination of the so-called external world. The word surface is spare and lyrical and beautiful. There really seems to be no reason to avoid reading this book.*The film pales in comparison. The hardcover edition is printed on good quality stock with a complementary cover design, while the paperback takes sad advantage of the possibility of recycling toilet paper, the somewhat brown pages partially disintegrating under the gentle touch of the reader's hand."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"This book was recommended to a short story writing class I was in, and I can't say that I wasn't a little skeptical about the promise the book held. Needless to say, I was blown away by the way Johnson writes. It seems like you're reading one long flowing poem. He even manages to make some of the more graphic imagery in the novel seem beautiful, something that is quite hard to do.There's something really interesting in the way Johnson makes the reader connect with a drug addict who obviously has no direction in life. This book is nowhere near as haunting as Requiem for a Dream, but it engages the reader nonetheless, carrying them through an entire book before they even realize they're near the ending.There so much going on in this book, as is the case with most post-modern (minimalist) books. Johnson seems to have a mastery of the sub-genre that Raymond Carver popularized. I love this book, and recommend it highly to anyone that has read Requiem for a Dream, or any of the works of Carver. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"The work of German born writer Denis Johnson will hold a peculiar place in the fashionably extensive fictional literature of \\"addiction\\", if he really belongs there at all--he transcends the genre he writes within by virtue of his oddly individual voice. You might say that these stories are not unlike something a more coherent David Lynch might pen if he had suffered the horrendous afflictions of drug addiction, alcoholism and also possessed a stronger moral sense.For all the sordid phantasmagoria in each one of these strangely touching, quietly brutal little parables, Johnson never once takes off from reality completely; in fact, not only is he writing about people and events which are all too real, he is detailing their most intimate characteristics in an uncommonly empathetic way. The ending of \\"Dundun\\" is the most painfully illustrative of this uncanny and singular ability.His instinctive understanding of the relationship between the irredeemably, casually broken and hopelessly lost is not flaunted or made to seem \\"hip\\" or anything of the kind: Johnson is aiming for a higher moral vision here, I think, something that hasn't been done before and certainly couldn't by a lesser talent or even an above average writer. This is not an appeal to the drug-addled \\"Trainspotting\\" vein (no pun intended) in literature but an amazingly successful attempt to transcend it. Explaining Johnson's unmistakable singularity in words is impossible to do, which is fitting: these tiny allegorical atom bombs are meant to roam through the subconscious, not to be explained logically. Essential reading."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Easily the best collection of Short Stories I have every read. Denis Johnson writes with an intensity, sparseness, and fearlessness that is unmatched in American Fiction. These stories revolve around a degenerate cast of characters wallowing through the drug culture of the late 20th century -- BUT the spirituality contained therein ultimately is life confirming and serene . . . without ever being preachy. A book that will keep you alive . . ."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"so good i pick it up for inspiration. collection has unity to it. prose is jarringly poetic. great exploration of Placelessness. must read for adventurous, not easily disturbed."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Stories involving drug addiction. Johnson's great gift is making something ugly so limpidly clear without judgment. He's so spot on about the minor drug-centered observations. You're really inside his narrator's world. So the book transports you, and if you are curious about or dealing with addiction issues in yourself or a loved one, you may find something illuminating here beyond the great writing and the neat structure. A small book and worth reading. I also recommend his novels, especially Resuscitation of a Hanged Man."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"I came across \\"Jesus' Son\\" by chance and was instantly hooked. The subject matter may not be for everyone, but his writing style is engaging very entertaining. The stories are tragic and funny all at once and almost always with some unexpected twists.

Drifting along in a dreamlike trance while taking in the beauty, the apathy, and the wonder of life through the eyes of FHD. LOVE IT"},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"Although Denis Johnson's JESUS' SON is often compared to Charles Bukowski, I think this is profoundly unfair to Johnson; he is a far better writer. The two writers feature similar characters in their stories, but Johnson has a gift for language that has seldom been seen. His is the art of the perfect sentence, the perfect, surprising, shocking word.The stories are very, very loosely linked stories that could well feature the same narrator. A couple of the stories reference events in early ones, and there is nothing to forbid our seeing the same person at the center of each story. The narrative voice is consistent throughout. It is possible that Johnson has confirmed that all the stories are given us by the same character. Certainly the same kinds of problems emerge in each. These are tales of people barely getting by, hardly making a living, surviving slightly above the raw subsistence level. Broken and battered people haunt every story. Drugs, alcohol, and random, often accidental violence run through the tales.All of this is good, but what makes the stories so thrilling for me is Johnson's mastery of language. I underline in pencil while I read. In nonfiction books I'll underline sentence after sentence, sometime entire paragraphs, later picking the book up after I have finished it to reread the passages that stood out for me at the time. I rarely underline fiction, however. One of the exceptions is JESUS' SON. Many of the sentences have the intensity of poetry. Most novel and short story writers we tend to read sentence by sentence, but Johnson you read word by word, as you would a poet."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"In Denis Johnson's stunning collection of short stories \\"Jesus' Son\\", there is an image that stays with you most of the time. This is the picture of loneness and desolation. In one of the best tales, called \\"Emergency\\", the main character whose name goes by FH and a friend drive through the country. They eventually find a drive-in. But the weather is awful and there is no one in there - even though there is a movie being played. Johnson's description of this place is the combination of beauty and sadness.Since the writer has a natural ability to construct both metaphors and harrowing images the scene is depressive and, at the same time, powerful, uplifting. \\"Famous movie stars rode bicycles beside a river, laughing out their gigantic, lovely mouths. If anybody had come to see this show, they'd left when the weather started. Not one car remained, not even a broken-down on from last week, or one left here because it was out if gas. In a couple of minutes, in the middle of a whirling square dance, the screen turned black, the cinematic summer ended, the snow went dark, there was nothing but my breath'.But before this, while FH was riding around this deserted part of the world, he though he saw angels - had a vision. This was just Johnson's build up for something stronger, a primal screen for the ending of loneness. The narrator is never still, he is always in motion, and no matter where he goes, he is always surrounded by depressed and depressive souls.The collection title comes from a Lou Reed's song called \\"Heroin\\". Addiction is part of the narrator's life - an important part, it brings people close and tear them apart. While trying to recover - without putting much thought on it - readers have a glimpse of a possibility of a better life, of something less sad and depressive. It is a drop of hope in a nightmare ocean of sadness."},{"Title":"Jesus' Son","review":"I read this book for a book club, chosen by our resident High School literature teacher.

It had stories where people would shoot heroin and puke a lot. It seemed like the same guy was telling all the stories only sometimes it didn't so maybe I was mixed up in the head or maybe the guy writing the stories. I remember a lot of times it was tragic and they drank and a lot of cars got wrecked. When they drank the snow would be like blossoms or something lyrical like that but mostly it was laconic only not a fancy word like laconic. Someone shot someone and they tried to drive him to the hospital. A man took himself to a rooming house and he overdosed. Stuff like that.

Salvatore's writing in general, Drow World/culture, Forgotten Realms, RPG gaming and good character development.Review:The book is not a great book by any stretch of the imagination. It is entertaining if you enjoy stories in the Forgotten Realms but you will not get much in the way of plot resolution. Obould takes his war against the humans, dwarves and elves to the next level. He prepares to seige Mithral Hall with support from Frost Giant allies (translate: Stupid artillery). The Seige is successfully forces Clan Battlehammer back into Mithral Hall, breaking down the front door and uniting the three Dwarven kingdoms against the Orc threat. Obould makes the effort to hold the ground he has won to date (I liked the fact that he is not a mindless animal. It is nice to see a villian with some level of reason and pragmatism.)The story does a bit to help resolve some of the \\"love triangles\\" -- if you can say any of the characters have love for each other, not fantasy in lust or high school crushes. The childishness of the relationships is frankly a bit insulting. I really wish the author would go back to developing the characters as he had done when he created Drizzt. For the most part, the characters are two dimensional in a soap opera way...the writing should grow with the maturity of the average reader.I have come to really enjoy the Dwarven characters(in general). I am looking forward to the next book due to the Dwarven underdark exploration for lost friends/allies. King Bruenor will make for great reading -- he has character and is not politically correct all the time.Drizz't really needs to get over himself and move on with his life. The book tries to help with that but it is a very slow process facilitated by an interesting Elf character, Innovindil. The lessons learned by Drizz't should have been clear a very long time ago.It is kind of sad that the author needs the evil, sentient sword, Khazid'hea, to move the plot along. The sword even started to be interesting even though it is painfully obvious in its actions. The characters have become that weak.Galen Firth is one of the most annoying characters ever created. In the world of Forgotten Realms, he should have been cut down a very long time ago. His annoying factor and stupidity is not quite on bar with Jar Jar Binks of Star Wars fame (the only character that I know of to have an entire audience at a local movie premiere to chant -- 'Die Jar Jar! Die!' at his first appearance on screen). The fact Galen survives is just down right painful when interesting characters like Dragna die needlessly.I hope that R. A. Salvatore takes time before writing the next book in the series / involving Drizz't. He needs to get his creative juices flowing again. Please focus on developing interesting characters and a solid plot line...the rest will all fall into place. Please do not continue to use the same formula as used in this trilogy."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I see everyone complaining that there was no resolutioin, King Obould sucked as a antagonist...blah, blah, blah. Everyone missed the point of the book. It was to wrap up a trilogy that is a fraction of what the series is. This story, (The whole complete Drizzt story) has span more than a decade in writing with like twnety something books in the whole series. This is just another stepping stone to the next part, that's all it is. If you read it without reading the other books before it, you will get frustrated. If you read the first two books in the series and not read this one, you will get frustrated. If you've never read one of these books before,, you are allready frustrated because you haven't found one of the most engaging and elaborate stories ever written.And everyone forgets that this story is also developing Drizzt's character in a whole new light. Yes he's still the invincible drow that left Menzoberranzan decades ago, but now he's lost some of the vulnerability that made him such a dynamic character. This late in the series, Drizzt has been accepted by most of the people on the surface. Now that that has happened, there really is no story. Most people think that the whole orc army coming to the north and taking over towns is the story, but the story really is the emotional journey of this one dark elf who suddenly seems emotionally vulnerable again.Basically, what everyone needs to focus on is the change in Drizzt's character, and not the unimportant loose ends. That's what suspending disbelief is all about. If you over analyze the story it becomes like star-trek, all technical. I give it a four because it is still a good story, but not worth me reading 20-30 times like some of his other books.Oh yeah, you have to read it if you want any resolutioin to Drizzt's love life problems."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"This group of Salvatore books was a fun read, as always, but I couldn't justify 4 or 5 stars. This 'trilogy' really didn't do much for me. The biggest problem I had with it was this book. It took care of some mildy interesting side plots which did keep me reading, but when I noticed I had only 50 pages left, I began to worry. The one thing I did not want from this trilogy was a quick and sloppy end to this war. I didn't get it, and for that I am glad. But that is the biggest flaw of this book. While some things get accomplished, it did nothing but set up an inevitable follow up. Don't get me wrong, I cannot wait for the conclusion to the orc conflict, and I will undoubtabley read the next set of books. However, this group was mediocre overall, with some good spots, and one of the most irritating endings I have ever read. Good trilogy with an incredibley disappointing ending."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Salvatore is one of my favorite authors. And this series was making up for the previous few books that were written basically so he could write these characters again and set them up to be in better situations. Now any book is written to put people in situations and watch them go through it, but usually this happens in the book you are reading. The ending wasn't the great climax it usually is, it REALLY felt like it was all setting it up for future books. I like a novel that stands on it's own and leaves room OPEN for something to happen in the future (in your imagination or in a future book) BUT I don't like being set up for a future novel that he wants to write.So I just finished The Twin Blades, the third book in the Hunter's Blades Trilogy. Very good trilogy. I can't recommend it unless you have read all the other books containing Drizzt and Wulgar, because if you haven't read them then about half of this book won't make sense to you at ALL! There are about 14 books you would have to read (you could skip one and be ok) to understand this one. And since two characters from a different series of characters comes into it, I would recommend reading those 5 as well. Now most of these books are definately worth reading, so I recommend them all ;) And the Hunter's Blade trilogy was definately worth reading, but the first two books were better than this one. Since it was a trilogy, I was okay with the way the first two ended, leaving room for everything to be explained in the 3rd. BUT this was the last book in the trilogy, some of the MAJOR things should have been addressed. Instead it was left where we see things will be just as bad in a few months as they were now.Also I have a problem with the way Delly was treated. When she was introduced, she pushed Wulfgar to be a figher cuz that's true to his heart, blah blah blah. She was very understanding (TOO understanding ;)) and all that. Somewhere between her being introduced and this book, aparently the author decided to totally change her. Instead of this being gradual because of circumstances she was put under, we are given NO explanation, he ignores how she behaved earlier and she just suddenly turns into a twit with no explanation. Also he kills off someone who was so obviously a 'plot twist that didn't go over as well as he thought it would', so get rid of the character. I don't have a problem with people dying, just don't kill someone only because you don't want them around anymore cuz people don't like them :p It should feel right or help the story somehow. AND one other major issue I have... in a previous story he messed up. He added an element he thought would make it interesting (which lots of tv shows have done as well). (I don't want to say what it was and spoil it for people) Well it didn't make it interesting, it was okay, but would definately get in the way of future adventuring stories. So he got rid of it in this book, very stupidly too. Also very in a way to set it up for a future adventure :p I don't like being so OBVIOUSLY set up! One of the things I've always loved about this author is that he is NOT obvious. Yes sometimes you can guess where the twist is going to go, but more because you are paying attention and are smart, not because it's all laid out in such a straight line. That's cheap and anyone can write a book like that. Be interesting! I still liked the book, for the most part it was great. But having the two major plot things at the end that were SO done to fix a previous mistake, kinda put a bad taste in my mouth.Oh yeah, I also don't like the love story. In an earlier series we were told Just Friends Just Friends Just Friends, so much so you couldn't think of anything else. Over the years certain fans have whined nooooo they looove each other! So fine aparently the author gave in. I don't like it, Drizzt deserves someone else, like ME! But the author decides to hook them up. In the meantime we meet someone else PERFECT for my boy! But no, he's stuck with her. BLECH! It didn't feel natural for me, although I am sure some fans are very excited about Drizzt's current love life.Anyway I'd recommend his earlier books, and if you like them keep going. But don't start with this one, you'd ruin all the earlier ones."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"---Spoilers---I was upset at the end when things were just left hanging.

Thanks Bob for catching me off-guard. I'm looking forward to the next COTH novel with an even bigger puddle of drool.The development of Drizzt and his emotional rollercoaster has made me more interested in him. Over the years I had become somewhat bored with Drizzt. He fought, he won, end of story. But now he has feelings. Stronger feelings than I've read before. He's been fleshed out, along with the other COTH characters, to the point where I'm more interested in reading about him.Wulfgar, Catti-Brie, Bruenor, and Regis also grew as characters. Regis I felt was getting older. Showing the hardships of war a little more than he'd like. He's nothing like the fat Halfling that dozed on the lakeshore fishing. Bruenor has seen death and survived. It wasn't really addressed, but I feel he may be taking a bit of a conservative stance at times, now that he sees he is mortal. Wulfgar and Catti-Brie are on the road again, together. There may be some tension between them, but I doubt it will amount to much. Catti-Brie is committed to Drizzt and Wulfgar is/was committed to his adopted daughter and Delly. I think he's in for another emotional road-trip in looking for another wife. Meanwhile Catti-Brie will be thinking of Drizzt and wondering how things will work out in the future. Is there a chance for a half drow-half human child?In conclusion, I see The Two Swords not as the end of the Hunter's Blade Trilogy but as the beginning of a new era for Bob. His writing style has changed dramatically since his first story, Echoes of the Fourth Magic. He moved up in skill with his Demon Wars series and moves up again with The Two Swords. And I think that has brought about the negative reviews. Fans expected to read the classic Drizzt fighting evil in the Underdark. Instead they read a story about the COTH as people fighting an evil that may win. Hopefully, like it did with Vector Prime, the negativity will eventually be washed away. Only time will tell with this newly defining moment in Bob's career.Neil@TK42OONE.com2004 TK42ONE.com Productions"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"So many people are complaining about the loose ends and the invincibility of Drizzt....WHOOOPPEE!!!The loose ends are there for a reason. How can an author continue on a story if all the ambiguities have been closed up? He can't! So to all the people who want a close ended story....its not gonna happen.And contrary to some of the people who reviewed this book I like Drizzt being the unstoppable character that he is. For crying out loud he survived the wilds of the underdark, various dragons, and even greater demons.....hes supposed to be tough. When i imagine Drizzt in battle it isnt him losing....its him dominating the battlefield.Now given characters like Artemis Entreri also have been through similar if not just as rich experiences as the famed drow and should be able to stand toe to toe with Drizzt, but the idea of a barbarian orc lord in invincible armor was ridiculous. I saw that as the only fault in RAS book. For one thing....glass steel was a technique only known to the sun elves and the avariel. How did a stupid orc ever find a way to make some.Still with this major fault i felt that Bob relayed an excellent story filled with action, and ultimately a story that shown into the heart of Drizzt. As for the loose endings ....I cant wait for his next novel."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"There was so very much to like about this series. The action was well realized, fast paced, and imaginatively told. These are like adventure war novels set in the forgotton realms. The characters are, for the most part interesting- replete with interestingly rendered orcs. There is even a hint that in the numerous-perhaps unending-skirmishes between orcs and the dwarves, that maybe the orcs weren't always at fault. There is character development-though not much. So I have to admit that I read each of these books in about two days after I got them and I thought they were, on the whole, a fun read.That being said, there were times, way too many times, that I would want to throw the books across the room in disgust at the timidity and cowardice Salvatore demonstrates.There are several moments where key characters appear to be killed only to have it turn out that they survive at the beginning of the next chapter, or a few chapters later. I must stress these passages aren't ambiguous. THere is nothing like, \\"it appeared, though he couldn't be sure,\\" or \\"it looked as if blah, blah, but then they disappeared from view.\\" Salvatore describes, completely unsurvivable situations,only to rather cheaply let his babies (Cattie-brie, Wulfgar, Drizzt and REgis) off the hook. Listen, when a mountain giant hurls a boulder at you, and it hits and lands on you, you can not appear in the next chapter with nought but a limp. You can appear battered, bloody, flattened and dead. I suddenly understood the anger felt by a certain number 1 fan from a certain Stephen King book. So if Mr. Salvatore wants to write scenes that make it appear his core characters are going to get killed, fine. I would just appreciated it if he had the respect not to try to cheat them back on to the pages.Also by constantly deus ex machinaing the fan favs from the jaws of death, he subsequentially robs his narrative of any power it might possibly have.The experience has left me a bit reluctant read his next series."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Compared to the Grisham, Patterson et al books I read this was a great book. It blows away Ludlum and so many other authors. So why whine because he didn't pick YOUR anticipated ending? By the way, I don't play D&D; but I think Obould is in it and therefore cannot be killed yet in a Forgotten realms book.This was an awesome book even by RAS standards. I mean you get DEEP into his character (Drizzt) and emotions. And there is a lot going on here in many sub plots. Some characters die, some find themselves, there are huge battle scenes. I loved it.If you want a new RAS book with new characters read \\"the Highwayman\\". It was incredible. Or pick up the Demon Awakens series, but don't whine if a character that you love dies. RAS has no problem killing off characters, but we are reading about the life and adventures of Drizzt here. So I doubt Drizzt will die in this series.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I've read a bunch of RAS. The only time I was unhappy was when Wulfgar was killed. I've read the reviews. Complaints about Drizzt, Cattie-brie, Wulfgar, Bruenor, and Regis being invincible. Another wanting RAS to \\"kill someone already\\". You people are sick. I want heroes that are invincible and live thru everything. If I didn't, I'd watch \\"reality crap\\" on TV. This triliogy, as in all other books RAS has written (with the exception noted above, which he remedied) about these characters, is solidly in the must read category."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I have always been a huge RAS fan. But when this series ended and Breunor was on his deathbed, NAY was dead with absolutely NO WAY of coming back. Viola, he's back and he is alive! Wha-? Huh?? He was d e a d. DEAD. There should be no reason for him to miraculously survive. It made no sense other than RAS is afraid to kill/ maim his characters. Maybe he should read Paul S. Kemp or GRR Martin for a glimpse of good authors who are not afraid to kill their characters. What a collosal letdown."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Only about halfway through the story now, and as with all the other in the series I think it is great.

Great read, my husband and son both have enjoyed all of the R A Salvatore book series."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"**There are spoilers in this review**First, I find it odd that a lot of folks are outright begging Salvatore to kill main characters. Yes, the whole \\"did they die or not\\" thing is getting tedious, but I can honestly say there's no way I would enjoy this series more without Cattie-Brie, Regis, or Bruenor. Wulfgar might be the only one that I could have accepted dying because it was pretty well done when he did, and RAS gave us enough reason to hate him at the time to not mind it so much. But c'mon, kill Cattie-Brie?? Yeah, let's kill off Drizzt's main love interest thats been developing from book one and start over. Sorry, but at this point, that would just be dumb. If your going to kill anyone off, let it be the ultra-annoying Galen Firth. Which brings me to my next point.Why on earth did RAS make us hate Nesme SOOO bad just to have Silverymoon pretty much choose it over Mithral Hall? He's given us a reason to hate that town with a passion at every turn, yet he frustrates us with the events in this book. I don't think I'm alone in saying that the minute I get to read that Nesme and everyone in it has been burnt to a cinder by a horde of Red Dragons, I will literally stand up and cheer. And the more detailed the demise of Firth, the better. Hell I hated him worse then any of the main antagonists in this series by far, or pretty much anything he's written (ok maybe not Kessel, but close!).Overall though, I think this was a mediocre close to this trilogy. The ending made some things I was waiting for pretty dry. I was waiting for Drizzt and Cat's reunion and they run to each other, finally kiss, and....we read that they are going to be going back out separately pretty much immediately (with their other semi-love interests no less). Wulfgar finally get's a girl that will keep him out of Drizzt and Cat's way and...splat. You have to think that the end of the third book in a trilogy should have one hell of an ending, and this one just didn't cut it. This book wasn't bad enough to make me not read the next trilogy, but it was pretty disappointing overall."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"this has been the most satisfying drizzt series i've read. why? because the big guy wins finally. you know who i mean. the most interesting character in FR...Obould Many-Arrows. he wins. the orcs finally win one. and its about damn time. why shouldn't the orcs have a nation of their own? why can't the progress as a people? finally those pompous dwarfs--and i love Bruenor as much as anyone--and those uppity elves get a kick in their teeth.

I would highly recommend this read to any fantasy buff.

My only complaint is that this is the last book in this series, so far.."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I've read about all of the R. A.

I am about finished with the above mentioned book, and sincerely hope that Mr. Salvatore continues with more novels about the legends of this Drow (Drizzt) and his friends. Simply put, a spell-binding character. Well done sir, please don't let them die the writers death."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"To me this story, and the other two editions in the trilogy, are more about the dwarves and their defense of their lands than it is about Drizzt Do'Urden...which is fine by me. Don't get me wrong, Drizzt is a great character, but Salvatore imbues his dwarvish characters with so much personality that Drizzt becomes a secondary player for the most part. While most of the dwarven characters share many stereotypical dwarven traits, Salavatore brings them all to life on the page - from the stalwart courage and gruffness of Dagna, Banak, Tred, and Torgar to the most unconventional dwarf Pikel and the amamzing Thibbeldorf Pwent and his Gutbusters. From my standpoint it was a very good book and I look forward to reading the next installment/trilogy. Mr Salvatore, there is no need to hide behind the popularity of Drizzt, however, so name the next one Bruenor's Axe to Grind or just Hee...Hee...Hee...My Brudder!"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"a review?The Two Swords by R.A. Salvatore is the final book in the Hunter's Blades Trilogy. It is a well written examination of the Hunter (Drizz't) and his relationship with his blades... or in other words, of how Drizz't has chosen to deal with the world around him. Readers know that Obould, the orc king, is a powerful new enemy, so we will not go there in this review.However, it is possible that Salvatore has created his best villain ever here. Obould has almost transcended base evil and is practically living on a higher plane of existence. The question is not \\"How do we kill him?\\" but is rather \\"Can and should he be killed?\\"Salvatore leads us to interesting questions and answers throughout this book. However, the action is still strong and vivid, the characters continue as believable and beloved, and the reader is sucked in quickly. The stakes are high, both on the kingdom level and the personal level, for all those involved.A good, swift read that will leave you breathless and thinking."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Absolutely horrible ending to this series which wasn't very good to begin with.There was a time when RAS used to be one of the most enthralling writers in the Fantasy genre. Now he's become stale, he rehashes old plots, and all of the main characters are invincible.One can only hope that RAS can revert back to his older style. And let's hope that happens sometime soon."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Let me start by saying that I have been a fan of the Dark Elf books since day 1, which only serves to magnify my disappointment with this book and this trilogy as a whole.I can appreciate Salvatore's efforts to further develop these already familiar characters, however, the overdone introspection and self analysis quickly went from the \\"development\\" stage to irritating diatribes of whining and self pity. While the story did offer a few (far too few) unique elements, it was ultimately the secondary characters that kept me interested. The main characters were simply put back into old plot lines under new book titles--- Mithril Hall being invaded, Drizzt's self-analysis and fear of having lost a best friend(s), Cattie Brie & Wulfgar romantic tension. Again, some different twists, but ultimately more of what we've already seen.Finally, and most importantly, from a pure reading enjoyment standpoint, the ending was terrible. Absolutely terrible. Salvatore did an excellent job building to what you thought would be a glorious climax and conclusion, then allows the momentum to fizzle horribly. Anti-climactic is a kind description. There was simply no sense of reward or resolution. You will turn the last page then quickly check the cover to confirm that this was indeed book three of a trilogy, because it is not evident in the ending. The only upside is we can be certain more books are to come."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I tend to agree with the many negative reviews here and have nothing earth-shattering to add, except to say 'here, here' to those that have recommended a much-needed hiatus from Drizzt for Salvatore. I've read every Drizzt novel in addition to just about everything RAS has written and overall, I love him. Hovever, this was the most disappointing travesty of a third novel in a trilogy I have ever read. (The 2 stars is for sentimental reasons only) I kept hoping and praying that SOMETHING would happen to redeem the book, but as each page turned it became less and less likely until finally, it was over- and pathetically so. RAS simply has too many 'beloved-characters' going and not enough of stuff HAPPENING to those characters.For those reviewers that read this and thought it was worthy of 4 or 5 (or even 3) stars, you obviously haven't read any of RAS' good stuff (Dark Elf Trilogy then Icewind Dale Trilogy is a good way to start)--go do that, then you will undoubtedly come back here and reduce that rating you posted for Two Swords.As others have mentioned RAS needs to switch gears to the long-awaited/ anticipated continuation of Jarlaxle and Entreri's adventures--'cause that will be something truly to look forward to. RAS' strentghs lie in his mastery of the drow and the choreographing of memorable swordplay battles--both of which would be central to any series involving J&E.;Switch gears RAS!! PLEASE!!! Then, after a few years, Drizzt can come whirling back into our lives and we'll all be happy to read that he did."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Although I understand why some people are disappointed by this latest installment from Salvatore, I'd have to say I enjoyed this novel more than any of his FR stories since Servant of the Shard. However, if you enjoy this book, it will be because Salvatore is trying something new, i.e.- Drizzt is using his intellect more and his swords less.That, I think, is why other reviewers have either loved the book or hated it- none of those really intense, beautifully written one-on-one fight scenes that made Salvatore so famous. A fair point, I think, is that the end of the book is paced too fast, especially the final chapter. Additionally, I agree, that little is resolved at the end of the story- other than some real movement in Drizzt's and Cattie-Brie's relationship. Obould is still out there, but that's OK, because he is a worthwhile villain because of his ability to plan ahead and inspire his hordes, not because of any fighting prowess he might have had.So, I do think this is a must read Salvatore novel, but existing fans should be prepared for something new, and they'll have to decide whether they like this style from Salvatore, or the old one better. I personally didn't miss the one-on-one combat so much, because, I think (spoiler), Salvatore makes it very clear that, despite the fact that their battle is interrupted, Obould can't stand up to Drizzt in single combat without his impregnable armour. So for now, less sword play and more character development; without Drizzt's foil (Entreri), I don't miss the combat-oriented writing that much."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I have been a long time fan of the Companions of the Hall, and a growing fan on all of Salvatore's work. I believe this was a great end to a great trilogy full of action and memorable moments. It's not easy keeping long time reader amused with the ongoing adventures of the same five main characters for so long. I commend Mr. Salvatore greatly. Yes, this doesn't have the same feeling that the companions of the hall had in the old days, but times change, and people grow.We can't always say that 'the other books were better' or that 'oh come on, that's so cheap, an orc in uber-armor and a massive army! I could come up with something better than that!' Well, maybe you can, but in a reasonably created fantasy world, not every bad guy is going to be Artemis Entreri or Jarlaxle, and not every adventure is going to be daring the underdark or reclaiming Mithral Hall.I believe what Salvatore is trying to do is to give us all a deeper view into the workings of the five best friends, especially Drizzt. He has done, by far, something that can be considered something marvelous by any author - creating and molding several characters so that they are imperfect, but exceptional by fantasy standards, then lets them grow into these wonderful beings of fiction that we all so love.Bottom line is that the Companions of the Hall are some of the greatest fantasy characters to ever grace the pages of the world.If you are a long time fan like myself, this book will prove greatly satisfying to you, bringing to fruit somethings that we have waited a long time to see. I promise that you will like it.\\"Hee hee hee!\\" ~Pikel"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"im very torn in regards to this book. looking at it strictly as a novel, i enjoyed it like i have enjoyed all other salvatore works, despite the fact that drizzt is very scarce in the book. BUT, looking at the book in regards to what it was supposed to do, i was disapointed. nothing is resolved in the book. i dont see the point of having made it a trilogy. if anything, the hunters blade trilogy seems like one long book leading up to something. im glad to see that the drizzt and co storyline will continue, but i got no closure from this book. little was contributed to the overall story. this is made even worse considering that salvatore is taking a possible 2 yr withdraw from the drizzt storyline to work on jarlaxle and artemis books. as a book it was an exciting read, but it dint deliver what it was supposed to. i am a huge fan of salvatore and it pains me to give this such a low score"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I love R.A.

I could go on but you get my point. I think people were more disapointed because the book spent and in fact this trilogy spent more time than it probably should in developing Drizztz's character.

It deals with both enormous external stuggles (The Orc Horde, sacking of Nesme, Prominent Dwarves deaths) as well as the internal ones (What it means to be an Elf, Love and Prejudice). There are many issues that are not resolved to this concluding book but it just sets us up for more in the future. No one brings forth a good villian the way that Bob can, and Obould fits the bill nicely. Gerti and her Frost Giants lend further credibility to the enemy.

Salvatore's best Drizzt series ever.The reasons I was disappointed are as follows. This book scarcely deals with Drizzt at all, it has him on some (in my opinion) pointless side adventure that really seemed out of character for him to be on. I am glad the love triangle of Drizzt, Wulfgar and Catte-brie was solved finally but I thought the execution of it seemed forced, as if he didn't really want to write it, but felt he had too.If he is so tired of writing Drizzt books he should kill him off instead giving us this drivel.I thought Drizzt's reasons for not going back to Mithrall Hall after he thought his friends were killed was understandable to a point, but once he saw how bad the war was going, at the least the Drizzt I know from the previous books would have gone back to face that struggle instead of the silly quest for the pegasus. All in all the book hardly has Drizzt in it at all, and when he is there, he whines, but overall I liked the series, and Salvatore certainly left everything open for the inevitable sequels, but I was disappointed, the first two books were the best to date."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"When I read my first Salvatore novel(s) a couple of years ago I was, honestly, less than impressed. I was never a big fantasy fiction fan outside of Tolkien's works and my forays into Dungeons and Dragons as a student. But a friend had insisted I read the Icewind Dale trilogy so to please him (shut him up, really), I consented and dug in. The books were O.K. Then I read the next trilogy, much to my surprise and again at the insistence of the aforementioned friend. I found these next three works to be quite an improvement over the first three and yes, you guessed it, I went on to read the next trilogy and all subsequent Drizzt books after that. I must admit, I was hooked. I suppose I was lucky in that I became a fan recently and was able to read many of the books back-to-back without having to await a publish date; up until the Hunter's Blade trilogy, that is. Now I must wait like the rest of Mr. Salvatore's readers for each and every opus. So naturally, my expectations were higher than most folk's for \\"The Two Swords\\", since I actually was forced to sit for the year between it and \\"The Lone Drow\\". And I must say, the author did not disappoint this go around. \\"The Two Swords \\" was fun-filled and action-packed. Mr. Salvatore's writing and style have improved much throughout the years. His talent for character development and obvious love of \\"casting against type\\" (drow rangers; dwarf druids) make this final chapter in the Hunter's Blade trilogy a very enjoyable read. Drizzt's \\"internalizations\\" at the beginning of each book part are tremendously well-done and offer unique insights into the mind of a unique, albeit unlikely, hero. I found this book to be a fitting and fascinating end to another great trilogy from a writer for whom I've grown very fond. And now the next long wait begins..."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Ok, same old story I'm a big fan sense Icwind Dale Trilogy yada yada yada...Loved the first two books, couldn't wait for this one. What a let down! Nothing was accomplished, no loose ends tied up. The only reason it got a three star rating was the fact it did surprise me. The surprise was I really wasn't expecting NOTHING to happen in this book. The fight scenes were ok. They felt kind of rushed through, especially the big end fight scene, only one page long. Maybe RAS was tired of the good guys always winning at the end of the books. Personally I don't care if the bad guys would have won, but nobody winning c'mon.Who says that they are tired of a story and that they plan on walking away from the books for a while, and leave two armies ready to fight right next to each other. A person trying to cash in on the next book of drizzt, when he decides we have waited long enough. Now don't get me wrong. I love RAS, I have all his books in Hard Back, but I think he let us down in this book."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I'm a huge fan of Drizzt. The problem that I am having is that I want to continue reading about this drow elf but the author is ever increasingly making him a weak character. Drizzt has never really defeated any large bosses, it always comes at the hands of his companions. Drizzt never finds real love... I suppose because he is always conflicted. Drizzt is never the real hero in any of the stories, it always turns out to be a side kick.Another thing about Salvatore's writings that is starting to wear on me is that none of the main characters ever die, when you think that they do he finds a way to bring them back. Wulfgar should have remained dead, Catti-Brie and Bruenor should both died somewhere along the way as well.It appears to me that this book was comprised of 380 pages of fluff and no real substance and that is unfortunate. Yes, I will buy the Orc King and continue reading, however, I'm going in assuming to be disappointed once again since this has been the pattern since the Dark Legacy Trilogy.Come on Mr. Salvatore don't write a book just for a buck put a little passion into it. Kill off a main character once in a while or at the very least but some mystery and unsuspecting turns in the plot for once. Stop writing as if you are trying to create a play guide for a dungeon master somewhere. I see the potential of your characters and the brilliance of your writing style but what I am not finding is a quality story. This one has left me the most disappointed so far. Here's hoping the Orc King breaks this pattern."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I've come to the conclusion that all of Salvatore's creations leave as many questions unanswered as ends tied up. LOL! At least he keeps his details fairly straight. But I suspect it'll be another year before we hear anything else from Drizzt - his most recent release seems to be about our friends Entreri and Jarlaxle."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Hmmm where to start. I just finished this book and am happy I read it. However, I have a small feeling of being given only 3/4 of a hamburger when I ordered a full burger. What I mean is this... the book was supposed to (not sure if Salvatore said it or not) tie up some loose ends and bring closure to a few storylines. In my line of thinking only one of the storylines was really moved forward in any substantial way. I won't post spoilers here, but there a few things that may have been written a little differently. But, I don't know the larger scope of storylines that Salvatore has planned so maybe this is for the best.With that being said, the books itself is a great read. Full of action and drama. There are a few twists int he book as well as a couple points where one holds out hope for a single hero... there are a couple memorable deaths in the book. Salvatore is one of the few authors who gets inside the head of the 'bad guy'. If you read the first two books int he trilogy you are sure to want to read this one as well."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I'm giving this book 3 stars because it is average. It is better than a lot of crap coming out but still not as good as Salvatores past work.Most of the negative reviews have been pretty close to the way I feel.When the series first began most readers were close to the main characters. I actually cared what happened to them, however it's hard to really get into a story when no matter what happens you know that the main characters won't be hurt.I think others have pointed out that the main characters are invincible. Right now I cared more about secondary characters more than the main ones.I think it's too late for Salvatore to do anything about it. So many readers and reviewers feel this way and have pointed it out that if he did kill off a main character I think most of us would just say he did it to appease us (the readers). It's a darned if you do darned if you don't at this point.I read in another review of his books that said he should do a book based in the future and following Drizzt. Say 100 or 200 years when many of the main characters would be dead.I personally think that is a great idea or that he should take a page from Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman and do a Next Generation series. That would be worth reading."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"This book had everything I look for in a Drizzt book- fast paced action, intrigue, suspense, and great fight scenes. It's great to see some of the characters together again and some cliffhangers with some of the characters. I was surprised to see a single negative review until I clicked on the reviewers \\"wish list\\". \\"Thirteen\\" is not on my wish list, and if that is your reading level, this book may be too sophisticated for you. Drizzt has some tough internal reflection to live through here as he battles with his Hunter self and his more surface elf-like personna. Obould has become a nemesis as significant as Entreri. You will love this book."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"If you started out reading earlier volumes of R A's work featuring Drizzt and loved them then you may well be disappointed with his work on this trilogy and any future works. I myself will never pickup another book written by R.A. as his work has become horrible and a labor to read completely through."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"SPOILERS:This trilogy has developed the characters even more, mostly Drizzt. I belive R.A left out a few obvious things for obvious reasons. Obould. Orcs still roaming. Baby gone. The new strange love triangle between Drizzt/Cattibrie/Wulfgar.Some people say these things make it a bad book. He did not want to make things happen to fast. Why try squeeze more in that book when you can fully explain the details in a new series?Why was Delly killed with so little mourning over her? Was she in the end just a Luskan Bar Wench never to have had a good life? At least she could have been kidnapped by orcs and rescued in daring raid by her beloved husband.However, it still left me wondering. I did not expect it to end the way it did. But I guess that is a good thing! Anticipation has increased because of it!(For future books)All I know is if he does not come out with a new series, I would rate this disappointing, because then the ending would be in my opinion horrible. It would leave you wondering, not really an end at all. I dont think he would do that, though."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"\\"The Two Swords\\" is a perfect blend of emotions. It had me on the edge of my seat one moment, instilling me with compassion and empathy the next, only to follow by inciting joy or causing me to laugh out loud over some of the antics carried out by one character or another. I am purposely avoiding mentioning names and scenarios because I feel, if you haven't already, it is most certainly a must read for any who enjoy fantasy fiction. R. A. Salvatore has taken me through the growth and development of his beloved characters through his words and captivating stories. His exceptional skill in writing has painted a picture in my mind that enticed me, drawing me into the story so fully, that I found his book impossible to put down. I feel Mr. Salvatore has orchestrated the perfect ending (though I do hope to read more!) to a long road as each character found their place and worth in the world. In the end, while still leaving tales for the imagination, I came to understand that adventure, in many forms, will always await the 'Companions of the Hall'. \\"The Two Swords\\", in my opinion, is a masterwork, worthy of appreciation."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"The Two Swords, like RAS other works, is a captivating tale with much of its focus directed toward the emotional struggles of the characters as well as how the army of Obould will change the realms. While the battles are still great (you have to admire Salvatore's dwarves and the ingenius devices of war they use)the strength of this novel relies on the how the characters come to terms with what happens around them. Filled with intricate plot twists and deception within the ranks, The Two Swords kept my attention through till the very end. Without giving much away, I would say that this novel finally defines Drizzt's character, and in those defining moments,the fabled drow ranger will forever be changed. It will be exciting to see how the surprises, turmoil, treachery and choices made in this book will effect the characters and the realms in the future. Do yourself a favor and enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"This is a bland tale with no suspense or unpredictability whatsoever. It has become obvious with Drizzt books that RAS is only now writing them for money and not for actual content. and for god's sake, kill somebody already!"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"As an individual character, Drizzt Do'Urden is as complicated as they come. The other main characters of this multi-trilogical series have all been well developed. What has always been lacking is the big picture.On a small scale the characters are lovable, for both their faults as well as their strengths, which has been the cornerstone of the series. What has not been developed adequately is the inner workings of the global political system. The Hunter's Blade Trilogy nicely, and finally, paints the picture of the complex politcal system of the region, and sets the stage for a \\"New Age\\".Although, at the tip of the sword was Mithral Hall, we see clearly how each city or citadel in the region reacts in a politcal way to the threat. It is a parallel, perhaps, to the real-world theater. The act of leaders taking different positions on the issue, and doing what each feels is in the best interest of their people or themselves is clearly defined. One such character is Lady Allustrial of Silvery Moon, whose beauty, grace, fairness, and good-nature have been crammed down our throats so much that we readers want her phone number. However when put to the test of doing what is right for her lands, or doing what is right for the region (which would include her lands) she takes choses her lands. It is not anything against her neighbors, but she certainly did not come to their aid until she had no choice.I liken that choice to the choice of King Thayoden of Rohan in Lord Of The Rings, when he chooses to send his people to Helm's Deep instead of turning and facing the invaders head on. He was only doing what he felt was right for his people. In the end, he had no choice but to meet them head on.The Fantasy Fiction Genre is always setting stages for new frontiers. Series like Star Trek and Star Wars, or Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms have always set major era changes, which welcome new characters, and new ways of thinking, often to the delight of the current reading generation. The Hunter'S Blade Series wraps up on kind of a anti-climax, but I think sets the stage for one of these \\"New Ages\\". In the near-future Salvatore novels, I think we will see exactly where this leaves-us-hanging trilogy is meant to take us.To place Salvatore in perspective with another fantasy writer who loves to leave you hanging, J K Rowling's Harry Potter: And The Half-Blood Prince leaves you hanging with more questions than answers, setting the stage for the final novel. This is exactly why I love Bob Salvatore's work, and look forward to the next trilogy of Drizzt and his friends."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"'The Two Swords' is the third volume of the 'Hunter's Blade Trilogy.' Interestingly enough, R.A. Salvatore decided not to resolve most of the plot lines started in the first two novels of this trilogy. The focus of the novel is how Drizzt will reunite with his friends, whom he believes dead, and how his friends are struggling to deal with the massive orc presence outside the gates of Mithral Hall.The only major plot line to reach a conclusion in this novel is that of what Drizzt will do about Cattie-Brie. There has been a bit of a love triangle between these two characters and Wulfgar since early on in the series. Finally, Drizzt makes his decision. Just when it appears resolved, events in Wulfgar's world cloud the picture. Any more details than that will spoil the story.Other than that, the novel fails to resolve the rest of the major plot lines, and instead resolves a few more minor ones. Drizzt and the surface elf Inovindil bring their quest for the captured pegasus to a conclusion. A few more characters meet their demise in this novel. However, none of them were really major characters in the trilogy.Ultimately, the novel keeps open the major plot lines for future novels, and introduces a few more. For instance, anxious to read about how the heros deal with Obould? Although there are confrontations, nothing is resolved here. Same for the presence of the Orcs outside Mithral Hall.This novel ends with essentially the introduction to the next novel or trilogy in the series. I did find that irritating. While I don't mind authors setting up future novels or trilogies in their current trilogy, it seemed a bit odd to not conclude this trilogy within the trilogy. There may not be a conclusion to this trilogy in the next few novels either because Salvatore has already introduced new plot lines that promise to shape the next novel or two.All this being said, I still enjoyed the book. There are plenty of detailed and expertly woven fight scenes. Salvatore seems to be the master of dark elves and dwarves and has created a very identifiable species stereotype for each. Salvatore's characters are classics, if not a bit invincible. If the reader had a dime it appeared one of the five major characters received a fatal blow, then nobody would have to buy his books. Still, they are familiar, unique, and occassionally imitated but never really duplciated. Fans of the Drizzt series will enjoy this book, but the one they'll really be looking forward to will be coming a bit farther down the line.Grade: 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Well, as indicated by the other reviewers, despite this being book three of the trilogy, the end is very free of resolutions. Rather, more avenues are opened up and not addressed.Drizzt and Innovindil continue their efforts to fight the orc legions, with Drizzt and Obould the orc-king finally meeting in combat. However, Salvatore changes gears slightly and makes this enemy beyond Drizzt's normal abilities. Salvatore does, however, make no secret of getting to Drizzt the tools needed for the job. While the battles show some of Salvatore's old flair, the inability of Drizzt the Invincible to defeat this blessed orc grates against me, especially given the inner rage Drizzt feels for this orc having killed (so Drizzt believes) his closest companions.The nonexistent love quadrangle between Catti-Brie, Wulfgar, Drizzt and Delly Curtie is played too far, as well as some cliched use of a newly-childless mother in her grief, to move this story along. It almost seemed like the cast might have been too large, and some of the chaff needed to be separated from the grain. Suffice to say that a number of consistent supporting characters do not survive this book intact, though the primary players of the Drizzt series come through for the most part. There is also still some notable lack of appreciation from the Nesmeans despite the efforts of those from Mithral Hall to aid them, selflessly.The end of this novel, though, leaves nothing finished. A new quest is planned, Wulfgar must travel down the river to seek a lost child, Catti-brie and Drizzt finally get to business, the orcs are still holding sway over the northland and the surface region of Mithral Hall, the humans are surprisingly willing to let the orcs stay put and dig in, there is new cooperation among Dwarven nations, and there is still strife between the frost giants and the orcs. But most of that was true at the end of the second book. While the writing of this story was fine, and perhaps the best in this trilogy, the necessity of flipping back and forth between so many disparate storylines seemed to give short shrift to them all. Yes there are clever and well-written fight scenes. Yes, there is sword and sorcery goodness. Yes there is stupidity and sacrifice. But there is no resolution. I think that loyal readers would not have minded wrapping up some of the many loose ends before starting a new series, we still would be willing to buy it. But leaving so much hanging, for a year at least, is really beneath a good author, in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I looked over some of the reviews here and I was truly shocked. I understand that everyone has his or her own tastes and opinions, but R. A. Salvatore is a truly talented writer. So many times, while reading \\"The Two Swords\\", I caught myself reacting verbally as the story unfolded. From ooos and ahs to mimicking Pikel's \\"uh oh\\" or \\"hee hee hee\\". The story did take on a different edge that I found very refreshing, but not so drastic as to alter the storyline. I think that perhaps some are overlooking the message. The ending to the book couldn't have been more perfect! The companions know who they are and where they belong. The road to adventure lies before them... always. They each learned more about themselves and each other. King Obould is a villain with a vision. In some ways, I thought he was similar to Drizzt when he first wandered out of the Underdark. I was thrilled with the way in which R. A. Salvatore handled the end of his story as well. It was a solution to an impossible battle that everyone (for now) has to live with. Would you rather that Drizzt settle every problem at the end of his blades? Even when it isn't something that's even feasible? I feel that I have grown with the characters over the years and I have come to know them as I would know a friend. So seeing the changes and growth and reading about the near death experiences keep me spellbound, NOT disappointed! Through the years we saw Wulfgar escape the bonds of hell and we walked with him during his turmoil till he found himself once more. Catti-Brie is no longer the confused teen, caught between her emotions and the same could be said for Drizzt. We learned and grew through their experiences and Drizzt's reflections and, in many ways, perhaps became better people ourselves. R. A. Salvatore has been a mentor, a guide, an entertainer, and a cherished friend all through his tales. I personally anxiously await a movie on the silver screen!"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I can't believe the number of people that are actually COMPLAINING that some of the main characters haven't died off! I for one, cannot imagine enjoying these books nearly as much with Bruenor, Regis, Wulfar, Drizzt, or Cattie Brie dying. This is, after all a fantasy book, and I believe that RA Salvatore has been able to create enough suspense regarding the fate of the characters without having to resort to killing them off for the sake of killing them off simply because they have \\"been around so long.\\" That is really what it comes down to for those that have called for the deaths of these characters: It has been a long time, so they MUST die.I found this series to be absolutely compelling. In fact, I read the whole trilogy in less than a week. The only real problem that I had with this trilogy was the fact that the Obould situation was not resolved. I thought it would be much better had Obould died, but maybe the storyline could have turned to the succession of Obould and how the orc nation may have had a series of orc's vying for ultimate supremacy and the effect that it has on the area surrounding the northland. Tribes could be in fighting as well as attacking nearby lands in order to achieve ultimate supremacy over the lands and the orc tribes.I thought Wulfgar's wife brought little to the story line, and although I did not like the genesis of her character from supporting wife to one that ultimately betrays wulfgar in such a short time to be a bit stretched, I believe that she brought little to the narrative line.All in all, this was a fantastic series, with many twists and turns and some real suspense. The more I read it, the more interested I became in dwarves and dwarven culture. I actually find dwarves to be the most interesting of all the races that populate the forgotten realms.Again, I repeat, these are fantasy books, and I read them because I care about the main characters. If even one of them dies, I think it brings the whole series down with it.Kudos to RA Smith, the best ADD fantasy writer in the world."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Unlike some other reviewers, I'll say the first 2 books in this trilogy were much better than the previous series, so I was very excited about this book.Big let down. I hope you didn't expect anything big to happen or anything. I hope you didn't become interested in any of the new characters like Nanfoodle or the dwarves who basically vanish from this book. I hope you didn't see into any of the foreshadowing about the good Drow goddess that's in FR 3.5 (Elliastrae sp?).It's just pretty bad. Everything seems rushed, characters aren't fleshed out at all. The only interesting part comes TOTALLY out of nowhere and has nothing to do with the previous 2 books. (Khazad'hea's adventure).I kind of wonder if Salvatore wishes he could just let Drizzt go.The epilouge lays the groundwork for the next series though. Let's all hope Salvatore finds some inspiration between now and then."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"To summarize my review before I get into it: R.A. Salvatore's Drizzt-books have evolved into Saturday morning cartoons rather than staying as the Tolkein-esque stories they first started out to be.I have been a Salvatore-Drizzt-book reader ever since 1990 when I read The Crystal Shard. I have read every Drizzt-book since then, but with this last book I have decided to give up the series until some drastic changes are made. Instead of an exhaustive review of this book, I'll just point to 6 ways as to how this entire series is on its death-bed. Salvatore can cure these maladies by listening to the following:1.) DRIZZT AND HIS FRIENDS HAVE BECOME SATURDAY MORNING CARTOON CHARACTERS - In cartoons the main characters never die, they are invincible, they are unflawed. In The Drizzt books, no main character can ever die. They fight hundreds and hundreds of \\"bad guys,\\" only to score perfect victories each time. If it seems that one of the main character has died, or will, it's only a red herring that sets you up for that character to inevitably \\"save the day.\\"2.) DRIZZT'S ENEMIES HAVE TURNED INTO THE \\"VILLAIN OF THE WEEK VARIETIES\\" - In cartoons, the heros are usually pitted by a different villian each week. The villians are rarely fleshed-out, and they're just around for the purpose of getting killed by Drizzt and Co. If a villian is fleshed-out, Salvatore becomes attached and cannot kill him, only send him away (Artemis Entreri, Jarlaxle, etc).3.) SUPPORTING CHARACTERS ARE LIKE THE \\"YOMAN\\" CHARACTER FROM STAR TREK - Remember in Star Trek how Captain Kirk would beam down to a planet with some unnamed officer, and inevitably, the unnamed officer would die while Kirk would be unharmed? Okay, now substitute \\"Captain Kirk\\" with \\"Drizzt\\" and you have Salvatore's new books. A seasoned reader knows that when a character is introduced, he's not likely to be a permanent fixture.4.) YOU CAN'T GO 2 PAGES WITHOUT BEING REMINDED THAT DRIZZT & CO. ARE THE TOUGHEST, BADDEST CHARACTERS IN THE WORLD - It's not that you see this through their actions, but Salvatore spells it out for you before every fight. Hypothetical example: \\"The orcs were heavily armed and outnumbered the weakened drow twenty five to one. But this was Drizzt Do-Urden, and he was no ordinary drow!\\" Please ...5.) SALVATORE'S EDITORS NEED TO BACK OFF OF HIM AND LET HIM WRITE - if you've noticed in the past several books, Salvatore paces the story nicely, then has to suddenly end the story because the editors limit the number of pages he can have. When you get 4/5s the way through it, you think \\"wow, I'm almost finished, and there's so much left! Hell, (enter character's name) isn't even within a 10-day ride from the others?!\\" ANSWER: Robillard the mage shows up and magically teleports the character wherever they need to go.6.) THE FIGHT SCENES ARE A BIT TOO DETAILED - Everyone knows Drizzt is a bad mutha-sucka, but when Salvatore gets carried away and writes, \\"Drizzt then shifted his balance to the right and pivoted low with a perfect center of gravity, slicing his left scimitar right, then feinting back, swinging his left scimitar in a downward arc, pulling back, then upward pivoting to his right, bringing his swords at a downward V-angle, parrying each blow, then rolling to his left, followed by an inverted cone flip to the front, slicing diagnally with his left right-ended scimitar....\\" I just find myself skimming paragraphs.MY SUGGESTION FOR SALVATORE & DRIZZT:-------------------------------------Set the next series some 100 years into the future. Drizzt, as an elf, will continue to live for several more centuries. Cattie-Brie, Wulfgar, Regis and Bruenor will not. Go ahead and jump forward and write the novel that you wanted to with THE LONE DROW. It's time for Drizzt to move on.I think Salvatore knows that. He toys with the ideas of Drizzt and Cattie-brie's grim future, but I don't think he has the nerve to actually kill anyone off. So just jump to the future and make it happen.And get rid of those annoying dwarf brothers! They are the Jar Jar Binks of the Drizzt world. I would welcome any feedback from Salvatore fans. I still am one, but I feel like I'm watching a good thing go down the tubes.Be critical, people. Don't just throw praise at a book because teh main character is cool and has potential. I can tell by the writing style of the majority of these reviewers that they are somewhere between 10-16 years old. That's how old I was when I read The Crystal Shard. I want to feel the same way about these new books as I did when I was that age reading the early adventures. I've matured, so now must the Drizzt storyline."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"There are a few spoilers in this review but it is nothing that you would not have figured out from the other reviews of the Hardcover edition. However, I will mark any paragraph with spoilers if it has any.Most of what has been written about the book in the Hardcover edition is pretty much true. On one hand, you do have some character growth in the form of Buenor actually acting somewhat like a king than in previous books. Regis, for the few times he actually appears, is a lot more calm and settled than he was when he first appeared.However, most of it is the same old, same old. Drizzt is still engaged in a lot of navel gazing when he isn't chewing through the enemy as an unstoppable force. Catti Brie is moving back towards her usual \\"Which one do I love?\\" persona. Wulfgar....Well, he twirls a hammer a lot.[Spoilers]A few secondary characters die without much comment, chief among them is Dellie. Her death is long expected as, after playing her part in Wulfgar's redemption, it is as if R.A. Salvadore had no idea what to do with her. Wulfgar's almost complete lack of reaction to her death would be callous if it were not representative of how little she was actually developed.[End spoilers.]In the end, we are left with nothing much having changed from the end of the second book and that might be the most intriguing development of all. One of the reasons that I don't read much in the way of Forgotten Realms books is that they are always pretty much the same. A great evil arises, heroes band together, evil loses a god/kingdom/a whole mess of wizards (with the attendant loss of henchmen), and that's that. In fact, back in college, I commented that, given Evil's track record, how noone with a survival instinct would become evil in this world.With this book, evil, for once, has not been neatly defeated. Obould's kingdom is still going strong at the end of the books. If the authors of the Forgotten Realms novels really wanted to write something new and different, they would incorporate this into their novels and not just as an excuse to have orcs to bash. Instead, have the leaders have to gradually deal with the kingdom. Perhaps have Obould become a civilizing influence (as he already has to a degree). Examples abound as to how this could be written ranging from the Zentraedi Control Zone from the Robotech Universe to the very real world example of Israel being surrounded by the various Arabic nations. Introduce some shades of grey into the situation (If Obould's orcs do stop and actually settle the land to build their own life, is it really \\"good\\" to slaughter them?).While nothing new was really written in this trilogy, there is potential for a new and fresh perspective to be brought to the world of Forgotten Realms than the usual \\"same old...\\" that has plagued these books for years."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Finally united by their god-king Obould, the Orcs stand at the gates to Mithral Hall--the great Dwarf kingdom and mining center. But when his initial attack falters, Obould pulls back--he'd rather defend the world's first Orc kingdom than waste his resources attacking the well-prepared and heavily trapped Dwarf caves. With his giant, dark-elf, and troll 'allies' repeatedly proving to be undependable, Obould knows that hanging onto what he has already conquered will be challenge enough.Renegade dark-elf, Drizzt Do'Urden, falsely believing that his friends and allies have all been killed by Obould, joins with an elf to rescue a pegasus, then makes single-handed war on the orcs. He knows that if he can somehow kill Obould, the orcs will shatter--as they have shattered so many times before. What he doesn't count on, though, is that Obould really does manifest the Orc-god--and killing a god is a tough challenge, even for a dark-elf.Author R. A. Salvatore delivers a mix of heroic action and introspection. Drizzt continues to evolve, slowly learning to leave his drow preconceptions behind him and become a true-elf. Obould is almost a sympathetic hero, holding his people together and helping them build their first kingdom despite attacks by elves, humans, dwarves, and the backstabbing by the ice giants and especially the drow. Salvatore's writing is always professional and smooth--and doesn't falter in THE TWO SWORDS.Fans of the movements of dwarf armies, clever dwarf traps, and of Drizzt Do'Urden will definitely not want to miss this one. If you aren't already a Salvatore fan, however, you might want to give THE TWO SWORDS a pass. There isn't enough character development or story arc to appeal to those not already deeply involved."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I have to admit to being somewhat strange, in that I love the Dark Elf books, but find Drizzt himself to be a completely unentertaining character. It is the people around him that I find intriguing. Perhaps that is the reason this book is one that I have mixed emotions about. For most of the book, it seemed that R.A. was going to 'right the wrongs' that have plagued the series up to this point - Delly and Colson out of the picture, Wulfgar and Catti-brie together (as they should be), Drizzt and perhaps Innovindil together, etc. At the very rushed feeling end of the book, however, Drizzt and Catti-brie are together and Wulfgar is left all alone following Delly's death and Colson's disappearance. Also, the Orc storyline is completely left up in the air - dramatic changes to the Northern part of the Realms have been made. It will be interesting to see if they follow up on them. Lastly, for Drizzt to be the nigh-invincible fighting machine he has been portrayed as for so long (along the lines of Snake-Eyes in GI Joe, honestly!), to see him struggle against and ultimately fail against the orc Obould was laughable. The redeeming parts of this book? The almost-renewed relationship between Wulfgar and Catti-brie, the excellent characterizations of some occasionally badly named Dwarves, and the fact that the next set of books (which are clearly set up at the end) seem to take the entire group out on the road again - perhaps a return to the great, rollicking adventure feel that the original Icewind Dale trilogy had, but that has been lacking and overshadowed by Drizzt's 'poor pitiful me' routine of the last 6-10 books or so. If you're a fan of the series, it's worth keeping up with the exploits of the crew - otherwise, you may be better served to stick with the current well-written War of the Spider Queen series for your drow 'fix'."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Much has been said of R.A. Salvatore's Forgotten Realms novels in the last few years, and most of it is negative. Are Drizzt and his friends seemingly invulnerable? Yes. Has Salvatore failed to introduce much in the way of interesting new characters? Yes. Are his books generally getting repetitive? Yes. Are they boring?...well, no.Most of the fantasy I read is in the Forgotten Realms world. Take that as you will, but Salvatore still wipes the floor with the majority of the Realms writers. Usually Salvatore, Elaine Cunningham, Troy Denning, and Douglas Niles are reliable writers of fun fantasy novels (for those angry readers who want to see a bloodbath in which scores of good-guy characters die, look no further than the Moonshae Trilogy by Douglas \\"Grim Reaper\\" Niles). The others range from passable to excruciating. But I know what to expect from Salvatore. I don't read his books to be enlightened - I read them to be entertained, and Salvatore does it again in \\"The Two Swords.\\"The story finds Drizzt Do'Urden spending most of his time trying to free a captured pegasus from the bad guys - orcs, trolls, frost giants, but especially King Obould Many-Arrows, a clever orc who appears to have become the avatar of the orc god Gruumsh, and is pretty much invincible. If this sounds like boring stuff for Drizzt, it is - but remember Drizzt is wallowing in self- loathing because he believes all his friends are dead, so he's trying to find something to do besides return to Mithral Hall and face the music (or so he thinks). Plus, he's trying to impress Innovindil, his moon-elf sorta-girlfriend (who has lost her horse! Sounds sort of like the plot of a Barbie comic!). In spite of this, Drizzt finds plenty of time to puree orcs, not to mention (and I don't think I'm spoiling a thing here) fight King Obould.Innovindil, although not a particularly original elf character, does deliver a cool soliloquy on 'what it is to be an Elf.' Drizzt buys into this and decides that his life doesn't suck so much after all. But most likely the best part of the interaction between these two is Drizzt's response to Innovindil's speech about all the noble reasons why Obould should be killed: \\"Maybe I just want to kill him.\\"As for Drizzt's friends, they're imprisoned inside Mithral Hall by about a billion orcs (give or take a few zeros). Bruenor, recently returned from the dead (yeah, I know, keep reading), leads his dwarves in devising all kinds of A-Team like devices to turn orcs into chunky orc salsa. Wulfgar is having serious marital issues with his jealous wife Delly, and Cattie-Brie is torn between wondering what became of Drizzt and flirting with Wulfgar. All fairly typical of Salvatore's subplots in his last few novels.The story, however, moves along at a fast pace despite all these apparent obstacles- it is really only dragged down by the pathetic Galen Firth and his inability to kill the trolls that want to slaughter his kinsmen from Nesme. Salavatore spends a decent amount of time bringing secondary characters to an unpleasant demise, but he neglects to introduce Galen's face to 20 or so orcish arrows. Too bad the interesting mage Shoudra had to be turned into cat food by Obould in \\"The Lone Drow;\\" she would have been a much better character in this book than the loser Galen. Also, the frost giants in the book, though led by the supposedly brilliant chieftain Gerti, serve little purpose besides chucking boulders into unfortunate places.Honestly, I think most of this book's enjoyability comes from the dwarves. Drizzt put Salvatore on the map, but I think he writes dwarves better than just about anyone. Let me add a caveat by saying the *names* he gives those dwarves are often horrifying (quick, spot the REAL Salvatore dwarf name! *Cordio Muffinhead* *Kragg Weaselface* *Alebrain Forgefarter*), but the dwarves are easily the most likeable characters in the book, mostly for their selflessness, love of life, and the fact that they don't give a... . Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder, formerly of Salvatore's lousy Cleric Quintet, are probably the best of the dwarves because their personalities aren't quite so cookie-cutter as those of the others.Finally, Regis the halfling finds ways to be useful as always, although his role is a bit diminished here and he is more or less on injured reserve for most of the book. I still think Regis, who usually wins with brains vice brawn, is one of Salavatore's best characters. He appears useless but often displays unmatched courage and innovativeness.Perhaps the most significant thing about this book among Salvatore's novels is that there isn't a happy ending of any sort. Drizzt slugs it out with Obould, and dwarves turn lots of orcs into hash, but Salvatore does a good job impressing upon the reader that Bad Things are happening to the North of Faerun, things that will outlast a novel trilogy or two. Obould, for his part, is a calculating and formidable opponent. Although very evil, his bloodthirstiness is limited by his tact, and exactly what the limits of his power are are not explored in this book. Among Drizzt's enemies, Obould is not as interesting as Artemis Entreri, but he is more dangerous. Expect Obould to be around for awhile.Unsurprisingly, the book sets up for a sequel or new trilogy, but the good news for weary Salvatore fans is that it looks like he's going to venture into some interesting territory with Bruenor and Drizzt. I never thought Drizzt was done with Ellifain, the elf girl whose life Drizzt one saved only to have her attempt to murder him decades later, and it looks like he's going to try to put those demons to rest. Bruenor seems to be heading off to find some ancient dwarven Moradin-given wisdom that might destroy Obould. I think that road will end with Bruenor's death, so those of you who want to see one or more of Salvatore's main characters buy the farm ought to stay tuned.Should you read this book if you have enjoyed Salvatore's past novels in the series? Sure! Don't expect, well... *any* loose ends to be tied up, but this is a typical fast-paced, enjoyable book from Mr. Salvatore. If you absolutely hated every Salvatore novel since 'Streams of Silver,' you can skip this one because you'll probably just have an aneurysm. You could instead go read 1500 pages to see if Robert Jordan writes about anything but womens' clothing this time, or maybe even go read some Ed Greenwood if you really want to get mad while reading a Realms novel.Otherwise, enjoy 'Drizzit's' exploits - and don't feel guilty about it."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Let's face it, R.A. Salvatore has somewhat lost his touch. As of late, his books just are not up to par as to how great he used to be. I think back on some of his earlier work such as The Dark Elf Trilogy and the Demon Wars and then I read this one and I shake my head in disappointment. Salvatore's Drizzt books used to be so great and unpredictable but now it's all changed.This book was quite stale. You had Bruenor on his death bed but yet the entire thing was pointless because you KNEW that he was going to come back to life. The fight scenes were OK but even those were not as good as Salvatore back in the past. Whatever happened to good old one-on-one fight scenes that RAS excelled in?In order for Salvatore to spice up his Drizzt series, he needs to refresh it by letting some of his main characters die. It is far past due for a major death to take place.Overall, \\"The Hunters Blades\\" trilogy was a poor series and nowhere near Salvatore's earlier work."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I also own and have read and reread all of the dark elf books and love this character. This book was a real let down as far as an ending, and the character was really dull at the end. You expected so much more from Drizzt and from Rob that i wish he had put more time into this. Hopefully he can put the zap back into his character before the next book. SPOILER&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; also upset that the book flap review hinting that Drizzt would have to choice between life and death when the scene never got that much energy. this was a big let down!!"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I was very much let down by the conclusion of this book. Nothing becomes resolved except long, drawn out reunion of the companions. I think that Salvatore has to either return Drizzt to his roots of the greatest warrior in the realms or just let him fade away. How long can readers follow his exploits when he is constantly brought down by orcs and goblins after hearing how he defeated demons and dragons? I cannot begin to explain my sorrow at having bought this book in hardcover when it is hardly worth the paperback price. I own every book Rob has ever written but this is the first I have ever felt betrayed afterwards. Please let him learn the error of his ways soon before I move on and find more interesting tales to follow."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"*I will try to avoid giving any spoilers, as this book is worth the read simply for the sake of knowing the end of the Drizzt saga first hand. However, since I'll inevitably give a ton away anyway, dont read this until you've read the novel and formed your own opinions on the events which transpire within.To be fair to The Two swords, the first half of the book \\"lived\\" right (4.5 to five stars) up to my expectations, with all the customary wit, intreuge, and flashing swords we have come to expect from Salvatore. I felt that this portion of the book carried on the series nicely, and set us all up for either a glorious defeat of the orc hordes and an alliance of the goodly folk of the Marches, or atleast a darring assasination of Oblould or Greti, setting back Grummsh's plans of conquest. I'm sorry to say we dont get either, or even an unlooked for way out (I was half expecting Kaer'lic's fears to turn out ture and Drizzt to be guided to vicotry by Lolth herself.). What we do get is an indesicive conclusion to what was otherwise a very strong series, and a disapointingly rushed one at that. While there where still some noteworthy moments in the later portion of the novel (with Drizzt's deafeat and Kazid'Hea's possesion of Delly Curtie), I found much of it to be simply page filling meteral and not very well thought out. Before I go on, let me explain my rationel for seeing Drizzt's defeat as a good thing. Quite simply, we've all seen him win enough time's to half convince us and the rest of Fearun that he is invincible. That is not so, nor should it be. In the FR, we have far to many perfect heros, undefeatable and righeous (cough cough, ELMINSTER!). By proving Drizzt not to be one of these, Salvatore demonstrates a noble goal, even if it wasn't brought to fruition as well as I'd have liked (If Dirzzt has to be beat, I'm sure you could have thought up a better way to bring it about then encasing the villian in perfect armor, and then making Drizzt drop his sword, I mean, the elfs been training with weapons for decades, he is not going to make a clumsy mistake like that, even if Obould has the strength of a god.) Back to my original rantings, I found the ending protion of the book to have the same rushed feeling about it as the end of the fith Harry Potter. If Salvatore had just taken 100 more pages to fill out Drizzt's reuniting with his old companions, maybe found a better way to reinterduce Obould after his apparent death, and given Inovinndil a better departure (all those elfie smiles for Dirzzt's happiness where a little much, even for one of the elder races.) So, for the end portion of the book, I award 2.5 to 3 stars. Averaged out, the total marks should be around 4 stars, but I thing that a books faults can override its strengths, so I'll give the Two Swords a 3.5, and since Amazon doesn't allow for half stars (ALTHOUGH THEY SHOULD!!!!!), I must resign myself to awarding a three."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Mr. Salvatore seems to have run out of orignial ideas and new plots. This book is same ole...same ole...And since none of his main characters ever dies, there isn't much suspense in the battles. Plus just how many different ways can you continue to chop up an orc or a troll and make it interesting? When he first introduced us to Drizzit, each book was a brand new adventure with new and exciting characters and action. Now it seems that if you have read one you have read them all. I wish the author would get inspired and give us something new and exciting. And occasiontaly kill one of the characters. After all, evil does triumph now and then. Finally, why call this a triolgy? It certainly did not have an ending!"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Once again Drizzt runs through impossible obstacles in invincibility mode. I've read many of Salvatores works and it's just more of the same. He keeps creating new stories for his bread and butter character which have grown so stale that were at one time creative nd suspenseful. Drizzt always comes out on top. Wulfgar is always torn between the same emotions that he only knows how to deal with in his barbarian rage. If this is your first venture into Salvatore's world you may enjoy it. But long time readers are likely to be bored with the same old same old. Read War of the spider queen book one instead. It's actually versatile, creative, and multidimensional; what a good fantasy book should be. Note: I am referring to the entire trilogy no just book 3."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"The Drizzt series has been a favorite of mine since i read the lone drow. I read all the others up to this point in about a year, and they were good reads. Now though, Salvatore just needs to get on with it and actually make something happen. This book, and the two before it, are incredibly slow and boring, as none of the villains have any depth and are basically there to annoy Drizzt and the gang. I also dislike the invincibility that all the main characters seem to possess. Just kill Bruenor or Catti-brie or someone please, it might accidentally spice things up a bit."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I hate to say it, because I have been a fan of Salvatore's work from the very beginning, but it just may be that he's losing interest in this long-running series -- or at least, that's how it seems.The battle sequences in this volume are top-knotch -- vintage Salvatore. I'm not sure there's a writer out there who choreographs better fights, be they between a pair of individuals or armies on a grand scale. Unfortunately, the battles in this book do not resolve themselves. Despite building toward what seems a perfect climax, we are left with an open-ended storyline -- not what you expect from the third volume in a trilogy.Instead, I was left feeling as if I were watching a soap opera -- an interminable saga with no end in sight. And while I am NOT looking forward to the day when I can no longer read about Drizzt and the gang, I would like each of their occasional adventures to bring with them a sense of closure, so that next time, it feels like I'm starting off on a fresh journey, rather than just dragging along the same old storylines from 10 books ago.The love triangle, for instance, between three of the major characters, is definitely bordering on melodrama. Can someone make up their mind about how they feel, already? Hearts may be fickle, but this is getting ridiculous. Whomever CB is going to end up with, I wish she'd just hurry up and do so.Even better, of course, would be for Salvatore to throw in some kind of surprise. I'm not anxious to see any of these principle characters -- for which this series is so beloved -- die. But I feel something major has to take place to shake things up and make them interesting again. In my opinion, it's getting tiresome, watching these superhuman characters receive a near-fatal wound, only to bounce up and carry on their way again. I'd rather see them simply kick the snot out of someone without first receiving a grievous wound, or else succumb, once and for all.In retrospect, I'm not sure that the premise of this series was strong enough to carry three books. Without giving away any of the plot, suffice it to say that the bulk of the story -- particularly Book 2 -- centers around one character's dilemma, a dilemma which is created out of a false assumption. Interesting enough, I suppose, but a question that could have been answered quite easily should the character have decided to verify the truth. Instead, he goes around assuming the worst, making those assumptions real. I'd liken it to the idea of: Well, I'm going to die anyway, so I might as well jump off a bridge now.In any case, I'm certainly not suggesting that fans of the series stop here. On the contrary, the author makes certain you will want to return -- whenever he himself decides to do so -- to this ongoing saga. Just don't expect a tidy resolution to any of the major plot threads, or you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I bought this book as a gift for my brother and he liked it. Based on that I give it a rating of 4."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I own some of the books series on Drizzt and plan on completing all the sets. Waiting untill someone makes the movies."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"This book was a fitting conclusion to an awesome series.This trilogy began with an incredibly dark and foreboding book, and that sense continues with the final book. Mithral Hall, Nesme, and the other dwarven citadels are fortifying to contain the orcs, while King Obould solidifies his gains. The tension will remain for some time. It is exciting to see such a powerful villain in the Realms. Obould matured from a ravaging leader to a calculating king over the series, forcing other leaders to change their strategy in dealing with him.The Two Swords perhaps had the least amount of action of the three books, but still has enough to satisfy.I think the ending will provide interesting new story ideas. And while some interesting turns leave some relationships changed forever, the door is opened for future strife between Bruenor, Regis, Catti-Brie, Wulfgar, and Drizzt.This is a trilogy I will be re-reading time after time."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"This the christmas gift my son had on his list. He knows exactly what he wanted as he has others. I know he is happy"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I have to say, I have loved almost all of the Drizzt books, and even the spin-off novels. Some are better than others, true, as is the case with all authors. This series, which focuses around Drizzt's and friends' dealings with an unusually powerful orc king (who is actually an old nemesis of the dwarves), is a very good addition to the series. Packed with action, cliff-hangers, and a couple very good villains, this series has it all, and the final book is no exception.The characterizations are nop-notch, as usual, with some frighteningly savage outcomes for some secondary characters. Concluding the series with his usual flair, R.A.S. brings dark elf Drizzt (again) from the brink of self-loathing and hopelessness back into the light...pun intended, on a few levels. Much of the North gets pulled along with the waxing and waning of the dark elf's mood.Though I can see how some would tire of Drizzt's see-saw bipolar outlook, Salvatore's flare for writing about these nuances never cease to amaze me - he manages to keep them fresh, despite their obvious reoccurences. That said, I think it's getting time to let the poor elf have a NICE time with his buds for a change!I look forward to the next series, which is hinted at throughout this series - the hunt for the lost dwarven kingdom that daddy Bruenor thinks will save the Northlands once and for all, while also lending one more adventure to the old dwarf's ledger."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"The Two Swords if the conclusion of the The Hunter Blades Trilogy depicts the war in the Silver Marshes between the forces of the orcs, giants, trolls, and bugbears led by King Obould Many-Arrows against the alliance of dwarven citadels and humans cities.The story itself excellent. Unlike The Dark Elf Trilogy and the Legacy of the Drow series, The Hunters Blades Trilogy focuses on a larger scale of events rather than just a group of characters. Obould's orcs are tearing through the Silver Marshes, and the leaders of the dwarven citadels human cities must unite to stop him. It's a classic story of good vs. evil.What I also liked about this book is that you see each character equally throughout the book. What kind of dissapointed me for a little bit, was the build up of Obould vs. Drizzt. In the end of the Lone Drow, and throughout the Two Swords, you feel the hype build up as Drizzt proclaims that he wants to fight the orc king. \\"Maybe I just want to kill him.\\" Though the fight itself was fast paced, the end result.Whenever I hear someone complaining about the ending of this book, it reminds me of when Lord of the Rings came out. I thought the ending itself was really good. It left it open for three seperate story lines, in which anything could happen.This isn't the best Salvatore novel, but for the end of a trilogy, I thought it was good. I probably won't be rereading it again for a while, but it's going to stay on my favorite's shelf next to the Dragonlance Chronicles."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"After reading all of Mr.Salvatore's books, and waiting eagerly for the next of drizzt's adventures, I was a little disappointed with the new book. The story started off fairly well with the first couple of chapters, but later nothing seemed to have happened in the book. I kind of felt bob was stretching the story to fill 300+ pages. Nevertheless, for loyal fans of salvatores work this is the kind of book which would make us wait for the next one. I would have given five stars had something more decisive had happened between drizzt,bree and wulfgar."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Nothing happened in these three books other than me spending money. Something needs to change here and I hope the new ones bring on the change. Orcs? We are talking about a group of people that beat demons and a city of drow and dragons, etc. But they are at a stalemate with orcs? Not good. And NOTHING comes to a conclusion other than a few minor storylines. Could Salvatore be out of ideas with these group of adventurers? I hope not but this trilogy has left me with much doubt."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"The Two Swords by R. A. Salvatore is the latest edition to the companions of the hall series. I have been a fan of the companions since the beginning. I devoured icewind dale, the dark elf series and so on. However I do not understand how anyone could give this book or for that matter the complete Hunters Blades trilogy more than one or two stars. In my opinion things started going south in passage to dawn with the return of wulfgar. He was dead, long dead and should have stayed dead. However I remained a loyal fan and eagerly anticipated the books that followed. That is, up until I read the thousand orcs, then on to the horrendous lone drow and now finally the dreadful two swords. I suppose I keep reading the series hoping that Salvatore will do something dramatic, like kill off a main character and keep him/her dead. I hope it's Bilbo, I mean Frodo, I mean Regis.I don't even know where to begin with this atrocity. How many times is a main character going to survive a cave in or a tower falling on them or a huge giant thrown boulder taking them down? It's just silly. How many times is wulfgar going to jump out in the midst of a thousand enemies and make it back in descent shape? Once again silly and unbelievable. Wulfgar may be tougher than stone but he is human and without any real magic to support his attacks.One of the main themes in this book, actually it seems to be the theme, is Drizzts belief that his companions are dead and how returning to mithril hall in the wake of their demise will make him feel. Throughout the novel Drizzt is hovering around the Hall but does not go in. Some may say that is just how Drizzt operates in situations like this. Hanging around on the outskirts looking for that target of opportunity---Obould in this case. But weren't all or most of the dwarves of the hall his friends, was it not his duty as a friend and ally to report to the dwarves. Perhaps seeing him alive and well would give them more hope. Also, with all the spying would he have not heard the mention of King Bruenor's return to the battlefield from at least one orc? In fact, Bruenor was the only companion of the hall whose death he had any real evidence of. He just assumed the rest were dead but that is silly as well. Why would he be so worried, even if they were dead couldn't he just go retrieve their souls like with wulfgar. Oh but that was different, wasn't it? Finally, drizzt comes two steps away from entering the hall but instead decides to follow a host of frost giants in the hopes of rescuing a pegasus for his new elf girlfriend. I think that could have waited five minutes. Oh but drizzt just wasn't ready to deal with the confirmation of his beliefs regarding his friends----whatever. So he tracks these giants all the way up to their wintry mountain abode and along the way does not find a single opportunity to free the pegasus, yet he arrives at their fortress and thinks he can waltz into the place and back out with a flying horse in tow----absolutely ridiculous.I could go on and on about this tremendously awful novel but I will not so let me conclude with a review of other reviews. I read a number of the 4 and 5 star reviews of this book hoping that I would find one with some substance. There were none. I would just like to point out a couple that said something more than, \\"Another Gem\\" or \\"Fantastic book.\\"Reviewer:Jared GarrettThe Two Swords by R.A. Salvatore is the final book in the Hunter's Blades Trilogy. It is a well written examination of the Hunter (Drizz't) and his relationship with his blades... or in other words, of how Drizz't has chosen to deal with the world around him. Readers know that Obould, the orc king, is a powerful new enemy, so we will not go there in this review. However, it is possible that Salvatore has created his best villain ever here. Obould has almost transcended base evil and is practically living on a higher plane of existence. The question is not \\"How do we kill him?\\" but is rather \\"Can and should he be killed?\\" Salvatore leads us to interesting questions and answers throughout this book. However, the action is still strong and vivid, the characters continue as believable and beloved, and the reader is sucked in quickly. The stakes are high, both on the kingdom level and the personal level, for all those involved.First of all, how is Obould anywhere near Salvatore's greatest villain ever? Obould is worthless and popped up out of nowhere. Have you read any of the other books? What about Jarlaxle and Artemis or any other villainous character? Obould is a joke. Second, \\"Can and should he be killed?\\" What? Everyone wanted to kill Obould even some of his supposed allies. This statement makes no sense. Third, please show me where there are interesting questions and answers in the book because I don't remember any. Finally, as I have already mentioned the characters are no longer believable. They can not die, nothing can kill them. Not even 50,000 orcs and a god-like orc king.Reviewer:Mary A. FeinbergThis was an awesome book even by RAS standards. I mean you get DEEP into his character (Drizzt) and emotions. And there is a lot going on here in many sub plots. Some characters die, some find themselves, there are huge battle scenes. I loved it.If you want a new RAS book with new characters read \\"the Highwayman\\". It was incredible. Or pick up the Demon Awakens series, but don't whine if a character that you love dies. RAS has no problem killing off characters, but we are reading about the life and adventures of Drizzt here. So I doubt Drizzt will die in this series.Ok, there is nothing even remotely DEEP in this book. Drizzt just wanders around whining about his lost friends and wondering if he knows what it's really like to be an elf---how lame. Alright some minor characters do die, one of which should have never been created to begin with. Huge battle scenes---so what. They were great to begin with but now they have become to long and drawn out. They are more of a crutch for Salvatore than anything else. Finally, Salvatore did kill off some main characters in the Demon Wars series, but this is not the Demon Wars series. I don't want to see Drizzt die but someone has to go.Salvatore has either lost his edge and is only out for financial gain or has lost interest in this particular series. I tend to believe the former especially when considering the second demon wars trilogy. The first trilogy was marvelous. Mortalis and Ascendance were even pretty good, however the final two installments were worthless and the conclusion was pure garbage. Mommy and Daddy saved their boy---man that was some crap."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"RA Salvatore's writing is very pedestrian in style and seems more like a play by play commentary of some D&D game than anything resembling a novel.

Even though overall I enjoyed reading this book, I found that it lacked something. I grew tired of reading about how the dwarves killed countless orcs.I thought it was disappointing that no resolution between Drizzt and King Obold took place. Out of all the Drizzt books, I think I least liked this book."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"As a collective, I enjoyed the entire Hunters Blades Trilogy quite a bit, mostly due to the fact that this body of works has a slightly darker feel to it than Salvatores' past Realms novels. The battle scenes were described in excellent detail (as always), the introspectives with established characters was good (if a bit stale), and the introduction of new characters gave Salvatores corner of the Realms a bit more dimension. However, in The Two Swords, everything just seemed to end far too abruptly. As usual, the story was (obviously) left open for future novels, but it's just not like Bob to leave so many loose ends lying around. It felt to me that, ultimately, NOTHING was really resolved.A good book that ended in a good way if this series wasn't a trilogy, but being the last of the three novels, I was a bit disappointed.One more thing: for the love of all the gods that ever were, PLEASE kill Wulgar . . .again . . .for good this time."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Ok, maybe it wasn't \\"gentle.\\" But I, and I'm sure most everyone else who's read this incredibly violent, dark, and surprising trilogy up until now will come into this book expecting the huge, epic, final battle - all the \\"goodly\\" armies of the region taking on Obould's thousands of orcs.Well, to you I say - just read the book. The first third of the book is absolutely incredible - the whole thing is rolling along just as you've pictured it. The other armies are coming in, \\"legendary\\" characters are showing up. It looks like Drizzt will finally, finally return to Mithral Hall and find his beloved friends are still alive.Then...things take a turn. The Two Swords start to fumble, start to slow. Things aren't progressing the way you thought they would. There's some surprising things that happen, some twists you might not appreciate at first.I say \\"at first\\" because the book truly does have a resolution, and a fitting ending. R.A. Salvatore was able to create, in Obould, a villain that actually had a real purpose, a strong belief system, a good reason to do everything that he does. I, for one, was rooting for Obould throughout the entire trilogy, and I was hoping that his dreams of an Orc Kingdom - dreams when the Orcs can share the sunlight with Elves and Humans - would come true. The fact that you can agree with, and even CHEER for, what was initially supposed to be the \\"bad guy\\" is a real testament to the storyteller's gift that R.A. Salvatore posseesses.The characters undergo pretty drastic changes...they're still the same characters you know and love, but they're not completely unchanged after all they've gone through. They're becoming more and more like \\"real people\\" - they all have huge emotional burdens, but throughout this book they begin to get over them, to become true to themselves - or, at least, they can finally define what being \\"true\\" to themselves really mean.All told, reading this books is quite the enriching experience. This trilogy was easily among the best of all the Drizzt books, and this final book does it justice. There's a fine resolution at the ending, leaving you satisfied, while still looking forward to the further adventures of these legendary heroes."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I own all books written by R. A. Salvatore concerning Drizzt. This book ended too soon. I couldn't put it down. But it does jump to the ending too soon. Plus, the main war is going on a little too long. But all in all, I was waiting since October 2003 to read this and I'll have to wait for October 2005 to read the next one. I pretty much devoured the book. I'm a big fan and anybody who wants to read/likes to read books of this nature I would definitely recommend in doing so."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Great concept to start the trilogy an orc king rallying all the orc tribes together to claim land for themselves so that they can be looked at as a real race and society of the realm. The novels progress and not much develops, in fact the second novel really doesn't even need to be read, just read the last couple chapters. This third novel is more of the same to the point it is like nothing I have ever read by Salvatore, minus the Wulfgar novel. He writes at such a slow pace you feel like he is preparing a 10 book series of 6,000 pages and by the end it is what you fear there was no end.Fans of these books, like I am, will be disappointed because there is not much to love. The typical one on one fight scenes Salvatore is known for putting you in the action have been traded for clumsy mass combat with little description. The once love you had for one of the group will not continue because most of the story revolves around others and the heroes are the supporting cast, with only glimpses of the old Icewind Dale group for mere moments.Twenty years of writing has not done well with this band of heroes because Salvatore is stuck in a time capsule and never lets the story evolve.The Hunter's Blade Trilogy is one I would not recommend, however a must read for fans because the new Transitions trilogy is a continuation of these events. Lets all hope by \\"Transitions\\" Salvatore has a new idea and ventures far from this one.Not recommended."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Let me preface this review by saying that several of RA Salvatore's works have been some of the best books I've ever read. So it's hard to see him produce such an uninspired work that could have been written for a freshman creative writing course. The beautiful imagery and rich character development that are such a trademark of his novels and makes them so entertaining is completely absent in the Two Swords. Even his beautifully narrated fight scenes have regressed into mind numbing hack-and-slash. It seems like it was written simply to fulfill a contractual obligation. Frankly I'd rather send him $25 and not have him write something like this."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"While I think its about time Drizzt was with a female, not Cattie-Brie! I have not ever liked her from The Crystal Shard! And besides, she's human and like what? 40 years old or so? Hey, she will be an old woman in another 30 years and Drizzt will just finally be an adult elf at about 100. Do us a favor R.A. and set Drizzt up somebody half-elven at least. Then they at least have a chance at some sort of relationship. You could play on the fact that half-elves have trouble being accepted in both human and elven worlds. I just say again, NOT Cattie-Brie!"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"As the conclusion to the Hunter's Blades Trilogy, the Two Swords falls a bit short of being a five star book. While still a very good Salvatore novel it just seemed to be lacking some things.First, Drizzt is barely in this book. While the final act is all Drizzt, for the most part he is non-existant throughout. An odd thing to do since the trilogy is called The Hunter's Blades and the last novel \\"The Lone Drow\\" was all Drizzt. So we went from him being the focus, to kind of dropping out of site.The second problem was that the cast was way to big. There are too many dwarf characters to follow. Did we really need to hear the story of Nikwillig coming down the mountain, following the Felbarr army and then meeting the elves of Moonwood? Or Fendes who seemed to die three times in the book just to come out fine in another chapter? Dwarf characters that we know were disregarded in the same way as Drizzt. Why is the battlerager Thippledorf Pwent in no major scene? In fact he is only mentioned twice I think. And consider Torgar and the Mirabar dwarfs who were such a prominent role in \\"Thousand orcs\\" have no more than a cameo in the middle of the book.The last problem is the biggest. There really is no conclusion to this storyline. The book could have left things open for more books, but there has to be some sort of conclusion, otherwise this really can't be called a trilogy. It is written more like a continuous series.Finally, this is still a very good read. Great battles, good characters, amazing action. I still think that \\"The Lone Drow\\" was the best in the trilogy because of its focus on Drizzt and its very dark tone. But this is certainly better than \\"Thousand Orcs\\" if you were disappointed in that like I was. May Drizzt never stop fighting!"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I have to agree with most every one....this was terribly lame.R.A. Salvatore is an excellent writer and this was just not on par.Its great to read about the gang from the spine of the world.I can hardley wait till the next book comes out. But after this one..... well i hope he takes a much needed break. mabey write about the guys from the Servant of tha shard again?Any how if another book comes out on Drizzt, heh ill buy it, but not with the anticipation I used to have.in this book, nothing realy happens...i dont the there is even a decent part involving one of the main charaters. the supporting secondary charaters stories are good though.well hope to see more from R.A. Salvatore just hope he gets the break he needs before it comes out."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"This is definitely not the best work that Salvatore has ever done. But this was the best book out of the Hunter's Blade Trilogy and shows more maturity than most of his Forgotten Realms books. Which are enjoyable for the most part and create some interesting characters, but tends to make them too powerful and lacking any vulnerabilities. That is why I lost interest in the almost invulnerable Drizzit. The ideas may be interesting, but there is rarely any question on weather or not he will survive.This one was a little different. This time the bad guy wasn't an ambitious individual, a group from the Underdark, or some artifact, it was someone touched by a god and a possible avatar. True there were people in the shadows, but they have less control over events than they think.In the first Two books it showed how an ambitious Orc decided to make a deal with the Frost Giants, a few renegade Drow, and a pack of Trolls. This pleased me for a few reasons. The Orcs and Goblins were named as a nemesis, but they never seemed like more than dirty brutes that die by the thousands against Elves and Dwarves. A good nemesis has to be an actual threat. This is an Orc that got feuding tribes to join under his banner and negotiates successfully with other races. More like the Tolkien Orcs and Goblins that weren't refined or compared to other races, but clever,strong, and apt at fighting.In this final book everyone is worried. The Orc armies are still growing and taking ground despite losses. Some say it is the tens of thousands and they are staying together and keeping fights minimal. Obould has formed a near cult around himself, even the cynical Drow think he might be touched by Grumpsh. The near immortal Drizzit starts showing concern for the sheer power and influence that the Orc chieftan displays, as well as constraint in battle. The dwarves are worried because he has his armies set on the Doorstep of Mithral Hall. Though they are not as effective as the disciplined Dwarves, they outnumber them more than 20 to one.This book isn't as good as the books he writes out of the Forgotten Realms universe, but it is one of his better works. The ending is a bit of a dissppointment, but it opens it up for another trilogy. But it finally gave the Orcs a much needed day in the sun and show themselves as more than lackies for evil geniuses or nuisances for Drizzit and the good reaces to practice their swordwork on."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Remember - there is no great hero without a great villain! Gone are the days of Matron Baenre, Llolth, Zak, the Underdark, dragons, the shard, Entreri, etc... We need more than an Orc with great armor! That was awful! I mean - give me Ellifain's superElf brother or something!Salvatore is a great writer but has failed to come with a good idea to breathe new life into his stories about Drizzt and his company. Much like Jordan - the books seem to go nowhere. Whether it is writing a book a hundred years into the future, including Cadderly or maybe some other forgotten realms characters, or another trip to the underdark - he has to do something which will break the monotony of what we are becoming used to: one of the main characters thinks another is dead, he/she gets pissed and kills everyone, a reunion with the main characters...."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I don't write reviews that often, but this book compared to other RAS books was horrible at best. It took me over a year just to read it because I got bored so easily with it, and if it weren't for my overseas flights I probably would have never finished it. The fight scenes were a dull read, which typically are the most enthralling piece. I've read The Dark Elf Trilogy, Crystal Shard series, etc., so I have some ground to get a comparison off of his previous writings. It just seemed to me there was no excitement in this book that kept me from putting it down, instead I just wanted to read it, finish it, then drop it off at the used bookstore."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Perhaps this was not the best Drizzt saga but it was far from disappointing.

Not to mention problems for Mithral Hall."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Bob has delivered an extremely good read, a solid, entertaining story, populated with familiar faces and brand new characters. Even in the midst of action and adventure, blood and gore, deception, intrigue, and monumental battles, there is a look into the emotions driving Drizzt and the companions, another level of the story.The ending answers many questions, and presents many new ones. Bob expertly lays the groundwork for many novels to come. It is what his readers have come to expect from the master storyteller."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Mr. Salvatore has done it again here. He's taken his characters and run them through the drama mill. It's a great book, but I feel like the ending to this series should have been a little more conclusive. I won't spoil the ending or anything. If you've read the other two in this series, then you have to read this one. I enjoyed it, I just feel that it could have been better."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I do not leave reviews per se but am doing so now because of all the whining and crying from everyone. Bottom line is that Bob Salvatore is an exceptional writer and the characters he has created are monumental pieces of work. I think this book was another exceptional read without a doubt. Granted as with all writers, some books are better then others and Bob has written some that are better and some that may not be quite as good. Bottom line is that all this writers books are very entertaining to a high degree. I look forward to his next piece of work with anticipation and just wanted to warn all the spoiled readers out there that reviews should be written with a broader use of thought instead of focusing on first reactions which is known as tunnel vision. Take in the whole before being to judgemental because you may be putting a knife into Drizzt's heart yourselves."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Why is everyone tearing this book up? It was a good read!The impression I get is that these people are bitter because the book didn't work out the way the poster imagined it would!Drizzt is an action character with a mind. Yes! Drizzt shows that he has become very wise in the many years of his life. This book is a nice change for the Salvatore reader and for the fantasy reader in general. No there is not battle after battle but good battles and lots of great stuff in-between.I hope Drizzt books keep coming because I WILL keep reading."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Unlike some of the reviewers seen here I will not post spoilers here. Most people read the books to find out what happens. Upon reading this book one thing strikes me most. I never wanted to put it down once I got started. I have read a lot of books where that wasn't the case. I've picked up some 6 months later before finishing. If you are looking for a book focusing only upon Drizzt, then you will surely be disapointed. But Drizzt on his own gets dull really. Its how he reacts to the world around him that matters. Exile was good, but didn't really turn into something great until Drizzt found his way to Blingenstone. And when you see and here people complaining that the book didn't resolve enough, remember, if the story isn't compelling, why do they care if it continues? It may be a few years before we find out what happens next. I for one, will be awaiting that time."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"R.A. Salvatore has outdone himself. I couldn't put the book down. I continue now to read the new books coming out of the story of Drizzt, Artemis, and the rest. I almost hope that the story of Drizzt and the others does not end!"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"The plot of this book is basically the same as the previous six or seven books based on Drizzt and co, and while the first Drizzt books were great it's getting really old. Drizzt has angst, drizzt runs away, drizzt faces his enemy... sound familiar? I also cannot figure out the point of the trilogy, the situation at the end of the book is basically the same as the situation at the beginnng, nothing has been resolved. What was the point of all those hundreds of pages? I'm still guessing. Overall not worth reading."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"As this is the last book the the Hunter's Blade Trilogy, and the story of Drizzt Do'Urden, this book lives up to what it's supposed to be: gripping, dramatic, and full of action. This book is all good because it ends how all good fantasy books should end: evil guy dies, and they all live happily ever after."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I loved the final chapter in this trilogy. I read it in two days and was upset that I finished it so quickly. I hope he continues to spin more tales of my favorite sci-fi fantasy character, Drizzt."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Pathetic, heinous, despicable. These are just a few of the words that come to mind in describing this \\"concluding\\" book to the trilogy. A friend and I were discussing how it might end just after the second book in the trilogy came out and basically nailed it. The only part we missed was O'bould dying. I don't mind giving spoilers here because there is nothing to spoil. Why orcs anyway. The great invincible Drizzt loses to an orc of all things. He suddenly turns into a helpless novice simply to allow O'bould to live so Salvatore doesn't have to think up a new story whenever he gets back to Drizzt. How it is possible to write 300 words of nothing is beyond me. I own every book Salvatore has written on Drizzt and it is no longer his strong point. He needs to get back to his roots and write about evil Drow. If he never comes back to Drizzt, I could care less. I may be able to forgive him if he finally writes the series that Jarlaxle and Entreri so deserve. They are infinitely more interesting than Drizzt, Drizzta, Drizztb Drizztc etc. Hopefully he will ditch the Drizzt diaries also. How many times can you rewrite the same thing? Apparently quite a few....."},{"Title":"Riemann's Zeta Function","review":"This is by far the book of mathematics that I like most. It's not the most complete source of information about the zeta function, Titchmarsh and Ivic are the authorities. However when you read this book, you have a feeling that you are following Riemann's, de la Vall&eacute;e Poussin's, Hadamard's, Littlewood's, etc... steps and you understand how these mathematicians must have felt while they studied the zeta function.It includes a translation of Riemann's original paper (On the Number of Primes...) which is very nice and most authors now seem to forget to mention (mainly because of the obscure way in which it was written).The first chapter is devoted to the study of the paper, then it is followed another chapter proving the product formula (which was not quite proven by Riemann), then a third chapter of von Mangoldt's proof of Riemann's Prime Formula.The fourth chapter has the famous prime number theorem and it's original proof by Hadamard and Poussin. The fifth one includes an error estimation due to Poussin for the prime number theorem, and the equivalent of the Riemann Hypothesis in terms of prime distributions.The Euler-Maclaurin formula is introduced in the sixth chapter to calculate zeros in the critical line.The Riemann-Siegel formula is introduced in the seventh, and then later chapters include large scale computations, Fourier analysis, growth and location of zeros.Finally we have my favourite chapter, counting zeros: Hardy's theorem, which says that there are infinitely many zeros in the critical line, which was improved by Littlewood, then later by Selberg, and then by Levinson.The last chapter is dedicated to some theorems, including an elementary proof of the prime number theorem.Most important idea: the introduction! It will give you an idea of how these amazing people studied and did math."},{"Title":"Riemann's Zeta Function","review":"It has always seemed to me that the very best modern books on the Riemann Zeta Function, and its applications to analytic number theory, are either written at a vey high or a very low level of mathematical sophistication. This book successfully bridges the gap between the uninformative \\"popular texts\\" and extremely advanced texts on analytic NT. True, you won't find material on generalized Dirichlet L-Functions, modular forms, advanced spectral theory of self-adjoint operators, and other such things in this book, nor will you find hopelessly obscurely worded, nonrigorous explanations like in \\"popular\\" math books; what you will find is an exposition of all the most important aspects of the theory which is accessible to anyone with even a piecemeal knowledge of real analysis and the rudiments of the theory of series and integrals of functions of a complex variable. The statement on the back cover that the \\"mathematically inclined general reader\\" will find this book accessible is certainly untrue when it comes to most such readers, but I would recommend this book to anyone with a basic knowledge of analysis and number theory who wants to really understand the math behind this important subject without overextending himself mathematically."},{"Title":"Riemann's Zeta Function","review":"I hesitate to add to the chorus of praise here for H.M. Edwards's \\"Riemann's Zeta Function,\\" for what little mathematics I have is self taught. Nevertheless, after reading John Derbyshire's gripping \\"Prime Obsession\\" and following the math he used there with ease, I thought to tackle a more challenging book on the subject. A Topologist friend suggested Titchmarsh's \\"The Theory of the Riemann Zeta-Function,\\" but I soon bogged down. I happily came across Edwards while browsing, and was pleased both with the low price, and the lucid contents.For those who are mathematicians and like their introductions to the most fascinating math problems straight and touching all horizons of inquiry, then experts appear to have converged on Titchmarsh as the volume for the first string. However, Edward's work is also appropriate for experts and hits the highlights of background leading to the Zeta function. But Edward's chief strength is beyond his intended audience, for it is his accessibility for the occasional mathematician. With some patience, and not without some little pain and an occasional side trip to \\"The World of Mathematics\\" or \\"The Encyclopedia of Mathematics,\\" even a self-trained mathematician can appreciate most of what Edwards is explaining.In short, I heartily recommend to those who have enjoyed John Derbyshire's \\"Prime Obsession,\\" and have additional steam, to take up Edward's \\"Riemann' Zeta Function\\" volume for further insights and knowledge."},{"Title":"Riemann's Zeta Function","review":"The popular press leaves us with the impression that math isintimidating. This wasn't always the case. In my time, the approach to how we teach math went thru cycles: (1) The boot-campapproach with its endless drills, (2) The New-Math approach, (3) The back-to-basics trend, and (4) The Make-it-Seem-Easy-and Fun approach and the motivational speakers.---Finally Edwards suggests, following Eric Temple Bell, that we rather begin with the classics when approaching a subject in math. It was thought that later books based on the classics had more effective ways of doing it, and few took the trouble of looking at the original and central papers of the great masters. The landmark papers. All the while, they collected dust on the shelves in the back rooms of libraries. Of the classics, the true landmarks, one stands out: It is Riemann's paper on the prime numbers, what later turned into the prime number theorem. It is also the paper with the Riemann hypothesis, still unproved, now generations later. So it is a delightful idea including Riemann's paper, in translation, in an appendix. It would have been nice had Edwards also reproduced the original German text. Now the RH is one of the Million-Dollar problems in math. It is anyone's guess when it will be cracked, but in the mean time, it continues to inspire generations of mathematicians and students. This Dover edition is came out in 2001. The original first 1974 edition, Academic Press, had gone out of print. This lovely book seems still to be a model that we can measure other books against. Edwards' presentation is both engaging and deep, and the book contains the gems in a subject that continues to be central in math, the subject of analytic number theory."},{"Title":"Riemann's Zeta Function","review":"Chapter 1 analyses Riemann's paper in detail. The zeta function is the product over all primes of 1/(1-1/p^s). Taking the logarithm, one obtains an expression involving the density of primes. So to say something about the density of primes one must say something about the log of the zeta function. Riemann does this by allowing the variable s of the zeta function to be complex, which enables him to prove the functional equation of the zeta function and the product representation of the xi function defined through it. From here he can derive an expression for log zeta, thus yielding an expression for prime density. Since it comes from log zeta, this expression depends on the poles of log zeta, i.e. the zeros of the zeta function. Riemann feels that all nontrivial zeros have real part 1/2, but this doesn't really matter right now since the term in the prime density expression depending on the zeros is \\"periodic\\" in any case and Riemann thus discards it without much harm when he derives his expression for the number of primes less than x. Hadamard and von Mangoldt later gave more rigourous proofs of the product formula for the xi function (chapter 2) and Riemann's prime density expression (chapter 3). As indicated by Riemann, further progress depends on an understanding of the zeros of the zeta function. Indeed, in this way Hadamard proved the prime number theorem (chapter 4), i.e. that the prime counting function is asymptotically equal to the logarithmic integral, and also in this way de la Vallee Poussin derived a bound for the error in this approximation (chapter 5). The Riemann hypothesis would imply a better bound. Chapters 6,7,8,9,11 deal with the pitiful progress towards the Riemann hypothesis, including computational aspects. Chapter 10 tries to hot up the Fourier analysis used in the classical works by putting it in terms of self-adjoint operators and so on. Chapter 12 \\"Miscellany\\" includes a proof of the prime number theorem that \\"is 'elementary' in the technical sense\\", but, as Edwards admits, it is neither straightforward, nor natural, nor insightful."},{"Title":"Riemann's Zeta Function","review":"I bought this book in order to understand Riemann's seminal paper on number theory, \\"On the Number of Prime Numbers Less than a Given Quantity\\", which I decided to try to read after having read John Derbyshire's excellent book on the Riemann Hypothesis, \\"Prime Obsession\\". I have some familiarity with complex analysis through reading Weinberger's \\"A First Course in Partial Differential Equations\\", although that hardly qualifies me as an expert, but it did give me the (perhaps unwarranted) confidence to try to read Riemann's paper. As Edwards notes in the Preface, there's no substitute for reading the primary sources. This review is therefore confined to Chapter One, which explains the paper in detail. Whether I ever get to any of the other chapters I can't promise.Anyway, at first I made slow progress, then got badly bogged down with the first contour integral, which I eventually figured out with help from Appendix E of Julian Havril's \\"Gamma: Exploring Euler's Constant\\". Then the going got pretty rough again and eventually I completely stalled at about page 5 of the paper where Riemann goes to the Fourier inversion of f(x). That's when I realized I needed to buy this book.The book performed as I had hoped. I was able to get through the rest of the paper with a more or less reasonable understanding of the overall thrust and how Riemann got where he got. Thus I can attest to Edwards' comment in the Preface that \\"Riemann's style is extremely difficult\\". Difficult because he leaves a lot out and assumes the reader is almost as mathematically capable as he is, which basically rules out 99.999999% of his audience.For the most part Edwards' exposition was understandable, although requiring close attention and a book on complex analysis and a calculator close at hand for reference. He goes into great detail and fills in almost all the gaps. But there were two areas where he lost me. The first was page 10 where he describes the first contour integral. I found Appendix E in Havril much clearer. The second was Section 1.15 \\"The Term Involving the Roots Rho\\". There is no mention of the corresponding expression Riemann used, which involves the square of the roots alpha of a closely related function. I could have used an explanation of how you get from one to the other.I also found one typo: page 27 expression (1) x should be lambda. (I think.)These minor criticisms aside, there is no way I could have ever gotten through the paper without help from this book. And I'm glad I decided to try. Riemann really is an amazing mathematician. He's like a magician, making functions appear, disappear, and change form before your eyes. This is the first time I've tried to read any original publications by one of the great mathematicians, and I really enjoyed it. I intend to do more of that in the future. In the meantime, if you're interested, there's a lot more in this book than just Riemann's paper. To be precise, there's 11 more chapters, covering almost all the other material described in \\"Prime Obsession\\", enough to keep you happily (or unhappily) occupied for a long, long time. Good Luck!"},{"Title":"Riemann's Zeta Function","review":"a wonderful exposition full of incredible formulae; a careful account of what Riemann could have thought of when writing his famous paper; the text contains calculations of zeta's non trivial zeroes in an old fashion way but still illuminating. Lacks schema of contours used in calculatingcomplex integrals but this is a very minor flaw; on the other side, one can find copies of two pages handwritten by B. Riemann which may show how casually this great genius could work and may explain why his followers had such difficulties in proving and following his ideas; the study of zeta means some herculean calculations of which Edwards gives a fine taste; this book is worth the pain to work with; one can compare his first proof of zeta's functional equation with those given in Ahlfors's \\"Complex analysis\\" or Tenenbaum's book: \\"Introduction to analytic an probabilistic theory of numbers\\"; my favourite formulae are:1) Von Mangoldt's formula for the psi function with summation over the nontrivial zeroes of zeta.2) the formula for the product of zeta and gamma as an improper integral and its sequel using hankel contour.3) the Siegel-Riemann formula for Z(t), this Z function being derived from the values of zeta on the line re(z) = 1/2.This is the very book to remove oneself on a desert island with (but don't forget a laptop to verify tha accuracy of Backlund's estimations of the fifteen first non trivial zeroes of ... zeta.By the way, do you happen to know which are the trivial zeroes ?"},{"Title":"Riemann's Zeta Function","review":"I have both bought this book and Titchmarsh's one.

I think this is very important and was neglected by all other books on this subject. From that not only we can have a more thorough understanding to what Riemann originally thinked and developed his famous function and this also serves as a respect to Riemann, one of the three greatest mathematicians of modern times!!

The seller has delivered on the high quality and excellent condition of the book."},{"Title":"Old Indian legends","review":"In this wonderful collection of D/N/Lakota stories originally published in 1901, Zitkala'sa (\\"Little Red Bird\\") retells fourteen legends (listed below)from the oral tradition. Most of the stories involve Iktomi (Unktomi) the Spider Trickster and his moral misadventures. Other stories include the Avenger and Iya (\\"Mouth\\")the Glutton. Most of the stories are used in showing the proper norms for D/N/Lakota society: be generous, do not be greedy, be hospitable, do not boast about yourself, do not deceive others to attain things, be merciful, be a good relative, etc. The reader will notice that some of the later stories do not follow the pattern of teaching morality, but seem to reflect older stories that do not always seem to follow logically. All in all, they are amazing stories that Zitkala'sa, also known as Gertrude Simmons Bonnin, wrote for primarily white audiences. There is a nice biographical sketch of Zitkala'sa and the illustrations by Angel De Cora are interesting in that they imagine the characters in human form.Here are the stories as they appear in the book: \\"Iktomi and the Ducks,\\" \\"Iktomi's Blanket,\\" \\"Iktomi and the Muskrat,\\" \\"Iktomi and the Coyote,\\" \\"Iktomi and the Fawn,\\" \\"The Badger and the Bear,\\" \\"The Tree-Bound,\\" \\"Shooting of the Red Eagle,\\" \\"Iktomi and the Turtle,\\" \\"Dance in the Buffalo Skull,\\" \\"The Toad and the Boy,\\" \\"Iya, the Camp-Eater,\\" \\"Man'stin, The Rabbit,\\" and \\"The Warlike Seven.\\""},{"Title":"Old Indian legends","review":"This is a clever and interesting book of Indian Legends. The first several stories are loosely linked and are probably best read in order, but otherwise the stories stand alone. They are a bit more violent than many Western tales, so if you're concerned about exposing your kids to violence, I might suggest reading over them first (I pretty much suggest that for every book of cultural tales, though).Also, many attitudes have changed since the times these stories were written, so although they cannot exactly be construed as prejudiced, there are a few odd phrases and translations that wouldn't have been used if the stories were transcribed today--nothing offensive, just odd.There were no formatting errors in the text. There is an active Table of Contents, but it is a chart, half of which is inaccessible. Even the available half looks incorrect in my kindle-for-pc program, though it's fine on the kindle itself.

After that night of horror she began a determined effort to find, prosecute and punish the rapist. In the process, her efforts helped other victims gain relief. Her account informs as well as holds your attention through the numerous twists and turns of human interest and self interest.Winkler is a gifted writer. Why read this book? It is more than just another account of rapes with clich&eacute;s, 'ho hum.' Dr. Winkler is also a professional anthropologist with knowledge and insight into human behavior. She examines the many aspects of the situation in a clinical manner. The reader will find answers to frequently asked questions, such as: is sexual need or power and brutality the driving force? what should the victim do at different times in the whole series of events from rape through recovery? what should friends do? to whom should the victim turn for assistance?Winkler presents enough information in a structured manner to support study groups in the many communities that are now developing programs to prevent rape and treat rape victims. The contents include three major parts: four chapters on key aspects of the physical rape; four chapters on the social consequences and problems; and four chapters on the legal aspects of gaining justice. She adds substance to other works listed in her extensive bibliography that can be included in a study. ...Winkler is a victim, a survivor, an activist, a defender and chronicler. ... One Night realities of rape reflects Winkler's professional authority and her humanity."},{"Title":"One Night: Realities of Rape","review":"Congratulation to Cathy, who is a good person who saved many other women.Throughout her book, she showed that the pain of three rapes could have been avoided. First, during the rape attack, two men heard her screams and did nothing.Her ability to detail a rape attack lets me understand why such a traumatic experience cannot be forgotten. Second,she lost her university job due to her persuit of the rapist with the police.An administrator abused her and terminated her appointment.Like a rapist, who will not apologize. Likewise, the dean of the school would not admit his error and give her her job back. Universities should support their faculty suffering crimes. A university is a part of a community and should work with the community. Third, the law enforcement, hospital and lawyers did not act effectively or swiftly. Fortunately,Cathy had good morals and along with persistance and determination to get real justice.She saved many other women who later would hve had to endure such traumatic experience from the rapist. I highly recommend this book. It was captivating and gave me as a man, understanding into the real tragedies of rape."},{"Title":"One Night: Realities of Rape","review":"Cathy Winkler should be commended for her sustained courage and determination to seek justice and to raise others' awareness of the multiple facets and phases of rape. Her book is an exemplar of the personal being political in feminist social analysis and criticism. Her success is based in large part on her skill as an ethnographer. Excellent ethnographers are able to produce three-dimensional descriptions and richly nuanced analyses of complex, power-laden social situations and cultural scenarios. The situations that Winkler describes are those related to the physical, social, and legal rape that she experienced and struggled against as an activist committed winning social justice. She offers a poignant cultural critique of how American society, with its gendered biases, treats rape as a crime and as a violation of women's human rights. Her critique implicates not only the criminals who rape but also others--friends and acquaintances, colleagues and administrators in work places, and, of course, legal and criminal justice personnel--whose actions extend the scope and effects of rape.Winkler joins the ranks of distinguished scholars like Peggy Sanday who has written on varying forms of rape in \\"rape-prone\\" societies. As a teacher at the university level I am eager to expose more of my students to this important body of work and to the powerful way that Winkler's reflexive account complements Sanday's research. Winkler's book can also be read in conjunction with with one of Micaela di Leonardo's essays in which she critically deconstructs the racist iconic representation of the rape she experienced when a Black male stranger violated her. Winkler's book also invites us to think about racist constructions of Black male sexuality and the pro-lynching myth of black men's propensity to rape White women. Although she does not address this aspect of the country's culture of race, she does express anti-racist sensibilities in the relationship she describes having with her Black students and with her concern about the way her case is presented to the public and to jurors, especially to Black jurors. She insists that her case is about violence against women and not race. Nonetheless, I think her excellent analysis could have been even more compelling had she elaborated on the emotionally-charged politics of representation and the relationship between the racist myths--through which many Americans still interpret cross-racial sex and sexual assault-- and the reality that her experience reveals. Although not discussed at length in the text, Dr. Winkler is well aware of these issues. Months after the physical rape, we shared a hotel room at the national anthropology conference and discussed her worry that racist cultural assumptions about Black male sexuality would muddle the facts of her case and the motivation that inspired her to seek justice. I didn't know then where her convictions would take her nor did I understand what a full-fledged auto-ethnography entailed when I read her initial essay on rape as social murder more than ten years ago. Now I know. She has written a powerful account that teaches us difficult but absolutely necessary lessons about how our society sacrifies part of the humanity of women who are raped."},{"Title":"One Night: Realities of Rape","review":"I would recommend this book. It is a story of horrible events which changed the life of the author, Dr. Cathy Winkler. However, against all the obstacles she faced, she was able to continue fighting for justice until this rapist was behind bars. It is a testament to her strength and courage. And a chilling look at the realities of how much can change in just one night."},{"Title":"One Night: Realities of Rape","review":"I had been waiting for the publication of ONE NIGHT for quite some time, so it was with great anticipation that I devoured the text from cover to cover upon receiving it. The social science of sexual violence, let alone any violence at all, is often difficult to come by. Sexual violence is something that affects so many of us, but it also happens to be one the least researched, thought about, and written about topics in the academy. It is refreshing that Dr. Winkler has been so generous with her self-ethnography. As a woman and a researcher, I am rarely surprised by what I hear about sexual violence-- and I think that Dr. Winkler has done a fine job in bringing to light in a particularly nuanced way many things which we take for granted, especially with respect to the following two points: 1) by showing us how tenuous and subjective the \\"path to justice\\" truly is,and 2) elaborating the many different axes of life that can be and often are disrupted for victim-survivor-activists, particularly those things which are imperative constituents of our everyday lives. ONE NIGHT is a rich and honest ethnography that preserves the individualness of the events shaping Dr. Winkler's life without making grand claims to generalization. At the same time, ONE NIGHT tells a terrifyingly familiar story, one that must be told if sexual violence is going to be considered as a multi-layered social problem and not simply as the burden of individuals. Finally, I must mention that I appreciated Dr. Winkler's care in producing a text about rape that was neither pornographic nor titillating. ONE NIGHT is an important step in unpacking the problem of sexual violence in the U.S."},{"Title":"Simulation, Fourth Edition (Statistical Modeling and Decision Science)","review":"\\"Simulation\\" by Sheldon Ross is a good book for introducing undergraduates to Monte Carlo simulation. I teach statistics to final year undergraduate students and I find that this book is at the perfect level for my students.After providing a recap of the basics of probability theory, Ross defines what a random number and a pseudorandom number are and then details how these numbers can be used to generate random variates from discrete and continuous probability distributions. Ross discusses the most commonly used algorithms for generating such variates, including the Inverse Transformation Method, the Acceptance-Rejection Method and methods for generating normal random variates. Ross also discusses problem solving using a simulation approach; the analysis of simulated data; variance reduction techniques (including how to determine the number of simulations required in order to solve a problem); and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.Ross's explanations of the various topics are simple to follow and include a large number of worked examples to illustrate the various points and formulae. A large number of exercises are also provided at the end of each chapter, although solutions are not given.The focus of this book is entirely on Monte Carlo simulation methods and Ross does not touch on any of the more sophisticated methods that have now superseded Monte Carlo methods (such as Latin Hypercube sampling), which may make this book a bit too simplistic for more advanced students (I am also writing a PhD in statistics, that involves the use of simulation techniques, and I found this book to be too basic to be helpful for that). However, for statistics students who are taking their first course in simulation, this book is perfectly pitched."},{"Title":"Simulation, Fourth Edition (Statistical Modeling and Decision Science)","review":"I'm currently an undergraduate studying introductory simulation, and this book has not been effective in conveying the necessary information.This textbook (if it can even be called one) is at best reference material. Examples are not clearly explained or worked out, i.e. methods for simulating a process are not fully explained and the actual estimator is never written down.The material is just too dense and an entire semester detailing various simulation techniques was covered in the span on 20-30 pages. Needless to say, this book can only be used as reference material for lectures and cannot be relied on for learning."},{"Title":"Behaviour Management in the Schools (General Psychology)","review":"If you've tried everything you can think of and your biggest behavior problems are still draining your energy(I know, I'm in the same boat, too!) then this book will save your sanity.

At first it was a little tough because the Canadian accent is written into the story, but overall it was entertaining."},{"Title":"Monkey subdues the White-Bone Demon","review":"My father used to read to me when I was very small from this very volume. I've always enjoyed the story, and after gaining in years I have come to appreciate the much larger text encompassing not only the tale of the White Bone Demon but also the origin of Monkey and his various escapades before and after his adventures detailed in \\"Monkey Subdues the White Bone Demon\\".In my opinion, the most often overlooked features of this version is the beautiful artwork present on nearly every page, almost certainly modeled after ancient Chinese woodcuts recalling this very legend, if not reproductions of the actual woodcuts themselves (I am not an asian historian). The various renditions of Monkey, Pigsy, Sandy, and Tripitaka intertwine themselves wonderfully with the text of the ancient legend.I've read Arthur Waley's abridged translation (and am about to embark upon the unabridged Jenner version), but to my mind this work stands apart from the others simply due to the beauty of it's presentation. The reproduced woodcuts alone are worth the purchase, regardless of what you think of the translation."},{"Title":"Monkey subdues the White-Bone Demon","review":"This is a great fairy tale with a Buddhist view that is magnificently and copiously illustrated.

I recognised it at the time as something special, and I worked out for myself how the scenery took on ominous shapes as the story turned. I wasn't even that excited by the story, but the artwork really captured my attention at such an early age.The whole of the book appears to be on archive.org if you want to try before you buy, but do get it on paper, the book has a wonderful feel of its own - a cross between a quality Chinese cultural publication of the 70's and a cheap mono xerox. And you do get to enjoy it even more not being on a screen, but to appreciate the art.

Now I'm going to do a \\"pay it forward\\" and contribute even more information. Believe it or not, there are actually 112 detailed 5\\"x7\\" line drawings in this 110 page book. How can that be, you ask? Frankly, I don't know. Chinese magic? But ignore the man behind THAT particular curtain because each of these exquisite images takes up most of its page, with the appropriate part of the tale written beneath the drawing in an easy-to-read typeface. Imagine it as an adult version of a picture book. Even the paper used has an unusual and nice solidness to it that I appreciated when turning the pages.The forward to the book says that \\"the line drawings are in the traditional Chinese style, while the operatic costumes in which the characters appear add to the legendary atmosphere of the story.\\" And, yes indeedy, it does have a very classical, timeless feel to it.If you love \\"The Monkey King\\" (or the \\"Journey to the West\\", as the original title by which this ancient Chinese tale is known), don't hesitate to purchase this book. I can't see how you wouldn't be happy with it. That irascible scamp, the Monkey King himself, is in almost every drawing (and loveable Pigsy --my personal fave-- is in most of the drawings as well, in case you, too, are a Pigsy fan).I hope this helps."},{"Title":"My First Jumbo Book Of Letters","review":"I gave this book 4 stars, because, although it's a wonderful book that's really quite unique for all of its combined features, I do wish it were constructed even sturdier, a little less flimsy. This is a crazy busy book chock full of lift-up flaps, touch-and-feels, and movable parts. It's a pretty big book, measuring 9.25\\" W x 11.5\\" L, with pages made of cardboard (but not the superthick cardboard of typical board-books; the pages are firm but thin enough to bend, only the cover is thick hard cardboard. From our limited experience, it seems that the DK \\"my first\\" books are usually made of thicker harder cardboard and are better constructed than this Scholastic book, but DK doesn't have one like this - SO FULL of many different interactive features!) There are 10 total pages, or 5 full spreads, all filled to the brim with colorful drawings of different sizes.The first page has things starting with the letters A-F; the interactive parts include an elephant with his head popping slightly out of the page, a little book with pages that turn, a fan that pulls down. The next page, G-L, has a helicopter with a rotating propeller, an invitation that opens up, and a leopard hiding behind a lift-the-flap bunch of leaves. You get the idea... Other features include a dragon with shiny scales, an orangutan with a furry touch-and-feel belly, a pop-up pyramid, a tiger hiding behind tall grass, a submarine that pulls up, a yo-yo that pulls down, etc. The final page ends with a giant pop-up zebra whose head literally jumps out of the page. There are lift-the-flaps and a string of hanging cards that show animals from A-to-Z. However, the zebra pop-up, although impressive, is too flimsy and not well-made at all - by simply opening the page to almost 180 degrees (just flat, not overbending it), I (NOT the baby!) caused the neck of the zebra to tear on one side. Since then, I've tried to be extra-careful with this page, but the other side of his neck is starting to tear too.Nevertheless, it's still a great book and one of our favorites. DS gets sooo excited with it, and it is a fun way to start introducing the alphabet and teach first words. Fair warning to all parents though - this book is so \\"interactive\\" that the parts will bend or tear very easily for any child (or adult, as above...), so we only read it TOGETHER, and I have to keep a very close watch to keep him from pulling too hard!"},{"Title":"My First Jumbo Book Of Letters","review":"I have now purchased all of the books in this line for my 2 yr old son & they are all wonderful!!

There is a section of the Hebrew original with its translation followed by the commentary. The text is broken up into a large number of chapters each one given a title .Here is a very small example of how the commentary is made. In regard to the central question of why Ruth refused to leave her mother - in- law after her husband's death, he writes. \\"With all the grace, compassion and heroism radiating from these verses and illuminating Ruth's personality, we still ask in astonishment , \\"Why did she see fit to act in this way!What did Ruth discover in Naomi that she took it upon herself to act this way?What did Ruthdiscover in Naomi that she took it upon herself to utter this oath? Did she want to lavish upon Naomi the love still harbored for her late husband?Or did some hidden voice beckon to her, speaking on behalf of the royal family destined to issue from her?Indeed Ruth followed her mother- in- law to the land of Judah carrying , hidden within her, the powerful urge to expiate their crime, and the hope of perpetuation of the family in the midst of Israel-that the name of the deceased husband not become expunged, but that a house for him be built in Judah and his name established in Israel.

It is a Brazilian novel, written in 1944, when the author was only 19 years old. It's written in a stream-of consciousness style and covers the childhood and early adulthood of Joana, whose view of the world is one of sadness and introspection. There's a unique use of language and a few good moments but it was a struggle to read and, if it wasn't a reading assignment, I would have thrown the book in the garbage after the first few pages. There was just too much introspection for me and non-linear self-absorbed thought. Her inner life bored me completely and, even though she used language well, I was never moved. I was just bored.That said, I must say that all the other members of the group, without exception, thought this was some sort of a masterpiece. Her angst-filled personality was meaningful to them, her words were unique expressions of wisdom. It was hard for me to believe how much they loved this book.When I think about it the author did have a unique voice. She did use language in a way that evoked emotion. And there was a bit of literary art to it. But I never would have read it had it not be an assignment.

I utilized the information as a parent and for the past ten years have incorporated the various topics into parent workshops. I like how the book is written as a parent guide that teachers can also tap into. I have a suggestion that hopefully Ms. Calkins sees valuable; Raising Lifelong Learners needs to be either revised and/or updated. The Common Core Learning Standards, the National Standards being adopted by most of the states, needs to be part of the text and included in the academic subjects. The book was written in 1997, parents would greatly benefit in reading the most up to date information.

From reading other reviews, I thought there would be more activities. Definitely a book to recommend to new parents."},{"Title":"Raising Lifelong Learners: A Parent's Guide","review":"_Raising Lifelong Learners: A Parent's Guide_ is full of practical suggestions, many of which are helpful to teachers as well as to parents. The book's principal author, Lucy Calkins, is a teacher educator, yet she considers the teaching of her two young sons to be her most important work. Calkins relates many vivid examples from her own experience.Although Calkins discusses things parents can do to maximize school success, _Raising Lifelong Learners_ is not a book about helping children with their homework. Instead it tells how to make the home a rich learning environment, how to arouse children's curiosity in all academic areas. Calkins says, \\" . . . the qualities that matter most in science and math, reading and writing -- initiative, thoughtfulness, curiosity, resourcefulness, perseverance, and imagination -- are best nurtured through the everydayness of our shared lives at home.\\"Calkins believes in leading children very gradually along the path of learning in all academic areas. She says, \\"My rule of thumb is to help the child do today what she will be able to do tomorrow. I don't want my assistance to be too far beyond the child's independent abilities or she will be put in a dependent position, always waiting for and wanting assistance.\\"Calkins places heavy emphasis on both work and play. The latter provides an opportunity for children to develop imagination, resourcefulness, and language skills. Calkins believes that parents, not schools, have the primary responsibility for developing a work ethic in children. This is cultivated through hobbies and projects as well as through chores.After Calkins discusses the nurturing of language arts, math, science, and social studies as children progress from infancy through middle school, Lydia Bellino, a reading specialist and school principal, addresses school issues in half a dozen appendices. Most of these, such as curricular choices and various assessment methods, can also apply to the homeschool situation."},{"Title":"Raising Lifelong Learners: A Parent's Guide","review":"I began this book last night. It was recommended to me by a friend who is also a principal, and I dutifully bought it, placed it on a shelf and kept looking at its spine (feeling guilty). It looked, judging from the title and cover, like an academic, how-to book. I was afraid it would be too impractical...too unrealistic. Was I wrong. I was immediately inspired. In fact, I was in my youngest child's preschool class today helping out. I heard myself asking the children the rather inane questions (questions only of fact) that Calkins describes early in her book. She doesn't just list these questions as &quot;bad&quot; questions. She gives us alternatives to help US help our children to THINK. So, upon hearing myself ask something inane, I rephrased my question and really LISTENED to the child's response. Thank you Lucy Calkins. I'm sure to keep asking these basic questions, but now I also know how to ask for and listen to more complicated ideas! I can't wait to learn more as I finish this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Raising Lifelong Learners: A Parent's Guide","review":"I can't put this book down! I have to re-read the chapters that are applicable to my 4-year-old child over and over again. The author captures exactly the kind of education I'd like for my child: one that encourages active, critical, and creative learning and not merely doing well in tests and getting good grades. This book has given me many practical ideas for instilling a love of learning in my child, as well as for finding a school that will be my partner in this endeavour."},{"Title":"Raising Lifelong Learners: A Parent's Guide","review":"This book is an excellent resource for anyone attempting to help a child's learning process, but it addresses our affluent, better educated population. The message is sometimes garbled by the &quot;silver spoon&quot; sticking out of Ms. Calkins' mouth. I give it 4 stars because the message is there, and I would not want anyone interested in the education of children to miss it. It does remind me of Martha Stewart and her creative, neat, organized world--often condescending but still providing good ideas.Unfortunately, &quot;my&quot; child is a 13 year old boy who has been neglected and abused all his life, and has been our foster son for only four months. He scores at a 2nd-3rd grade level in reading, but our observations tell us he is capable. This child missed out on that necessary intervention in early childhood and, it is apparent, his school is not going to bring him up to speed. I have read many books in the last few months on the theory of teaching reading, and Ms. Calkins' is one of the best. I just wish there were more to be found on helping disadvantaged children who have been deprived of the joy of reading by circumstances beyond their control."},{"Title":"Raising Lifelong Learners: A Parent's Guide","review":"I was attracted to this book by the title and based on the previous recommendations I read on Amazon.You have to give credit to somebody who draws from their experience to help others. What I really like about this book is that the author urges parents to become a proactive force in their child's education and provides various suggestions for doing just that. This is particularly true when the author addresses reading. As I researched about reading skills, it became apparent to me that many pre-reading skills (such as understanding symbols, sequencing, left-to-right, etc) should be developed 1 or 2 years before reading begins. One of the simplet ways (there are others that should be considered also) to encourage and strengthen these skills is to read aloud to kids. Don't wait until they are in kindergarten or preschool, do it now, as soon as birth and perhaps even during pregnancy. LMC articulates and underscores this point very well. Of course if you are considering this book you probably are already doing just that.Why the three stars? First, I think LMC missed a big red flag when she invalidated her sons feelings at one point about going to school. She writes something to the effect that she told her son \\"its not normal\\" to not like school or something to that effect. Having read Roger Schank's radical \\"coloring outside the lines\\" in parallel with this book, I think its the most normal thing in the world for children to complain about being bored in school while adapting to it. How is it normal for a child to sit at a desk and not speak out of turn all the while being expected to absorb concepts that are new and thus foreign and perhaps even uninteresting to them? Anyhow, maybe its just a difference in philosophy, since I lean towards, non-coerced, student-led educational philosophy. Nonetheless, I think LMC has the best of intentions with this book and provides excellent suggestions with respect to creating an environment of learning at home, which is the aim of the book.The second reason for the three stars is that I think the book's effectiveness could have been enhanced had LMC summarized a reading list as an appendix. The suggestions for read-alouds are great, except you may have to jump back and forth throughout the book to find them or otherwise keep a pencil handy so you can write them down as you come across them.Overall, a good book and perhaps should be done as homework before one becomes a parent or at least when one is considering how a child's environment encourages learing."},{"Title":"Raising Lifelong Learners: A Parent's Guide","review":"I bought this book because my son was beginning 3rd grade. I thought it would help me understand how to encourage his reading. It far exceeded my expectations. This book was filled with both great personal insights (from a parents perspective) and current educational theory. This book made a great case for understanding &quot;Whole Language&quot; methods of teaching reading and working with them. I now have a much better grasp of what education theories are being used in elementary school and I also better understand the importance of helping my son develop a love for writing. Simply put: this book is very helpful for parents who want to be involved with their children's elementary education!"},{"Title":"Raising Lifelong Learners: A Parent's Guide","review":"This book was very helpful to me and my husband. We are not &quot;educators&quot; by trade and it provided alot of thought provoking material. We are in the process of deciding on where to send our son for kindergarten and found many of the suggestions in the appendices very helpful. I never realized how many different ways we can make reading and writing a fun and natural part of our children's lives. We have already made changes at home and are seeing the benefits. Both our 2 and 5 year olds are picking out books from their bookshelves each night and excitedly listening as Mom or Dad read. I especially found the recommended authors listed helpful."},{"Title":"Raising Lifelong Learners: A Parent's Guide","review":"Calkins makes the case for embracing a child's natural curiosity and encouraging their interests into definable disciplines. She spends a lot of time on how to approach writing. She gently points out that it is not initially a fine motor skill to be mastered but an avenue for the child to record his or her own stories and experiences. Her constant message is how to encourage rather than perfect the child's ability which is refreshing in a world of standardize testing. Through sharing of her own experiences she provides ideas on how to help further develop a child's natural inventiveness into lessons on reading, writing, science and math. This is not a hard line method to expose a child to everything available but rather an encouragement based approach to explore ideas with your child."},{"Title":"Raising Lifelong Learners: A Parent's Guide","review":"This book has had a positive impact on my child rearing. My children are 4, 2, and 3 months. My 4 year old attends a Christian Montessori school where they support the kind of rich learning evironment that Lucy Calkins describes in her book. I have encouraged it at home too: little television, lots of books, free play, use of the imagination, puppets etc. and I am pleased with my daughters overall love for learning. This book is not related to Montessori, but it confirmed a lot of what they do. Well worth the read. I didn't give it 5 stars because I would have liked an appendix of suggested readings she made."},{"Title":"Raising Lifelong Learners: A Parent's Guide","review":"This book changed the way that I looked at my children's learning and the way that I conducted myself around them. It's full of practical ideas that anyone can do and vindicated some of my own instincts. It may bother people who think their children need to be in organized activities all the time. The book stresses that creativity often comes from having the time to think and dream.It also gives ways to help you communicate with your child and also about how what you say about your life reflects in your child's view of the world. Another item which was helpful was the idea that it's okay for kids to try things and fail or not do them perfectly as long they keep trying.I'm the mom of two very creative, bright kids and I think this book is partly responsible."},{"Title":"The middle parts of fortune: Somme & Ancre, 1916","review":"Marvellous read.

This updated edition of Gavin's 1992 book of the same title concerns the history of cabaret in America--and it's a real dazzler.Beginning in the speakeasies of the '30s and progressing through the glamorous '40s and '50s to the repressive '50s, the book takes us to the wide-open sexuality of the '60s and '70s, the devastation from HIV of the '80s and early '90s to where we stand today. It's a show-biz history of an admittedly small niche in American entertainment, but an extraordinarily rich and creative one. From Bobby Short and Mabel Mercer through Phyllis Diller and Barbra Streisand and Peter Allen to the Callaway sisters, Barbara Cook and Ute Lemper, there is something here for all tastes and all moods.The art of cabaret--and be sure it is an art--is the experience of sitting in a quiet club, some glamorous, some sewers, and listening to a singer perform . . . seemingly just for you. Old standards are reinterpreted, new material marveled at, forgotten songs recalled. The audience in encouraged to feel, think--and maybe have a drink or two. Scrupulously researched, Gavin has managed to not only create a chronological history (including the stars, and the genius accompanists, crafty presenters, scummy landlords and adoring fans) but lovingly describes performers and performances. But be forewarned: The discography at the end of the book is incredibly comprehensive, and by the time you've finished reading about these legendary talents, you're going to want pull out the charge card and hit amazon.comSo stop sitting alone in your room, buy this book, and discovers just how much more music you can hear play, if, old friend, you come to the cabaret."},{"Title":"Intimate nights: The golden age of New York cabaret","review":"Gavin has done a lot more than just research the time period he covers with such liveliness in this comprehensive book about New York nightclub entertainment.

Fantastic! For all the skeptics out there who view Hulda Clark's theories as &quot;unscientific&quot; and &quot;quackery,&quot; I invite you to check out her latest publication. This is science way beyond its time. This independant scientist has bypassed the normal route of dicovery and handed the results to you personally. No medical journal time lag involved here! She is not motivated by peer recognition nor financial gain. (Clearly the great power above would not have allowed her tremendous success in cancer, aids, etc. if she was motivated by greed.) Anybody familiar with biochemistry and physics can truly appreciate this entire book. It is basically broken down into 3 sections: 1. Basic syncrometer testing: This section contains 30 experiments in basic syncrometer testing. It is a companion section on her 3 books, &quot;Cure for All Cancers,&quot; &quot;Cure for Hiv/Aids,&quot; and &quot;The Cure for All Diseases.&quot;2. Syncrometer Biochemistry testing: This section contains 62 experiments in advanced biochemical testing with the syncrometer. This is not for the beginner. Nor can one use household products to make testing samples, but with a few hundred dollars in specimen, tissue and substance slides the possibilities are endless!3. Geometabolism: This 3rd section of 16 experiments undoubtedly qualifies Dr. Clark for a Noble prize in various categories.(Of course she deserved a Noble prize in medicine with her very first Cancer book!) This section involves the effect of the earth's(or outer space) magnetic field on the timing of our metabolism. It would be a great discovery in modern science if she or other syncrometer operator was able to perform these experiments in a space environment outside of the earths atmosphere. This would bring us major steps closer to piecing together many questions of our existence. Are we really connected to our universe? Is there an ultimate &quot;force&quot; that brings us all together? Is there really something to Ayurvedic medicine's philosophy of our health being connected with the cosmos?(Ayurveda is the oldest form of medicine originating from India and spawning nutritional and exercise(yoga) guidelines.)This book is years ahead of its time for those who can look past its basic ingredient, the syncrometer. Although rather elementary in its design compared to todays technology, its use involves the most sensitive, fool proof machine existing. Our own senses. This device is more sensitive than ELISA immunology testing, is cheap, quick and user frendly. So what is the catch? Well ask any musician if their instrument is difficult to use and you will most likely get a quick, &quot;No!&quot; The reason for this confident answer is that they have PRACTICED long hours. The syncrometer will initially require a few hours of practice much like a musical instrument. It is a blend of hand eye coordination, sensitive listening and concentration to blend the two together. In 6 months of daily practice one can become a saviour to ailing family members and friends. Good luck and God bless!"},{"Title":"Syncrometer Science Laboratory Manual (Syncrometer Science Laboratory Manual Series, 1)","review":"My paradigm of science has been expanded.

I may be exhibiting a little (healthy) Aussie bias but perhaps that would make me all the more critical if the product did not stand up. The academic style is totally appropriate, elevating objectivity and providing the keen reader with an opportunity to check sources and interpretations. Given the literary achievements of the authors, I expected a good read so this technical edge is a bonus.The early focus on the romantic origins of science fiction in Australia is an eye-opener for me and I will be sure to review some classics, on the fringe of the genre, in a new light. The hard-nosed analysis of the booms and busts is, again, appropriate. In the second half, the book moves from analyses of periods to an author-by-author account.

His stories are filled with the subtleties of human communications, human frailties and the power of man's ability to resolve impossible conflict. From the simple to the complex, the serious to the sublime, Jeff has captured many poignant mediation turning points and dissected them for the reader's education and skill building.

The material was so good and entertaining that I found myself at the end of each chapter saying, \\"Okay, one more chapter then I'll go to bed.\\" Then a half hour later, \\"Okay, really just one more chapter.\\"Mr. Krivis has shared in this book many valuable tools that I have already applied in my private practice as an attorney and mediator.

The book is easy to read and the summaries at the end of the anecdotes (\\"What Strategies Can We Learn?\\") are a bonus. I ordered an extra copy of this book to lend to my clients."},{"Title":"Improvisational Negotiation: A Mediator's Stories of Conflict About Love, Money, Angerand the Strategies That Resolved Them","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. In addition to the Hip-Pocket Guide to Strategy, which is excellent, this author is a masterful storyteller. His tales are not simple, though. They record decisions people have made in difficult circumstances; Some involve relationship and communication breakdowns while others are mostly about money, still others involve negotiators whose decision making depends on finding creative solutions or on using information strategically. As the author recounts these cases from his own experiences and those of colleagues, he shows us how mediators lead negotiators toward resolution. Each of the thirty examples is followed by a discussion of the techniques and approach used by the mediator. Some criticisms are offered, with the benefit of hindsight of course. The presentation of each case, the analysis of the techniques used and the author's reflections on the experience enables the reader to see each of these mediations from the perspective of a master mediator. A book that does all this deserves to be highly recommended."},{"Title":"Improvisational Negotiation: A Mediator's Stories of Conflict About Love, Money, Angerand the Strategies That Resolved Them","review":"Jeffrey Krivis has mediated thousands of cases in practically every imaginable legal area. A former trial attorney, he has been a successful mediator for over 15 years, and has served as the president of the International Academy of Mediators and the Southern California Mediation Association. He has taught various courses and workshops on mediation and dispute resolution and in 1993 he received the Dispute Resolution Lawyer of the Year Award. His website [...] is filled with a wide array of helpful information.Improvisational Negotiation takes the unusual approach of showing by example how mediation can help parties reach mutually beneficial solutions. This book forgoes any long-winded discussions of philosophy or the rigid use of a formulaic approach to conflict resolution. Instead, Krivis has filled this book with thirty stories - mostly taken from his own experience. He succinctly explains the disputes in a few pages and then shows how a mediator uses a variety of tools and skills to bring the parties together to settle their conflicts before they end up in the courtroom.After each case is brought to a conclusion, Krivis summarizes the keys to resolving the negotiations in a short section called \\"What Happened?\\" He then concludes with a section called \\"What Strategies Can We Learn?\\" where he briefly lists the approaches taken that led to a successful resolution. This is a very entertaining way to show how various approaches are often needed to bring divergent positions to a common ground.Krivis organizes the stories into sections dealing with:Rebuilding Communication Breakdowns and Healing Broken Relationships;Financial Negotiations and Using Information for a Better Deal;Useful and Proven Techniques For Difficult Technical Negotiations; andAdvanced Techniques for Negotiations that are Locked Down.Improvisational Negotiation is filled with entertaining stories and helpful techniques used to bring parties together. Krivis understands that no two cases are alike and that no two mediators work in the same way. He expects that these stories will provide a broad guideline to various approaches thatmediators can use in their practice. He recognizes that \\"mediators need to change their approach not only from case to case but also within the same case.\\" He writes in the introduction that he hopes \\"the stories in this book encourage you to follow a similar path: to search the length and width of the field, anticipating the direction of the case, constantly maneuvering the parties toward the deal.\\"This book is filled with great examples of creative and successful mediations - along with an analysis of the techniques used to bring the parties together. Krivis clearly knows his stuff. Mediators and lawyers will find in this book many examples of ways to solve problems that at first blush appear to be nearly impossible. My only criticism of the book is that some of the stories presented point to a fairly obvious solution. Others involve lawyers allowing their clients to engage in somewhat questionable conduct - such as talking privately with the opposing lawyer with only the mediator present, or disclosing information to opposing counsel that might expose the client to even more liability.On the whole, however, this book excels at showing just how effective mediation can be when done with skill and finesse."},{"Title":"Improvisational Negotiation: A Mediator's Stories of Conflict About Love, Money, Angerand the Strategies That Resolved Them","review":"I am just starting out as a mediator and have found this book both inspiring and practically helpful. Krivis's case studies are extremely specific and just long enough to give you the story, but not so long that you wonder when he's going to get to the point. His stories demonstrate a mixture of mediation approaches--transformative, facilitative, and directive. I think I'll read it again after I get a few more mediations under my belt."},{"Title":"Improvisational Negotiation: A Mediator's Stories of Conflict About Love, Money, Angerand the Strategies That Resolved Them","review":"I found this book to be very entertaining and insightful.

Well, as a trial lawyer and as someone who would benefit a lot from doing my best at mediation, Jeff Krivis' book is a DEFINITE READ. Mr. Krivis' style is clear and very easy to understand. After setting forth various fact patterns that an experienced lawyer might see, he shows how different approachs to meditation settle the case. This is a window into how to a top mediator thinks about your case and the strategies he uses to help both sides resolve their differences.

This book should be required reading for anyone currently mediating the litigated case. It should also be read by litigators. The analysis sections at the end of each chapter provides a wealth of information for sorting out differences of all kinds. Don't wait for the jury, ladies and gentlemen.

In 30 riveting chapters, Krivis takes the reader behind the scenes and far beneath the surface of conflicts that everyday people face and his (and others) strategies for their resolution.

Edgar Hoover for use by the FBI to help develop their crime lab. At the time, Hatcher probably knew more about what is now called firearm forensics. This book describes how one goes about becoming an expert in the field of cartridge case and bullet comparisons to determine if the one used in a crime came from a suspects gun. It describes all the available equipment, like the comparison microscope, and how to use it.This was used for many years by the FBI as their basic training textbook and went through many editions as more and more sophisticated equipment became available.This is a replica of the first edition and is highly interesting reading, although it becomes quite technical at times.

I'm so glad that I did.Although it is considered a novel for young adults, this older adult reader was highly caught up in the story about the young, pompous, and very talented silversmith who had his whole future changed in an instant when a work accident burned his hand. His entire life's work came to a screeching halt. His transformation from braggadocio boy to patriotic spy was a realistic journey that taught me much about life in Boston just before the American Revolution.Forbes' characters are enchanting even when they are annoying, and this reader grew to appreciate all the hard-earned lessons in life that transformed Johnny into a mature, likeable fellow. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Bought for my kids to read, ended up reading it myself. Was a kid when I first read it in school. Forgot how good it was.

I loved the book for its revolutionary story and touching ending. The characters were very well developed. Esther Forbes did a great job writing this book. The plot was terrific. Johnny Tremain seemed very real. His feelings and views we can all relate too. I loved Rab, expecially. His character was always mysterious and ahead of Johnny. I can see how Johnny was so intrigued with him when they first met. I would be, too. His confidence made him appear very mature, and his ambitions and good intentions made him a man. All in all, read Johnny Tremain; you will not regret it! It was a great book, definately my favorite!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain is a book about a young man living in Boston just before the Revolutionary War breaks out. This book has a lot accurate historical facts, and readers learn about people like Paul Revere and Sam Adams. This book is worth reading because it shows how Johnny grows up and changes and how, at the same time, the colonies get ready for war. The reader learns about the Sons of Liberty and the Observer's Club which were held in secret and helped unite the colonists against the British.In the beginning of the book, Johnny is only concerned about his career and himself. He feels sorry for himself because he loses the use of his hand in a terrible accident, and he can no longer be a silversmith. He is denied the right to join a family that he belongs to and finds himself with no friends and no future. When he meets another young man named Rab, his life changes. He begins to work for a group of men who seek independence from the British because they believe the colonists are not being fairly treated. He learns how to ride a horse and practices writing with his crippled hand. Johnny participates in distributing Whig publications around Boston and the surrounding towns. Johnny participates in the Boston Tea Party and then becomes a spy for the colonists.Slowly, Johnny realizes that the making of his new country is most important in his life, and he forgets about his all the other things that caused him problems in the past. While working for the colonists, Johnny proves to brave and loyal. He is willing to take risks and even have a very painful operation to repair his hand so he can fire a musket and help fight on the battlefield. He can also see the good in other people, especially the men who are willing to die for the colonies. Johnny is very proud of them. At the end of this book, Johnny is mature and not afraid of his future. At the same time, the war has started and a new country is born.I recommend this book to all fifth graders because this book has action, adventure and a lot about history. It is a great way to learn about our Revolutionary War and the events that led up to it. It also shows the great sacrifice many people were willing to make to separate from the British and start a new country. Finally, this book shows how one man can change and really make a difference."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This book really gave you good insight on the Revolutionary War. I read it in third grade, and now, two years later, I can't remember much. It was well-rounded in the theme.The character developement was great. Johnny has the traits valued in main protagonist: bravery, wits, and kindness. Other characters also helped the clima of the story. Cilla, Issanah, Rab, Mr. Pumpkin (my favorite), etc. were all wonderful.This story involves a lot of loyalty. There he is, involved in a war. His friend, Rab, is a hot-headed patriot while his remaining family, the notorious Lytes, are loyalists. It makes everything really complicated."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I just finished reading this for school. To be honest, I kept putting it off, not wanting to, as I don't really like historical fiction, unless around WWII times. When I finally started reading it, I didn't want to put it down! I loved it, along with the characters.They had me going back and forth, with which character I agree with. Lavinia Lyte seemed liked a nice girl, maybe a little vain, at first, but then my opinion totally changed. I loved Johnny and Cilla's relationships, it was fun, and innocent at first, and progressed slowly. Johnny's jealousy helped too.Rab was a very interesting character, I always wanted to know more of him. But it seems you weren't supposed to know him all that well, and that was fine with me.I did have to go back, remember what it was that I was reading about in several situations, make sure I understood what characters were doing why, why Johnny was doing so, but all in all, greatly written and I would suggest it to friends. (:"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"When I read the first page of this book, I think I actually groaned. The author starts off describing how gulls wake up in Boston. However, as the story builds, I began to realize that the author was only showing the reader the setting, and the trivial gulls were no longer a part of the story.Johnny Tremain is a silversmith's apprentice, who is good at what he does, although a little arrogant. While making a silver cup for John Hancock, Johnny burns his hand because one of the other jealous appretices gave him broken tools. He spilled molten silver on himself, permanantly crippling his hand.While looking for work that can be done with one hand, Johnny is hired by a printer, delivering papers on horse back. The printer is a Patriot, and even holds meetings of the Sons of Libererty in his attic. Johnny finds himself an avid participant of the Revolution, even hoping to join the fight so that \\"a man can stand up...\\". He hacks open tea chests during the Boston tea party, and acts as a spy for Paul Revere.I highly recommend this book. It teaches you a lot about the American Revolution, and offers an interesting story as well. I enjoyed this book because I saw a bit of myself in Johnny, something I wasn't expecting at all. A surprisingly entertaining look at the past-I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Having read this book as a child and several times over the years of my life I find myself returning to this classic for various reasons. Each time I find myself liking him for different reasons.His determination to go forward in life despite personal misforune has always been reason to like him as a fellow. His inadvertently making friends among people he sees as his enemies has kept him human. He remains a patriot but still keeps with his Redcoat friends. And we never forget that this isn't some political mess, it is set on a time just about to explode into war when many of his neighbors and friends on both sides of this mess will be bent on killing each other.A good book for young boys to read both to teach them history and to set them forward in life."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"It was 1969 when this book was read to me or I should say read to our class at Brook Glenn Elementary School in Taylors, SC. Every day right after lunch during quiet time our teacher would read a section from this book.I still remember it like it was yesterday. Images that a little 9 year old hasn't forgotton in 35 years. The story was good. I clearly remember living vicariously through Johnny Tremain in my little world. I wonder if teachers still read to students like that. It certainly made an impression on me and was perhaps the beginning of a lifelong love with reading books.I notice that the book was written by a woman. I wonder if the teacher was an early feminist. Funny to have that kind of thought about this book these many years later. It reflects the times we live in. But I suspect, since the book was written before all that came along, it had no political agenda at all and is just plain good old storytelling."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain is about a young boy who lives in the time of the Revolutionary War in Boston, Massachusetts. His mother and father died when he was very young so he has been living with another family through his years as a skilled apprentice being a silversmith. He's very cocky and thinks he's all that. He doesn't get along with the other family members and treats them like garbage. After a messy incident working, Johnny gets a permanent burn on his hand from the hot metal. He is PERMANENTLY scared and cannot use that hand anymore. Now that he is useless the family starts treating him like garbage since he is no use to them anymore. The mother kicks him out and Johnny has to find a new job that he can work in with his crippled hand. While looking he makes friends with a quiet, friendly, yet intense patriot named Rab. Rab works at the Boston Observer, a newspaper publisher run by his uncle, and they offer Johnny a job there delivering the newspapers and a place to stay. Johnny starts realizing how humble Rab is and becomes a new person now since he isn't viewed like an amazing skilled silversmith anymore but just another civilian. After working at The Observer for quite awhile now, Johnny finds out something about his mother and father from his so called \\"enemy\\" (the Lyte family) in the book. What he finds out may change his life forever. As he becomes in the loop of the patriots plans, he helps them spy and try to defeat the British. Will he go off to war and sacrifice himself for the new born country? Or will he stand by and watch? Who will he lose along the way? Personally I really hated the book. The idea of it was good but the book dragged on and on and on and on!!! When I first heard what this book was going to be about I thought it was going to be exciting, sad, dramatic, nerve racking, scary, victorious. I thought I was going to feel many emotions (especially since it's about the Revolutionary War) but I felt nothing what so ever. Since I didn't feel anything the chapters dragged on and on and they were really hard to understand and confusing. I really suggest that you definitely don't read this book. I wouldn't have finished reading this book if it weren't for my teacher. I seriously suggest to read another book and ignore this one!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"First off, I would like to say that when I started reading this book for a language arts class assignment, I had NOTHING against it. I don't mind books about history; I don't mind reading, and believe me, I WANTED to enjoy it. But by the time I got done the first chapter, I knew this book was horrible, yet I continued to read it. I did not HAVE to read it, I could have just gotten the answers from someone else, but I read it anyway. This book was horrible. It was unrealistic and had almost nothing at all to do with history. The plot line (if you could actually call \\"that\\" a plot line) had nothing to do with anything, the so called adventures this dumb Johnny Tremain kid got himself into were things that would never ever happen EVER. It had nothing to do with anything in history and tried to drift more of your attention to this dumb kid who got some stupid silver cup stolen. It was the most boring book I have ever read.If you are actually considering buying this trash, PLEASE for the sake of your poor kids or students or whomever, RECONSIDER. If you want to buy them something educational or something that portrayals early American life, DO NOT buy this. I forced myself to be bored with this dumb book about three quarters of the way through, and then I could not take it anymore. There was nothing I found remotely interesting; I would not force my worst enemy to read this book. It would be more fun and interesting watching someone pick the lint of their socks.If one was not the lowest number I would rate this book a zero, it deserves a negative 200, but that would draw too much attention to a book so dumb it does not deserve ANY attention. I feel so strongly about this that I am actually wasting my summer to come and type this to help prevent some poor soul from going through the torture I went through. Why this book won a Newberry metal, I don't know, something seriously went wrong, but look at the other books on that list... SHILOH? I personally think that someone was held at gunpoint to actually PUBLISH this book.Don't waste your time with this waste of paper. Incase you are wondering, I got a 98 on that test without even reading a lot of the book and the other parts I actually did read I was too busy banging my head into the wall or falling asleep, the only thing that stopped me from shredding this book in the Garbage disposal or a cuisinart was that I might break one of them on this useless piece of (crud) and that I would not pay the school even 10 cents for this horribly written garbage."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"First off, I can't figure out how or why Johnny Termain won the Newbery award. My guess is that perhaps there was a shortage of quality book. This book is painfuly bad.I'm doing my thesis on the Revolutionary War at the Elementary level, and I was told I should read this book. Thre are so many other books that are so much better. If you want to read about the Revolutionary War, then I suggest some Dear America books, and My name is America books, and MY Brother Sam is Dead.The problem with Johnny Termain is that the war isn't mentioned until 1/2 of the book is over. The author just prattles on about nothing. It briefly mentions the Boston Masscure, and the Boston Tea Party. They are two events that are reasons why we went to war, but the author just skips over them.As a character, Johnny is a smart mouthed little punk. The reader never really cares about what happens to him. In the story, Johnny gets injured on his silversmith job, and has to find other work. The problem is that we don't read that much about the war, and that's what this book is suppose to be about.There are a lot of fictional books that are a good read that deal with the Revolutionary War.....Johnny Termain isn't one of them."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This book is so dull.

I'm an advanced reader for my age, and the old English vocabulary is hard for me to tackle. The plot is mostly boring, but there are some exciting parts, such as the Boston Tea Party. There isn't really a plot line, so you never know where Esther Forbes is going next with the story. ...

No, actually in space. My 7 year old brother has written better stories. It takes place in Boston during the Revolutionary War. I feel it was very boring and nothing out of the ordinary happened. They couldn't even make you sad when Rab died, and you knew this character from the beginning. If I could've I would've rated it -100,000,000,000. The romantic junk between Cilla and Johnny was the same old thing. I felt I was just reading the same story over and over again (If you're gonna do that at least read something worth while). Cilla likes Johnny, she doesn't care, Cilla likes Johnny, she doesn't care, Cilla likes Johnny, she doesn't care. It was the same thing. They could've put more suspense and details. It didn't even teach you much about history. I could've watched a movie and gotten more information. If you want to learn about history read a history textbook or go to school. Yes, even homework is worth not reading this disgusting horrible, dull book. I absolutely hated it. When they told you Rab died it should've been more sad. You weren't even sad when Johnny burnt his hand. You knew everything that was gonna happen, and of course the same old ending (The hurt or sick person is cured.)

After wandering the streets, Johnny finally takes a job delivering newspaper for a printing shop. He makes friends with Rab, another boy who works at the printing shop. Every one at the shop is a patriot, and there are secret meetings at the printing shop. Soon Johnny helps out by spying on the British, because his horse is in the same stables as the British horses.

When Johnny discovers that many rebels were killed in battle, he makes his way over to see if Rab was killed.Personally, I hated this book.

The book does an good job of portraying 18th century Boston and the lives of apprentices. The book is also interesting for its ability to cast the hero as one who is disabled for a large portion of the story and his struggles to deal with his new found limitations. Of course the highlight of the book must be the description of the British march on Lexington in Concord that began a Revolution that would eventually result in a new nation being born.

I re-read Johnny every few years and still enjoy every word and still find something important in it.A word to students, if you are reading it for class and resent having to read it then you won't enjoy it, but if you think of it as an adventure story and if you want to find out how our country began this is a very good book to find out. Would you enjoy reading about a young boy on another planet fighting to save his world from being dominated by a race from another galaxy?

The plot becomes so thick when you start to read that you begin to yearn to finish this terrible book. Johnny's poor attitude causes you to have no sympathy for him once he burns his hand. There are a lot of characters involved, and are again individuals you will have no empathy for. This book is very boring, but the Boston Tea Party part was mildly entertaining. Johnny Tremain does not have the energy that some novels do, which make you want to turn every page to see what will happen. It's a book that you just want to get through to finish. I'm giving it two stars because I like Rab's demeanor in the story, and I like the way Johnny grew and became more mature toward the end of the novel. Only read this one if absolutely necessary.

He is apprenticed to be a sliversmith. Johnny is the alpha cocky, bossy, annoying boy that lives with a family called the Laphams. But once he burns his right hand with molten sliver, that all turns around. Mr. Lapham tells Johnny that he should find something that he is good at and that he can do with his injured hand (because Johnny can not be a sliversmith with his burned hand.) But Johnny is turned down for most jobs. One day Johnny meets Rab, who works for his uncle(Uncle Lorne)at the Boston Observer. Johnny decides to start working at the Boston Observer as a horse/delivery boy. This is how he gets connected with famous patriots like: John Hannock, Sam Adams, and Paul Revere. He goes on adventures that include the Boston Tea Party and The Battle of Lexington. So this book was okay but I wouldn't read it again. It seemed too long and it also seemed repetitive. It seemed as if it was so long that I forgot about the beginning. I think it was reptitive to me because I just learned about all this stuff in class and it took a long time to explain something that most students will cover quickly in class.. But if you are looking information about the Revolutionary War it would be an okay source to use but not the best one there is out there. I personally thought it was ok and not fun.

It introduces many of the famous people of the time."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain, an arrogant, annoying brat of a silversmith's apprentice is ruler of the roost (the shop where he works, that is) until a tragic accident cripples his hand, making him unable to continue his trade. He then becomes an outcast of society. Unable to find work, he nearly sinks to theiving, but luckily stumbles upon a printer's assistant named Rab who befriends Johnny and helps him find a job. Rab is an intriguing type of fellow. He was my favorite character in this book, even though he's not the main character.Rab introduces Johnny to a wonderful world of secrecy, excitement, and intrigue with the Sons of Liberty, who are plotting America's independence from the tyrannical British government. Johnny develops into a rather likable sort of chap before the book's end. Such American immortals as Paul Revere, Sam Adams, John Hancock, and Joseph Warren are skillfully interwoven by Forbes into this delightful piece of historical fiction. I highly recommend this book to children around 12 on up but I believe it is just as enjoyable to adults. I am in my 20's and I really enjoy this book still. If you are an American history buff or simply enjoy a good book with an old-fashioned flavor, buy this book and read it."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain is one of the best books I have ever read. It is the story of a fourteen-year-old silversmith's apprentice who is very talented, but a bit proud and arrogant. His life is suddenly completely changed when an accident leaves him with a maimed and useless hand, and he is unable to continue his trade. Johnny eventually befriends and older boy called Rab, and is thrown into the fear and excitement surrounding the Revolution when he begins working for a rebel newspaper, The Boston Observer. Although this is a wonderful and masterfully written book, I thouroughly warn teachers against assigning it to their History or Social Studies class. Kids either really love it, or really despise it, and some parts are a bit dragged out."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Cocky, insecure Johnny Tremain remains on of my favorite fictional people. And his book remains one of my favorite stories. A few reasons why:The characterizations in this book are wonderful. No one is painted in strictly black and white. Even the apparent villains have their good qualities.The setting, as well, is fascinating and well-researched. Esther Forbes did, after all, win a Pulitzer Prize for history. She knew what she was describing and presented it well. The whole book has a great &quot;you-are-there&quot; quality.I first read Johnny Tremain in the sixth grade and must have read it twenty times in a row (mostly skipping the ending, which is sad). Then I got out the encyclopedia and read the article on the American Revolution. Now I'm majoring in history."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This children's book won the 1944 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. It is regarded by many as being a landmark in the development of historical fiction for children and should be on the shelf of any serious student of children's literature. The story centers around a couple of years in the life of a young silversmith apprentice, Johnny Tremain (or, Jonathan Lyte Tremain) in Boston near the start of the American Revolution. At the beginning of the novel, it is 1773 and a fourteen-year-old Johnny, who is very good in his work but is also excessively proud and arrogant, has an accident when working on the Sabbath when a crucible of molten silver breaks. His right hand is severely burned and he feels he can no longer become a silversmith. He begins to roam throughout Boston with despair and finally obtains a job at one of the Boston newspapers. There he comes in contact with some of the early heroes of the revolution: John Hancock, Sam and John Adams, Paul Revere, Dr. Warren, etc. Johnny, and the reader, see the events leading up to the Boston Tea Party in December 1773 and the very start of the Revolutionary War at the Battle of Lexington and Concord in April of 1775. I read this book a second time when I was in my 50s and it is still great to read. And, reading the comments of the other reviewers, it is apparent that most of today's young adults like it as much as I did in the late 1950s. And, it is so much better than the Disney film."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"When I went to read this book for school, my older brother said, &quot;Oh yeah, I read that and it was real good up to the part where he burned his hand, but after that it was real boring.&quot; Well, as usual, I have to disagree with my ignorant brother who totally missed all of the great character development that Johnny goes through as a result of his injury. Reading this book is like having a ringside seat at the opening battle of the Revolutionary War. We studied the American Revolution in Social Studies right after I read Johnny Tremain and I could just picture Rab standing there on the Lexington Green, facing down all those British officers on horseback with that gun he loved so much. Rab was like my brother: always looking for something violent and gross to get involved in. You'll see what happens to him (not that my brother was probably paying attention.) I felt the sorriest for Pumpkin. I think he would have been very happy as an American if he'd only been given the chance. Overall, I'm glad we won the war. I guess we have guys like Rab to thank for that. God bless America!!!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"JOHNNY TREMAIN is not an easy read though it is a worthwhile one. The book was first published in 1943 (think that was during World WarII!) so it may seem a bit dated to the youngest readers but the well realized setting of Revolutionary War era Boston and Johnny's many adventures stand up to time. Forbes writing style is not difficult to follow once the reader or listener is engaged with the story though the vocabulary she uses is quite advanced for a book purported to be at the fifth grade reading level. And the book can be rather detailed especially in regards to some of the finer points of 18th century silversmithing. Yet I despair of the readers who give this a one star review saying it has no plot! The book is extremely rich in plot, characterization, historical detail, adventure etc. Consider it as a read aloud if you are a teacher or parent whose kids just can not \\"get into it\\". They will be pleasantly surprised once they meet Johnny and the other residents of colonial Boston."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Esther Forbes' award-winning novel of a youth caught up in the turmoil of the American Revolution is a timeless classic that today's parents can enjoy again with their kids. Educational as well as entertaining with its portrayal of colonial \\"job training\\" (apprenticeship), the tragedy of Johnny's injury in an era of primitive medicine, the rise of the Minutemen and patriotic fervor, and the valuable relationships between friends. Highly recommend for any age group"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Esther Forbes has written a colorful novel, Johnny Tremain, with fictional and genuine characters with interesting personalities, and a historical plot with slightly amusing twists to it. The book draws you to its beautifully crafted and placed words; alongside the way it makes you feel involved.In Johnny Tremain, a young teenage boy named Johnny Tremain serves as an apprentice to an old silversmith with 2 other useless boys. He becomes arrogant, and bosses the other apprentices around, igniting hatred towards him. He then accidentally burns his hand with hot silver while making a sugar basin and his thumb becomes connected to his palm with silver. He searches for new work, as he cannot work as a silversmith with his crippled hand. He then works for the Silsbees as a newspaper delivery boy, and finds himself at home with them. He also finds himself getting involved with the Revolutionary War and its leaders, and tries to help despite his hand.I think Johnny Tremain is a must read book for both young and old. It will grab your attention as it did mine, and keep it until you finish the book. And even then, you will read it over and over again."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain is a historical book about the Revolutionary War, focusing on a young silversmith named Johnny. Johnathon Lyte Tremain is a slilversmith apprentice to the Lapham family, in Boston Massachussets. He is a cocky young man, and believes that the world revolves around him. He is rude to the Lapham family, who took him in when he was young and believes he is the best silversmith in town. One day, when an order comes into the shop, Johnny is working on it when he has a terrible accident, which leaves his hand crippled from a bad burn. Since he is no longer able to become a silversmith, the Lapham family decides he is no longer worth the keep, and kicks him out. While he is wandering about the streets, Johnny gets into some trouble which scars his name and ruins part of his reputation. Since he is no longer the center of attention, he is left to fend for himself. While strolling through the streets of Boston, he meets a boy named Rab, just a bit older than him. They quickly become friends and Johnny scores a job at the Boston Observer (Rab works there too), (a newspaper printing company). But as the British become more demanding than ever, Johnny and Rab wind up getting involved with the Sons of Liberty, and take part in momentus historical moments. When Rab goes off to fight for the Patriots, Johnny can't help feel lonely without his presence. After a sudden death, Johnny's life will change forever, and at last, his life will feel renewed.I believe that Johnny Tremain was a good book in the sense that it is extremely good for learning history. When you are reading (or at least in my experience), it really feels like you are in Boston during the colonial times. It also had exciting moments that were suspenseful and thrilling. Like times where you might say, \\"ahh! What's going to happen next!\\" But I understand why some of my friends didn't like the book very much. For younger readers it's hard to understand, and at a lot of moments, you might be confused....but overall, in the end the story comes together to make a thrilling novel that deserves a sequel.- Sophia - Grade 5"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"For summer reading, this book wasn't awful, but I have read a lot better. I just finished Johnny Tremain today. Some parts were good, some not so good. I enjoyed the book when it got more into acts such as the Boston Tea Party and the battles. If you have this book for summer reading, just get it over with. Read it all at once. Good for long car trips. Try taking notes. But if you don't HAVE to read it, don't."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I bought this book for my 10 year old son to satisfy a summer reading requirement of a novel about the Colonial era. I tried very hard to get him to read it but when that didn't work I read it myself. I actually liked it quite a lot. But I understand why he won't be interested. There are a number of places where it gets very slow and only mature readers can get through it. We read &quot;Carry on Mr. Bowdicth&quot; aloud last year and he liked that very much. He seems eager to read it again instead of Johnny Tremain."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"The worse thing you can make a kid do is force them to read a novel. Especially if it is 'historical fiction' about the Civil War. So I would recommend parents and teachers to SUGGEST or give this novel to children and not assign it as homework. I read 'Johnny Tremain' when I was in highschool because I knew it was a 'highly recommended' novel and required reading for many middle school English classes. I wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised. It was hard to put the book down. There is a variety of characters who add humor and plot twists to the story. And it moves along at a nice pace. You really care about Johnny Tremain and his friends. His particular story is interwoven excellently with that of important people and events in history. This isn't a book for everyone. But for teens who enjoy reading, and enjoy reading _novels_, not just Christopher Pike and the Sweet Valley Twins, this should be a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"From the WWII era of nearly universal male military service, came a sophisticated brief for patriotic self-sacrifice, aimed at brilliant youth. Johnny Tremain slowly grows from a Prima Donna into an enthusiastic team player. Our own (Whig) leaders are flawed, human. The enemy (British & Loyalists) are human, with sympathetic aspects. Yet the Cause is just and defense of Bostonians is worth Johnny's sacrifices.Rab is Johnny's older role model with young women as with revolutionary patriotism. Steady, persevering, full of inner fire, Rab is all the older brothers and friends who volunteered early in our wars. Johnny is the younger youth inspired to follow as soon as age permits. That Forbes wrote in mid-war cannot be coincidence.Forbes' wise compassion in letting Johnny (and her young readers) experience the death of their Hero in advance of their own first taste of battle is mediated by the kind revolutionary physician Joseph Warren. Readers who research beyond the novel will learn that Dr. Warren himself would die in battle a few weeks later at Bunker Hill. The irony and poignancy of that foreknowledge colored my re-readings as a teenager. Johnny's lot is to be a soldier, not a silversmith, and the first surgery suffices him.Likewise, Forbes' tasteful handling of Johnny's successive sexual attractions to Lavinia Lyte and at last to Cilla, his former pal, shows the superiority of mature love (without preaching). \\"Spinal tingles\\" have their good place, the wise woman writes for boys in an era before the sexual revolution.This is a bildungsroman--novel of youthful formation into adulthood--that never preaches its lessons. Like Huckleberry Finn, it lures with sophisticated subtlety disguised as artless simplicity. Forbes never preaches--but do we learn!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain was an ok book for a couple of reasons. First, i HATE historical fiction! So since it was ok for me it is probably a great book for anyone that likes that sort of thing. It gives great detail and makes you feel like you are Johnny and are there in Boston during the time of revolt. It is about a 14 year old boy living in Boston during the preludes to the revolutionary war and just a tad bit into the Revolutionary War itself. He starts out as a silversmith, an awesome one at that. He is apprenticed to Mr. Lapham, an old almost senile silversmith that in his day was a really great smith But now Johnny pretty much rules the shop even though he is younger than a lot of tht other boys. He is the best, but is very arrogant. One day Mr. Hancock brings the Laphams an enormous assignment, that if done correctly could put the Laphams back on top and Mr. Hancock's sliversmith. He orders his Sugar Basin by Monday Morning early and it is about Thursday. Mr. Lapham does all of the hard stuff that Johnny has not learned yet and Johnny does the rest. By Saturday night they were almost done, except for the handles. Though Mr. Lapham is very religious and forbids work on the Basin past dark. So the next day, while Mr. Lapham is gone to church, the whole household works on the basin. Though because Johnny is so good and arroganthe has earned some enemies in the House, namely Dove. When Johnny asks for a mold. Dove hands him one with a minute crack, hoping that the silver will leak a little and cause the handle to have a minute blemish to teach Johnny a lesson. But to Dove and everyone elses surprise the mold explodes and the hot silver burns Johnny's hand. His thumb grows together with his forefinger and he can no longer be a silversmith. He goes in search of other work. When he finds Rab. A printer and a Son of Liberty. Johnny joins the revolt and is in for a world of adventure."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I teach sixth grade students who know little of the Revolutionary era. Johnny Tremain is an ideal way to teach literature and history as a unit since Esther Forbes has woven accurate historical facts within a captivating story.Dolores Crouch / Los Altos, California"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I read this book in school. It provides a lot of information about what causes the Revolutionary War, but does not explain much about what happens during the Revolutionary War. It shows a young boys (Johnny Tremain) journey through Boston as certain circumstances make him change courier paths. This story is okay. It is not that exciting but if you like history you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I love this story. To all of the people who can't understand this story, don't write bad reviews about it. I think I could recomend this book to anyone who loves historical fiction or nonfiction. This book shows me that you shouldn't give up even if everything gives up on you. You should not give in to defeat, but pull yourself out of the depths and keep trying to live a great life. Johnny burns his hand making a sugar basin handle for American Patriot, John Hancock, on Sabbath Day, which was breaking the law and working on that day. The Laphams did not enjoy his presence so he went to Mr. Lyte. When Mr. Lyte has him arrested for theft of the cup Johnny really owns. In trial, Precilla Lapham testifys because she has seen the cup before the date Mr. Lyte said it was stolen. Johnny is proven innocent but tries to sell the cup to Lyte. Lyte takes it and gets his poor relative, Sewall, to think Johnny came to give it back. He threatens to send Johnny to Guadalope but Johnny runs out and is faster than them all. He goes to the Boston Observer and stays there with a boy a few years older, named Rab. That's about half. If you want to know what else happens, read the Newberry Award-Winning Novel, Johnny Tremain by Ester Forbes."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain is a beautifully written classic novel about a young apprentice that struggles to live in colonial Boston during the time of the American Revolution. The author, Esther Forbes is a historian and the novel is based off of historical facts and events. Louise Cowan would probably identify Johnny Tremain as a classical novel because Forbes displays her characters in a way that highlights their humanely ways, both positive and negative. Forbes creates a plot in which the main character discovers himself and grows from a proud young boy to a strong and humble man.Louise Cowan would probably describe Jonathan Lyte Tremain as a very complex character due to his lack of respect towards some and his great humility towards others. Johnny's character started out as a proud fourteen year old boy who worked as an apprentice for a skilled silversmith and ended as a humble and brave sixteen year old who sets off to fight in the American revolutionary war. A good example of how proud Johnny was as a fourteen year old is on page ten of the book when Priscilla Lapham, Johnny's friend and the granddaughter of Johnny's master says, \\"When the meek inherit the earth, I doubt Johnny gets as much as one divot of sod.\\" As Johnny grew older, he became more determined with everything he did. In the last chapter of the book, he decided to have surgery done on his right hand without any medication and with no one to hold his hand down but him, all so that he could hold a gun to fight in a war. Johnny was also always very intelligent. When he worked for Samuel Adams, James Otis, and John Hancock, he picked up information about what the British would do next from his sluggish friend Dove, who was working in a British stable at the time. Johnny Tremain had wonderful characteristics that grew so much during the two years before the revolutionary war.Johnny Tremain had values too. He valued the ability he had to use his hands in his craft and he looked down on people with lower- class work. This can be proven by his first meeting with Rab, his best friend. When Johnny first walked into the small printing shop of the Boston Observer, he saw Rab sitting there, taking notes for a newspaper piece advertising a lost pig. When the lady whose pig was lost finally left after confiding her sorrow for her animal in Rab, Johnny felt like he could confide in Rab also, even though he didn't even know Rab and he had no idea if Rab even cared. After Johnny had told him about how he had lost his job and was looking for a new one, Rab suggested that Johnny look around Hancock's Wharf ,but Johnny refused to do work that didn't involve much talent or skill such as he had had in his silversmith apprenticeship. One other thing that Johnny valued was the freedom of all men. A good example of this is on page 241 when he said, \\"We are fighting, partly, for just that, because a man is a private is no reason he should be treated like cordwood.\\"Johnny Tremain is definitely something that Louise Cowan would call a classic. She would say that Esther Forbes creates a world like ours, where life is many- sided and the people have good and bad sides to them, a world where people grow and fall, a world where life and death exist together, and where people can be good to one person and bad to another in one moment. Johnny Tremain takes its place among the many classics that I have read as a favorite."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"The time I laid eyes on the book Johnny Tremain I didn't know what to expect I thought it might be long and boring. As I read so many events happened that kept my interest, it was like no other book I've ever read before. It is a book that describes real life situations even as relating to today. The things people will do for money or rights for themselves. The conflict for taxes also that we have today. It is based in Boston at the beginning of the Revolutionary War.Merchant Lyte tried to buy the cup from Johnny. But they argued about whose cup it really was. Then the merchant told Johnny to describe the cups details. For Johnny the cup had significant meaning from his past. It represented a powerful and wealthy family and his only connection to the Lyte family.I would think it would be Johnny's cup because he made the cup. After that Johnny didn't have a safe place to put the cup but then he realized he didn't have any clothes, food nor any money. He thought if he sold the cup it would be worth 4 pounds of old silver. He seen later that the cup matched the others and it could then be worth 20 pounds of old silver. Unfortunately he didn't sell the cup instead he put the cup back in the bag but then Mr. Lapham snatched the cup with his quick fingers and said you stole this beautiful cup and told him I'll see you at court.Everyone thought Johnny stole some shoes. But Johnny bought the shoes with his own money from the silversmith job. Although he told everyone no one believed him.But since Mrs. Lyte caught him she got the sheriff. And the sheriff put shackles on Johnny and walked to the jail cell but they said nothing to each other the whole walk to the jail cell. Then when they finally got to the jail cell the sheriff asked Johnny does he have any family or friends that can cover him in court but Johnny answered Rab the sheriff asked isn't that the kid you took the coat from. Johnny didn't answer. Johnny slept well on the tiny hay bed.Sadly soon Rab died. During the first gunshots of the Revolutionary War. The British killed him before he could use the musket Johnny gave him. Rab was Johnny's friend. He would be by Johnny everyday even when Johnny needed him most. But he wasn't able to be by Johnny when he died.Rab was at Dr.Warren's house when he died. But Johnny wasn't able to get there in time to see Rab's last moments of living. Johnny slept at Dr. Warren's house and went to a town nearby.In Boston, Massachusetts,1775 British soldiers were on every corner. You see men in stockings and pants ending at their knees. Grocers, pubs and the printer. Cats in malt houses, Granaries and mansions everywhere. In stables horses were shaking their halters and whining. Sleepy women and sleepier children waking up to work. Young women swept. Streets were busy. The cocks in Boston backyards had cried long before the day came. On rocky Islands gulls woke. Fiery furnace awaited their silversmith users. Everyone worked from people along with children to animals.The British were taking too many taxes and the colonist didn't like that. So that led to the Revolutionary War. In the Battle of Lexington the colonist had 70 men when the British had 700 it was basically target practice, an unfair battle indeed. But they still had the Battle of Concord.The colonists won the Battle of Concord and became independent by separating from the British. After they won the battle of Concord. And the Battle went on for several more years. One of the strategies they used to win the war was 1 by land two by sea. And that meant 1 lantern the British are going to travel on land and 2 lanterns meant the British are traveling by sea."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I was 12 when I first read Johnny Tremain, it had about 300 and some pages and I read it in 3 days.

In 1943, when it was published and received the Newbery Medal, it was undoubtedly popular with young teenage boys. I recommend it only for adults and YA's who enjoy history.

I loved this book! After a terrible accident, Jonathan Lyte Tremain can never do the handiwork required of a silversmith again, so he sets off in search of a new place for himself. He finds it at a printers shop along with adventure and excitement. Johnny uncovers some interesting information of his mysterious past, learns that pride comes before the fall and about friendship, and plays a huge roll in the patriotic movement. I definately recomend this book--after reading it I was tempted to start right over again!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This book is often viewed with contempt by younger readers who happen to have it as assigned reading for school. Read for pleasure though and the book is not too bad. I really enjoyed the book's descriptions of Boston and the activities of the Whigs. The story of the lead character also gives an interesting glimpse into the life of apprentice workers during the pre-Revolution. This novel also does well with historical accuracy considering that it is written for younger readers and that much of the best research on the American Revolution wasn't available on a wide scale till after 1975. The historical backdrop for the story contributes greatly to the reader's interest as well. I recommend this book as an interesting read and for good entertainment value."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I use this book as a novel study with my fifth grade students, and every year it is a favorite. The kids get so emotionally involved in Johnny's world, and they come to see the important figures of the Revolution (Paul Revere, Sam Adams, James Otis, etc.) as their personal friends, not just names in a Social Studies book. This year I took my class on a trip to Boston, and they were thrilled to see the places Johnny saw. The book is challenging reading, but it is worth the effort."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I enjoyed this book. At first it's boring but when you get into it you just can't put it down!

Here is the honest truth about Johnny...The book can be dull at times. It can be really really really dull, but what is imporant is that you wade through the dull parts to get to the drama! There is plenty of DRAMA!This is a moving, well-written story about a young boy in a turbulent time in history, his role in the war and his eventual self discovery. Some moments in Johnny's life are simply...REMARKABLE! Some moments are tear jerking, heartfelt and inspiring!It is a question of wether or not you want to read all the borning junk in between. i would recommend reading this story, but be prepared for boredom.

The story starts out slow, but then starts to progress. My favorite character in the book is Johnny Tremain because he reminds me a lot of myself. He is a boy about my age that I can relate to in many ways. The setting of the story is just before the Revolutionary War. Almost all of Johnny's actions and decisions are related to the setting. Johnny participates in the Boston Tea party which was a main factor in how the war started. I recommend this book for kids who are in sixth or seventh grade.

Johnny is the apprentice to a silversmith and lives with the family. In the family there is one of the daughters named Cilla. Her mom wants them to marry. Johnny is very rude and snotty.He treats everybody around him like trash. He thinks he is \\"all that and a bag of chips.\\" But one day, all of this completely changes when he burns his hand making a sugar basin. His hand is useless and so is he. Now for a change everyone treats him like trash. This makes Johnny very humble. And he doesn't act like a snotty, rude brat. Then the mom of the house, Mrs. Lapham kicks him out. Now he can never pursue his dream of being a silversmith. So, he looks for another job that he can actually do. He finds a job at the Boston Observer, a newspaper business, and creates a new friend named Rab.(Isn't this boring.) Their family are patriots. They have secret, Sons of Liberty meetings at their shop. He helps them out by spying on the British. This is how Johnny got into the political beeswax. The book just goes on like this. I thought this book was going to be filled with fury and excitement because it's at the Revolutionary War time but it was a super bad book. It was just plain BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

He lives with the Laphams, and he does not like Dove or Dusty. Dove and Dusty are the two kids who live there. Johnny works for Mr. Lapham as a silversmith, but when Johnny has a horrible accident using the hot silver, he can't do his job anymore. He goes searching around for a new job, but is troubled finding one. Not to spoil anything, but at the end, Johnny gets his hand fixed (I think). The whole book is so confusing that I don't really even know.I did not understand the part about Johnny getting his hand fixed, because of the explanation of where they were throughout the book. Same with a couple other parts such as, Johnny \\"falling in love\\" with Goblin at some stables that I did not know of, and when Johnny got the bunch of money and was spending it and walking through the towns (I think). In conclusion, I don't think this was the right book for me, but it was a well written book with a lot of potential."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johhny Tremain? Bo-ring! Set back in the 1770s, about the time of the Boston Tea Party and the Revolutionary War. Johnny Tremain is a 14 year old silversmith that receives an unfortunate burn that cripples his hand. He cannot work as a silversmith for the Lapham's so he starts to work for another family and gets wrapped up with the war. Before he was burnt Johnny reveals his family secret to Cilla Lapham, who Mrs Lapham wants Johnny to marry. Before Johnny's mother died she revealed that he was related to a wealthy Boston merchant named Jonathan Lyte. She also gave him a silver cup featuring the Lyte coat of arms but told him to not make contact with them unless he became desperate. But that only gave him more trouble with Mr. Lyte himself. When he moves from the Lapham's he starts to work with a boy named Rab. Rab is a bit older than Johnny and is willing to fight. He does just that one night leaving Johnny mad and betrayed. Basically this book is about the war, which was a very big problem. But in the end Johnny understands what he needs to do and also understands he needs a fresh start. He knows he needs to forget about Lavinia Lyte adopting Isannah Lapham because of her beauty and stealing her from Cilla, he is going to forget about his crippled hand. He is going to look to the future and forget about some very unfortunate deaths regarding his mother, someone that wanted another life that was executed, and a very good friend. Now it may seem the book is interesting. But it drags on and on and on until you are so uninterested you don't understand what is happening. Sure, it does teach you some good history, but if you want a good book it needs to captivate the reader's attention. That's just my opinion."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This book was so boring i fell asleep every other pagealso there are other good historical fiction books out thereand ones about the civil war or w/ethis book is so incredibly tedious that if i had to read it in one sitting i would diedo not make your students read this they will try their best to skip reading itbelieve me my class was forced to do a literary curve and everybody went online and cheated because they read most of the book and found it so boringplease have a heart, and don't make your students sufferPLEAsEPLEASEnobody cares its a \\"good reading tool\\" if you want people to be encouraged to read don't make them sit through the boringest book ever writtenjust listen to me and rethink getting thisHAVE A HEARTi am afraid if i am forced to read something this boring again i will die of boredom"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Not only was this book totally boring, it seemed like everything terrible happened to Johnny.

When Johnny injures his hand he is rudely thrown away because he is of no use to the family anymore. After a long search, he finds a place to live at the Boston Observer just as the war begins.

Personally I much prefer George Guidall's narration (from Recorded [...]); I think that it is a more dynamic and enjoyable recording. However, if you are looking for a basic recording of Johnny Tremain and don't want to spend a fortune, these CDs certainly do the job."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This novel is severely underappreciated because of its standing as a \\"kid's book.\\" I first read Johnny Tremain more than a decade ago in elementary school, and I've read it at least once a year, every year, since.If there is one complaint that I do not understand when reading negative reviews, it is the claim that these characters are 'flat'. They are anything but. I'd even venture to say that Johnny is one of the most well-written characters in literature. Forbes writes Johnny so that he grows and matures as the novel progresses, without shoving it in the reader's face. His transformation is subtle; unlike many writers, Forbes doesn't spell out every little detail for the reader, and thank goodness for that. She trusts that her audience is smart enough to see how Johnny changes. This reason alone may be why so many kids despise J.T. They want it spelled out for them, otherwise, they don't (can't?) understand.As for the plot, it's tight (and I don't mean \\"cool\\"). So many times you read a novel and wonder where it's headed. More often than not, authors seem to throw in the towel at numerous points, as though they've gotten themselves backed into a corner, either because of poor execution of the storyline, or because their story becomes too complex and they get flustered. Not the case here- Forbes knew her beginning, middle and end, down to the very last sentence. Every word has meaning, every storyline makes sense, every character is significant.This is one of my top three novels of all time, so I admit I am biased. But I encourage anyone who hasn't read it to do so. It's a quick read, but it's an impressive one. There are only two books I think are practically flawless: Johnny Tremain and The Count of Monte Cristo. Both are outstanding, not just because of the plot (TCoMC is far superior, in my opinion, to every other book), but because of the characters."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Many are already familiar with the story of \\"Johnny Tremain\\", either through the book or the Disney movie. It is worth reading whether you have read it before or not. I have recently read it for about the fourth time. It is, of course, the story of the silversmith's apprentice, Johnny Tremain ,who becomes involved in the events leading up to the Boston Tea Party and culminating in the battles of Lexington and Concord. Through Johnny's eyes we see Paul Revere, Samuel Adams and Dr. Warren. We also get a glimpse into the world of Eighteenth Century Boston with its merchants and apprentices, landmarks and social conditions. The story is enhanced as we watch sixteen year old Johnny form his standards of right and wrong, feel out his relationships with girls and, under the tutelage of his new friend Rab, enter the world of men. We also see Johnny mature as he comes to know himself.\\"Johnny Tremain\\" received the John Newberry Medal for excellence in Children's Literature. This speaks to its quality, but does not indicate a limitation on its appeal. It is an excellent book for teenagers, but should not be ignored by adults either. I have read and re-read it repeatedly and never tire of it. It is an excellent book to read before a trip to Boston because so many of the places you will visit as you walk the Freedom Trail and the persons referred to along its cobblestones are included in this book. It will help you to a deeper understanding of the Freedom Trail and the role of Boston in the Revolution. Whether you are going to Boston or not, do not miss \\"Johnny Tremain\\"."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I suppose I had read other history books before I read this book at age 12. However, this is the book that hooked me on history.Our media, books, television, films, are full of the American Revolution and its heroes and heroines now, but back in 1952, things were pretty quiet on the American History front. We were making our own history with WWII, the Marshall Plan, the Korean Conflict, the red scare et al. In spite of all that, this book set me on fire. I wanted to know more about the foundations of our country, and I went on to read everything I could set my hands to. I am still doing it, but that is another story.\\"Johnny Tremain\\" is still a wonderful book. It tells the story of a teenaged apprentice who learns the hard way what is his real value to his country.
