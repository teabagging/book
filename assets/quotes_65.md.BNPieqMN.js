But it is a very good one, and shows how William Styron, even in his youth was a talented and perceptive writer. This novel begins with the death of Peyton Loftis, and goes back in time to follow her childhood and coming of age, as well as her eventual marriage, until her death. We see these pictures through the alternating points of view mostly of her father and mother, but also of some other characters, and learn how her death was inextricably related to the slow attrition caused by stubborness, jealousy, and hate that tears apart her family. Darkness is everywhere in the novel, taking the form of guilt and personal failures that corrode the hearts of each character and make inevitable Peyton's tragic end. Indeed the predetermination is all the more evident, since we know from the very beginning that she has died.Although Sophie's Choice shows how much more polished (and more thoughtful too, perhaps) he has become as a writer, Styron's writing is beautiful, as are the characters and the story. This may not be a necessary read, and the beginning may be slow, but it was well worth my time."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"made me grateful about those long, boring afternoons spent in learning English!I just read all the reviews: Some were written by real experts. But some of them depict this novel as \\"too long\\" (I WISHED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER!\\")\\"boring\\" (This lady is far of understanding any book:This book is a living proof of the geniality of Styron : He is capable of describing the most shining and also the most heinous feelings of a character. Styron strips the characters and drive us to watch them as they really are.This is one of the most soul tearing book ever...and the argument is unique, BRUTAL, TERRIFYNG and BEATIFUL1"},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"I first read \\"Lie Down in Darkness,\\" Styron's first book, when I was barely 20. In that first reading, I identified passionately with Peyton Loftis, the daughter who cannot survive her father's obsession or her mother's hatred. I saw Peyton as a free spirit, albeit spoiled, trapped in a South I knew only from reading Carson McCullers, Flannery O'Connor and Tennessee Williams. Re-reading the book nearly 50 years later, I understand better that her parents are trapped too, unable to cope with their failed expectations and their own desperate need to be loved.Make no mistake about it, this is a story of alcoholism and mental illness born of both nature and nurture. As we learn from Styron's writings about depression, and from his daughter's recent memoir, so many of the images in this book come from his own struggles through childhood and adolescence. Styron's mother was chronically ill and died when he was very young, replaced by an almost stereotypical \\"evil stepmother\\" who becomes a model for Helen Loftis. As Milton Loftis lurches from one tragic drunken event to another, Styron takes us inside his head so compellingly that you're convinced he has been there himself - and he has.And yet, in a novel that is painfully depressing, the words and the images they summon are excruciatingly beautiful: Every foot of an incoming tide, every flower blooming or wilting, every tacky mile of the Virginia Tidewater region, even Peyton's delusional reveries about flightless birds. Some elements of the book may appear outdated and no longer politically correct: for example, characterizations and descriptions of the African American community. But Styron cannot lie about the time (the 1930s and 1940s) or the place. You can hear it, feel it, smell it, taste it - good and bad.\\"Sophie's Choice\\" and \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\" brought Styron fame and fortune, but it is this first book that established him as one of the great American writers. \\"Lie Down in Darkness\\" will haunt you forever."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"William Styron produced Lie Down in Darkness when he was twenty-five. Published in 1951, it gained immediate critical acclaim. To read it with Styron's age in mind is to realize the meaning of literary genius. His powers of description are ridiculous and his insight into human nature belies his youth. He tells the story of a star-crossed WWII-era family of his native Tidewater area of Virginia which devolves inexorably to its demise. Replete with Southern gentility, the tale wends its way through relationships, psyches, and social conventions of the day. If you read fiction only rarely, as I do, this may change that habit for you."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a dramatic page-turner that is written like poetry, but is easy to relate to, and will stay with you long after its completion. Lie Down in Darkness represents a darkness farbeyond death.FULL REVIEW:[...]"},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"Overall I liked this book but I thought it began to drag towards the end. It became really repetitive and just wanted Peyton to throw herself out that window just to make the novel stop. Ugh. Styron's talent for vivid description is amazing and he gets all the characters right. But it just begins to plod along and I had to force myself through the last third of the book. Still, definitely worth the time to read."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"William Styron's first novel is often overlooked because \\"Sophie's Choice\\" is, without doubt, his flagship; however, his style in \\"Lie Down in Darkness\\" is as melancholy and forceful as it was in each of his subsequent novels. No reader can leave these pages unmoved by the depth of suffering, both self-imposed and due to other forces, of its principal characters. The family unit is rife with undercurrents and has no opportunity to become functional because the parents are so deeply enthralled with their own problems. I disliked Helen the most. Her passive aggressive martyrdom fueled her husband's neuroses and alcoholism until their relationship became Faulknerian in its dysfunction. Styron's well-known bouts of depression obviously inspired much of the insights into mental illness. The pain of these characters is palpable throughout the book, and I find myself thinking about this family more than I would like."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"\\"Lie Down in Darkness\\" is one of a group of books the novelist Richard Yates recommended to his writing classes at the University of Iowa and elsewhere. I copied the entire list from Blake Bailey's excellent 2003 Yates biography and have been using it as a means of re-entry into fiction-reading after a very long absence.What makes this book a considerable achievement, for me, is its structure, the way it plays with time, lurching forward as unsteadily as the funeral procession that is the book's core event, and telling its story along the way. The stream-of-consciousness suicide narrative near the end is richly imagined and convincing.I found the ending itself--which asserts that humble black people have more wisdom about life, love and forgiveness than the privileged whites who control their world--obvious and patronizing. Perhaps I'd have thought otherwise if I'd read it when \\"Lie Down in Darkness\\" was first published, in 1951.I'm very glad I followed Yates's recommendation."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"I think it was interesting how Styron dedicated the final 10 pages of a 400-page book to a baptism of the minor characters. But in doing so, he draws a contrast between the impotence of Carey Carr and the spiritual bankruptcy of Helen Loftis and the power of Daddy Faith to inspire Ella and a faith community. Carr's ministrations fail to save Helen from her own guilt and self-loathing, which ultimately destroy her marriage and her daughter. On the other hand, Ella supports the Loftis family throughout the book, even if it is in a servile role, and at the end safeguards a stranger, Doris, who has strayed from her mother during the baptism. I couldn't help but think that the tragedy that befalls Peyton would not have occurred had she been Ella's daughter. A larger theme could be that the spiritual community in which Ella belonged is an antidote to the nihilism that pervaded the Loftis' world."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"A startlingly beautiful telling of intimate personal destruction. Styron's ability to fill the reader with both love and revulsion for his charcters in this novel is a marvel."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"Although Styron has been influenced by classic novelists such as Faulkner and Joyce, he has improved upon that from which he has borrowed. He has raised the standards of classic literature.Styron's language is of the most beautiful I have ever read. His prose is often poetic and melodic. Furthermore, his characterization, namely of Peyton, is especially well-developed.Lie Down in Darkness, like Styron's other novels, is a work of art."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"William Styron creates some impressively tragic and melancholic situations for his fatally flawed characters. Their lives have a way of permeating your dreams after you enter Styron's world. A fine example of this is Sophie's Choice.The problem I had with Lie Down in Darkness is that the situation is overly dramatic. While I can understand Sophie, I cannot accept Peyton's insanity. Styron attempts to attribute Peyton's descent into madness to her childhood, and her experiences with her mother, which albeit unhappy, cannot plausibly be used as an explanation for the tragedy that ensues. The style is sophisticated, and the imagery and symbolism of birds as death omens create a forbodding presence throughout the novel.While the style is sophisticated, I didn't find the journey enjoyable because there were parts that felt tedious and long-winded. Mostly, it is just a depressing novel, with every familial milestone that should be joyous - such as a wedding, or Christmas celebrations - marred by a doomsday feel. You know that Helen will find some way to quarrel with her husband or Peyton and that the repercussions will resound throughout the entire novel, which feels like a lifetime.Novels about sorrow and lost can be enlightening and enjoyable. However, this novel requires stamina because it is very long. You sink into a stiffling world for the duration of the novel and you won't necessarily come out of it feeling rewarded."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"As a huge fan of Sophie's Choice, I decided to try this one. It may be &#34;great art&#34; since the critics all love it but it shouldn't be this difficult to read a book. Virtually no characters are likable. The story is totally depressing and repetitive. I almost didn't finish it but at some point decided to go down with the ship. Probably won't read another Styron."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"I'm not sure if it's the translation from book to Kindle, or the writing itself, but all I can say about this book is that it rambled on and on. It felt disjointed and did not flow at all. Not a fan."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"if you search by title for this novel there is an edition of the book in pbk that will not be found.

Oh Lordy, no."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"What is the deal with this new modernist style of writing. Everything is so ambiguous, and the plotline is very vague. I like real classics, not this modernist trash. This book was awful."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"Lie Down In Darkness, Styron's first novel, published when he was just 22, is a masterpiece of psychological realism and storytelling in the Southern Gothic tradition of Faulkner, Eudora Welty, and Flannery O'Conner. That it was created by such a young mind is testament to the author's genius; that it has yet to be rivaled as a stirring, oftentimes painful and disturbing portrait of a doomed family, is testament to the writing. Composed with thick, purposeful prose, heavy on similie, metaphor and description, the novel charts the rise and fall of the Loftis Family, an archetypal rendering of the Soutnern Gentry. We follow the tragic downfall of Milton, the drunken patriarch, Ellen, the frigid mother, and the two Loftis daughters, one born perfect, one born crippled. It is a novel of abundant ontological truth, which will reach in and strangle the unconscious sensibilities of almost any reader, regardless of background or predispotition. The novel's beauty ranks with the prose of Lawrence, the passion of Rimbaud and Kundera, the depth and spiritual metaphysics of Doestoyevsky; It is both story and case study. And ultimately we are shepherded through tragedy after tragedy into the climax--the suicide of the immeasurably beautiful and desired Peyton Loftis--as we walk moment to moment with her, peering inside the poisoned stream of consciousness that overwhelms and eventually claims her. Lie Down In Darkness belongs in the canon of Great American Masterpieces. It's significance has only begun to be understood."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"William Styron is likely the greatest novelist no one has ever heard of. His name is even less recognizable than Faulkner's, or other great American writers: Steinbeck, Hemingway, etc. And yet, in my opinion, his works are far superior. With only four novels to choose from out of his career he has made it very difficult for himself to be regarded in those terms, but he has still achieved a wide amount of critical acclaim, with a Pulitzer Prize and an American Book Award to his credit.His novels are not light novels. They are not coffee table books, but a rather serious discussions on moral issues written with an eloquence that is unmatched in modern writing.Lie Down in Darkness is his first novel, and is much like what I have just said. As a first novel it is necessarily experimental, although the effect of this experimentation is at times hard to tell.Following through flashback the trials of one Virginia family on the day of their daughter's funeral, Lie Down in Darkness leads up to the present, describing in tragic terms how the family has come apart and where it is now.This is great writing, some of the best writing I have ever read, as realistic as any Dickens novel, and as engaging as anything by Baldwin.It is not a happy book, but it is the best book I have read about the American family, far greater and relevant than anything I have read by Morrison."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"William Styron, in Lie Down in Darkness, tells the story of Peyton Loftis, the beautiful daughter of Helen and Milton Loftis, her ultimate suicide, and her family's contribution to her fate. Sad, yet compelling. As I read, my revulsion for the characters grew line by line, for they are wasted, empty, and they drown themselves in a swamp of despair and impotency. Helen is a vindictive, jealous mother who takes painful jabs at anyone in her path; Milton is an incestuous alcoholic who can't own up to his failures and who is stuck in a sort of paralyzed stupor; and Peyton, well, she is a genetic carryover of her parents-from her mother she learns revenge, and from her father, alcoholism.The story is one of severe despondency, a portrait of lives that have lost their savor and are headed toward destruction. Of all the characters in the story, the Negro house servants come forth as the strongest. They have a spiritual strength that contrasts strongly with that of the Loftis.' The overwhelmingly best quality of the book, I believe, is the beauty of the prose. It's like an epic poem, lyrical and dramatic and sweepingly colorful. And, believe it or not, I actually enjoyed Peyton's stream-of-consciousness marathon just before she killed herself. Styron made it enjoyable and I will always remember the flightless birds and how they follow Peyton all over New York and also the $39.95 clock that Peyton perceives as her refuge from the evil world. Is this what mental illness is really like? This book is certainly one to be read again."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"Never have I wanted to pound some sense into fictional characters as when I read William Styron's Lie Down in Darkness. The Loftiss family saga is sometimes hard to read because they hurt each other so easily and so often. But Styron's language is beautiful, and his understanding of the characters is deep. The account of Peyton's last day is especially heartbreaking and revealing. In short, this novel is one of my favorites simply because of its account of human frailty and the amazing way in which the story is told. Styron is one of the best."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"I recently managed to make it all the way through Sophie's Choice, a book I had attempted to read in college and hadn't had the maturity to finish. I loved it on my recent read so I thought I should return to Lie Down in Darkness, another book I hadn't been able to complete.This is a very good, if not great, novel. It is also very depressing. I remember it being so depressing that I just couldn't get through it the first time (and my memory was good). All the same, the writing is beautiful and the characterizations clear and sad. In a sense, this novel is a lyrical essay on Tolstoy's quote about unhappy families from Anna Karenina: \\"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\\"The novel opens on Peyton Loftis' body returning to her family on the train from New York after her suicide. Styron ranges back and forth in time and point of view throughout the novel in presenting the causes of Peyton's depression and suicide.Peyton Loftis is the template for a particular kind of doomed Southern girl - beautiful with Daddy issues and a dozen bad habits, the kind of girl certain kinds of boys fall in love with but never marry. She is in some ways a very old-fashioned character - very much of her own generation. Reading her will make you grateful that our mothers' generation fought the feminist battles and gave us options beyond attending Sweet Briar and marrying the first fraternity boy that crossed our path. I think it's a wonder more intelligent and creative women didn't cut their own throats in the public square out of sheer boredom.I'd like to say that all the changes in the status of women in the last 50 or so years have made the Peyton Loftises of the world obsolete, but that would be untrue. There are still plenty of boxes for both women and men to be confined to and political and societal change don't necessarily eliminate them.I'm glad I made it through this one this time. It is, as I said, a good novel. I can strongly relate to all the flavors of despair that Styron depicts and truly felt the presence of his own depression throughout the novel. Styron is wonderfully flamboyant with language and character, even when weighed down with his own demons."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"Before I read the novel Lie Down in Darkess, I read commentary which said that Merle Miller, a noted critic of the time, could not finish the last eighty pages because of beautiful and doomed tragedy of it all. The day I finished Styron's Lie Down in Darkess, it occurred to me that I should stop writing because none of my prose would ever be this amazingly poetic.Lie Down in Darkess is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read. Milton Loftis, the main character, is not a protagonist because he is not our hero, although we certainly spend time hoping that he might find a middle ground between his shrewish wife, his alcoholic excesses and the heartbreak of his feelings for his oldest daughter Peyton. Milton Loftis is a man trapped in a Greek tragedy who blunders on every day, balancing his illusions and hoping for the best, although he, and we, the readers, see the foreboding clouds which spell certain doom from the beginning of the book.Helen, the bitter, hypocritical wife, clothes herself in the self righteous delusions of religiosity and spends most of her energy with the mentally incapacitated daughter Maudie. She pretends that Milton is a profligate sinner and adulterer who has made it his life's work to torture her, ignoring that her icy civility and the obvious hatred of her own daughter has been the prod to his loveless and licentious life style. Milton Loftis finds some modicum of hope in his sad affair with Dolly Bonner, but that and whisky are only ways to escape an insufferable existence he cannot escape and cannot understand. He is not weak enough to die, and he is not strong enough to flee.Admittedly, I am a stylist of the Faulknerian, Reynolds Price persuasion, so I found the haunting beauty of this novel enough to recommend it to other readers. I understand that is my bias, but I stand by that verdict. The more people who read this great book, the more awareness of life's inexorable twists, and, hopefully, the more aware we become of the pain of others, and the more committed we become to tolerance and forgiveness."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"This long, wending, fatiguing, frustrating novel is one of those rare books that are so suffused with suffering and tragedy that the reader, if s/he is the sort of \\"deep\\" reader, as I imagine most prospective readers of this book are, will not emerge from reading it without suffering and trauma themselves. In particular, the character of Helen Loftis, whom Styron seems to have drug up from the depths of Hell, has such depraved and hateful intricacies in her soul, which Styron never ceases to plumb to their core, that this reader at least, breathed a long sigh of relief upon finishing the book and knowing that I wouldn't have to read about her anymore. She makes Lady Macbeth seem an ideal candidate for sainthood. All of this invites the question of whether a book that causes the reader to suffer is worth the read. To this, I don't have a pat answer.Yes, the poetic prose is beautiful and haunting. But so is that of Faulkner and Thomas Wolfe and Proust and Lowry and, more recently, John Banville. I'm not sure I would recommend this book before these, or even with these. A book which causes the reader to suffer is a unique experience in my long acquaintance with literature.I've not much else to say here, save to let the novel speak for itself, to let the prospective reader know what s/he is in for:\\"...a song of measureless innocence that echoed among lost ruined temples of peace and brought to their dreams an impossible vision: of a love that outlasted time and dwelt even in the night, beyond the reach of death and all the immemorial, descending dusks. Then evening came. Arms and legs asprawl, they stirred and turned. Twilight fell over their bodies. They were painted with fire, like those fallen children who live and breathe and soundlessly scream, and whose souls blaze forever.\\" Last paragraph of Chapter 5, pg. 225, in my edition.Pretty love scene...No? One comes away from this book feeling that one is emerging from a Hell of Styron's own devising full of characters whose souls blaze forever in its bowels."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"Reading Lie Down in Darkness fifty years after its publication, it still resonates with narrative power and graceful prose. But now with such distance one sees so clearly how much it owes to, among others, The Sound and the Fury and Ulysses--and by that comparison, how it has fails to renew itself with time, unlike those two books. Styron's book, while beautiful and wonderful, has not made the short-list of immortality, because it belongs to a fixed time. It is a work of amazing grace, fluidity, and power; it is a classic of a time when the bomb had just dropped, and when humanity was emerging from two wars with a great hope of solving its woes. The narrative struggles to make sense of all the madness and nihilism, the faith and sanity of that time, and as such Lie Down in Darkness's ambition and grace make it worthwhile reading for those dedicated to literature and beauty and understanding--understanding, that is, where we come from and, perhaps, where we are going. Will this work endure forever? No; it has its limits and its bounds, and already perhaps there are books that better capture the pervasive spiritus mundi, sorrow. But what does endure forever, after all? Daddy Faith might say belief. The example of Peyton Loftis seems to disagree."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"How this novel has only garnered 14 reviews on Amazon is beyond me. This is one of the great American novels of the 20th century and is a \\"must read\\" for any student of letters, for any aspiring novelist. Styron's style is poetic and majestic; the novel is a beautiful read. It is a joy to read. Every page reveals new wonders and delicate crafting of the English language."},{"Title":"Lie down in darkness","review":"This book was required reading in one of my college classes years ago: not this very edition, but the novel \\"Lie Down in Darkness.\\" I remember Peyton Loftis: I have never forgotten her. Styron's depiction of her life and suicide is beautifully written. We see that Peyton has been raised by selfish, self-hating, destructive parents who inflicted their tortured views onto the children they never should have had. The entire time I was reading the novel, I kept wanting Peyton to somehow \\"win\\" -- to assert herself, to want to live. But I sensed that the opposite would happen: Styron is a master at making us see and feel the inevitable.Although I think this novel was beautifully written and true to its characters, I will also say that I have never had a desire to re-read it. It's not as universal as, say, Faulkner's novels, which I've read several times. There is something so specific about the people and setting depicted in \\"Lie Down in Darkness\\" that I forever think of it as a book that walks down a very narrow lane -- a lane so exact you will never forget it, but also so dark and uncomfortable that you will never go there again."},{"Title":"Western Civilizations: Their History and Their Culture","review":"I picked up Vol. 2 at a yard sale and they didn't have Vol.1, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon."},{"Title":"Trouble with Trolls","review":"Treva lives on the slopes of Mount Baldy.

This one is fabulous. Treva is smart, creative, courageous, loving, strong, competent and clever. This is exactly the kind of child that we would want our 2 1/2 year old son to be exposed to. It's a fun adventure story that shows how a child can be creative and use their imagination and other intellectual abilities to problem solve and come up with a plan in a tough situation (without resorting to physical force) and then use their physical and creative skills in executing their plan. The last few sentences of the book also add a more abstract, creative idea that expands the depth of the book depending on the age and abilities of the child who's hearing the story. The illustrations are well done - they're good and easy to follow and help the child to understand the story, They also provide additional details and threads for the child to explore. And, something I'm always on the lookout for, it was a great alternative troll story. On the chance that most of his fellow schoolmates would be talking about pirates, superheroes, fairy tale characters and such, I didn't want my son to have no idea what others were referring to simply because we tended to avoid such stories because they tend to be completely objectionable in terms of their values and characters. So, I'm always on the lookout for good alternatives, and this was a very positive way to introduce him to a troll. (As a side note, a good alternative for superheroes is \\"Max\\" by Bob Grahm; for pirates try \\"Pirate Pete\\", \\"Edward and the Pirates\\" and \\"Pirate Pink\\"; and there are many fractured fairy tales which are clear winners over the traditional sexist, violent, etc fairy tales, e.g. \\"The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig\\", \\"Wolf\\" by Becky Bloom, \\"The Big Bad Wolf is Good\\", \\"The Emperor [Penguin] has no clothes\\", and on video - CinderElmo - where Elmo goes to the Princesses ball). This was my first exposure to Jan Brett and I'm looking forward to more books."},{"Title":"Trouble with Trolls","review":"What would a Jan Brett winter's story be without the trolls? Once again she spins a tale with words, as well as beautifully illustrates each step of the way through the story.

Being that it's a 40 day journaling process helps a person learn about getting into the Word daily and spending some sweet solace with their loving Father.This study will lead a person into a constant communication with The Lord, helping to draw us into a solid, restful place for mind, body and soul no matter what circumstances may be swirling around us in life. It is an intimate study, developing a relationship with The Lord and with others as they share their hearts and their insight.

In order to exact revenge on Viole Falushe, the third Demon Prince, Kirth Gersen must first discover who Mr. Falushe is, and then find and infiltrate his famous Palace of Love.The actual plot, while just as brisk and fun as usual, isn't the most entertaining aspect of The Palace of Love. This volume is particularly charming because of Jack Vance's exquisite characters -- three in particular:1. Vogel Filschner was rejected by the prettiest girl in school when he was a pimply 14-year old geek. His retaliation feels just like what school psychologists are warning us about these days. He's a fascinating villain!2. Navarath is a washed-up poet who lives on a houseboat. We're not sure if he's a genius, a fake, crazy, or just drunk. Whatever he is, he's amusing and Vance has lots of fun with Navarath, giving him an eccentric artist personality. He talks dramatically and emphatically, gestures extravagantly, seeks attention, drinks a lot, and broods. When he got on a spaceship for the first time he \\"simultaneously became afflicted with claustrophobia and agoraphobia, and lay on a settee with his feet bare and a cloth pulled over his head.\\" He even constructs absurd (but somehow ingenious) poems, including one whose stanzas end with lines such as \\"But Tim R. Mortiss degurgled me\\" and \\"But Tim R. Mortiss peturgles me.\\"3. Zan Zu, the girl from Eridu, is a dreamy dirty adolescent misfit with no name. (Since Kirth asked for her name, Navarath introduced her as \\"Zan Zu from Eridu.\\") Vance can't help but use her entire title nearly every time she's mentioned (and I can't either), so Kirth thinks of her as Zan Zu, the girl from Eridu, and we regularly encounter the words \\"Zan Zu, the girl from Eridu\\" in the text. It just trips off the tongue so nicely and somehow made me smile every time I saw it. (I read somewhere that Jack Vance chose his characters' names this way -- by saying them over and over to see how they sound.)These are three of Vance's best supporting characters, all packed into about 150 pages. That's enough reason to read The Palace of Love."},{"Title":"The Palace of Love (The Demon Princes, Book 3)","review":"The third book in the Demon Princes series is predictably good. It is slow and methodical. It follows the same formula as the previous 2 books, which is a winning one. Kirth Gersen has sworn to hunt down and kill the 5 Demon Princes who murdered members of his family and his town many years ago. They now live anonymously, still committing acts of evil. Gersen now pursues Viole Falushe , who controls the Palace Of Love. Its location and nature is shrouded in mystery. Gersen slowly lifts the shroud.Again, there are memorable bits of information and unusual characters. Gersen's companion during his search this time is an eccentric poet, who makes for a colorful character. The hunt for Falushe develops with the same sureness of the last 2 books, but I found this one to be somewhat slower in pace. Falushe's evil is deep and solidly told, and has a complexity to it that is refreshing. Vance sticks to the series premise as stubbornly as Gersen maintains his singular purpose. Gersen may be unable to change, but I would welcome at least a little something different from the series the next time around. Either way, Vance's strong writing will surely not disappoint."},{"Title":"The Palace of Love (The Demon Princes, Book 3)","review":"The Palace of LoveA Guest of the MargraveKirth Gerson's quest for revenge against the five Demon Princes who destroyed his home and family has one unfortunate side effect. It makes him more than a little unlucky in love. When Alusz Iphigenia finds herself dragged to Sarkovy, the poisoner's planet, to watch a man die for selling poisons to Viole Falushe at the wrong price she draws the line and Gerson finds himself alone one again. Unsurprisingly, Gerson is almost relieved at the loss.For Gerson, the thin clues discovered on Sarkovy will eventually lead him back to Earth where he must struggle to build the snare that will trap the elusive Falushe. Eventually, the trail will lead him to Navarth, a poet of unsteady demeanor and writing skills, the guardian of the young woman called Zan Zu from Eridu. Whoever Zan Zu really is, she is the double of Jheral Tinzy, the woman whose cavalier treatment launched young Vogel Filschner, later known as Viole Falushe, on the life of a dire criminal mastermind. Gerson uses Zan Zu and Navarth as the keys that will gain him access to the killer. Even if it means a trip to the fatal delights of the infamous Palace of Love.If 'The Killing Machine' was a slight letdown, 'The Palace of Love' finds Vance back in complete control of his writing powers. The book is both a facile satire of the foibles of an overly attenuated civilization and a hard nosed adventure of the fight to the death between a vicious, if overly romantic, sadist and one of his earliest victims. Irony is the rule of the day as many characters get their just and embarrassing deserts. For a reader jaded by the modern tendency to the grim and noir, Vance's use of almost comic justice is like a breath of fresh air.Vance creates his worlds in order to have full use of the people on them. Sarkovy, with its wheeled god, the archaism of Earth, and the countless quirks of the worlds of the Oikumene and beyond the Pale come to life in the footnotes and quotes with which Vance peppers his stories. You will find yourself enamored of both Vance's story-telling skills and his capabilities as a somewhat cynical sociologist. These are stories designed to fire the imagination, to stay in the mind after they are put to rest."},{"Title":"The Korean Pentecost and the Sufferings Which Followed","review":"As one who has grown up in the Korean-American church, I have always been curious about the foundings of Christianity in Korea. This is an excellent, first-hand account of the work of the first Korean missionaries during the early 1900s. It also contains incredible descriptions of the sufferings endured during the Japanese occupation and the subsequent Korean War. I found it to be quite inspirational."},{"Title":"Voices of Doom","review":"Voices of Doom is a collection of short stories, with the near-entire book of &quot;From Evil's Pillow&quot; within it. Some of the stories are simply sentimental jaunts, like &quot;Charon&quot; or the paranoid retiree &quot;A Very Pleasant Fellow.&quot; &quot;The Stranger&quot; is basically Kafka. You only get a few stories that are the real prime of the book, which is classic horror in the Bloch/Lovecraft vein.&quot;The House on the Tarn&quot; sets the mood nicely and has things going nicely up until the end-- and you feel jilted by the unsatisfying ending. Aickman-ish.The two best stories are the riveting &quot;The Gossips&quot; which is probably one of the top 30 horror short stories I have ever read. It is about ghastly statues and the horror the befalls the scholars that venture about it. A rather weak plot, but it is brilliantly told.&quot;The Grey House&quot; has an even weaker plot that borders on collapse with its characters that act ridiculously foolish; nevertheless it is well told.Overall, the striking horror elements of this book are good, but you don't need to read it unless you have an abundance of time on your hands."},{"Title":"Voices of Doom","review":"Voices of Doom, Basil Copper's third hardcover British collection, is-- for owners of his previous volumes-- marred only by the fact that it contains so many previously collected tales. \\"Charon\\", \\"A Very Pleasant Fellow\\", \\"The Gossips\\", and \\"The Grey House\\", all found in an earlier American Arkham House hardcover, reappear, which of course is fine if one doesn't already have them. The latter two stories are must-reads. That leaves only three stories appearing here for the first time in Copper collections. The least of them, though a fun read, is \\"The Madonna of the Four-Ale Bar\\", in which the pathetic hero seeks to romance a beautiful girl while a mad killer stalks London. \\"The Stranger\\" is a thrilling tale of suspicion, soaked in paranoia, as only Copper can write them, which bears comparison to \\"The Knocker at the Portico\\" found in the earlier volume Here Be Daemons. The remaining story, \\"The House By the Tarn\\", is a strong haunted house yarn earlier published in the Arkham House anthology, Dark Things. This story ends a tad abruptly for my tastes-- I would have preferred more development to the climax-- but the evocation of eerie setting here is Mr. Copper at his best. That house, and its environs, where ventures the overly inquisitive researcher are awful places I'd rather read about than visit, and the \\"history\\" underlying the tale is first rate."},{"Title":"Taboo Memories, Diasporic Voices","review":"Shohat's \\"Taboo Memories, Diasporic Voices\\" opens multiple perspectives for thinking.

Shohat rewrites history and the Jewish experience to suit her anti-Zionist proclivities, and treats us to an \\"alternate reality\\" in which the Diaspora was really very good to Jews, Jews of Muslim lands had nothing much to do with Jews of Europe (presumably this includes Jews of Spanish descent) and Jewish nationhood (\\"am Yisrael\\") as well as all the persecutions and problems of the diaspora are portrayed as figments of Zionist propaganda. In fact, according to Shohat, it seems that the only problem the Eastern Jews ever had was Zionism, and were it not for Zionism, they would be living happily ever after, enjoying the benefits of enlightened and progressive Islamic rule to this day. In Shohat's world, Jews did not say \\"am Yisrael\\" (Nation of Israel) before the time of the Zionists, did not pray and wish for return to Zion, and never tried in fact to return. Especially not Sephardic and \\"Arab\\" Jews. Ibn Gvirol and Yehuda Halevi and Shabbetai Tzvi did not exist or can be explained away and neglected. Rabbi Alkalai, the Sephardic proto-Zionist, did not exist either, because according to her, it was impossible to conceive of the Jews in any other way except as members of a religious totally divided by the cultures of their separate countries.Everyone can write propaganda, but only silly people will pay for it. Save your money. This is socio-historical post-rational fiction."},{"Title":"The Glenn Gould Reader","review":"Glenn Gould was one of the best piano players ever. But he not only achieved the highest level of virtuosity, he re-invented the music of Bach and other composers. He was not only faster than other musicians (as this is the trivial criteria of virtuosity), every of his interpretations contains a thought beyond the music. This book shows the world of Gould's thoughts beyond the music. It's almost pure philosophy of art, almost, because Gould doesn't want to create complex system, his points are straight. Two examples:- &quot;The determination of the value of a work of art according to the information available about it is a most delinquent form of aesthetic appraisal&quot;- &quot;The computer repositories file away the memories of mankind and leave us free to be inventive in spite of them&quot;Makes you think, huh?The book contains dozens of short texts written during many years, and are grouped into few parts:1) Music - about Art of Fugue of course, Goldberg Variations, Beethoven, Schoenberg and Mozart. Deep look into the music.2) Performance - Gould gave up live performances and was accused for eccentrism There was a good reason beyond this decision, figure out why he did it.3) Glenn Gould interviews Glenn Gould. What? Yes, his interviewers weren't good enough, so he conducted an interview with himself.4) Media - how recording has changed the perception and performance of music, Gould's favourite radio with explanation of the &quot;Idea of North&quot; and &quot;Latecomers&quot;, exceptionally original radio pieces by Gould, comparable with the XX century avant-garde. Radio as music.5) Miscellany.Sometimes it requires quite good musical background and education, as Gould lets the music speak for itself, on paper, by reproducing notes. Sometimes it requires knowledge of this recordings, which he refers to. But most of it is about music per se, the universal language Gould mastered. Highly recommended to all people who believe in music."},{"Title":"The Glenn Gould Reader","review":"Glenn Gould has occassionally been accused of being different just for the sake of being different. I believe this was not the case. Everything he did had a clear motive and this book lays out most of these motives. Besides being entertaining and stimulating reading, the Glenn Gould Reader contains a peek into the brilliant mind of the genius who created some of the greatest recordings of piano music of all time."},{"Title":"The Glenn Gould Reader","review":"Appreciation of Glenn Gould's towering genius came late to me, but now that it has, I would be bereft without this book as my companion.Gould's virtuoso performances speak for themselves, but by clever design the 3-CD setA State of Wonder: The Complete Goldberg Variations (1955 & 1981)included a radio interview that allows Gould to speak for himself. Listening to his incisive and insightful self-criticism, I regretted that his life and my awareness of it never overlapped. Happily, a collection of his playful, unorthodox, and thoroughly original ideas were committed to paper, and Tim Page has done a great service to his legacy by editing and collecting those papers into this rather substantial volume.It is absolutely breath-taking the way that Glenn understood the implications of his preferred medium, the audio recording, and how that understanding presaged the free culture movement, and in particular, the Creative Commons. Consider this proposition from \\"Strauss and the Electronic Future\\": \\"[in] fact, implicit in electronic culture is an acceptance of the idea of multilevel participation in the creative process.\\" In \\"The Prospects of Recording\\" Gould asserts \\"[it] would be a relatively simple matter, for instance, to grant the listener tape-edit options which he could exercise as his discretion. Indeed, a significant step in this direction might well result from that process by which it is now possible to disassociate the ratio of speed to pitch and in so doing ... truncate splice-segments of interpretations of the same work performed by different artists and recorded at different tempos.\\" Twenty years before sampling, and thirty years before remix was a genre, Gould knew that it was only a matter of time and technology. And though he did not live to see that technology become mainstream, he writes manifestos of culture and philosophy, aesthetics and interpretation that give us a perfect view about what he would have thought about today's crisis of copyright versus culture.Gould writes with such an intimate voice, so rich in imagery, precise in detail, tireless in explanation, fearless in argument (and the use of the parenthetical), that I feel as if I am having a late-night conversation over a bottle of red wine with the man himself. Or, more astonishingly, that I feel as if we are true friends.So listen, and read. Read and listen. You may find yourself with a new friend, too."},{"Title":"The Glenn Gould Reader","review":"I disagree with most of the opinions expressed herein, yet I enjoyed all of them immensely. Glenn Gould was a brilliant pianist, an erudite and deep thinker, and a man with a very great knowledge of music.He hated the Beatles, yet I think he and the Beatles unwittingly had a lot in common--as cultural phenomena, I mean. Gould and the Beatles were on top of their form and at the height of their popularity when they abruptly announced they would cease performing publicly, declaring the impersonal--and arguably &quot;de-humanizing&quot;--medium of recording to be the true art form of the present and future. In this collection Gould derisively calls the Beatles's &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; &quot;Monteverdi played by a jug band&quot;, not realizing it was created much the same way that Gould explains (elsewhere in this collection) he was wont to create his own works: by splicing together radically different recorded snippets.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."},{"Title":"The Glenn Gould Reader","review":"First let's put Glenn Gould in context. The rise of the Romantic style in the 19th century overwhelmed the Classical style in terms of instrumental and orchestral playing. Increased dynamic range, freedom of phrasing (rubato), went wild in the Romantic period, became ingrained and nearly impossible to counteract. It was thought to be \\"expressive,\\" but easily tended to \\"wretched excess.\\" But the Romantic composers made much great music, which tended to validate the style and make it even more difficult to reject. The Classical style, which embodied ideals of restraint and intellectualism were put aside. Classical music tends to be spiritual and abstract; Romanticism, worldly and programatic.Glenn Gould was born into this context, a man with classical instincts in the midst of a full-blown Romantic era. In other words, a duck badly out of water. The stage had been set by Franz Liszt himself, then Paderewski, Rachmaninoff, Rubenstein, Horowitz, etc. But Gould bravely and single-mindedly went his own way. He established no school of piano playing, had no followers. He eschewed public playing. His music--Bach, some Mozart, some Beethoven--and bits of various modern composers, was best produced in the recording studio where he could do perfect performances avoiding the hazards of concertizing. Gould wasn't energized by an audience. His inspiration was from within. His Bach was played entirely at one dynamic level with utter clarity and precision--no pedal.His writing style in this book, is complex, heavy-textured, pedantic; but there is no denying his astonishing erudition. The book is full of his fascinating observations about music, musicians and composers. His writing validates his playing and his playing validates his writing."},{"Title":"The Glenn Gould Reader","review":"Glenn Gould's literary style is every bit as immoderate as his musicianship, and tends I think to draw extreme response, favourable or not. He is unquestionably very erudite and articulate. There are times though, when I felt he took some liberties in not only inclusion but also exclusion. I am not completely comfortable with the interviews conducted with himself, and for instance in the Beethoven interview, GG (speaking to gg) claims that he cannot \\"get a bead\\" on the finale of the Chorale symphony, and that he does not find the Opus 131 Quartet pleasurably listenable. On both occasions, he fails to adequately explain why. I do not find fault with the author's unorthodox views - just the manner in which he sometimes attempts to support them, or on occasion, declines to do so.This artist pretty much lived by his own rules regardless of popular taste or convention - and his comments about critics in general are pretty damning.The chapters devoted to rigorous analysis of the keyboard works of Bach are very well done.Gould's musical tastes, in general, favour the renaissance, baroque, and post-romantic eras. Much of what has been composed between The Art of Fugue and Tristan und Isolde is regarded unfavourably. This I would guess is one of what the commentator Leonard Bernstein referred to as the many \\"shocks\\" of this book. Whether you agree with Mr. Gould's views or not, his observations force you to reconsider your own opinion of the works in question.The book is compelling, thought-provoking reading. In general, the chapters are concise, having the feel of a series of essays. It is not necessary to read them in chronological order."},{"Title":"Medicine for Beginners (A Writers & Readers documentary comic book)","review":"Medicine for Beginners is a historical approach rather than an aesthetic approach. It covers from whence medicine was for the shamans and healers and witch doctors. Soon, it became a practice and then a teaching and schooling.

Doctors has made it difficult to become a doctor (to raise prices) and insurance (to treat the rich). Since then, medicine has been really geared for those that do have money, and everyone else to pay the rest of their lives in fees (somewhat similar to the IRS and credit corps. do).

The result is premature aging and the early onset of chronic degenerative diseases. Modern Medicine, referred to as Conventional Medicine or Orthodox Western Medicine, is reactive in nature. The industry responds by running expensive tests to diagnose diseases, producing and prescribing drugs, and performing surgeries. In America, this industry generates over One Trillion Dollars in revenue yearly, close to $4,000.00 for every man, woman and child. The professionals are highly paid for treating symptoms of diseases; underlying causes are usually not addressed. Often, as patients conditions continue to worsen, additional drugs or stronger dosages are prescribed. Adverse side effects and reactions to these drugs, or combinations of drugs, often cause additional problems.The book: \\"You Can Be ...... Well At Any Age: Your Definitive Guide To Vibrant Health &amp; Longevity\\", by K. Steven Whiting, Ph.D., should be in every household in America.Those who read this book and embrace the concepts therein will learn how to take charge of their health. They will learn about time tested methods of disease prevention, management and even the reversal of over 250 chronic degenerative conditions, all without the use of drugs or surgery.

We also found very helpful how Dr. Whiting goes through each category of nutrients, fats, carbohydrates, proteins, etc. and tells you how they work in the body, and how you feel if you are deficient. We have also found that the sections where he covers diabetes, arthritis, heart disease, weight management, womens and mens hormones, etc. have given us a great outline to use as we talk with people who struggle with these problems. It has been very gratifying for us as we work with people who want to overcome their health challenges, to use the information and nutritional programs in Dr. Whiting's book, and to see the change that comes into their lives as a result. We would reccommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"You Can Be...Well at Any Age: Your Definitive Guide to Vibrant Health","review":"Based on the previous reviews I felt I would get great benefit from this book yet I found it to be somewhat trivial and would not qualify it as a &quot;definitive guide&quot; for good health let alone vibrant health. Would prefer theory with proof behind it, this just seems like a missed opportunity for a field that needs all the positive and qualified sources it can get."},{"Title":"You Can Be...Well at Any Age: Your Definitive Guide to Vibrant Health","review":"I found that many of the &quot;claims&quot; made were unsubstantiated. Quite a bit of theory without any proof to give it credibility."},{"Title":"The house in Hook Street","review":"This a a great series, but sadly out of print. I wish I could locate them all."},{"Title":"PsychoBible: Behavior, Religion and the Holy Book","review":"I bought this book on a lark. The clever title grabbed me, the notion that a clinical practitioner of psychology would take up religion as a topic interested me, and the effort to address a holy book from a new place without judgement or claim sold it to me. The fact that the author doesn't put \\"Dr. Favazza\\" on the cover in an effort to suggest authority also weighed well on my initial impression.Throughout the work I found Favazza to be extremely easy to read. I laughed often at his little asides that owed more to keeping a light tone in the midst of a (possibly) heavy topic than they did to a real need to be comedic. The writing was very casual given the scope and material yet was respectful in regards to beliefs. I never felt like Favazza tried to convert me to whatever his thinking or away from my own, I always felt like a friend was sharing with me his discoveries over a glass of wine.Favazza's writings deal with a myriad of Biblical subjects. The evolution of scripture through various translations and mis-translations, contradictions, curious passages and the observation of the devil's expanding and contracting roles through history are but a few of the topics given page time. Age old questions such as the Bible's comments on alchohol, homosexuality and various other \\"sins\\" are given new angles if not completely resolved.There is no inherent theme that I can discern. The author does not set out to prove lofty claims such as the Bible is wrong or the Bible is right with a \\"but.\\" He simply lays out his findings and information with very little personal bias. In that way, I suppose the book could be a disappointment to those looking for positions to argue from or new evidence in support or opposition to some Biblical position -- you will need to build your own arguments from the material within, it is not done for you. This might also lead those who favor clear cut, \\"this-that-therefore\\" lines of thought to become a little frustrated with the slightly rambling nature of the book.All things considered this has been a fantastic read, easily enjoyed and a source of new questions whose answers I now feel I need to search out. Those given to literal interpretations of scripture will likely find the work offensive and heretical. Those of open mind and curious spirit will likely find it an interesting piece of religious furniture to help round out a small corner of their theological home -- one that you can't really stand on but is still intriguing to have present."},{"Title":"PsychoBible: Behavior, Religion and the Holy Book","review":"In his own intellectually provocative and entertaining style, Dr. Favazza has produced another meaty and informative read in his latest book, PsychoBible. This book is the result of a richly vast, refined research into religion and its impact on culture. It serves to create a bridge between the world of Christianity (especially Fundamentalist Christianity) and the scientific/artistic field of psychiatry (and the mental health profession, in general).Briefly, and importantly, the book has a message for both the Christian and the scientific communities. To the Christian, the author suggests that where Biblical interpretation is concerned, moderation is the key. And to the scientific community, he points out \\"the importance of the churches in providing psychological support and of the congregation as a healing resource.\\" Dr. Favazza's approach has done a great deal to inform and educate that \\"mental health and positive emotions\\" should and can be part of the fabric of one's religious philosophy."},{"Title":"PsychoBible: Behavior, Religion and the Holy Book","review":"Knowledgeably written by a world renowned psychiatrist Armando Favazza, Psycho Bible: Behavior, Religion &amp; The Holy Book is a straightforward, no-nonsense look at what the Bible truly says about contemporary and complex issues so relevant for today. From the status of women; to the existence of angels; to abortion, celibacy, marriage, homosexuality, feminism, and so much more, Psycho Bible deftly picks apart the stories told in the biblical texts and presents them in terms nonspecialist general readers can directly grasp. A matter-of-fact presentation, especially recommended as a complement to studying the Bible, Psycho Bible is also available in a hardcover edition."},{"Title":"PsychoBible: Behavior, Religion and the Holy Book","review":"Whether a believer of not, one has to acknowledge the Bible as a pillar of our culture and history. Psychobible is an illuminating examination of its meaning and interpretation that serves as a fascinating look at ourselves. The book will energize the thinking of anyone even remotely interested in the workings and dysfunction of our belief and society."},{"Title":"PsychoBible: Behavior, Religion and the Holy Book","review":"This book is not for those who are looking for faith or belief. It describes who wrote ,translated edited and selected the written material. Remember that the Old Testament was set-down after a long oral tradition from a wandering tribe, that spent many a long evening around a campfire. The New Testament was written in flawless Greek (mostly) while the early Christians spoke Aramaic and were not that highly educated. Many \\"first-hand\\" narratives were written after -the fact. John2 was written 60 years after he died."},{"Title":"PsychoBible: Behavior, Religion and the Holy Book","review":"I met Dr. Favazza on a plane flight to St. Louis in August 2006. I didn't know who he was, but we had a very interesting discussion on several topics. As we were about to part, he confessed he'd written a book and asked me to read it and comment, though he didn't mention Amazon specifically. So... One of the two most important questions we all want to know is what kind of beings we are. Human nature is a key question for philosophy, its ancestor religion, and its offspring psychology. Whether or not one accepts the heritage of the Judeo-Christian outlook on human nature, one has to deal with its world-view and its source text, the Bible, in any examination of the views of human nature in Western Culture. And, if one is well-read, s/he knows that religion has often chafed at the pronouncements of psychology/psychiatry about human nature. Dr. Favazza's book is an examination of the Bible, of the intersection between commonsense, the Bible and psychology, and a gentle discussion of what one can honestly say on several questions mentioned in the reviews below. You cannot say that he has a specific point-of-view to prove, because what you are given is the decades of his thought and gathering wisdom on all these topics. You, the reader, come away with a mountain range of knowledge about so many things that you are enriched by the book, even if the author did not try to persuade you for or against the Bible, psychology, or any position on the topics discussed. I don't mean that he wrote so many pages of mere opinion, because his scholarship is evident throughout. I just mean that this is the intellectual sharing of an eminently reasonable man from whom many should learn. Your time will not be wasted by strident skepticism or advocacy, nor by technical jargon or psychotherapy abstracts. But, you will be given the chance to reflect on your own experiences, values and the roots of any beliefs you have by spending time in \\"conversation\\" with this man, as I did, far too briefly, on the plane ride into St. Louis. Worth the price and time you'll invest."},{"Title":"Gender and Science Reader","review":"This is a graduate level book!

Yes, I wanted and needed to learn more about breeding; however, I wasn't anticipating such a scholarly volume that I had to decode! The depth to which Ms. Holst examines breeding, and the mechanics of breeding, was a bit overdone; and yet, she omitted basic information such as what age is appropriate to begin using your dogs for breeding.

Tolkien fanatics who discover Appendices E and F in The Lord of the Rings and suddenly want to read everything they can get their hands on about Finnish and Welsh grammar but wouldn't know a allative from an allosaurus!) this book's for you. What's best about it, is not only does it give terminology utilized for non-Indo-European languages, but I found it was a great way to get a crash course in some of the latter-day schools of grammar that have erupted through the breaches in the once-solid wall of the stale, sterile, and limited Chomskian paradigm. My only complaint: the book, in addition to simply describing terms, should give more examples and contextual illustrations from actual languages."},{"Title":"Work Horse Handbook","review":"This book has been around for a while, and I believe we are on the 3rd copy in use at our farm since Dad bought one in the early 80's.

Mr. Miller demonstrates how the horse can be not only a companion and a playmate but also a practical, functional part of our modern life. I hope to do \\"all that\\" and then some!"},{"Title":"The life and adventures of Joaquin Murieta,: The celebrated California bandit (The Western frontier library)","review":"This is where the myth of the notorious California bandit Joaquin Murrieta was born. There are probably as many versions of Joaquin Murrieta as there were of sightings of him in the the gold rush days of California lore. Originally published in 1854 the Cherokee Indian Yellow Bird, better known as John Rollin Ridge, created the story that has since grown to mythical proportions. In this edition, of particular note is the introduction by Joseph H Jackson, who clarifies some disputed points about the authenticity of the fabled bandido Joaquin Murrieta. From the humble beginnings of a novel grew the legend that has been perpetuated through various novels, poems, music and even the big screen. All that is missing is the True E biography on the small screen. For those unfamiliar with the story, Joaquin Murrieta was a bandit who terrorized the early Californians, along with his notorious band of bandidos numbering some 2,000, which included such bad guys as &quot;three fingered Jack&quot; and more Joaquin's than those listed in a Mexico City phone book. This is a serious account that grew out of the imagination of one poet-journalist who authenticated his account by meeting in &quot;secret caves&quot; with Joaquin Murrieta to tell this tall tale. What is most fascinating is that this myth is deeply imbedded in the consciousness of Californians, particularly those of Mexican desent who identify with Murrieta as a sort of Robin Hood. Myself included, I was duped into believing the story of Joaquin Murrieta who was forced to turn into a bad guy after the gringos wronged his wife, sister, or whatever version you may happen to believe in. It made for a romantic vision of a bygone era, good guy wronged goes bad to avenge his woman, against incredible odds he managed to be shadowy and elusive. The stories growing with each retelling by the the campfires, Joaquin Murrieta became larger than life. After reading this original novel it is clear that the story that has grown larger and bigger than life was the stuff of pulp fiction. The book itself is an easy to read narrative. If you are interested in the fictionalized history of California, than this is a must read to understand how the myth of Joaquin Murrieta was created. Many books have been written on the life of Joaquin Murrieta but this is the original."},{"Title":"The Great Lakes Triangle","review":"This book,titled to cash in on the hugh sales that Bermuda Triangle-Devil's Triangle type books were enjoying at the time,is actually quite entertaining. It actually can be a little eerie at times. Reasonably well reasearched unlike most of the other triangle books. About vanished ships and planes in the great lakes area. Some very interesting stories here. A good read. Note: there is a similarly titled book by an author named Hugh Cochran,which came out shortly afterward. Avoid this one as it is a lame copy."},{"Title":"The Great Lakes Triangle","review":"I read this book a number of times a long time back. My attention returned when I realized that the author's theory of sudden methane releases causing &quot;bermuda-triangle&quot; type events is supported by later gas-hydrate buildup discoveries in cold water. This review is from memory -- I just placed an Amazon out-of-print order."},{"Title":"The Great Lakes Triangle","review":"I can only testify as to the missing ships he writes of, as I have never researched the planes. But if his lack of research and misinformation is as bad regarding the missing planes as it is with the ships, the only thing this book is good for is the fireplace. One example: he has the ship Charles M. Price as 'mysteriously disappearing' on Lake Huron in 1913. What he totally neglects to tell the reader is that the Price (which didn't 'disappear'-the hull was found capsized with many of the crew washed ashore) was in what many historians consider to be the worst storm the Great Lakes have ever seen and appears to collected most of his material from one writer, and rather selectively at that. Many of the other ships which he alludes had 'mysterious' disappearances were actually victims of severe storms, which the author usually neglects to mention."},{"Title":"The Great Lakes Triangle","review":"I found it very interesting. The planes just flew into Lake Michigan on a clear night. Ships just sank. The wreck of theEdmund Fitzgerald, of which Gordon Lightfoot sang in the1970s, was real. In November 1975, the Edmund Fitzgerald,a Great Lakes ore carrier with 29 crewmen, sank on LakeMichigan. She sank in the worst storm in over sixty years.The Edmund Fitzgerald was traveling in tandem with another ore carrier, the Arthur M. Anderson, when she sank.The Discovery Channel had a special about her in the '90s, and they had a salvage team raise the ship's bell. A plaquerests on the bottom of the lake."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Empire","review":"I am not a sci-fi book reader. That is, not till I read Twilight of the Empire. Excellent. If you like great in-depth, believable character development mixed with fast-paced, don't plan on getting a lot of sleep action, this book will not disappoint. It has plenty of both, as well as some of the best writing I've come upon. Simon Green possesses a pleasantly understated method of writing which is very \\"human\\", like talking to a buddy. No fancy-shmancy wording or rhetorically correct banter just for the sake of fancy-shmancy wording and rhetorically correct banter. No unnecessary words to muddle what one's reading. I'm a visual reader - I have to be able to \\"see\\" what I'm reading, the more I can the more I enjoy - and Simon Green has created one of the most easily visual books I've ever read. You can't help but see every detail: the seediness of Mistworld, the eeriness of Ghostworld, the savageness of Hellworld. These places are real, and their inhabitants alive (this guy has one whacked-out imagination. Very original!). While reading Twilight I couldn't help thinking \`man, this would make a great movie.' If only Simon Green were a director...."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Empire","review":"I've read lots of SciFi books but this one is my favorite. I really liked the parts Ghostworld and Hellworld the best. I liked Ghostworld because the way the characters got through most of the obsticles was very creative. And I liked the Hellworld part because the enemy in that part was very creative, so was the parts of it where the characters were fighting, and the plot was very creative also. The part Mistworld was great too I especally liked the way Simon R. Green went into the thoughts of Mary while she was being controlled."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Empire","review":"I've read Green before, but this is most definantly his best work. It helps to have read the Deathstalker seriese but it is not a must. If your tired of the overused dragons and faries of popular sci-fi just take a walk with Green.He is capable of creating aliens and habitats I don't thik any other mind could come up with. Mr. Green, if you see this, thank you so much for the experience of this book. I hope you love it as much as I do. (Topaz was my favorite charactor)"},{"Title":"Twilight of the Empire","review":"I read the first book included in Twilight of Empire while I was on a cruise a couple of weeks ago. Mistworld is written clearly for easy reading. It is built around a situation that capitalizes on the relationships between prominent characters that many writers would go overboard with. Mr. Green doesn't. Despite the convoluted plot, the minor detail is kept to a minimum. I stopped reading at one point and tried get straight in my head who had done what, and how it affected others. I succeeded in this. Another neat thing is Mr. Green's sense for creating the \\"legendary\\" character. For example, in one case he has people mention the fury of one of his central characters, Topaz. She is a siren, an esper who, in her own defence, killed 500 attackers with her song. In the end, Topaz must face Typhoid Mary. Trust me, you'll know who she is. This book is terrific. And I loved Deathstalker; Mr. Green wrote that one at full steam in his technique."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Empire","review":"Several rviewers have written about Green having found his niche, I agree. He writes well when he places sword &amp; sorcery stories into the future and adds warp engines. It takes a bit of getting used to but his brand of fantasy with a tech twist grows on one after a time."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Empire","review":"Coming to this book from Green's Hawk and Fisher series was a somewhat odd transition. But most definatly a good one. The new depth of horror that I found was great. We got tastes of it in &quot;Bones&quot; and a few other spots. Such as the Burning Man or Lament. I have not been disapointed at all with this man's writing. Keep them coming!"},{"Title":"Twilight of the Empire","review":"One thing I should say before I begin: I think Green's found his niche writing space opera. It's not really sf per se--it's more like fantasy in space, with science-fictional trappings. This isn't bad; I just thought I'd point it out.That being said, the three novels herein give some more background to the Deathstalker universe. They're fun reads--not terribly complicated, but fun. And some of the imagery is beautiful."},{"Title":"The Big Beast Book","review":"Not quite as far back as the dinosaurs, I was homeschooling my three younger children. One of the books we used for our studies was the Big Beast Book. When I was a child, I was deeply interested in dinosaurs and I was lucky enough to be living near Rapid City, South Dakota, home to the School of Mines, a school with a compact collection of fossils. In the 1950s no one mentioned lizard-hipped or bird-hipped dinosaurs, but The Big Beast Book did; it was a revelation. I was not only pleased to renew my acquaintance with dinosaurs, but tickled to find out new information.Although the book is simply illustrated, I didn't find that style to be a distraction. Many of the newer 'full color' photo-realistic books have so much detail that it all turns into background noise. Sometimes simpler is better."},{"Title":"Land of Terror (Ace science fiction)","review":"&quot;The Land of Terror&quot; was the sixth of seven novels in the Pellucidar series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, and is rather unique in that it was never published in magazine form having been rejected by all of ERB's publishers. Instead ERB, Inc. published the book in 1944, although clearly there are five &quot;parts&quot; to the novel that would have worked as a magazine serial. The result is one of the most disjointed Burroughs novels and the low point in the Pellucidar series.In &quot;The Land of Terror&quot; the focus returns to David Innes, who is rather surprised to learn that he has been living in Pellucidar for 36 years, although he still looks like a young man of about 20. In all that time Abner Perry has brought such wonders of civilization as gunpowder and sailing ships, and now he is working on poison gas. The first adventure has Innes being captured by the women of the village of Oog, who have reversed the traditional gender stereotypes. The second takes Innes to the land of the Jukans, where he is captured by this most bizarre race and forced to make mud pies (no idea what point ERB is making with these crazy society, especially when David declares his name is Napoleon Bonaparte). The third deals with the love story between David's companion, Zor, and Zeeto, while David is off trying to rescue Dian the Beautiful (again) and makes friends with a mastodon. The fourth part of the story has David captured by the giant 6-foot long ants. The final story takes place on Ruva, the Floating Island, where, once again, David ends up a slave. The people of Ruva are black and have white slaves, so there is a racial flip that bookends the opening gender flip. The point this time is that the black masters treat their white slaves better than what happened in human history in the outer world.The lake of a comprehensive narrative and the repetitive capturing of David Innes easily explain why ERB's usual publishers were not interested in this Pellucidar novel, which is the weakest of the series. There are some philosophical sections to &quot;The Land of Terror,&quot; where Innes thinks deep thoughts about how 20th century inventions are making human beings so dependent that they are becoming more helpless than their ancestors. But there are also sections where Burroughs gets caught up in describing the animal life of Pellucidar while he comes up with the next place for David Innes to be held captor. Actually, Dina the Beautiful comes out better in her brief appearance in the early part of the story, before she also becomes an unwilling captor."},{"Title":"Land of Terror (Ace science fiction)","review":"I'm an avid ERB fan who has acquired just about all the Master's published work. That said, I consider myself one Burroughs' most ardent admirers. Unfortunately I found little to admire in Land of Terror. The novel is disjointed and incoherent with little or nothing to redeem it in many places. Probably the worst facet of the book is the fact that Dian the Beautiful is so little onstage. She appears early on then disappears till the next to last page, having miraculously made everything all right offstage. Probably the two best parts of the book come in the sections featuring the Jukans and the Ruvans, but everything else feels like padding. Characters appear and disappear with appalling regularity, leaving the reader no chance to identify with them. The whole plot (such as it is) seems to be a travelogue of unexplored areas of Pellucidar while David Innes stumbles obliviously into trap after trap. (Had Burroughs made Innes' inability to find his way home unaided the linchpin of the book, I'd be less caustic; but that is a minor point only occasionally mentioned.) Why ERB made his character so stupid at critical times rather than carefully plotting their temporary downfall is a mystery to me. Richard Lupoff says it is to give the reader a sense of superiority over the character, but Innes' slowness, inability to return home, and general failure to recover his wife accomplish that well on their own. Turning a man who has forged an empire from nothing into a blithering idiot for the plot's purposes is sheer folly. How I wish Burroughs had written this better. Unfortunately he didn't, but the parts where he really applied himself to the story do shine, though they are far too few."},{"Title":"Land of Terror (Ace science fiction)","review":"As other reviewers have mentioned and as I've plowed through ERB's sixth Pellucidar novel, it is the weakest of the series. Per \\"wikipedia\\", none of his magazine publishers wanted it and I can see why: What 1944 editor wants to publish how women with beards have effeminate males as slaves, have legs \\"like a linebacker\\" and beat up and kill with no aforethought. When ERB mentions that it's a good thing men are the leaders in the outer world and what would happen if roles were reversed was quite telling.Satire regarding \\"bringing civilation\\" to the Stone Age inhabitants included inventing rifles and poison gas and other methods of warfare. Yeah, he'd be civilized all right! Clear reference to World War II raging at the time of this writing.In other adventures, where Inns gets captured quite a lot and finds himself in a society of crazy people and declares himself Napoleon. The stereotype of a crazy person would declare himself so is also telling.As the reader tiresomely completes this, we have a racial stereotype where the whites are slaves and the blacks are masters. Interesting but not fully developed.The floating island stuff was interesting as was Dian the Beautiful, who seemed to fare better than David, poor guy.Better:Edgar Rice Burroughs Science Fiction Classics: Pellucidar, Thuvia Maid of Mars, Tanar of Pellucidar, the Chessman of Mars, the Master Mind of MarsThe Pellucidar Omnibus: At the Earth's Core & PellucidarMovie Adaptation:At the Earth's Core"},{"Title":"The New York, Susquehanna & Western Railroad","review":"This is the most comprehensive and interesting history of this railroad that has been written.

Several years before I was born the NYS&W; terminated all passenger service on this line and freight was relegated to the very early morning. The NYS&W; is one of the oldest, continuously operating railroads in the United States. It's notable for once being owned by the Erie but not disappearing into Conrail. Today, hauling local garbage and occasional freight and having lost intermodal business to the ex-Conrail parts of CSX and Norfolk Southern, this regional shortline railroad lurches into a future that's not quite certain.This book covers the deep history and innovations of the railroad. Its state-of-the-art passenger service tried to provide affordable commuter service on modern trains only to give up due to confiscatory local taxes and a severely backward federal government administration. The selling of the ultra-modern commuter trains overseas and replacement with 40-year-old antiques was especially disappointing, but not as much as the complete abandonment of passenger service.After a recent short-lived passenger service in Syracuse, NY, the NYS&W; has been forced to give up all passenger service again. Now that railroads are in vogue again this oldest railroad may soon find new passenger business with New Jersey Transit.This book provides the fascinating background of a railroad that even the locals know preciously little about."},{"Title":"The New York, Susquehanna & Western Railroad","review":"the book comprises a complete history of this rail system. this is exactly what i wanted. it is a visual and intellectual treat."},{"Title":"All About Scabs (My Body Science Series) (My Body Science Series)","review":"I bought this book for my nephew and he absolutely loves it!

Despite having written books with similar themes, \\"A Wagon Train for Brides\\" and \\"Buster Adams and the Ragamuffin Gang,\\" the story remains fresh because 1)the characters are so clearly drawn, and 2) there are plenty of action points and plot twists that are unique to this book - not just dusted off and trotted out to beguile the indiscriminate reader.

Some consider Mr. Frost to be a New England poet, but many people have now discovered in his poetry universal themes crafted for expression by the persona of a Yankee farmer, a profession by the way that Mr. Frost never suceeded in despite the fact that he owned several farms during his lifetime.

There's a clock on the left page each time you turn the page to demonstrate what time they have to be at their destination. It is an easy way to teach children time and a fun way as well.

Now that I've spent half of my day thoroughly reading this 76 page gem, I'm kind of astounded by what's been written about it. In spite of my rating, I don't consider it to be a bad book. If you're the manager of a purchasing department within a large manufacturing firm looking to reengineer your operations, I recommend that you read it. However, if you're looking for sound advice on general purchasing practices, look elsewhere.This book seems to have been thrown together fairly quickly. It contains numerous typos, and poorly drawn cartoons that add little to it. Nonetheless, the author does dispense some practical advice on modernizing a purchasing organization, and how to sell the plan to affected individuals. He principally focuses on computer automation, developing procurement card programs, and developing \\"strategic relationships\\" with suppliers. This last notion refers to his belief that strong business relationships should be forged with important suppliers to get them more fully involved in meeting the company's needs (automatic inventory replenishment and the like). On the whole, the book seems to be more about modern (late 90's theory) operations management than about purchasing, but at least the points that the author does make seem sound. Unfortunately, the book is too short to be of much use as anything but a checklist for people trying to reengineer organizations. At least it's good for that.As far as the personal stories gleaned from years of purchasing experience are concerned, I could only find two, which collectively took up a whopping half a page. I'm not suggesting that the author didn't rely on his extensive experience to write the book, but he principally just states the \\"facts\\" as he sees them, and provides precious few examples to illustrate his points. More vexing still, is that the man probably could have taught his readers a great deal about purchasing, but chose to write about other things instead. I've little doubt that there are people out there who can greatly benefit from this book, but they probably number in the thousands, which is probably why it's called \\"Common Sense Purchasing\\" and not \\"Common Sense Modernization of a Purchasing Organization\\"."},{"Title":"Common Sense Purchasing: Hard Knock Lessons Learned From a Purchasing Pro","review":"Just an outstanding purchasing field manual! Most consultants and academic folks will hate this book! They can't stand low cost common sense techniques. The book has many simple common sense approaches to purchasing. Unfortunately common sense is all too rare in purchasing. At our company we don't even want to hire purchasing folks who are certified. We have to spend too much time deprogramming them! The style is eclectic because the author wanted to emulate the chaos of a typical purchasing day. Many bureaucrats can't get this book and just mindlessly pan it. The key point is that relationship building with suppliers is essential. There is no roadmap for this effort other than hard work and getting folks to trust each other.I personally experienced Dr. Tom's one day workshop on Reengineering Purchasing which was the best experience of my purchasing career bar none. Most of the high priced junk that consultants sell today is smoke and mirrors like spend analysis, reverse on line auctions, portals etc. Bottom line Dr. Tom hits it on the head, \\"It's about getting world class suppliers and building strong relationships.\\" This is where the quantum leaps are. Many companies are enamored with technology and lose sight of the strategy. Any purchasing dummy can learn tactics and be a fire fighter. The strategists are rare but their gains can be enormous.

As a college senior with no previous experience in the business of purchasing, this is a very interesting piece of writing to analyze. Being a visual learner by nature, I find that the presentation and format of this book is quite engaging. People may argue on whether or not the content was in-depth enough or relatable, but that isn't the real issue.This is the kind of writing that is meant to get you think on your own and stepping up to find your own manner of work and business. I feel the whole reason it is called Common Sense Purchasing is due to the fact that we all know what we need to do to succeed. You do what is best for your situation and learn from your mistakes--see the subtitle if missed that reference.In an age where we want our information compact and to the point, this 76-page book is a great answer to that. Even without much knowledge of this field, I was still able to get what could work for individuals in this field.

Read all the way to the end of this interview to see my favorite from the book.Common Sense Purchasing is structured around 100 lessons, the kind of lessons that are easy to agree with, but not always so easy to consistently put into practice. My personal favorites are:* #3: Plan or Perish. Make sure you have a strategy first. Not technology first.* #12: Do your homework with suppliers and industries.* #21: Pick the right metrics [for procurement performance]. The right ones.Following each lesson are examples and other ideas backing up why the lesson is important and how to execute its advice.If you need an additional reason to buy and read this book, it is the price.

This is a handy feature when you're outside and trying to use one of the maps to identify constellations. Really, the only item you have to supply is a flashlight with a red filter so you can look at the maps without ruining your night vision.Each of the twelve included maps is set up to be 100% accurate for three hours per year, e.g. the June map is good for 10 P.M. in June, 2 A.M. in April, and 6 A.M. in February. With a planisphere, I can dial up the exact date and time, and it shows a much more complete star map. The maps in \\"Michigan Starwatch\\" are bigger and easier to read, but the author also eliminated lots of stars and whole constellations for ease of use. This lacuna is okay if you're a beginner and trying to identify the more prominent constellations such as Virgo or Aquila. Once you can make your way around the night sky with ease, then you will want more accurate maps for locating dimmer constellations such as Libra or Ophiuchus.The author's purpose is to \\"make the stars your old friends.\\" The book contains a quick education complete with color photographs and diagrams of what you might see in the night sky: nebulae; galaxies; planets; comets; and meteor showers. Telescopes and astrophotography are briefly covered. There are also modern renditions of the mythology of the constellations, e.g. Hera to Cassiopeia: \\"If you think you're so beautiful, I'm going to put you where you can show off your good looks to the whole world every night.\\"This book is fun to read, and the maps and stories of the individual constellations are loaded with viewing information. The only drawback to its use is that you're going to see many more stars in the night sky than are shown on its twelve maps. The solution is to use a planisphere rather than the maps for advanced viewing."},{"Title":"Michigan StarWatch: The Essential Guide to Our Night Sky","review":"This is a great book .It explains the constellations and where to find them and also has detailed star maps for the different seasons of the year.It has been invaluable in looking at the summer sky with my grandson.It is also filled with information about the history of star gazing and how the constellations were named. It is very informative and good reading even if you are stuck indoors."},{"Title":"NEVER THE LAST JOURNEY","review":"An ageless and inspiring story of determination, survival, and ultimately triumph. Zandman's story brings home minute details about being Jewish during this horrific period of time--right down to the mindset of most Jewish families in Poland. This book clearly illustrates how subtle, calculating, and conniving Hitler was as he, not all at once, but gradually moved the Jews from their homes, to the ghetto and finally the death camps.After I read this, the first time, I wanted nothing more than to meet Felix Zandman personally. Even the title inspired me to always push forward and to never give up."},{"Title":"NEVER THE LAST JOURNEY","review":"For many years my mother's family was presumed completely obliterated by the Holocaust until I found Dr. Zandman and his book. I was finally able to put fates with the faces of the people I knew only through aging photographs.This is a book of horrors and of triumph over adversity. That Dr. Zandman was able to survive what he did and still go on to become the fine international businessman that he did is nothing short of miraculous. Where others would have just ceased to go on he found the courage and the strength to live his life to it's fullest.The personal stories that he tells of his Great Aunt Sonya and his Grandfather Nochum are absolutely heartwrenching and leave you wondering simply how so many people could hate so much."},{"Title":"NEVER THE LAST JOURNEY","review":"As a stock analyst, I've seen many CEO's and heard many success stories. This is a heartwarming story of dedication and triumph unlike that of any other business executive. Despite spending his youth in hiding from Nazis, Dr. Zandman manages to get a PhD., move to America and found a small engineering company that ends up being one of the world's largest suppliers of electronics components."},{"Title":"NEVER THE LAST JOURNEY","review":"The Holocaust part of Dr. Felix Zandman's book echoes events of my own childhood. The fateful dates of 01sep39 and 22jun41 left deep marks in my memory. On the 01sep39 my mother was badly wounded by a shrapnel from a bomb and my father saved me by hurling me from a new opening in our burning apartment and jumping after me. Then he saved my mother's life by delivering her, as the first patient, to a Warsaw hospital. I rode my father's shoulders to the new German/Soviet border at the river Boog and over by swim. Mother came months later on crutches.Five o'clock in the morning 22jun41 war came to us again in Lutsk. Mother was in Crimea. Father could not persuade his four brothers and three sisters, each with their families, to leave town. Father set me on the frame of his bicycle and we left town toward east. By the 12dec42 all these relatives were dead in a common grave with the other 18,000 Jews of Lutsk.Our story though is not as horrible. Our suffering was not as severe and prolonged as Felix's. All the details mentioned in his story are credible. Moreover, I say that were it not for the continuous danger of being caught and killed, the people in the grave under the Puchalsky's bedroom would not be able to stay sane. The adrenalin kept them going.The rebirth after the 17-months encapsulation is nothing short of remarkable. Again, the story is natural, honest and credible. The education, scientific achievements and business success of the young and mature Dr. Zandman are as remarkable as they are credible. He is never boasting. He is honest about his shortcomings and mistakes. The reader ends up full of admiration for the man and may use his experience to avoid mistakes in life and business.On personal examples, the book teaches honesty, endurance, heroism, prudence, charity, leadership and humanity.I am a slow reader, yet I swallowed the book during a week-long cruise with 14 family members in the Mediterranean. I view the book as an asset in my education.I hope to meet Dr. Felix Zandman these days and present to him my book Smiling for Profit available here at Amazon. That way, I would help him to sustain the success of his enterprise indefinitely beyond his retirement."},{"Title":"NEVER THE LAST JOURNEY","review":"It was as good as new and it had author's signature!

While many fantasies are set in a medievel style backround, this one uses an 18th century-frontier type world for the setting. It has lots of action, and the main characters move quickly from one adventure to the next while in pursuit of their goal. It is a unique world and story."},{"Title":"Do Dandelions Grow on the Moon","review":"This is the best fantasy book I have ever read! It has far more depth and edge than the Harry Potter series, and the characters and story are far more brilliant than ever the Lord of the Rings series. Popiela has put strict limits on the description of his fantasy world, and instead allowed the chemistry and personalities of the two main characters Kara and Hobbes motivate the plot. The story is ripe with symbolism but doesn't skimp on the action and adventure. If you're looking for a fantasy fiction story with more flavor than Harry Potter with out the wordy boredom of Tolkien, this is the one for you."},{"Title":"Media Semiotics: An Introduction, Second Edition","review":"A good intro for those who haven't read any semiotics or structuralism, but it will be boring for those who have read some of the theory. The main problem with the book is that the author is British and uses examples of British TV shows and magazines that the non-British (i.e. American for myself) reader will not be familiar with. One can still get the basic point of his examples, but it might have been better to use sources that were not so geographically isolated."},{"Title":"Shigeru Ban","review":"Shigeru Ban is famous for his innovative use of building materials, structural rigor and pureness. This book captures all these quintessential attributes of this ingenious architect.The editor did a great job of organizing Ban's projects according to the building materials (i.e., paper, wood, bamboo, prefab, and skin). Multiple projects in each chapter form a coherent and articulated presentation of how Ban took advantage of the uniquessness of certain material and incorporated it into his architectural philosophy and aesthetics.The text is technical oriented which often includes the characteristics of the materials and the issues concerning structural engineering. At the end of most chapters, you can find detailed technical information and test statistics of the building materials used in the featured projects. Moreover, at the beginning of the book, Ban also contributed an article on the whole building process of building his classic work: Japanese Pavillion, which is very informative and instructive.Another noteworthy strength of this book is that it reveals the connectness of Ban's different projects and shows how the architect developed and built his own architectural style programmatically (e.g., How he developed, refined, and matured the paper architecture, the furniture house idea, the ivy structure, and the universal floor plan through several dozens of projects).Put together, this is a well-organized, thoughtful, and informative book about Ban's contribution to the international architectural community. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Shigeru Ban","review":"The book itself is almost the perfect monograph. Each project is described concisely, and it has all the drawings and photos to orient the reader to the site, the program and the idea. The drawings and photos range from the finest detail to the biggest gestures, and doesn't isolate the projects like they're pristine objects. The photos often emphasize the construction or assembly of the work, though the finished photos and model shots are expressive and informative too. The pages with experimental and test calculations are well-organized and relate back to specific projects and details, using graphs, tables and pictures or drawings of the elements or details in question. For a non-engineer, it's all rather clear and convincing. I've never seen ideas and processes presented so rationally and convincingly. Nothing here seems superfluous and Ban reveals his process and interests completely to the reader.Of course, the projects themselves are fantastic. John Hedjuk's influence is all over the work, and I dare say that Ban's actualized projects are now richer, have reached greater depth and are more expressive and informative than his mentor's. On one level, you could imagine that Ban's preoccupation with wood products, \\"green\\" construction and sustainable design started as a bad pun that served as the basis of his student thesis. (\\"Paper Architecture.\\" Ha-ha.) But the rigor and depth that he brings to each project break through any temptation to show self-conscious irony or superficiality. At the end of the day, he's an architect's architect who controls proportion and light, defines space and considers human scale in all his work. He makes Calatrava look like \\"just\\" an engineer. And his works aren't just formal exercises with nine square grids and such. His ideas and works begin to touch on politics without seeming pretentious or partisan with his refugeee shelters and other more recent work (although those private houses do present a counterpoint to the socially-oriented work in more ways than one).Anyway, great book, great work. I'm totally convinced of Ban's skills and talent."},{"Title":"Shigeru Ban","review":"The fact that this book comes with real explanation and plans of the proyects is why it was chosen above all others... arquitects don't read pictures, they read plans..."},{"Title":"Shigeru Ban","review":"I really enjoyed this book due to its in-depth investigation on the designs of Shigeru Ban. Ample in the book is photographs as well as technical drawings such as plans and sections. The mentioned technical drawings are not small enough that you can't read them but they aren't very big either. The pictures itself is printed on high quality paper which contributes to the overall readability. It should be noted that much of the photographs and diagrams could be found on Shigeru Ban's own website though this shouldn't be a deterrent since there are also much information that isn't posted on his website that is included in the book.As such, i found this book to have more of a focus on the structural nature of Ban's materials as there is a section at the end of every chapter noting the structural tests and strength of the materials used. This certainly isn't a bad thing considering it is an architect's job to make sure that a building that he/she designs is one that stand up to the forces of nature. However, laymen could be turned off by these end of the chapter sections. Furthermore, detailed and exploded axonometric drawings are scattered in this book that show the structure of the building which is a definite plus.One should note that this book was first published 2003 so it doesn't have much of Ban's latest works but that shouldn't deter anyone from purchasing this book as it still have a lot of positive aspectsThis is definitely one of Phaidon's better architectural monographs and should serve to inspire and inform."},{"Title":"Shigeru Ban","review":"Excellent book,interesting, useful not only for architectors but for anybody. good print quality."},{"Title":"Shigeru Ban","review":"the work of this interessant japanese architect, it's a demonstration of a continuated and progressive developmente of an architecture beautifull and deep."},{"Title":"Through five hundred years: A popular history of the Moravian Church","review":"This book, although dry, is a must for anyone who desires to know more about the Moravian church and its missions.

Ramon teaches the boy, who is the son of his patron, how to care for a herd in the harsh terrain of the desert. The boy learns about sheep and sandstorms, rattlesnakes and wolves; he also learns about friendship and loss, bravery and cool-headed wisdom.

Has nice drawings too."},{"Title":"Old Ramon","review":"(While the title of this review highlights the American Southwest, it could be sent in Mexico or other areas of Latin America.)This short book packed a great deal in a few pages. The characters - old shepherd, young boy, old dog, young dog, and multiple sheep - are introduced gradually, as is the world they live in. In both writing, subject matter, and illustrations, the book strongly evoked the works of Glen Rounds.I especially appreciated the matter-of-fact relationship between the animals and the humans. To me, a true partnership and interdependence was portrayed. However, more modern audiences may react less favorably to certain story elements (death of animals, memories of neglect of animals resulting in death, and humans physically striking animals.)"},{"Title":"Prince Charming M D (Prescription: Marriage) (Silhouette Special Edition)","review":"Loved this book. She's sworn off doctors and one doctor, especially: the hero. But then they get stuck together at a sensitivity seminar where they each have to carry an egg around and treat it like their newborn baby for the whole weekend. Turns out, he's more sensitive than she thought -- and every bit as sexy as she remembered. This book was warm and funny; another winner from Ms. Mallery. I love this Prescription: Marriage series. Can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Prince Charming M D (Prescription: Marriage) (Silhouette Special Edition)","review":"I enjoy almost everything Susan Mallery writes, and this book is no exception. The heroine in this book, Dana Rowan, can be a pain sometimes with both her stubborn refusal to believe that the hero, Trevor MacAllister, is genuinely interested in her and how quick she is to judge him in the negative when she hears rumors swirl about his dating life (which, in fact, is non-existent).The rumors take on a life of their own, and they get WAY out of hand, both in the book and in distracting away from the romance plot. That said, Trevor is the book's saving grace. He is a tall, dark and handsome doctor with a playboy reputation...that is completely unwarranted. He just returned to his hometown to work at the hospital where Dana is a nurse. After many exchanges rife with sexual tension, plus a week at a management training seminar together where things get er...out of hand one night, he finally gets through to Dana that he wants to date her. He's trying to take it slow with Dana, who was his high school sweetheart before a huge misunderstanding splits them up, because he wants her to see him as a man and not as his reputation, and the tenderness and vulnerability he displays make me want to gobble him up.Overall, I'd give this book 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4. I was halfway in love with Trevor myself and ready to kick the heroine sometimes for her too-quick-to-judge moments and the times she believed all of the rumors, despite Trevor's insistence they were painting him far blacker than reality. However, like I said, the romance in the end is sweet, and let's just say they imbue an egg (an exercise that is part of the management training seminar) with plenty of personality and humor.*****FROM THE BACK OF THE BOOK:HOSPITAL HEARTBREAKERTrevor MacAllister, M.D. - a.k.a. \\"Dr. Love\\" - was a living legend. A brilliant surgeon - and so sexy he made grown women whimper.

Based on that experience, I doubt this book would have done much good at all in learning to operate the program. Where I found it useful is in its overview and presentation. It does a great job of explaining broad concepts and giving a feel for the capabilities of the program. It also give some of the very basics of the mechanics of how to edit. I suspect I will find this book useful as a continuing reference not to explain the particulars of how to do something but to explain conceptually what can be done.

As a longtime Premiere (and now Premiere Pro) user, I found it very easy (there's that word again) to search through the book and find references to tools or procedures that needed \\"refreshing\\" in my mind. Even if you use Premiere Pro everyday, you don't use every tool or technique on every project, so the help file and good reference books like this are essential when deadlines are looming or you are just experimenting with new ways to jazz up your videos. The descriptions are easier to follow and are better organized than the online help included with the program. They often go well beyond the information that Adobe includes in the help files.Aiding me in my searches (and for new users, making Premiere Pro easier to understand) are the book's graphics. The graphics used for the screenshots in this book are, in a word, spectacular. They are crisp, clear and large enough so that even a casual viewing conveys lots of information immediately.

Although the tragedy she creates has a moral &quot;told you so&quot; aspect hard for modern readers to take, it also has the pathetic grandeur of the great tragedies -- small, pointless faults and actions which lead to irreversible pain. The humanity of Inchbald's insight is what makes this book one of my favorites among the 18th century women writers."},{"Title":"A simple story","review":"Those who like Austen, Edgeworth, and Burney will enjoy this novel by Mrs. Inchbald. The primary characters of Mr. Dorriforth and Miss Milner are written with such humanity and honesty rather than cliched caricatures. (Warning: spoiler alert) Of particular notice is Inchbald's treatment of the adulterous or \\"fallen\\" wife. It is quite different than the other portayals given in other 17th and early 18th century novels. Inchbald makes neither a villainess nor a martyr out of Miss Milner (Lady Elmwood), but shows her as a victim of being brought up to be selfish and spoiled. The reader finds themselves rooting for Miss Milner's reform due to her many good qualities and her sincere and ardent love for her husband. You find yourself alternately pitying her and being disgusted by her. Yet the image of her that is left is that of a true penitent. Dorriforth's weakneses are explored as well and his transformation into an unmerciful tyrant as a result of her betrayal is an interesting plot twist of Inchbald's. By the end of the novel, Mrs. Incbald succeeds in convincing her reader to lament the spoiled and indulged upbringing of Miss Milner and to ponder what could have been if she had been raised differently."},{"Title":"A simple story","review":"Inchbald has a great talent with words. This books is insightful, provocative and dramatic.

I have enjoyed it ever since. There are two things in this book about German wine that make it extraordinary, the maps and the photographs.Detailed maps show the location of the vineyards in relationship to the wine-producing towns. So when one buys a bottle of German wine in the United States, he or she can read the label, for example, on a bottle of Muellheimer Sonnenlay and locate the Sonnenlay vineyard near the town of Muellheim on the appropriate map.The photographs in this book are beautiful. One example would be the picture of the market place in Trier, the so-called oldest town in Germany. There are also photos of the rivers, the towns, and the vineyards.I have visited some of the wine-producing towns on the Mosel and some on the Mittelrhein and sampled wines. For me, these are some of the best wines in Germany. On the Mosel, from personal experience, the towns of Zell, Bernkastel-Kues, and Piesport offer outstanding wines, and they are worth a visit. On the Rhine, my favorite wine town is Bacharach, which produces some equally good wine. The coverage of these towns in the book is, in my opinion, very good.In his book, Stuart Pigott also clarifies the \\"Praedikat\\" system, used for classifying wine types, such as \\"Spaetlese\\" und \\"Auslese\\", according to the level of grape sugar in them. He also lists the names of some of the wine estates for each area with a comment on them, as well as the phone number, for those who wish to visit. Pigott also reluctantly points out a few German wines that are not what they are supposed to be. An example is Piesporter Michelsberg, most of which is not even from a Piesport vineyard. I have seen this in good wine sections in stores in the United States next to the authentic and fine Piesporter Goldtroepchen.Even if the reader is not particularly interested in wine, the book provides a good deal of information about the towns along the Mosel and Rhine rivers, and it can be used to help plan trips. As mentioned, there are photos of many of the towns with a description of the high points, along with some recommended hotels and restaurants.On the whole, from my own experience traveling in Germany and tasting numerous wines, I think this is an excellent book for understanding German wines and equally good for planning trips to some of the most interesting towns in some of the most beautiful river valleys in Germany."},{"Title":"Touring In Wine Country: Mosel & Rheing","review":"Another reviewer accurately described this book as an excellent guide for wine enthusiasts. It's certainly that, but I'd be tempted to recommend this book even if you're so-so about wine.That's because this travel book is straightforward and honest in its opinions; it says that the view from a restaurant is excellent but the food is only so-so, or just stick to their fish entrees. As a result, when the book does gush you know that it's sincerely meant, not an unrelenting PR spin about the expected tourist stops.The book isn't perfect, however. One thing it lacks (as do most other Germany guide books) is any sense of distance between places; an occasional &quot;only a 20-minute drive away&quot; would have helped immeasurably.We all have a limited amount of time available on our vacations; this book helped us use that time wisely."},{"Title":"Oracle Databases on the Web: Learn to Create Web Pages That Interface with Database Engines","review":"While most of the Oracle Web books focus on Java and other insignificant details, this was the only one that I found that had a simple, clear explaination of creating Web pages with Oracle."},{"Title":"Oracle Databases on the Web: Learn to Create Web Pages That Interface with Database Engines","review":"To address a few points made in some of the reviews of 'Oracle Databases on the Web', I would like to first point out that this book was written PRIOR to most of Oracle's own written documentation on Oracle WebServer and prior to any online documentation.

It was reviewed by an Oracle VP who was thrilled with its content, which led to subsequent major orders for the book by Oracle's Business Partner Alliance.

The book is the diary of a radio man's journey from WWII London (via steamer out of Liverpool on August 27, 1941) to his new position as Director of Talks & Productions for the Malaya Broadcasting Corporation in Singapore. Playfair's lightly historical narrative is filled with local color, well-done descriptons of his surroundings, and insight into the inner workings of a radio broadcast station during wartime. The book concludes with details of the hastily arranged escape of MBC's staff from the island. Playfair wrote: \\"I had my last look at Singapore on the night of February 11, 1942. Fierce fires were burning and it looked as if the whole island were in flames, as if some fearful biblical vengeance had been visited on the place where we had left behind the routine of our lives and nearly all of our worldly possessions.\\" The final chapter about their escape, the Epilogue and the Appendix (a concise, one-page overview of MBC) were a fitting end to a fun read.

Parks has his moments of deepness and the reality of his experiences stand on thier own but this young brotha made me laugh at things i never felt were humorous. His essays, &quot;Blockbuster versus Bankbuster&quot; and &quot;Where Are All The Single Black Women?&quot; had me in tears.

He takes you through several periods of his own life, and each page you turn reveals a different layer. Park's book allows you to see the warm, funny, angry, compassionate sides of a man. It even allows you to see vulnerability, which increases the impact of this man's words. His outspoken essays are thought provoking, and so are each of his poetic tributes on life, love, loss, and strength. You get to grow with him as you experience his life through his words, and it is a compilation of work that everyone can truly vibe with, no matter your age.

Although harsh at times, it kind of brings a certain reality into perspective. I beleive that many of us live two or more lives, a professional life of today in 2001, and another life at home that has been passed to you from generation to generation. Mr. Parks put both lives together in fine print for all to see, like it or not. That's the beuty and the brutality of it. He kind of made me feel like there were hidden messages between the words that either you saw or you didn't but either way the overall outcome was what you wanted it to be. The effect this book had on me was more than just the pleasure of reading a different reality on life, but it served me as a motivator to get me to express myself somehow. It was very motivating and entertaining. It shows a true freedom of expression to it. I like how he left everything up to the reader to interpret, giving anyone and everyone a different understanding of what Mr. Parks was trying to say. This is definately one of those books that you could read over and over and truly get something different out of it everytime you read it.

Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"Part of me hates to write a less-than-flattering review about a book like this. Author Edward Bonekemper sets out to paint a picture of Ulysses S. Grant that is contrary to the image of a reckless commander who ruthlessly squandered his men and defeated Robert E. Lee by sheer superiority of resources alone. Instead he claims that Grant was an able and visionary general who had what it took to win the Civil War. I agree with Bonekemper's view and, as such, agree with the book.So why rate it so low? Well, unfortunately I found little original or compelling in Bonekemper's views. That Grant was not a butcher is an argument that has been set forth several times by many able historians, and the fact that Bonekemper frequently cites them, instead of digging up his own primary research, is evidence of the fact that this was not a book that needed to be written (again). Bonekemper makes particular use of the work of Jean Edward Smith and T. Harry Williams in his analysis of Grant, which begs the question: why not just read their stuff instead?That's a question I can't answer. To me this book read like a high school book report-a summary of the work of other historians with little original insight. Even the accounts of battles and campaigns were so lacking in detail as to be completely unsatisfying (reading of the battle of Shiloh was particularly painful, as most of the important details of the battle are skimmed over or omitted completely). The unfortunate result, for me, was a book that left much to be desired and just seemed a waste of time.There are many in-depth analyses of Grant that paint him as a victor rather than a butcher. I see relatively little purpose for this book and really no reason for anyone with an interest in Grant or Civil War history in general to read it."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"Historical myth, especially those connected to the Civil War, are not easily changed. Decades of authors have tried to embellish a myth until it is accepted as fact. Mr. Bonekemper does an excellent job of pulling together statistics, details and opinions concerning Ulysses Grant and then analyzing what these really mean. A case is meticulously built that Grant was a brilliant leader and apparently the only general who had an overall view of what needed to be done and how it would be accomplished. He not only understood the military actions needed on the battlefield but the political implications to Washington. Mr. Bonekemper refutes the myth that Grant was a butcher and shows how he generally minimized his overall loses by understanding the \\"big picture\\" and changing tactics when needed to overcome his opposition. The book is easy to follow and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"Bonekemper follows in the shoes of JFC Fuller and T. Harry Williams who long ago argued that Ulysses Grant was the preeminent soldier of the Civil War. For nearly 100 years, the rise of the Lost Cause mentality has obscured Grant's true brilliance as a general and his great rival, Lee, has been elevated to near demi-God status. Bonekemper dispenses with such nonsense and shows, point by point, how Grant won the Civil War. He did so because he was a military genius and possessed rare gifts of stubbornness, intelligence, daring, patience and sheer nerve. The fans of Robert E. Lee will be reaching for their smelling salts when they pick up this tome!The book is not heavy on statistics or details and those who dislike plodding military narratives will still find something to like here. Bonekemper's &quot;Appendix I&quot; is especially interesting, particularly for those who are familiar with Grant literature from the past. It's interesting to read his opinions on some of the recent spate of Grant biographers. Equally impressive is Bonekemper's list of Grant's &quot;Attributes&quot; which he lists in descending order. Among these are modesty, the dis-inclination to constantly demand reinforcements (which is what contributed to McClellan's downfall), and a stubborn tenacity. Bonekemper brilliantly refutes the tired old adage that Grant was a butcher who was injudicious with the lives of his men. Borrowing stats from McWhiney and Fuller, he clearly demonstrates that General Lee lost far more men in proportion than did Grant.My only criticism is that Bonekemper inexplicably describes Grant as &quot;an alcoholic.&quot; He should have known better, because it's simply untrue. Grant drank and imbibed too much early in his army career, almost always when separated from his much-adored wife. He also got drunk on occasion in the ACW, but it didn't interfere with his service career and was borne out of a need to be with Julia. No serious historian of the past 50 years has described Grant as an alcoholic and it's disappointing that Bonekemper follows suit. This is an odd inclusion, particularly when he states that &quot;alcoholism made him a better general.&quot; This is a theory borrowed from McPherson and should have been omitted.Aside from this small lapse, the remainder of the book is a grand exercise in proving what Grant students have long known: this man was one awesome soldier! Kudos to Bonekemper from proving this point so thoroughly."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"Bonekemper presents a sympathetic, fast-moving portrait of US Grant's exceptional abilities and personal character. I admired Grant more and more while reading this book.Like many reviewers of Bonekemper's works on the Civil War, I find weaknesses of Bonekemper's presentation to be the dearth of maps to illustrate battles and campaigns, and the partisan presentation of (what should be) objective facts. Bonekemper's education, while excellent, apparently was weak on non-partisan presentation of facts. Throughout this book, Bonekemper focuses on his thesis statement (crudely put, \\"Grant good, Lee bad\\") and attempts to hammer it home ad infinitum. This is acceptable as long as objectivity is maintained; when objectivity is compromised, scholarship is compromised.A good example of this sort of authorial pitfall is Tolstoy's protracted rant (at the end of War and Peace) about the ineptness [?] of Napoleon's generalship. At best, both Tolstoy and Bonekemper, whatever their other virtues, give the impression of being curmudgeonly armchair generals. But Tolstoy was writing fiction while Bonekemper is writing nonfiction: thus Bonekemper cannot afford Tolstoy's self-indulgence and, unlike Tolstoy, Bonekemper does not sequester his armchair generalship from the main body of his work; rather, he weaves it through the fabric of his story.Just one specific example: At Spotsylvania Courthouse, the author asserts General Lee's withdrawal of his artillery from a commanding height the night before the battle was a mistake; the author next asserts that Lee's situating his artillery on that same height the morning of the battle was a mistake, too. Why? Bonekemper leaves you to wonder. He doesn't explain. He doesn't bring in any additional information that might have motivated Lee's decision. It's a simple declaration; it was a mistake both times. Take it or leave it. What you're left with is the vague impression that whatever Lee did was a mistake in Bonekemper's judgment. Your repeated encounters with such textual sphinxes gradually erode your confidence in Bonekemper's objectivity.Contra Bonekemper's thesis (\\"Grant good, Lee bad\\") is the obvious fact that Grant's first contact with Lee was at the Second Battle of the Wilderness, in May 1864. By that time, Union numbers in men and materiele were overwhelming; also, the Army of Northern Virginia was no longer what it once had been - Stonewall Jackson and Jeb Stuart both gone by that time.Being an author of historical nonfiction certainly requires enthusiasm, but it also requires objectivity. Bonekemper scores A+ for enthusiasm, D+ for objectivity.Recommended with provisos noted."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"This is a well written book covering the campaigns and military career of U.S. Grant during the civil war.Chapter 12 and the appendixes give a solid analysis of what made Grant a success and offers a great discussion of the attacks upon his record by his detractors.Included within the book are statistical analysis demonstrating the losses suffered by Grant's armies were not out of proportion, especially when viewed in contrast to those suffered by Lee and his other opponents.This book brings forth in a very readable style how and why Grant was a success as a general. It should be enjoyed by the novice and the expert on the subject of Grant's civil war career."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S.

Very easy reading and exciting."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"Mr. Bonekemper has again attacked a historical myth, this time that General U. S. Grant was a butcher who suceeded against Generral Robert E. Lee merely by brute force of arms and overwhelming numbers. This book builds a persuasive case that, at least im military matters, Grant was a able, even brilliant leader who understood his profession throughly and was attuned to the politicalconsequences of his actions on the battlefield as well. The book proves the case that Grant deserved to be treated more fairly by popular history, and at the same time is a good review of the essense of all of Grant's campaigns."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"I found this book thoroughly enjoyable. While I never thought of Grant as a &quot;butcher&quot;, it gave me new insight into his merits as a commander and a person. It brought out a number of things that I had read in other contexts relating to the failings of other civil war generals and highlighted the strengths of Grant in avoiding their problems.It was easy to read and understand. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"Perhaps it is the American tradition of rooting for the underdog. Perhaps it is the influence of movies like 'Gone With the Wind' that have created a golden image of the south (In spite of the South's Peculiar Institution - Slavery.) But for whatever reason, Robert E. Lee has been raised to almost God like esteem, while Grant has been considered a drunken butcher.Of late, the reputation of Lee has suffered some. Incidents like Picketts Charge have been looked more closely in the reliaziation that Lee's most trusted Liutenant, Longstreet recommended against the Gettysburg campaign so heavily.It is good to see that Grant is getting a new look. He led a masterful series of military campaigns, often over the objections of his superiors such as Hallack. And in the end, he won the war. Dr. Bonekemper does not go into the troubles Grant had as a civilian, either before the war or during his presidency. But after all, this is not a biography of Grant but a military history. Well done, well written, highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"Sooner or later, a student of the American Civil War is confronted with seemingly irreconcilable portraits of Ulysses S. Grant. One paints Grant as something of a vicious dullard, capable only of bludgeoning his enemy to submission with the brute force of vastly superior numbers of Union soldiers. As this picture has it, he sacrifices needlessly the limbs and lives of Union men in repetitive, horrendously brutal attacks upon the cornered enemy who happen to be fellow Americans.The other image is that of a military genius who prevailed through superior strategy and tactical prowess. Writers advancing this vision contend that Grant recognized and understood the need of the Lincoln administration for battlefield successes to retain popular support for the war effort and win the 1864 election. By focusing on Confederate armies instead of cities, goes this line, he achieved the necessary victories, ultimately bringing the war to a successful conclusion. In doing so, it necessarily follows, Grant succeeded where others had failed, saved the Union and avoided even greater numbers of battlefield deaths.In &quot;Victor, Not a Butcher&quot; Ed Bonekemper does much to resolve these competing and conflicting images of Grant. Reciting Grant's Civil War record from Belmont to Appomattox, Bonekemper makes a forceful case that Grant was crucial to keeping the Union intact. Bonekemper demonstrates convincingly that Grant actually spent the lives of his men less freely than did his Confederate enemy counterparts. And he provides the numbers to support this assertion. Along the way, Bonekemper provides insightful analyses of the 1864 election and the treatment of Grant by other historians. The later, in particular, assists in understanding why and how these reverse portrayals of Grant developed over time and with the changing lens of historical perspective.All in all, &quot;Victor&quot; is an enjoyable and thoroughly readable book. It is accessible by novice and expert alike. Both will benefit from Bonekemper's unvarnished recital of Grant's accomplishments and reverses. His unbiased conclusions are persuasive. This reader, for one, is convinced."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"This book is a short biography of U.S. Grant (see below for a discussion of the book's length). The author provides a brief overview of the subject's life, with his pre-war life consuming one short chapter, and his post-war life being essentially ignored. The remainder of the book consists of a cursory recounting of Grant's campaigns as a general during the Civil War, with the intent of discussing whether he was a good general or not. Well-read Civil War buffs will recognize a remix of the comparitive biography written by the British military historian J.F.C. Fuller 80+ years ago. If the author brings anything new to the subject, it's that he has a good command of the scholarship that's been done since, and considerable statistical analysis of the losses Grant's armies suffered during the war, with an emphasis on comparison with Robert E. Lee. Lee doesn't come off that well in this comparison, as readers of \\"Attack and Die\\" and Fuller's book will expect. Neo-Confederate readers and writers will of course protest.But to return to the book, it's very little in the way of biography and a great deal on the subject of what a good general Grant was. Bonekemper even manages (sort of) to take the edge off of the attacks that Grant himself, in his memoirs, said he regretted, namely the attack at Vicksburg and of course Cold Harbor. Bonekemper insists that Cold Harbor especially has been exaggerated, with some historians putting the Union casualties as high as 11,000, when in fact Bonekemper insists that they should be closer to just above 6,000, with about half that falling in the first assault (where some historians have insisted 7,000 men fell in as little as 8 minutes). Bonekemper argues this and other points eloquently, and I only noted a few times when he seemed to be cutting Grant more slack than was reasonable. In the discussion of the Battle of the Crater, he blames the switching out of the USCT division on Meade exclusively, when most historians agree that Grant was equally responsible.This book is somewhat deceptive in terms of length. It's 452 pages long, but the actual narrative text is 266 pages in length. There are several long appendices afterwards, one with extensive tables laying out casualty figures for Grant's armies as reported by lots of different historians. Wide margins at top, bottom, and the sides of the pages, wide spaces between the lines, and a large font, mean that this book doesn't have that much content. There aren't that many maps, but the illustration section is paged also, adding to the total in a fashion most books don't. As a result, this is really not a very long book, it just looks that way.I still enjoyed this book. I tend to enjoy, at times, books that present an argument, as opposed to those that just try and relate a series of events. Yes, argumentative books are biased, but at least you know what the bias is going in. That makes it easier (in my mind, anyway) to spot unreasonable bias, when the author tries to shade the truth to fit their version of events. Frankly, I didn't see that much of that here, and the result is a very interesting book, with a pretty unusual point of view. Highly recommended to history buffs."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"A decently written book that explores the thesis, advertised in the title, that Ulysses S. Grant was \\"A Victor not a Butcher\\" as general. Certainly, I see sense in this thesis. His bold attack on Vicksburg is a wonderful piece of work. His tenacity in the campaign in Virginia in 1864 and 1865 is another testimony to his generalship. But this is scarcely a novel thesis. Many others have made the same point. He learned as the war went along. An initial succcess at Belmont deteriorated, and Grant learned from this.A victor? He was the only general in the war to \\"bag\\" three opposing armies (Vicksburg, Fort Donelson, Appamattox Court House). But that tale has been told by others.And there is often something of a lack of detail. The battle at the Wilderness is briefly covered; the offensive movement towasrd Richmond and the South at the end of the battle has some discussion, but that discussion is rather brief and is better (and more dramatically) told elsewhere.Some nice features: a notation (in Appendix II) of casualties in Grant's campaigns. Overall, his figures in dead/wounded/missing/captured are pretty good. The last chapter lists some of those characteristics (such as the ability to write clear and simple orders in the heat of battle) that made him a fine general.Overall, a worthwhile book, but not a pathbreaking work. It makes its point (well made elsewhere) and does not provide much detailed discussion of the battlea and their aftermaths."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"One of my favorite figures from American history is Ulysses S. Grant. He was the greatest general of the Civil War, and perhaps in American history, with three Confederate armies surrendering to him. He was not such a great president, though better than most give him credit for being. The corruption in American politics during his administration was not his fault and, in fact, was endemic throughout the country. He did stand up for the rights of the freedmen and the native Americans, and this perhaps along with his victory over Lee accounts for the hostility with which many contemporary and Southern sympathizing historians have treated him. It is all too commonly believed, even today, that Grant was a butcher who defeated Lee by sheer weight of numbers, without regard to the casualties he inflicted.Therefore, it was a real treat to read Edward H. Bomekemper's Ulysses S. Grant: a Victor, Not a Butcher. Bonekemper shows conclusively that far from being a butcher, Grant was, in fact a master of strategy and misdirection. In his western campaigns, Grant skillfully achieved his goals; the capture of Vicksburg and the Mississippi, driving the Confederates out of Tennessee, etc. with a minimum of casualties. The toll was heavier in the east, against Lee, but as Bonekemper points out, while Grant suffered as many deaths in the eighteen months he commanded the Army of the Potomac as all of the previous commanders had in three years, nevertheless, Grant had developed a winning strategy on a national level, which coordinated with Sherman's march to the sea brought the South to its knees.Some reviewers have commented that Bonekemper brings nothing new in this book, no new research or any revelations to one already familiar to the course of the Civil War. This is true, but I think it serves as a helpful introduction to a sometimes-neglected military genius."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"Whether Grant is an \\"overlooked military genius\\" is in itself a doubtful premise - however, this book was very disappointing - lacking depth, analysis, insight or the kind of narrative writing that can render even a well known subject interesting. The complexities of the Civil War are great - just the two months of March and April 1864 alone are worth a book in Grant's career. This is just too simplistic of a book to be taken as serious or even enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone. I have read many Civil War books and I would rate this book as one of the best, if not the best, book I have read. U. S. Grant was a Military Genius and should be recognize as such."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"Boy, does this author have a bone to pick with General Robert E. Lee of the American Civil War. Having knocked Lee from his revered pedestal in a previous book, Bonekemper now polishes up the reputation of his final adversary, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant.This book is not a study but an argument. The author is a passionate proponent of his ideas. It is easy to follow the clear and trenchant prose. It flows right along, from one point damning Grant's legions of contemporary and historical critics in the East or South to another. In contrast to his book on Lee as a loser with faulty strategy, or comments on other lesser lights, the author here ticks off his protagonist's winning characteristics in personality, tactics, strategy, and overall vision. If you happen to be a partisan of certain Civil War generals, campaigns, regions, or historians, he may get your dander up.Beyond the obvious, that Grant was a military winner--over and over, as Bonekemper shows us how--the author argues he did it with a minimum of losses compared to most other generals. Hence not the \\"butcher\\" of reputation, especially in the early years when he was campaigning in the spacious \\"West\\" or mid-continent that allowed rapid maneuver. To make this argument, Bonekemper emphasizes \\"losses\\" rather than \\"casualties.\\" Against Grant's often large casualties (since he was usually on the offense--beating the opponent to the punch--or came with more men) the author counterpoises captures. That is, Grant looks best when we include the fact he was the first to capture three entire armies (at Ft. Donelson, Vicksburg, Appomattox) as among the \\"losses\\" he inflicted on his enemies. While the Rebels, with their smaller pool of manpower, certainly could not afford these lost men, I think many of Grant's prisoners were paroled and later returned to battle. So Grant's numbers are not so good as the author makes out. Nevertheless, credit Bonekemper with compiling many studies by others to assess the vexed question of the numbers of killed, wounded, captured, and missing on both sides of Grant's many battles. It is thus easy to choose your own definition of \\"losses,\\" and evaluate the contesting generals accordingly."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"Edward Bonekemper's \\"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S Grant's Overlooked Military Genius\\" explodes the myth of General Grant as a butcher of Union troops while Robert E. Lee was a military leader of unparalleled genius. The author is cloyingly effusive in praising Grant (yes, he was great, no doubt about that) throughout the book, but it does not detract from the hard facts that the final commander of Union forces in the US Civil War was the man who took the war to the enemy and brought hostilities to a violent but conclusive end.Bonekemper points out that contrary to the myth of butchering his men, Grant generally suffered fewer losses amongst his men than his enemies. Where he did take significant losses--the Overland Campaign, Cold Harbor and the Appomattox Campaign--these were proportionate to the tasks at hand. Grant was aggressive, forward-thinking and kept a national overview of the war in mind as he pressed on rebel forces before him relentlessly.The author deals a particularly sharp blow to the Lost Cause mythologizing of Robert E Lee: As commander of all rebel forces Lee's main strategic objective was to not lose. It was the Union's job to recover the South and bring it back into the Union. Bonekemper points out that General Lee, thinking myopically only of Virginia and the eastern theater of operations, needed only to not lose, but went for the win and lost. General Grant, thinking nationally, went for the big win by destroying rebel forces and won.One main detractor is that according to the author, Grant could do no wrong. Nevertheless, \\"A Victor, Not a Butcher\\" is a strongly argued book on the continuing rehabilitation of General Ulysses S. Grant's successful military career."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"The author provides a different pespective regarding the relative generalship of Grant and Lee. One of the most interesting feature is a comparison of the casualties substained by each side during Grant's overland campaign. Most civil war books that I have read focused almost exclusively on the high casualty rate suffered by the Union army during that campaign while focusing very little on Confederate army casualties. Thus, Grant became known as a \\"Butcher\\". Given that for the most part during the Overland campaign the Confederates fought from defensive fotifications, while the Union was on the offense, the author's anaysis of the relative casualties for the Union and Confederate does not support the title \\"Butcher\\" for General Grant. A look at the relative position of both Armies, with the Confederates on the defense, the Union on the offense coupled with the ratio of casualties sustained by each Army,the author makes a compelling argument that Grant was indeed the better General."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"There are several solid biographies of US Grant available (not to mention his own memoirs), this is not one of them. And that is what this book is... Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","review":"Towards the end of the war Grant was losing 5000 troops per major engagment. Mary Todd Lincoln called him a butcher and wanted him removed. Abe wanted to end the war. Grant made no bones about his motive. To crush the south, and he did. I wonder if it was because he knew that sacrifice was necessary and with the Northern industrial complex behind the logistics and a draft in full swing (whew)... at that point Lincoln finally had a General who had the will to win at any cost. He could have won with one hand tied behind his back... the south was in poor shape. Yet Lee managed to give back worthily at just about every juncture, save Petersburg and the rear guard action into Appomatox. Was the book that good? No suprises here."},{"Title":"Gold: A Novel of the Sea","review":"P.C. Richmond's book GOLD is a great book for all armchair sailors and also for general readers.

This KM book provides a useful conceptual introduction to KM strategy, based on research carried out at leading U.S. and European companies.The primary audience for the book is managers involved in KM practices, and MBA students. The material is divided into 10 chapters, covering KM models, processes, planning, learning, technology infrastructure and measurement.The book includes a modest two-page list of references and a very useful ten-page questionnaire for assessing KM aptitude in an organization, covering issues like staff awareness, KM commitment, IT infrastructure, business culture, and KM measurement.The book is based on research carried out in 1999 and 2000 by a University of Surrey project. The material is peppered with sidebars containing actual quotes from strategists and managers at 28 U.S. and European companies like HP, Andersen, Swiss Re, Barclays Bank, Cap Gemini, Siemens, AstraZeneca, Reckitt&Coleman;, BP Amoco, KPMG, Buckman Labs, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Rolls-Royce, Nokia, Cable&Wireless;, NatWest, Procter&Gamble;, Ericsson and PowerGen.\\"KM has come to the fore over the last 8-10 years, progressively brought into centre-stage, driven by the networked economy through increased competition, mergers and acquisitions, and the all-invasive Internet. The net result of all this has been a far greater dynamism in the economy as a whole. People have greater access to information than they ever had before. There is a huge potential for learning at an accelerated pace, for change at an accelerated pace. What this has led to is a need to have a far more responsive organization,\\" the authors begin.Still, the authors caution that KM need not be a guarantee of success or survival, though it can certainly improve the odds. There is also the possibility that without proper planning, users may merely become \`information rich but knowledge poor.'The authors draw up numerous taxonomies of knowledge, such as tacit/explicit, embodied/embedded/represented, individual/institutional, static/dynamic, declarative/procedural, routine/non-routine, team-specific/strategic. KM can also extend outside organizational domains to suppliers and distributors, via alliance knowledge; cultural alignment and trust are key pre-requisites for such transfers.Contextually, KM is more organic and humanistic as compared to the various business strategy paradigms of the last few decades, such as portfolio management, sensitivity training, core competencies, TQM, and BPR.The human factor was underestimated in BPR, whose focus on process efficiencies often ignored opportunities for knowledge exchange among employees and with customers. One of the major shortcomings of TQM and QC philosophy was its narrow focus on problem solving, and not other corporate issues.McKinsey classifies KM buying behaviours into five kinds: conservative adopters (with basic KM functionality for cost savings), fast followers (deep KM functionality in a few critical processes), solution buyers (who prefer all-in-one solutions), self-sufficient integrators (market leaders), and business design innovators (driven by visionary leaders).KPMG identifies five stages in the maturity of KM culture and adoption in a company: knowledge chaotic (no structured KM approach), knowledge aware (basic cataloguing available), knowledge enabled (standardized processes implemented), knowledge managed (integrated KM culture, CKO), and knowledge centric (daily assessment and improvement of knowledge environment).From a KM practice perspective, Sveiby categorises four modes of knowledge conversion: embodied to embodied knowledge (sharing experiences and mental models, eg. apprenticeship), embodied to represented (eg. cookery books), represented to represented (eg. formal education, corporate universities), and represented to embodied (internalization).Hansen, Nohria and Tuerney identify two kinds of KM strategies: codification (re-use of knowledge bases) and personalization (encouraging people-to-people networking and mentoring).A key foundation of KM is nurturing and harnessing communities of practice, where knowledge is put into action. Useful tools here include organizational network analysis (ONA), based on employee answers to a wide range of questions about the conversations they normally indulge in at the workplace and outside. The output is the cross-functional sociogram, which can help identify key knowledge flows in an organization.Expertise directories and glossaries, knowledge coordinators, network events, online collaboration spaces, and storytelling of illustrative anecdotes are important roles and processes here.One chapter covers the KM matrix, a useful table with knowledge types on one axis (embedded, embodied, represented) and knowledge processes on the other (sense, organize, socialize, internalize). Accordingly, there are numerous KM activities (and enabling technologies) that arise, such as datamining, knowledge surveys, knowledge taxonomisation, groupware, e-learning, and workflow analysis.Some obstacles that may arise here include differing learning styles among employees, a \`hoarding mentality,' and work-related cultural differences (particularly for global organizations) related to power, individualism, gender, and ability to cope with ambiguity.On the technology front, content management is a major factor in the more efficient management of knowledge. Version control, document cross-referencing, library systems, security, bandwidth, interactivity and reusability are key considerations here.At the end of the day, measures for evaluating KM programmes will have to be applied, but the issues surrounding such intangible assets are not easily resolved. Assessing intellectual capital can cover not just financial returns but also customer satisfaction, employee profiles, business processes, and performance trends (i.e. human, structural and customer capital).Many of these perspectives and principles are based on the numerous examples cited throughout the book.\\"The main objective of KM is to arrange, orchestrate, and organize an environment in which people are invited and facilitated to apply, develop, share, combine and consolidate knowledge,\\" the authors conclude."},{"Title":"203 Ways to Drive a Man Wild in Bed","review":"I found that the book took an interesting angle (covering several pages), by tackling the issue of self-esteem to start out with. I didn't buy the book to be reminded, you should think you're sexy and you'll be sexy, ect... Although that is very important, I bought it with the strict idea of how to pleasure a man, with techniques of physical contact (in bed)in mind. The title is a bit misleading. Most of the book is dedicated to time outside the bedroom, setting the mood,and ways to make things less routine. It had less to do with the sex act itself, more to do with the events leading up to sex. It did spark some creative thoughts, but I think your own brain can conjure up some ideas just as well as this book. Far as going into detail about sexual acts for pleasing men, it was pretty basic.

I glanced through this very short book (only 129 pages) and all of a sudden I was embarrassed. I looked around, wondering if anybody else had seen what I'd had in hand and instantly locked onto Mrs. Doubtfire's disapproving glare. \\"Heh, heh,\\" I laughed. She didn't laugh back.I felt just like I did when I was in junior high school, buying one of those Midwood books from the local liquor store. In case you don't know what those books were, well let's just say the were written for men and were kind of steamy and graphic, some might say sleazy, others might call them dirty books.I grew up in California, so the liquor stores didn't open till six in the AM, but that was fine by me, because that was just about when I finished my paper route, so there wouldn't be anyone around to see me buy them, just the old guy who owned the place. However, one time I went in, got a couple of my dirty books, went to the register, only to find Miss Swayze, my third period Social Studies teacher, behind the counter. Turns out her father owned the store and wasn't able to open up that morning. I was so embarrassed, especially because Miss Swayze was hot. Every guy at Bancroft Junior High fantasized about her. I felt like I'd been caught doing something really bad.And that's how I felt holding this book under Mrs. Doubtfire's condemning glare, like a sneaky old reprobate, one of those guys who hangs around schools, sans any clothing at all, save a trench coat. I know it was completely irrational, but that's how I felt. Lickity split I picked up a couple other books, so it wouldn't look like I came in strictly for this one. The girl at the register started to check me out, running her scanner thingy over the bar codes until she got to the last book then she started to check ME out.\\"Research for a novel I'm working on,\\" I said.\\"Sure,\\" she said.When I got home I flopped on the couch and read the book and wowza did it ever open my eyes, turned 'em into silver dollar sized, bug-eyed circles.

Of course there is a lot more included in this book about how to drive a man wild in bed, but my head is still spinning and my mind is still stuck back on that \\"Oral Treats\\" chapter.

Whilst it is an excellent beginners guide, it would benefit from a glossary of commands and another chapter stepping through linking to and populating other office applications."},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"I have been doing computer systems and software for forty years and was looking for a training book for two new staff engineers who have engineering degrees but little programming experience. I ordered Andrew Parsons \\"Starter Kit\\" for this purpose and then ordered this book by Jerry Lee Ford as well. For reasons described below, I have selected this book, the Jerry Lee Ford book, to use for newbie training while reserving the Parsons book for those with prior programming experience.My first reaction was disappointment. There is no CD with an installable VB Express. Such a CD is handy for newbies even though the free download is there on the Microsoft site. Thumbing through the book with its large text, I thought perhaps it was written for ninth graders. (It is subtitled \\"for Absolute Beginners.\\") And the sample code applications were all simple games. I, like others, found lots of typos, like referring to Appendix A and Apendix B but forgetting to print them. If someone sees me reading this, they are going to think I am only a dummy or at best a hobbyist. BUT THEN IT GOT BETTER.I raced through the book and concluded that Mr. Ford, an exceptionally experienced VB teacher and writer, has distilled VB to its essential elements. The origins of the VB language, the .NET Framework, and Object Oriented Programing concepts were explained sufficiently and clearly along the way; but the heart of the book is the creation of several simple projects. Each start with a GUI (one or more user forms with one or more buttons or other controls), modifications of form and control properties (appearance and other), and code to do things when events happen (button clicks for example).The wonderfully easy features of drag and drop GUI design grab the reader's attention in the first third of the book as simple projects illustrate design of forms with controls, menus, and toolbars. A nice chapter on application interfaces has the reader create and publish an application and reminds the reader of the need to make the user comfortable and well informed during program execution.The middle third continues with simple applications but addresses coding procedure fundamentals. Not much has changed in the forty years since I had my first programming course, and the outline of the middle portion of the book could be from a 1960s Fortran course. Variable types, conditional logic, loops, and functions are still important topics and part of every common computer language and must be mastered for almost all real projects.The final third of the book begins with a nice explanation of the key object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism and adds chapters on graphics/audio, and debugging. The OOP's concepts fit nicely here now that the reader (not normally an experienced programmer) has used objects and has a good feel for the whole of project development. Only an experienced teacher, like the author, appreciates fully the importance of waiting until the student is ready. (If this section intrigues the reader, he may be a candidate for additional more difficult programming courses, but he will be well-started with this book.)I am glad I got over my first impressions. This book rocks (scratches and all) like an old Jerry Lee Ford (I mean Lewis) 45 RPM recording of \\"Great Balls of Fire.\\" I mean you can't miss the beat on that record and you can't miss the VB essentials in this book. This book would make a good text for a community college VB course."},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"This book is the best tutorial format book I've seen on programming VB. It starts with just a handfull of simple steps and behold, there's a real, live, working application. To be sure, it doesn't do much, but at least you have something working.I really like this approach. Within the first handfull of pages you've done something that makes sure the software is installed and working properly, you've been exposed to the IDE, you've seen (some of) the syntax of the language.From here you have the basic foundation to move on to learning what the language really does. You can go learn more about the IDE, but you already know what its for. You can learn more about thelanguage, but you already know at least a few things that it can do.Later on, if you're serious about being a programmer, you'll want a reference book, or perhaps books on the particular type of VB that you'll be using for your real application.

Also, while formatting the text, they accidentally hit keys like \\"space\\" or \\"del\\" without realizing that they just took out a portion of text during the formatting procedure.Why do I bring this up? Because I have found many books with these problems and having worked with publishers for years regarding materials have gained an education on their internal process.This book has some glitches in it from the typesetter. They all do.Putting all of that aside.The material in this book is very informative and helpful to get you up and running toward becoming a VB 2005 programmer. There is a lot of insight which this particular author brings to the table for a new student.If you are looking for the \\"perfect\\" book....you won't find it. If you do, email the title so I can teach from it. But, if you want a strong book that will get you up and running.

I plan to use it to teach my students.The book is also fun. The author's approach of teaching your how to program by developing computer games is great. Plus, Ford provides a solid review of .NET and Object Oriented programming (OOP) that will give any new Windows programmer a real head start."},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"This book hits the mark. It provides a solid overview of VB Express and .Net. Its review of OOP was suprisingly easy to understand and the sample applications that you learn how to build provide a very practical learning experience. The only negative that I can point to are a few minor typos but nothing out of line with most books these days. The bottom line is that this is most understandable programming book I have every read. You won't find an easier read or a better presentation for beginner users."},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"I found that the express verion of Visual Studio 2005 the to be a really nice product at a great value (free!). Because the \\"Express\\" version does not include all of the functionality the full version has, I found non-express books and online tutorials and other information frustrating. \\"Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition Programming for the Absolute Beginner (For the Absolute Beginner)\\" fills the void quite nicely. The examples are interesting and easy to understand.

Wow. very impressive!"},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"I really want to like this book. The explainations are good. The projects are nice and game oriented so they keep your attention. However, the book has a large number of mistakes in the text. Especially in the code you need to follow.Also, the author totally misses on showing off Object Oriented Programing. He gives a decent showing of what OOP is, but the project that comes in that chapter lacks the creation of any Classes. I was really liking the explaination of OOP, but you get nearly no experience of it from the project.This book had a lot of potential, but misses."},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"This book by Jerry Lee Ford, Jr. focuses on the absolute beginner of VB Express 2005 and anyone new to VB Express would definitely benefit from this self-contained course.Various aspects of the Visual Basic language and programming interface are explained in a non-boring fashion. This is accomplished via the design/programming of several game-type scenarios including the details of application interface, object oriented programming, adding graphics, audio and animation.In summary, if anyone has a desire to learn Visual Basic, I would highly recommend this book as a start but also an excellent reference.The source code for all games is available from a Web Site and typing long pages of code is not really required. This is a great beginning manual which is relatively easy to understand and provides the foundation for anyone that desires to get started in VB Express ."},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"this is my second book on visual basic . the first was microsoft's build a program now .

I chose to type them myself and found errors that were actually very challenging to fix but was able to find them . There were a few code errors in the later chapters of the 2005 version book. But over all a very fun and challenging book."},{"Title":"Transact-SQL Cookbook","review":"Rather than a real-world &quot;cookbook&quot;, ostensibly targeted to database professionals who want to avoid reinventing the wheel, this book would be better positioned as a companion to an introductory text on SQL (e.g. for a class on SQL, where the class laboratory work employs SQL Server).One or two of the chapters do cover problems which baffle a lot of experienced SQL programmers with whom I have worked; a good example is the chapter on the implementation of hierarchical data models.There is some minimal attention paid to performance implications of alternative query formulations, but very little useful information on practical database and query tuning.The practical examples are generally good for building the necessary context for the various implementations, but there are some clear gaps in the authors' understanding of the underlying business problems and the conceptual solution techniques. Also, there are some flat-out errors: for example, the explanation (and the implementation) of exponential averaging (more commonly referred to as smoothing) is simply incorrect.All in all, I would recommend this to someone who is just learning SQL, and is having trouble &quot;getting their head&quot; around how it would be used in practice. For someone already working in the field, an online subscription to SQL Server magazine (giving access to all of the source code for the articles) would be a better investment."},{"Title":"Transact-SQL Cookbook","review":"This book is everything I was looking for. I bought it on my recent trip to United States. I had a chance to read it on the long flight back to Europe.I needed a clear and concise book to help me with my MS SQL programming problems. I think I found it. It clearly explains logic behind the code and examples. Other books often mix together a lot of other topics, but not this one. The text is only about coding. No administration or fine-tuning. I think it's a very good book for programmers.If your interests include administration and other topics for DBA's, this book will be of no help for you. But that's the strength of the book. Just a few hundred pages, but no page is wasted on issues not directly related to coding."},{"Title":"Transact-SQL Cookbook","review":"This is a very concise and to-the-point book. It assumes that the user has a basic understanding of T-SQL. So, you won't see any repetition from SQL Server Books Online.Authors chose very interesting topics, and backed them up with real life scenarios and practical examples. So, every example makes sense.Book is very easy to read and understand. If you are a beginner T-SQL programmer (or someone coming from a VB or other programming backgrounds), this book helps you get on the right track, as it clearly explains how to think in terms of sets. If you are an intermediate level SQL programmer, you can really use the examples provided in this book and start your journey towards becoming an advanced SQL programmer. For advanced users of SQL, this serves as a great reference."},{"Title":"Transact-SQL Cookbook","review":"No DBA nonsense, just plain programming. Great stuff, clear explanations, excellent code!!!

Like other O'Reilly titles, the book is an excellent piece of work."},{"Title":"Transact-SQL Cookbook","review":"I've read this book and I'm recommending it to all my friends. This book contains concise explanations of many important topics. Anyone who would like to learn about the concepts should read it since it covers almost all levels of understanding from the overall picture to the nitty-gritty details of Transact-SQL. Examples are clear and well structured.Not for beginners and probably not for hard-core gurus. For me, a programmer with no good mentor to learn from, this book is very useful. Overall, this book has everything you need to master TSQL programming on your own."},{"Title":"Transact-SQL Cookbook","review":"Information on performing statistics calculations using TSQL is very rare. Using this book, I was able to write a couple of User-Defined Functions that provide both Confidence Intervals and Exact Confidence Intervals.Although TSQL isn't the right tool for this particular job, requirements can sometimes put you in a bind. I would like to see this chapter greatly expanded in a future edition. Someone needs to fill this vacuum."},{"Title":"Transact-SQL Cookbook","review":"Read the negative reveiws and bought the book anyway. Still can't figure out what it was that other reviewers found objectionable...This book was helpful to me because it takes the subject of a SQL query much deeper than most of the texts that I have read. It puts emphasis on solving problems using the query language instead of procedural language, and it shows some truly eye-opening examples of what can be done with a simple SELECT statement.The authors are clearly subject experts, and their work is in keeping with O'Reilly's generally high standards for technical references. My only regret is that the book wasn't longer."},{"Title":"Transact-SQL Cookbook","review":"I re-read this book every month or so. I was turned on to it by a co-worker when working for a securities trading firm. It has proven invaluable to me at each job I take.The set based concepts can help you optimize code that is laden with cursors and strange logical progressions. Some of the techniques are not new to programming they are just applied to database programming.I highly recommend this book to anyone who works with TSQL."},{"Title":"Transact-SQL Cookbook","review":"I cannot say enough great things about this book!

Well, that hardly turned out to be the case--even way back then! Nevertheless, this book proved easy to read and learn from. The book also contains cartoons that provide some degree of entertainment as well as stories, poems, and aphorisms. Two of these I committed to memory and am still able to completely recall: Heine Heine's \\"Die Lorelei\\" and the following observation by Nietzsche: \\"He who knows himself to be profound strives for clarity; he knows himself not to be profound strives for obscurity. For the crowd considers all to be deep if they cannot see the bottom of it--they are so timid and venture so unwillingly into the water\\".I should also note that although I am practically the only American scientist of my acquaintance with any knowledge of German, it is a language that has been of great benefit to me professionally. Often it seems as if major concepts in the physical sciences are only clearly explained once--and that is in the original German journal article (often in Annalen der Physik)! Indeed, when my graduate school textbooks failed me, I could always turn to the original article in German--usually written by Hans Bethe!"},{"Title":"Use Your Head (Radio Collection)","review":"I have been interested in study techniques and improving my mind for some time. There are great books out there on reading technique, memory, note taking, communication etc, and the best of them use accurate explanations about how the mind works. This book is most definitely not one of them!I made some great improvements in my learning abilities after reading books such as \\"Your Memory, and How to improve it\\" by Higbee, or \\"Reading Flexibly\\" by McWhorter. Then came the Buzan guru promise of being a superlearner, or a powerbrain mind mapper, in order to unleash the alleged 99% of my intelligence that I was not using.The first chapter gave a story about a student who used mind mapping to get into Cambridge. Fine (but just imagine the countless students that swallowed the hype and failed their exams due to mind mapping)! Then there was an explanation of how he did it; He knew how his brain worked, and he used it properly. OK! However, the following chapter on how the brain works is so innacurate that it can only be described as misinformation. The left/right brain speculation and holographic theory of the mind are so feable they will only be useful as rhetoric for selling more books.The section on reading takes a step backwards from even the most mediocre texts on reading. He emphasizes speed and clouds issues of comprehension (which are essential for good reading). As you may have heard from some speed readers, they can read at over 1000wpm. So can I, but unlike them, I do not fool myself and claim that my comprehension will increase.The section on memory is basic 1960s psychology about the forgetting rate, and some very limited information about mnemonics. He does not even mention the method of loci (probably the oldest and most powerful techniques).The chapter on mind mapping and study (MMOST) leads the reader up the garden path at every turn. Mind mapping as a graphic technique does not even use labeled links between concepts. Concept mapping does, and it leads to meaningful learning. Once again, Buzan opens a trapdoor for us to fall through. The study technique section (MMOST) is standard study technique, (except that the author evangelizes and raises expectation so high that anticlimax is guaranteed).At the end of the book, the promises to lead the world to a vision of mental literacy are nothing more than sales pitch and cult building. If he did ever manage to teach the world to mind map, he would also be teaching the most innacurate information about the brain known to pseudoscience. He would also be training those people in self-delusion.Get ANY other book on learning or study techniques, and you will be better off.ATBDRayt"},{"Title":"Use Your Head (Radio Collection)","review":"Tony Buzan is smart - in two ways. Firstly, he is a good marketer. But full credit to him. He manages to achieve this while still sharing infinitely valuable tools for 'expanding' your mind. But secondly, he is at the forefront of the study of mnemonics (that's how to remember stuff). Use Your Head, the first in the 'BBC Mind Set' series is simply an overview of all the areas into which you can specialise by purchasing his other titles. I read his 'Use you Mind' title prior to reading this and I kid you not, from being a klutz when it came to remembering lists and faces, after 5 days I was remembering lists over 100 randomly ordered words. I could repeat them backwards, forwards, around the dinner table I got my family to test me by asking me what word number, for example, 86 in the list was and I could recall perfectly. They called me a freak. And the coolest thing about it was that it is simple. Like really simple. I guess that my advantage was that I was passionate about improving my memory and therefore incessantly practiced. But like I said - 5 days it took me! So I am a fan. I'm currently on page 98 of 'Use Your Head' and have already managed to improve my reading speed, today(!), from 250 words per minute to 470 words per minute. I'm now on the section about mind mapping, and have actually got his specialist mind mapping book, called funnily enough, 'The Mind Map Book' sitting on my desk ready to be read and practiced next. I'm already a top student in my studies, but I seriously cannot wait to get back to school to put all of this to use because I feel like my brain is actually working for the first time.If you have to choose one book in his series, I would suggest 'Use Your Mind' (all about remembering), but that's just me. I promise you that if you approach it with the enthusiasm that I did and are willing to harass your friends and family into testing you, then you will see exactly what I mean. It's groundbreaking. And if you choose to ignore, that's cool, your loss."},{"Title":"Use Your Head (Radio Collection)","review":"Often villified because he breaks new ground continually, this book encouraged me to attend one of his seminars. I have to admit I found Mind Mapping difficult until then. After the seminar, with just a little practise, I found the technique is unbeatable. How else can you attend seminars/lectures, and come out with complete notes that cover everything you need. This book gives a broad overview of all his techniques and lets you experiment to find the ones you like. Once you have an overview then get the more specific titles, like Mind Mapping etc.If you are at all interested in improving yourself this book is a must! Be Warned his techniques are not little tricks that can be applied instantly to make a little improvement. They are something you need to learn and practise, but when you do, they will change your life forever!"},{"Title":"Use Your Head (Radio Collection)","review":"Well, nice new cover. After 30 years or so, the author has actually started summarising some of his info into mindmaps (the trademarked property of the author's company). However, he doesn't put them at the end of the chapter, just in the centre spine.OK. So he says you see 1000 slides, and you can recognise them perfectly. Then he confuses the reader by inferring your recall works the same way. Wrong and misleading!You only use 99% of your potential. Why is this relevant? This positively screams at you that miracles can be obtained from his book and narrow methods. More salespitch!He does a survey on learning. Did you learn about memory techniques at school? Then, just to help you out, he says NO! at the response part of every question. This really is leading the reader up the garden path. I realise most people are not too keen on their school memories, but I believe the author is blindsiding the reader and insulting all teachers. I guess he also uses this kind of mind control in his seminars.He says that the greatest invention of all time is note taking (advance in communication of ideas). However, he also goes on to say you should use mind maps instead of linear notes. Mind maps are obviously just awful for communication. They can't even stand on their own! Why doesn't he come clean and just say a mind map is a kind of glorified scratch pad, the sort people have been using for years?He narrows the reader's mind in his writing in order to sell his other books, and he promotes some very limited and narrow techniques while blocking out some of your already well learned strategies for coping with life. He promotes himself as a guru, and uses mind control throughout. The methods have a cult following. What else can I say?Apart from that, he writes fairly wellThis book is not about learning to learn. All it does is blinker the reader to buy more of the redundant same."},{"Title":"Use Your Head (Radio Collection)","review":"This is a really great book to help you unlock your potential and use your brain more effectively.

In particular, it draws upon his direction of \\"Operation Nursery\\" in 1946, a relatively obscure operation designed to curtail any kind of covert or overt postwar insurgency by Nazi loyalists.The story concerns a low-level American officer who is ordered to parachute into Germany near the end of the war to meet with a potentially useful German turncoat. However, complications ensue, and he is forced to assume the identity of a shady German, leading to an unexpected opportunity to penetrate an underground German network of some sort. Alone and untrained as a spy, the typically capable and gutsy officer manages to survive against the odds and wreak havoc. As the story unfolds, it is peppered with transcripts of cables and recorded phone calls between various plotters -- and it becomes apparent that the American is at risk of being sacrificed by his own side as part of some larger scheme.Some of this is very well done, especially the early chapters, in which the agent parachutes in and tries desperately to avoid detection when his initial assignment goes awry. However, once he settles into his new identity, the pace slows down significantly, and the story started to lose my interest. The twists and turns of just who was betraying whom, and all the layers of interests (German, Nazi, American, Soviet, etc.), while perfectly plausible and realistically portrayed, simply failed to capture my imagination. It doesn't help that the protagonist is such a stock hero figure, with little personality. Things pick up slightly at the end, when the Macguffin of Nazi gold gets introduced, but it's too little too late.Perhaps I'm just not a big enough fan of spy thrillers (I do like the old Ambler books, and the newer Furst ones), but for whatever reason, this one just never got me in its grip. I certainly like the idea of taking this real-life situation and making a story out of it, but perhaps the author was just too close to the events to be able to fictionalize them to the extent necessary to make it work well as a thriller."},{"Title":"The Expendable Spy","review":"Jack Hunter did a fine job with THE BLUE MAX but this book was so bad it was one of the few times I just stopped reading and donated the book to the library.

The writing and production values have come a long way since then, and now it is an exceptional, not just professional, literary collection. (My five-star rating now has the appropriate double asterisk.)The book begins with a good, eclectic set of poetry. Some of it requires some wading through, but there are several solid and even excellent pieces here. I think Andrew Hungerford's poems stand out here (there are two), especially &quot;Pining for a Third Millenium.&quot; &quot;I am a high priest for the / twenty-first century,&quot; Hungerford declares, in a Whitmanesque mood but not without irony. Another treat is the featured author section, with an article and selected poems by Meg McClure, another Michigan (nee Chicago) poet. There's a nice survey of McClure's work (including two new pieces) as well as a brief biographical and critical article. McClure is a very promising young poet, and it's astonishing how precocious she is in an early poem like &quot;Sisterhood Haiku&quot;: '&quot;We're a different breed,&quot; / you confessed one Tuesday night. / &quot;We know what love is.&quot;'The book also features a prose section, including an essay and four short stories from writers all over the map; MSU undergraduates, native New Yorkers, and young San Francisco writers. The Offbeat/1 is really a unique assemblage of breakthrough talent. I think that anyone interested in poetry or new fiction would be pleasantly surprised by just how good this collection is."},{"Title":"An essay upon projects (Cassell's national library)","review":"This is a more technical book by the great satirical writer, although now and then the satirist has the upper hand: 'so I have seen shares in joint-stocks dwindle away till ... no buyer (the fine new word for nothing-worth).'This book is a plea for- a bigger Bank of England, capable of forcing extortionate intrest rates down- a Merchant Court and a Bankruptcy Court, specialized in commercial litigation- industrial insurance (mutual help in case of disaster)- better roads, 'which promote universal correspondence, without which our inland trade could not be managed'- a fool-house- a charity-lottery for the maintenance of the poor- a universal welfare system (pension and health insurance): 'that all persons in the time of their health and youth, while they are able to work and spare it, should lay up some small part of their gettings as a deposit in safe hands ... to relieve them if by age or accident they come to be disabled'- taxation should be equitable: 'every man may be taxed in due proportion of his estate ...

But in view of its technicality, I recommend it only for historians and Defoe-fans."},{"Title":"Shinsengumi: The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps","review":"Last year, the local foreign-language TV station here in L.A. broadcast an NHK-produced, fictionalized series about the Shinsengumi. The show was gripping, but it was obvious that the whole thing was highly romanticized. Since then, I've been looking for a more historically accurate account of the period, so I was delighted when I found this book.I did indeed learn a lot more about the Shinsengumi from it. For one thing, the television series presents the group's members as heroes and patriots. By including descriptions of less-than-flattering incidents conveniently left out of the TV version, Hillsborough's book essentially portrays the Shinsengumi as a group of deluded, self-aggrandizing thugs. My personal sense is that there's some truth to be found in both of these approaches. Being aware of television's need to simplify and anoint heroes, I tend to trust books more. In this case, however, the written word doesn't live up to its promise. Neither version presents enough evidence for its own point of view, nor does either generate enough overall credibility to allow the consumer to make anything resembling an informed judgment.Hillsborough says in the Preface that he's \\"concentrated on the spirit of the Shinsengumi and their place in history, rather than on trivial details....\\" To my mind, that's insufficient justification for the disorganized, repetitive writing and overheated descriptions found in this volume.Regarding organization, I'm no fan of the \\"Dates and Places\\" school of history, and I have no trouble with the idea of an author bringing an era alive by telling incidents out of their chronological order. But really, shouldn't there be some kind of reason for jumbling these things? I couldn't discern one here.The real problem with the book, though, is the shallowness of its analysis. Hillsborough's thesis is appears twofold. First, that a \\"will to power\\" combined with \\"self-aggrandizement\\" leads to trouble. Second, that the \\"superior martial spirit, fighting technique, and an unflinching propensity to kill,\\" and the \\"official sanction to kill\\" granted by the Tokugawa shogunate is what set the Shinsengumi apart from their peers. This might be true. Repeating it over and over doesn't make it true. At one point, the phrase \\"propensity to kill\\" appears eight times in two pages. Several chapters later the point is driven home yet again, with a chapter entitled, yes, \\"A Propensity to Kill.\\"The Shinsengumi were a tragic group of idealists trying to hold on to a world that was passing them by. Their goals were lofty; their methods were brutal. I don't believe their leaders were unaware of the tensions between their ideals and reality. Although many were peasants, they were educated and pursued art and culture along with their martial activities. I await the day when an author writing in English treats their complexities with sensitivity and justice.[Three stars for the information. One for the writing. Average: Two.]"},{"Title":"Shinsengumi: The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps","review":"When I saw this book, (quite by accident, actually), I was impressed that here was a book on something that I had never even heard of before. So, the expectation was high.Hillsborough has tried to bring out the spirit of the organisation without getting bogged down in the details. Actually, it was the details that I was looking for and often the details will give you something of the spirit of the subject anyway. Some of the historical detail was there, and Hillsborough certainly came across as one who knew his subject material and sources. However, with his book being the first in English on the topic, I question whether the deliberate focus away from the said details was justified. For the average non-Japanese, that historical data would have been priceless, as most of us have nothing else about the Shinsengumi to read.Three phrases were repeated and repeated ad nauseum: \\"propensity to kill\\", \\"will to power\\" and \\"self-importance\\". The latter had some variations, but all three are constantly hammered and drummed into the reader. At one point, the first phrase appears in almost every sentence for about two paragraphs. While it is certainly worthy to explore the motivations of anyone of historical importance, I again question whether the point needed to be laboured to the degree that it was.A lot of the historical information regarding important incidents involving the Shinsengumi read a bit like a medieval version of \\"Battle Royale\\". At one point, I wondered if I were indeed reading a \\"historical novel\\" rather than a book on history. This is something to keep in mind, if you are thinking of purchasing the book.While the book was interesting, it was certainly not fantastic. It left a huge number of unanswered questions and also left me wondering just why the Shinsengumi was feared so much. From what the book described, there were far more vicious individuals around. That information would have gone a long way to create an understanding of just why the Shinsengumi were so feared and hated.It is an average book, though with nothing else that I know of in English, there is little choice if someone wants to know about the topic. The Shinsengumi are interesting and worth the look, so for that reason alone the book is worth getting. Just don't expect too much from it, that is all."},{"Title":"Shinsengumi: The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps","review":"If you don't speak Japanese, Mr. Hillsborough's books are pretty much your only source for information on the people and personalities of the Meiji Restoration. (Kenshin, Peacemaker, and Gintama can only get you so far!) If you are interested in Japanese history--or the pop culture surrounding the Shinsengumi et. al.--these books are definitely worth a read. But be warned that the writing is just this side of awful...there is more cliche, hyperbole, and terrible dialogue than you can shake a bokken at."},{"Title":"Shinsengumi: The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps","review":"I remember back in the 80's wondering if any english book of any sort would ever come out regarding the Shinsengumi. Over the years since that time I have collected various things on Japanese history that vaguely touch on the group, read small references regarding them in scholarly texts and martial arts magazines, seen a few plays about them, and dozens of movies ranging from noble portrayals of the group to rare stuff where executed members of the group come back as ghosts to haunt their former comrades (lol!). The day has finally come for the Shinsengumi with Romulus Hillsborough's new book.Like Hillsborough's former works, this book is in the same style that can be considered \\"Historical Fiction\\". He acknowledges this in the preface that the book is not entirely nonfiction and gives his reasons for this. With that said, he does use many of the essential Japanese sources used to create his biography of the group. Part of the problem with dealing with the history of the Shinsengumi is that they have become such folk heroes where myth and fact have become blurred. It is the same type of problem one encounters with western gunfighters and the history of the old west. So many movies and novels have been made that are based on all of these guys, but add \\"creative\\" elements to the stories that add on to the myth. One can wonder if anything that \\"corresponds with historical reality\\" can be seen or written about these folk heroes.So, with that said, Hillsborough's book does attempt to give a literary type of biography of the Shinsengumi. It is not a dry text that tries to cram all sorts of statistics and dates about the group, but like an artist trying to paint a picture, the book tries to paint portraits about the Shinsengumi using his style of writing. Certain words and phrases are used over and over to hammer home the way he feels about certain people and events. When this book was announced a few years ago I knew, based on Hillsborough's previous works, that he would definitely have a certain viewpoint about the Shinsengumi. They are not always presented in the best possible light. However, I respect the viewpoint since they are, and always will be, a controversial group.The majority of the book covers the years roughly around 1863-1868. Most of the chapters deal with the key events of their time in Kyoto which are the core years of the Shinsengumi. The time in Kyoto is the most important since that is where they make a name for themselves and when they depart Kyoto everything is downhill after that. There is an epilogue chapter on what happens after the death of Kondo Isami, but at that point the few individuals left aren't really the Shinsengumi anymore in the same sense they were during the Kyoto years. So, it makes sense how he ended the book.It is a good book for anyone being introduced to the Shinsengumi, but I think any fan of the days leading to the end of the Shogun will enjoy and be challenged by this book."},{"Title":"Shinsengumi: The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps","review":"The stillness of the night is shattered by clashing steel. The year is 1864, and a group of ronin samurai have not only prevented an assassination, but also saved their capital, Kyoto. Shinsengumi is a historical retelling of these times, written by Romulus Hillsborough, using some of the rarest primary sources this side of the Pacific. The book is about the chaotic period near the end of the Tokugawa Era. In a last ditch effort to hold onto power, the rulers created a unique group of samurais to fight back against the rebel Shishi samurai. The book specially focuses on the Shinsengumi, which literally means \\"Newly Selected Corps.\\" These men became a part of the Japanese mythology for their ruthlessness and undying faith to a failing cause.The primary documentation used in this book is marvelous. Every bit of information is backed by proof, which makes this the most truthful retelling of the Shinsengumi. Too bad it is plagued with stiff writing and weak narration. Hillsborough's style is stuck somewhere between wanting to be a retelling, and a thesis. It tries hard to do both, but overwhelmingly fails. The information in the book is great and for those out there who are interested in a truthful look into Japanese history, it is worth a look. Everybody else should steer clear, as if this book was one of the \\"Wolves of Mibu.\\"*Originally published for San Francisco/Sacramento Book Review*"},{"Title":"Shinsengumi: The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps","review":"For over two centuries Japan was ruled by the Shogunate under a law of isolationism, but in the mid-1800s this policy was to change with the arrival of Matthew Perry and his armed warships from the U.S. Navy. Their arrival sparked a revolution and the overthrow of the Shogunate: SHINSENGUMI: THE SHOGUN'S LAST SAMURAI CORPS is the first English narrative of these events, tracing the internal conflicts within the Japanese world and the rise in murders, assassination and violence as a result. The Shinsengumi were the most dreaded security force Japan had ever known, and their power and effects are followed through one of the most confrontational periods of Japanese history. A 'must' for any student of Japanese history and military culture."},{"Title":"Shinsengumi: The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps","review":"Shinsengumi is one of most popular historical figures in Japan like 47 Ronins.If you are fan of Rurouni Kenshin or Peace Maker, you must read this since this is the only English book about Shinsengumi.I hope someone will translate great Shinsengumi novels like \\"Moeyo Ken\\" \\"Sinsengumi Keppuroku\\" \\"Bakumatsu Shinsengumi\\" etc...someday."},{"Title":"Shinsengumi: The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps","review":"If you are interested in Japanese history regarding: the Edo Period, the fall of it, and/or samurai in general, then this book is definitely for you. There are only about a dozen characters in the book, but to comprehend the story you need to remember their names and roles (an easy thing to do, actually). Just remember this from page one. I lived in Japan for a number of years and had a blast associating the places in the book with where I'd been. The author did a tremendous amount of research for this book and should be rewarded for it. He even found pictures of the two main characters. That is a real treat to see - putting faces on the names. So, I give him 5 stars; coming from a person interested in this type of history."},{"Title":"Shinsengumi: The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps","review":"The first thing to really take me out of this book was the insane punctuation. And I'm not talking about long Os which I fully understand and agree with, and while it's presumptuous to assume anyone reading's studied Japanese, it's really patronizing to think that everyone reading doesn't know how to say the names of things. I'm certain the writer (or editor?) doesn't understand what &eacute; means, because that not only effects the pronunciation but also in most cases should mean where the accent of the word is, which Japanese words have none. Also, an apostrophe is a stop which is also misleading because when saying Teradaya you don't actually stop before the ya... you just pronounce it in Japanese. Also I think this was done for the reason that ya means room... in which case isn't is a hyphen? SPEAKING of hypens, where in Japan is Utsu-nomi-ya? Because I'm pretty sure the nearest city to me's Kanji was broken into U, Tsu, no (not actually written but said) and Miya (also, why would you need to break apart the name?)... Despite my feelings towards this type of writing, it was only going to bring it down to 4 stars, because it's only a small problem that nags at you and makes you ask yourself if you're reading about Japanese history or Pok&eacute;mon.The other big thing is something everyone seems to agree on, there are words used over and over again that make the whole book redundant and kind of cheap. Also it's a little bit mellow-dramatic. You don't need to tell me that it was cold-blooded murder, I can already tell that from historical facts. Propensity to kill is of course the other big one, mentioning that a group of men who were known for enough murders to shame Okada Izo had a tendency to kill is already really redundant, then to mention it 80 more times only worsens it. The writer brings up these sort of half-baked analyses and themes that weren't mentioned, bangs on about them and maybe forgets them for a while. The worst is the mention of the Sun Goddess in the last few chapters; \\"I'm sorry I didn't know this was a theme, oh there it is again and again...\\" So the whole analysis is that the Shinsengumi leaders were cold-blooded killers who had a tendency to kill and were very self important. Excuse me for thinking that this isn't a point that really needs to be analyzed, but if you must, do it with evidence and historical fact only.What these two things have in common is essentially \\"bad writing\\" yet everything factual that is presented is interesting, so it's really only the fact that every few minutes the writing gets really patronizing and redundant. I found myself enjoying the overall story and finding a lot of intrigue in what actually happened (Kondo Isami was blamed for Ryoma's murder, not surprised but I didn't know that since Kyoto's historical museum never mentioned it) so it's definitely worth a read, but if you see anything that sticks out as odd, don't think it's going anywhere, because it's not."},{"Title":"Shinsengumi: The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps","review":"The author of 'Shinsengumi', Romulus Hillsborough, is regularly criticized for his dry writing style and poorly worked out theories. It seems unlikely that Hillsborough has any training in history whatsoever. His book on Ryoma Sakamoto, in fact, is miscatagorized as 'history' (it is 90% dialogue, and the average reader will be able to spot it as historical fiction within four seconds of opening the book). 'Shinsengumi: The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps', however, is a very interesting read. By focusing on one historical period, Hillsborough not only fills a gap in available Japanese history literature in English, he is also able to avoid the 'long tradition' sameness of most collections of samurai tales. The samurai in this book, though often less than admirable, are therefore much more real than most."},{"Title":"Shinsengumi: The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps","review":"It is very hard to find a book in English about the Shinsengumi.

While realizing that you have to focus on something and research inevitably leaves some things out it is not difficult to ask the questions in a more inclusive way. In fact, I found the class discussions to be more challenging and stimulating when I shifted the questions just slightly so that they included other possible relational models - besides \\"one man and one woman.\\" (Not a quote from her book but a nod to the marriage fight and the reinforcement of heteronormative values to the detriment of diverse thought through centering dialogue on heterosexual relationships.) In fact a sort of follow-up book, \\"Critical Thinking about Sex, Love and Romance in the Mass Media\\" (2007) looks at some applications of her theories to queer and other de-centered media. With that said, I found her book to be well-laid out, easy to read - and therefore deceptively challenging (a reference to the critique that her book is \\"fluff\\" - which it is most definitely not).

I read the books first and found myself really liking this one due to its readability and grounding in research. Also, it has sound philosophical teachings and specific advice that is appropriate to every age and stage. It combines the fields of Child Development and Psychology with morality and good common sense to lend the reader a practical guide. It leaves plenty of room for readers to fashion our parenting philosophy combining the information given with our own intuition, experience and views. Anyway, I also reviewed three other more popular books (bestsellers), some of which cited research of their own. What I found when I compared the advice given in these books with the findings of popular current studies on parenting is that Lickona's book was the most detailed, most grounded in research, least repetitive book of the four, AND it was very well-supported with the current findings I encountered. Hooray! If only the chapter on babies were more detailed (including more information on the most healthy philosophies for feeding, sleeping, etc.), I'd be even more thrilled. (I have a 4-month-old.)

When you read this, think of the people who say the Holocaust did not happen, and never let them rise to a place of power."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is one of a kind; a true classic for the ages. Commencing in the 19th Century it sets the philosophical foundation of the Nazi Party, examining the persons who created the ideology. Moving to Hitler's youth, the forces that shaped him are closely reviewed. Shirer then shows the rise of the Nazis as a political force in post World War I Germany, and how this was aided by an overly harsh Armistice treaty, hyperinflation, and a weak government. All of this is covered in what seems to be excruciating detail, but once the reader peruses the easily understandable text, it becomes apparent that a lesser treatment would almost be worse than no examination at all.Shirer then turns to the Nazis' ascent to power, and the years prior to World War II. Masterfully exhibiting a deft touch, Shirer exhaustively traces the consolidation of power, the first anti-Jewish atrocities, and the almost innumerable opportunities the West squandered in failing to stifle Nazism by diplomacy and appeasement, instead of using or threatening use of force. One by one, the Rhineland, Austria, Memel, Czechoslovakia and Spain fell into the Nazi orbit.Shirer's best work, in my opinion, is the discussion concerning the events leading up to the invasion of Poland. Hitler's cynical dealings with the equally cynical Russians are amazingly detailed in this book. A sense of breathless anticipation ensues as the date of the Polish invasion draws near. And finally the war begins.Shirer's treatment of the Second World War is superb. He focuses not so much on specific battles, but weaves them seamlessly into a general narrative of how the various thrusts, including the Balkans, Scandinavia, France, North Africa and Russia proceed from the Reich viewpoint. A fascinating chapter includes Hitler's aborted plan for an English invasion, and what would have been done had it succeeded. Shirer's research is such that he questions the loyalty of the Duke of Windsor, a by-now accepted premise, forty years ahead of its time.As the tide turns against Germany, Shirer veers slightly and presents a magnificent chapter about the Nazi genocides and atrocities, setting forth what was done in grisly detail. This reading is not for the squeamish, but it is necessary to understand what the true nature of the Third Reich was. He then turns back to D-Day and the collapse of Germany, concluding with the bomb plot against Hitler, and his subsequent suicide.One of the better parts of the book is the Epilogue, which covers the Nuremberg trials, and what was adduced by them. This is must reading.This book, and its companion work on the Collapse of France, comprise a rather complete history of Western Europe in the years 1870-1945. Certainly, they are a winter's worth of reading, but you will never find them dull, disappointing, or inaccurate. Shirer's two works are epic in stature, and will be read years from now. There are no photographs, and few maps. Those maps that are presented are very well done. Shirer is to be commended for his herculean effort and his studied objectivity in discussing such a cataclysmic evil.Again, the book is a true classic. I recommend it highly. NEVER LOAN IT OUT TO ANYONE."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Finally, a book on the Third Reich that doesn't focus solely on its persecution of the Jews. This book would be recommended to anyone who didn't live during that period so they realize that the Nazi reign of terror reached much further then one religous group. Mr. Shirer is to be commended."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"In reading the thoughtful and eloquent reviews contained within this site I can't help but think that my review is unnecessary, except to add one more voice of praise to the chorus. &quot;The Rise and Fall of Nazi Germany&quot; is the standard by which any work on the Third Reich needs to measured to. I use measured instead of compared because I highly doubt any other work on the Third Reich will rival it let alone better it.The history of the Third Reich is clearly told in a transparent easy to read prose. Considering the mass amount people and places that Mr. Shirer has to deal with it is surprisingly easy to keep track of who did what, when and where. The book is a gripping, entertaining read and manages to present and the detailed and intricate history of the Third Reich in a clear straight forward manner.Mr.Shirer relies on thousands of captured official German documents, diaries and correspondence of people involved in the events describe to flesh out a very accurate history of the Third Reich. Let me say that since the book was written that there has been additional information that have seen discovered that would expand or modify some of the conclusions reached by the author and thrown a different light on certain facts and events. For example at the time of the writing of this book it was not widely known that Japan had lost a series of clashes against Russia on the Mongolian frontier in 1939. That event would throw a different light on Japan's refusal to declare war on Russia in 1941. Regardless in the majority of instances this book is still extremely accurate.As to its downside I have the same reservation as mentioned by prior reviewers in that M.Shirer time and time again repeats some of his biases and observations. Again as mention by a prior reviewer, c leong73 the sexual orientation of some of the figures that played a major role in Nazi Germany has no bearing weather they were slimeballs or not. There were plenty of heterosexual psycho's running around Germany at that time.At any rate the good points in this book far out weight the flaws. A must read for anyone who want to comprehend this fascinating era in history."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is the second highest selling book of all time, outsold only by the Bible. It is rare that a bestseller compares in quality to its number of copies sold, even a Pulitzer Prize winner such as this one, but here it is totally justified. It is also the second greatest book of all time. No one today can claim literacy without having read it, because the story told here is the most important and relevant story of our time.Although William Shirer was not a historian, he was a talented journalist who lived under the regime he described. Shirer utilized a team of researchers and tons of documents and records from and about the Third Reich that has never been equaled, and never will be. We are fortunate that Shirer was a journalist because it enabled him to write a history that is accessible to most readers, not just a limited academic intelligentsia. That is no doubt one reason why it is never boring or tedious.While it remains the undisputed summary history of the Third Reich, it's strongest point is its detailed description of the rise of evil, as opposed to the majority of other accounts that skip that most important part to hurriedly get to the more exciting and action-packed details of the crimes and ultimate collapse of the Reich, such as the many battles fought until the Reich's Waterloo at Stalingrad, the greatest battle ever fought. While these are covered here as well, it is the detailed description of the rise of Hitler and the Nazis that make this work so important and relevant today, because this is the lesson to be learned if a recurrence is to be prevented. It is the surprising account (surprising because it contradicts the common notion of a madman with Svengali-like charisma capturing a nation with his hypnotic power of persuasion. A good story but almost completely untrue) of a political failure transformed by moneyed interests into a political powerhouse. This was true of both the Nazi Party and its most successful and powerful leader. Hitler was not only financed via contributions to his Party by Big Business, but by direct payment from them, i.e., outright bribery. It is a lesson learned too late of the dangers of mixing money and politics.By recounting one nation's tragic subversion by fascism and the resulting horror inflicted on an unsuspecting world, the second greatest book ever written should be required reading for many years to come."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"No single book can contain in depth accounts of the horrors and evil of the Nazi era, but if I were asked to recommend an entry level book for someone less versed or less interested in history of that period, I would recommend \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\". It does not cover any one subject in overwhelming detail but it covers most important events and people of the era in enough detail to get a clear picture of what went wrong and when, and, if you have a thirst for knowledge, the long list of references is invaluable."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Despite the virtual tsunami of words that have been written about Nazi Germany, its antecedents, and World War II, Rise and Fall of the Third Reick remains a standout in the field, and truly qualifies as a must read for anybody who is seriously interested in this era.Shirer's massive work (1143 pages in the paper edition) is particularly good on the pre-war years and the rise of Hitler and Nazism, when Shirer was for many of those years stationed as a correspondent in Berlin. The book is noticeably thinner on events after the US enters the war, when Shirer departed Berlin. Thus,the years 1942-1944 are covered in somewhat more summary fashion, with most of the attention focused on the major military battles of Europe and North Africa. Shirer also pays relatively short shrift to the Holocaust, which is something of an anomaly, because its full horrors were certainly well established by the time of his writing.The other great strength of Shirer's work is its vividness. As a long-time correspondent in Berlin, Shirer, unlike so many of the subsequent historians who wrote of this period, had direct and personal knowledge of many of the Nazi leaders, and that knowledge informs his writing. Although he makes no secret of his revulsion at all of the Nazi leadership, his particular disdain for Goering, Ribbentrop, and to a lesser extent, Goebbels, shines through clearly. That insight, combined with typical and illustrative repertorial detail, such as the weather at the time, what the local newspapers were reporting about the developments of the day, etc., give Shirer's work an immediacy that other historians simply cannot achieve.Shirer was not an historian by training. Yet, because of its power, and because he was correct in the vast majority of his conclusions, his work stands up admirably against the works of professional historians. If the subsequent passage of time and the opening of the formerly Russian archives have taught us anything, it is how right Shirer was about so many things, writing in the late 1950s. Later historians, such as Richard Evans, have written more analytically, and in more typically scholarly ways, about Nazi Germany, and as I noted, others have had greater access to documents, but Shirer's broad themes have been validated by the test of time.As I have suggested, Shirer's work is not without flaws, but its weaknesses are utterly overwhelmed by its great strenghts. This is a must read for people who want to understand World War II and its pre-history."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is based upon captured German records released after the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945. Thus it is based almost solely on primary sources. If you are looking to write a report or if you just want the essential reference book for Nazi Germany this is what you've been looking for. A combination of a biography of Adolf Hitler and a 12-year history of the authoritarian dictatorship he created, by a journalist renowned for his work as a foreign correspondent, this work will be unequaled for years to come in its scope and its reliability. It's not so hard to believe when you consider its been in print for 46 years.In the beginning, Shirer was branded a \\"German-hater\\" by West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer and he was treated unfairly by contemporary historians because of his lack in the field. But in retrospect, we can clearly see now that he was and is a very respected and gifted author.Shirer went on to write End of a Berlin Diary and numerous other books on history and his work as a journalist, but he is best known for \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\", an unexpected bestseller which catapulted him to literary fame."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Like reviewer Clifford Stanford (May 30, 2006), I too kept this book on my shelf for years before reading it. But unlike other tomes of this size, the size of this book is worth it. For it chronicles everything you want to know about Nazi Germany, and more!The political and military histories are extremely detailed. They are carefully supported by ample references, including many 'secret' 'top secret' and 'most secret' cables. Reading these histories, one is shocked by just how many chances Germany, and then the world, had a chance to stop the horror of the Nazi regime either before it was born, or before it became so powerful and caused such destruction, but failed to do so for what seem to be, in hindsight, reasons that are small minded, if not down right selfish. I was particularly shocked by the cavalier decision of Europe to 'sacrifice' Czechoslovakia for 'the greater peace' and of the Soviet Union's decision to ally with Germany, foolishly thinking it would be safe by doing so from Hitler's greedy wrath. The military histories chronicle the Nazi military machine from its victorious beginnings when it overran country after country to its dramatic losses in the forbiddingly cold Russian winter, where machines literally stopped working (due to frozen fuel and oil) and the soldiers froze to death.But this work contains so much more than just political and military histories.There is a biography of Hitler from his childhood, to his years as a vagabond wandering Austria (where he picked up much of his ideas) to becoming the Nazi warlord of Germany to his suicide in the end. However, Shirer doesn't just give us dry facts, but includes interesting details on his personal life (for example, his relationships with women, including his lover Geli Raubal and wife Eva Braun) and personality (his weird psychological state, often foaming and twitching, etc).There are sections about the German people, detailing how their history, philosophy and culture had shaped them so that they could participate in the creation of such a horrendous regime. In particular, I found sections about Goebbels and how his powerful propaganda machine fooled the Germans into accepting this regime truly frightening. I fear that similar propaganda efforts maybe afoot today, and in the future, we maybe seen as foolish as the Germans for believing in them.There are graphic descriptions of Hitler's horrific treatment of Jews, Poles, Russians and others in concentration camps, including murders, massacres, medical experiments and more. Also described in some detail is how the land of the conquered was plundered by the Germans for raw materials and profit.There are the stories of the resistance in Germany, whose members tragically were slow to move in the beginning. When they did become energized in the end, it was too late. However, resistance fighter Count Von Stauffenberg emerges as one of the few heroes of this book. Stauffenberg was a bright spot in a work that is filled with so many villains, but even more frighteningly, so many more regular people who just wanted to go about their regular lives, and not shake the status quo. This is one reason that I believe that the Nazi regime (and other evil regimes) are able to cause so much damage- we the \`regular people' are unwilling or afraid to face evil in the eye for fear of personal consequences.Apart from his massive research, Shirer had the distinct advantage of actually being present in Germany as a journalist, witnessing some of the events first hand. His personal reactions to events (such as Hitler's speeches) offer a power to this book not found in other histories of the regime.The book could have been strenghened further with additional supporting material. I agree with Clifford Stanford that maps would have been nice, along with pictures. I think a brief timeline, as well as a compendium of the main characters with a brief description of their role would have been helpful for non-historians like me. There were so many characters, many playing a significant role, that it was hard for me to keep track. I would often have to go to the index, and flip back through many, many pages to jog my memory of various characters."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a unique history of Hitler's Germany as seen through the eyes (at least during the first half of its life) of an American journalist in Berlin.The whole book, categorized labouriously into many sections detailing Hitler's youth, his rise to fame, the political machinations that led to his ultimate rise to power are ruthlessly laid out in chilling detail. The first half is especially fascinating for it builds up the tension as Hitler strides from relative obscurity to become the most powerful man in Germany in one stroke and then mercilessly annhilating his political opponents (including those in his own party).The second half of the book deals mainly with the events that led up to the World War II, something that is laid out in great detail (especially the political events in the capitals of Europe). Here, the book becomes more historic in nature (though a lot of quotes are still given).The capitulation of Austria, the bloodless conquest of Czechoslovakia, the fall of Poland are all given thorough examination and a wide treatment.The third half of the book deals with the fall of the Third Reich and here the read becomes terrifying (especially the portion titled \\"The New Order\\"). This part of the book details, in sickening detail, the treatment of the prisoners of war, the Jews and the people in the conquered lands. The butchery and savagery of the Nazis apart, the bestial medical experiments conducted by the Nazis are also detailed here: something that could have been avoided.The book is a hard read and sometimes there are inconsistencies (such as when some events are given extremely detailed importance while others are glossed over).Some of Hitler's closest subordinates are also pictured in lurid detail (some of the funny ones being the corpulence of Goering and the mental incapacity and vanity of Ribbentrop, Hitler's foriegn minister).All in all, an excellent book and a must-read for all those seeking knowledge of the Third Reich and its Supreme Leader, Adolf Hitler."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"With all of the two bit books around today that try to attract readers with wild theories or incorrect information about the Nazis, this book should and does stand as the gold standard by which all the others are measured, and all fall short of. And with good reason. No other book on the Third Reich covers the entire life of Nazism, from the early life and infulences of Aldof Hitler to Goetterdaemmerung in the Berlin bunker to a brief review of Nuremburg and none with such detail. Shirer intended to make his book the only one with all the details of the years of Hitler. He not only covers those years but does so with the massive detail that only he, who covered the Nazis in Berlin from 1925-1941 and also poured over the 400+ tons of German documents for five years while writting his book, could. From the years of 1925-45, Shirer uses both these sources to cover every relavent detail of the period. Shirer tells the story of the Nazis very professionally. While he derides many deserving Nazi leaders, loosing his true jounalistic objectiveness, he presents all the facts without speculating about why the Germans let Hitler take over or offering any other crazy theories. This lets the reader go through the history making his own conclusions instead of interpreting some quack's thoughts on Hitler. The only slight fault of this book is that Shirer depicts Berliners and other Germans as good natured people who were taken advantage of by Hitler and who wanted no part in WWII. Though this is most likely true for some Germans, others, if not most, agreed with Hitler. Shirer probalbly befrended many Berliners during his time there and was hesitant to goup them with Hitler. This minor flaw is not nearly enough to drop this book from a perfect score. If you want a definative, no questions at the end, every last detail history of the Third Reich (as every history enthusiast should) look no further."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Insightful account of the history of Hitler's german"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"A wonderful, informative book.

There are are no cross references to this masterpiece. Deem it a classic!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Overall the book is an interesting read, but the author's pro-American bias is abundantly evident. With the benefit of hindsight, the author levels all sorts of accusations on the naivete of the European rulers, as if he and the American leadership were onto Hitler's plans all along.The book also reinforces one of the greatest myths of WWII (especially here in the US) that Hitler was somehow a military and political genius, when in fact, even from the evidence in the book itself it transpires that Hitler was merely a high-stakes gambler that had a spate of lucky events in the beginning of his career.The book's age also helps reveal some of the lack of objectivity from the author when considering members of the Nazi party throughout its existence. It seems Shirer wants to believe that all Nazi party members were caricature movie villains, even trying to go into the minds of these people to analyze their reasons for belonging to a party that was not entirely different from a myriad of others that existed at the time in both sides of the Atlantic. When nothing else can be found against an individual, he calls them \\"homosexuals\\" as if that was a character killer.In sum, it is a coherent chronicle of the events at the time, even if the subjective interpretation given by the author to the reasons and consequences of the events are a bit biased by his own national/religious affiliation."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is invaluable for anyone (including myself) that only know the broad outlines of the rise of Nazi Germany. It is really a monumental work in its own and even more amazing that it was written in an age without the internet or even computerized research. Shirer is writing in an age (barely 10 years after the end of the war) where there was no Holocaust museum, no Holocaust memorial; he doesn't even use the word. In this way, the reader really gets a sense for how the war must have looked to people who lived through it. At a time when Holocaust survivors were on \\"This Is Your Life\\" he conveys a sense of horror that is much more modern than the period in which he wrote.The one criticism, such as it is, is that minor portions are dated. I'm thinking here specifically of his treatment of Ernst Rohm, an early Nazi-party crony of Hitler's and the head of the SA. Rohm, who was a homosexual, was murdered on Hitler's orders during the \\"Night of the Long Knives\\" in 1934. Indirectly, Shirer links Rohm's murderous, gangster-thug mentality to his \\"deviant sexual urges\\"."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book analyses the rise of Hitler and his party, how it went on to become one of the worst in the mankind. Also, it explains how the superpowers stayed away when Hitler was growing like cactus. As George in Seinfeld says \\"You could have put Chamberlin's face in the toilet and he would have given half of the Europe to Hitler\\", this book clearly portrays how Britain was a silent observer when Hitler took over Czech.Very worth reading eventhough the early days of rise of Hitler is being painstakingly explained. I guess it can be comparable to Churchill's work of WWII."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"A must read if you want to know about Nazism and the powerplays of the Nazi stalwarts. Very detailed, very informative and frightening.Too bad the author is dead. He could have updated this book with all the newly released information; especially from the former Soviet Union."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I was very impressed with the book. The author brings a first hand impression of the events leading to the most darkest ages of humanity. Although he was trying to stay subjective he did not and brought his own personal opinion from time to time. Historian is not supposed to do that. On the other hand the author was deeply involved in the event s and it is highly understandable why he acted like that. I thought that I am very familiar with those times, 1900-1945, but the book came and shows me what I was missing and it is a lot. The book opened my eyes to the real reasons for the NAZI party and the German people unimaginable behavior and it was a revelation. The book is very successful of explaining the roots of the German hatred to the Jews and the reasons to the Jews' and others' holocaust."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is meticulously researched with as extensive a bibliography as one would expect for a book which tries to cover in one volume a phenomenon lasting 12 years.The style does not carry the reader. This book is more a history student's companion guide rather than a volume one would pick up for the pleasure of reading. I also found irritatingly large numbers of pages where fly on the wall narration was provided without reference to a source which strained credibility because the author was not present when certain events occured, such as the meeting between Stalin and Ribbentrop in August 1939.This struck me as poor investigative journalism and more than once I wanted to close the book for good because of historical inaccuracies, the first of which really bothered me which was the death of Ewald von Kleist, whom I know was still alive in 1974.** A reader pointed out to me there were in fact 3 Ewald von Kleists active in the Wehrmacht at the time, one of whom was still alive at least until the turn of this century and one of whom, as Shirer points out, was executed in 1945. This point was not made clear in the book, hence the confusion on my part.**For the most part, the narrative fleshes out the bones provided by the the references used in the bibliography quite admirably, but at times the story is weighed down by the author's labouring to provide the detail. He says the book was 25 years in the writing. It has taken me more than 12 months to read the 1000+ pages, largely because the style just doesn't flow as perhaps the style of a Hugh Trevor-Roper flows.The subject matter is fascinating, meticulously researched and extensively annotated, but as historical records go, it seems the composition was not a labour of love for the author and so it is not a labour of love to get through as a reader. I find the faults with this book are what I am remembering most, whereas with other books on this subject, my overall impressions are positive across the entire book.This is not one you're going to read twice from cover to cover."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Quite a good and very thorough account of the time. The problem I have is that he lets his liberal slant show through in his treatment of the non-Nazi political movements of the 1920s. But I am quite impressed with his tracing of the roots of the Nazi ideology, especially in regards of the German philosophers of the 19th century who he readily acknowledges to be the progenitors of both Nazism and Communism (Hegel, Fichte, Kant, Nietzsche, etc.). Very few commentators seem to acknowlege that Fascism and Communism are two sides of the same statist coin, coming from the same philosophical roots."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Simply enjoyed.

I think that for me at least it filled in all the voids where a high school and college didn't cover. It my take one a while to read but the knowlage that one learns from this book if irreplaceable .

If there was any argument for preventive war against Hitler, especially before Munich, this is it. Appeasement was useless with Hitler. It only made him stronger and bolder."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"If you only could read and own one history book on Nazi Germany, this would be it. Don't let the 1245 pages daunt you, this is a very well written and readable book on the subject. Shirer was apparently a journalist and started research on the book when he first went to Germany in 1925. He spent 5-1/2 years writing it. The title pretty much explains it, it covers the rise of Adolf Hitler to the eventual fall of Berlin. There are other history books that cover specific aspects of the Nazi's, such as the recommended 2002 publication of Antony Beevor's The Fall of Berlin 1945, but this is the one history book on it all. Considering how the events covered set up the modern world, this should be essential reading for everyone on the planet."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Many people have remarked that Shirer wasn't the most objective observer of the Third Reich. Some reviewers have stated that they would have preferred a volume devoid of personal biases and slanted observations, believing themselves competent to form their own opinions of the characters involved. If you count yourself one of this group, don't read Shirer. Don't read, for that matter, any book written by a human. I am more than content to base my opinions of Nazi leaders on Shirer's observations. He was an incredibly intelligent man in the best position possible for giving us an outsider's view into the otherwise murky world of Nazi Germany. How else do we form conclusions about men and women who died 60 years ago if not by cannibalizing the observations of others? It is impossible for anyone lving today to form an accurate picture of any historical figure without relying on the words of previous observers. Where else but from Shirer could we have learned that Hitler was commonly reffered to as a \\"Teppichfresser\\" ('carpet-eater' - referring to his occaisional fits of rage that ended with him drooling on the floor and knawing at the carpet) by those who disliked him? By the very nature of its author and the circumstances under which it was written, this book will probably never be surpassed in providing a broad, yet incredibly insightful view into the Third Reich."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"One of the Top Ten Books of All Time!! A Triumph!!!Kershaw, eat your heart out, you are an amateur compared to Shirer.Shirer was actually there, during the rise and fall. He is not only a masterful story-teller and highly acclaimed journalist, but a witness to history. Of equal importance: He gets it right!Shirer, in this important book, explains not ony the rise and fall of Nazi Germany, but of Adolf Hitler. All other books on Hitler and Nazi Germany pale in comparison to Shirer's master work, which is truly one of the best books of all time."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I rented this book from the library, and it is definitely one of the most thorough history books I have ever experienced. It covers all aspects of the Third Reich on an extremely detailed and interesting level. The only down side (if you can call it that) is that being 1200 pages long- it takes a long time to read, so plan on having alot of free time before reading. Other then that, it is a very enjoyable book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I'd known vaguely about WWII, the same way many people do, when I picked this book up several years ago. I remember it from my father's book collection. Anyway, it held my attention and I finished it about four days. William Shirer spent many years in Germany until about half way during WWII. His experiences during that time as a reporter allowed him to tell a more-or-less accurate story and tell it in a fashion that, unlike many historical books, is enjoyable to read.Some would argue as to the 100% accuracy of the book or to it's relevence to history. Personally, having read (and I'm not exaggerating) most of the so called &quot;classic&quot; biographies on the Nazi leadership, philosophy, policatal system and anything else, I think it is a very important contribution that covers the important parts of the Third Reich (1933-45) in detail. I think, given when it was written, that it is surprisingly unbiased and fair and Shirer has done his best to keep his personal feelings out of the book. He does make observations from time to time, but usually only in situations where he was actually present at the event.If you are new to the subject of the Nazi rise to power and the subsequent 12 years, then I cannot think of a better place to start. There are other books on the subject, but few that are as easy to read and cover quite as much as this one."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I started to read this title over 40 years ago while I was still in high school. I must tell you that reading this book is what turned me into a German major in college. I wanted to understand more. But Shirer started all that with this very well annotated book covering the whole ugly story of how a small group of radical took over the political, and eventually all aspects, of a country's life.I find his writing very engaging and he turned the history into a suspenseful tale with myriad twists and turns that any fiction writer would love to think of. There were many sections of the book that I had to stop reading and wait for my emotions to calm down a bit before I could continue. Shirer does not paint his pictures in the soft pastel palates of water colors. It is not for the troubled to read. One needs to be strong to think about some of the material facts presented in this book.It is especially timely now, when we Americans are in the throws of similar demogoguery and scapegoating in our political world. Indeed, it quite amazes me how many of the damning things said about the Jewish Germans are the same one being currently slung at members of other groups right now in this country."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Reading this book is like attending and watching an exciting World Series finale from a seat right behind the home plate.Excellent narrative history sprinkled with a good use of original quotes.Current paperback edition is deluxed-sized with a readable font."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer admits in his Foreword to \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,\\" that he would not have started such a project merely on the basis of having been an on-the-spot observer of the Reich's development. Being stationed as a reporter in Berlin from the mid-thirties until just before America entered the war, certainly helped when the time came to take a deep breath and begin this work. However, what really spurred him on was the enormous, much too voluminous amount in fact, of material left behind by the German general staff and almost all government ministries, presumably in their panic to escape the Russians. In fact, Russian units entering the centre of the city found a few desultory piles of classified material burning behind the Reichstag and were even able to save much of that.This is a work that falls between two categories. It is hardly light enough reading to be easily packaged as an ordinary paperback (although paperback editions abound); nor is it a scholarly work trying to be complete in every detail, with all the antics of the vast assemblage of characters carefully foot-noted, cross-referenced and indexed. It is a solid book, but fortunately, immensely readable and I wonder how you could really get around an understanding of the Third Reich without it (or why you would want to). In addition, its writer is an American and for some reason, that seems to make it more dependable. Shirer is no fool; he treats the subject with openness and honesty, giving us what I feel is a better, more reliable view than certain European sources might do. This is in spite of a certain tendency he has to view the main protagonists with a jaundiced eye. But who could really view the von Ribbentrops and Goerings of this world with extreme fairness, much after 1940?There is nothing like having been there, and Shirer has recorded his experiences in diary form in \\"Berlin Diary,\\" which is also well worth reading. But if you are going to read just one main book about the history of the Third Reich, you won't go far wrong with this one. It's a major accomplishment."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This massive tome is still a solid treatment of WWII and the events leading up to it. While its history isn't perfect, it is Nazi Germany as the author saw it--he remained there until late 1940, which took special courage. Shirer did not know all that we know now, but a lot of what he says has held up.It would be a much more wearying book were it not for Shirer's unique and pungent commentary on Nazi figures he found lacking in merit, particularly Ribbentrop. (How can anyone resist a characterization like 'insufferable ignoramus'?) He delves into some of the more interesting rogues in the Nazi gallery, such as Alfred Naujocks, giving information not commonly known. Strongly recommended, with the caveat that one should also read other books to get a more complete historical perspective."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Don't let the size of this book deter you from reading what is truly a masterpiece. William Shirer's look at one of history's most ruthless regimes is nothing short of outstanding. It is a well-written and utterly absorbing account of Hitler's rise to power, his reign of the Third Reich, and his subsequent fall. Shirer's painstaking and extensive research, coupled with his clear writing, provides the reader with a terrifying account of the horrors of Hitler's reign of terror. It is truly amazing to me that one man could mesmerize a country and lead them into a war they did not want and felt they could not win. The only drawback to the book is this: I am admittedly weak in geography and would liked to have seen a few maps of pre-War and post-War Europe throughout the text. In addition, maps of troop movements and campaigns during the War may have provided a clearer picture of the expanse of the German Empire at its height; however, the lack of maps certainly did not detract from the written work. Overall, a truly exceptional book that should be read by anyone who is interested in German/European history, WWII, or Adolf Hitler."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is so good that despite the thickness, I read it twice. While it is a chronicle of the rise of Germany from the ashes of defeat in World War I to an even greater pile of ashes after World War II, it is not a historical account. Shirer is a journalist, and that is the approach he took in writing the book.There is no historical event more fascinating than the manner in which Adolf Hitler rose to such power in Germany and led it to such ruin. Approximately a decade before rising to power in Germany, Hitler stated his intentions quite clearly in the book \\"Mein Kampf\\" (My Battle). Yet, the German people were so desperate at the time that almost anything seemed to be an improvement. The one quote that always comes back is when a German citizen is being interviewed. When asked about giving up their freedom when the Nazis came to power the reply was, \\"Yes, but before we were free to starve.\\"I have read many books about the rise of the Nazi state in Germany, but this one is clearly the best in describing the actual events, from the beginnings until the disastrous conclusion. I first read it in 1975 and reread it again in 1994. Most likely, I will reread it again somewhere around 2014. It is the best description available about how bad things can go when ideologues seize power and the moderate forces in the society respond either tepidly or feel obligated to render their support. Few people realize that Hitler came to power legally and with the support of a large part of the political establishment."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I'm not a fast reader and I dove into the nearly 1,200-page tome with the understanding that I would probably devote the next month or two to the quest of gaining a much fuller understanding of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany.I thought it would be worth the effort and I was right. William Shirer's engrossing narrative provides a virtual \\"everything you ever wanted to know\\" about the Third Reich from the vantage point of someone who was actually there!A few reviewers have carped about his tendancy toward journalistic license at the expense of academic research, but I was able to overlook this in much the same way that I got past the same criticisms while reading Shelby Foote's wonderful three-volume account of The Civil War. Dry historic research is okay for dry historic researchers.But, most popular writers are going to have some sort of bias, and Shirer can't avoid his need to remind us frequently the Nazis were really BAD people and did really BAD things. This I do not mind .. I appreciate it in fact."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"By reading this book I came to the conclusion that Hitler almost made it to rule all of Europe. I have not read a better overall account of the Nazis then this book offers. It does not have in-depth coverage of battles, as that is not the focus of the book. What it does cover is the overall details of the leadership of the Nazis through the period. The title could make you think this is going to be one of those very dry reviews favored only by history professors, but that is not the case. The book is a well-written and orderly book that is easy to read. The detail of the personalities involved made the list of characters easer to remember. There is just so much good information that this book should be the first book read by anyone wanting to gain an understanding of WW 2 in Europe."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is a spectacular achievement by an author who knows whereof he speaks. Shirer was an American journalist in Germany during the 1930's; he watched Hitler's rise from obscurity in Austria to become the most powerful and evil force in Europe. Shirer was witness to what Hitler built and nourished and he doesn't pretend to be impartial. He states in the book's introduction that he hates all totalitarian governments and he especially came to loathe this one as he watched its relentless assault and violation of everything that makes people human. Shirer pays Hitler grudging respect as a man of undoubted, if evil, genius. He knew how to manipulate time and circumstances to his advantage. But he couldn't have done it alone or in a vacuum, and Shirer builds a solid background on the historical events that made Hitler and Nazism possible. Antisemitism was an old story in Germany; there is an almost unbroken string from Hitler back to Martin Luther whose advice to kill and destroy all Jews as enemies of mankind was \\"literally followed 500 years later by Hitler, Goering and Himmler\\". He writes of how the great majority of Germans enthusiastically and blindly followed Hitler through conquest, war, and the destruction and devastation of their country. And he shows in convincing and sickening detail the German mindset that made them \\"ubermensch\\" in their own minds, and everyone else, especially Jews and Slavic peoples, subhumans to be killed or allowed to live as slaves to German \\"kultur\\".Shirer's book is abundantly documented, largely thanks to the bonanza of Nazi documents that fell almost untouched into Allied hands at the end of the war. Perhaps it was that mania for organization and precision that contributed to the \\"Final Solution\\": first, the determination that the Jews were to be eliminated and then the search for a method to most efficiently bring this about. So from mass shootings in the trenches, they progressed to Auschwitz and the gas chambers, and kept searching for ways to improve the rate and efficiency of the carnage right up to the end.What kind of people would participate in something as monstrous as this? Some of the most chilling passages in the book are the descriptions of the defendants' testimony at the Nuremberg trials, as when one officer says without batting an eye that he personally oversaw the deaths of 90,000 people. Even this pales before the descriptions of the medical experiments in the concentration camps, when respected doctors prostituted their science and their souls in some of the most despicable tortures ever perpetrated on human beings, and lost their own humanity in the process.One of the main strengths of the book, besides the wealth of documentation, is that it was written only 14 years after the end of the war, when many of the main characters were still alive. Shirer gives grudging respect to those Germans such as Halder and Speer who were able to face up to and acknowledge their own guilt and complicity that allowed the unspeakable to become real. One wonders what Heydrich or Von Ribbentrop would have told him had they not been executed, one by Czech partisans and the other by a hangman's noose after the Nuremberg trials.Shirer narrates in detail the failed plot to kill Hitler by his own officers in 1944, the revenge exacted by Hitler and his kangaroo courts, the Allied invasion of Western Europe and the final assault by Russia and the Allied forces that destroyed Nazi Germany, and not a minute too soon. He feels some sympathy for the German people who followed Hitler blindly to their own destruction, like lemmings over a cliff. It is difficult to share his feelings. One reads this awesome book and feels that they brought it on themselves, they enthusiastically backed Hitler's rise to power, and in doing so, unleashed a monster."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is one of the most interesting historical book I have ever read in my life. In my high school days, history has always been one of my favorites subjects but I haven't done anything outside of school to expand on it. One event that has always piqued my curiosity has been World War II, specifically what happened with the German government and of course, with Adolf Hitler. I find it very hard to resist learning about the famous German dictator and in various times, I often search on Youtube for some of his videos. That quenched some of my thirst for knowledge but for higher learning, nothing beats reading a book and so my task was to find an unbiased book that not only chronicles the events leading up to World War II but that also dug into the mind and details of Hitler himself. I was immediately drawn toward this monstrous of a book by William Shirer. I have learned so much after having finally devoured this book from start to finish in just a matter of two and a half weeks.I will like to point out that for anyone who have a problem with people like me who took it upon themselves to dedicate a huge chunk of their time devoted to learning about Adolf Hitler, I can assure you its not due to admiration. Many of my friends think me crazy to actually wanting to learn about the history of this crazed man who inevitably led to the extermination of millions and millions of lives. If you never have thought it curious as to how just one single man on this planet could come to this much power, then obviously this book isn't for you. If you have never felt some sort of sympathy for the millions of lives lost and took it upon yourself to learn of their plight and what they actually had to go through, then obviously this book isn't for you. I could go on but I'm sure you get the point.The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich does an excellent job of presenting the facts of the events that took place, especially between 1933 when Hitler came into full power until his ultimate demise in 1945. There are definitely a ton more of written material on earlier events of Hitler's life but it was during that period I just mentioned that is so examined by many historians. Only after having access to the tons of captured documents after the war, which many of them comprises of secret telegrams, does the author have a remote chance of presenting and giving us readers as close as a picture possible of what actually took place in that fateful era of terror. Believe me when I say this that there will be many moments throughout this book that will just knock you out of your feet. It's so surprising for someone who don't have much knowledge on this subject, such as myself, to finally get an insight into how and why events folded as they did back then.For the most part, I can sense that the author tried very hard to keep any of his bigotry and opinions to himself but you can definitely also sense his anger and criticism throughout the book. For example, he keeps referring to Hermann Goering as the \\"fat\\" Reich Marshall. However, I can assure you that it does not hinder the reading experience at all and you wouldn't in any way feel throughout the book feel offended by the author's remarks. If you are actually looking for a book detailing the Holocaust event, you'll be disappointed in this regard and should look elsewhere if that is your main focus. The author, however, does dedicate one entire chapter on presenting details of what actually happened in the concentration camps and how the Nazi's planned for the mass extermination of the Jews.Every chapter is filled with footnotes and citations. My personal recommendation is that if you want to get the most out of this book, you'll definitely want to read all the footnotes from the author. However, many of the source citations I left unread. The author obviously had to include them (trust me, there are a ton of them) due to completeness sake. In fact, even the author himself stated how shocked he was to learn of how well his book sold for something that has so much footnotes and citations. To give you a hint of just how much is included here, the book itself contains about 1280 pages. The actual story ends at about 73% ( I read digital edition). The rest is filled with citations!This book really did open my eyes and I can't thank the author enough for this. I'm sure he spent countless days and nights putting this book together. While many people would automatically categorize upon hearing the name of Adolf Hitler into the \\"evil people\\" category, they have no idea or knowledge of the man himself. Many people would not consider him an evil genius because they have no idea of how he completely conquered his neighboring countries without shedding one single drop of blood. They have no idea that if you looked up the phrase \\"from rags to riches\\", you might probably find a picture of Hitler attached there. They have no idea that his last name of \\"Hitler\\" almost didn't become to be and if it were so, the course of history would have been changed forever just for that fact alone. They have no idea of how important Britain, France, Russia and the United States have played in the role of taking down the Third Reich. They have no idea how the country of Yugoslavia, at the expense of many people's lives, ultimately played the biggest role in the defeat of German troops in Russia and its not in the way you would think initially. These were just some out of the many other things I have learned from this book.I felt that I owed it that much to the millions of victims whose lives were lost due to this tragic event that I at least learn of what happened to them. In this way, they could at least continue to live on through the memory of other human beings and not fade into obscurity forever. There are still many mysteries that are left unsolved even after the capture of secret documents which the Germans failed to destroy. We, of course, have the benefit of hindsight and analysts and historians are able to leisurely dissect everything that has happened in the Third Reich era but there are just some things that cannot be accounted for no matter how hard one try. But of course, that's not the purpose of this book. If you do want to learn everything you can about one of the darkest period known to mankind, than you definitely have to pick up this book. Humankind can only pray that there will never be another Adolf Hitler. Once you've read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, you'll truly be able to understand why.As the author states at the end of the book, \\" Remembrance of the past helps us to understand the present\\". If you can't understand that, then I'll repeat here that this book obviously isn't for you.**********Here are some personal movie's I've seen and recommend relating to WWII and Germany:Schindler's List DVD (Universal's 100th Anniversary)DefianceDownfall [DVD]The PianistValkyrie (Single-Disc Edition)"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Anybody that is interested, like me, in German politics and history especially during the Nazi's 12 year rule, will find this book hard to put down.

I have read it twice word for word and will most likely read it again sometime."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This has been one of the most entertaining, shocking, and interesting stories I have ever come across. And to think that it is true. Shirer's insight as a witness to many of these historic events add to the depth of information on this evil empire. Every detail one needs to understand exactly what went on, and how, is in this book. I highly recommend it. A classic for a reason."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I started reading this book when I was 13. It was the first book I had read about WWII. It was difficult to get into at first, and I probably would not recommend it to anyone who hasn't read anything about WWII before. Shirer sometimes introduces new figures without an explanation as to who they were. It took me almost half the book to figure out Goebbles position.This book is an amazingly detailed account of Nazi Germany. The details are arranged in such a way that it is extremely interesting. His thought progression is logical and he allows the reader to take in the important details.I find it very important for people to read this book. My views on life, politics, and war completely changed after finishing the book. We take so much for granted in the United States. It was only 80 years ago that Germany went through the depression. Politics were much different back then than now. Anyone who wants to be able to look at World War II in a different light, and see what they are really taking for granted, should definitely read this book. It is a truly amazing tale."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"In the \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" all of what is mankind - the greatest triumphs to the most revolting follies - are layed before us in this timeless masterpiece. The great powers placate the insatiable appetite of mad-dog Hitler only to be confronted with complete capitulation or fight. Read how leader of the free world, Prime Minister Chamberlain, deludes himself with his triumphal proclamation - \\"peace in our time\\" - only to be humiliated as the greatest political fool of all time. Great leaders Stalin, Hitler, Musolini, Churchill, and Roosevelt jockey for position at the eave of War. Blitzkieg! and combat fronts extend for thousands of kilometers as the Reich opens fronts and gathers conquests in all directions. Chills will run down your back as you read of true valor at Stalingrad. D-Day is almost anti-climactic as truly epic battles in years prior bring stagnation, then collapse of the Reich's Eastern Front. Anger will engulf your heart as you read about the \\"Final Solution.\\" The true character of Hitler will haunt you henceforth. You will wonder, \\"How on earth life might be today had the Allies lost.\\"William Shirer's book is so meticulously researched and footnoted, and so compellingly written, that the most devout \\"Holy Roller\\" will reject the Scriptures before he doubts this monumental work. You will read and re-read this book throughout your life, maybe, just maybe wondering, \\"What is Civilization anyway?\\" or \\"Is Pacifism Folly through and through?\\" Should you choose just one book of Human History, choose this one."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I had almost given up on my hope of getting this one on my kindle ... recently my pre-order for it had been cancelled ... but now it is here.

Thanx Amazon! :)"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"That Hitler's parent were 2nd cousins and that they needed an Episcopalian dispensation to wed? Or that his tenure as an \\"artist\\" consisted of painting crappy postcards for tourists? That if his father wasn't recognized by his father in middle age, that chants of \\"Heil Schicklegruber\\" would has resonated throughout the Reich? Well you should. The quintessential text on Nazi Germany written by William Shirer is something you should read. Quippy fun facts aside, this text is comprised of an eyewitness account from day one until VE day and beyond. Shirer had access to the captured documents, diaries, and files and is able to work fact and detail into a highly readable account. Previous issues with the layman reader tackling this work stemmed largely from size of the volume and not readability but the Kindle Edition provides the necessary ergonomic realities to curl up with this work. Read it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The book is excellent, but the Kindle edition has a lot of problems. Many of the footnote links don't work, and some footnotes are entirely missing. I believe this is an edition that's already been \\"corrected\\" to a certain extent, because it does have page numbers, which were apparently missing on the first Kindle edition.One of the most annoying problems is that there are many passages quoted from documents that are not distinguished in any way from the rest of the text. I imagine that in the hard copy edition, these are indented and use a smaller typeface; I read the hard copy edition years ago, but I can't remember. In this Kindle edition, it often is not at all clear that you are switching from the author's words to words from a letter or memorandum written by one of the protagonists. For one thing, the author often makes first-person observations, so a sudden switch to the first person doesn't always indicate a quotation.Here is one example, from page 501, location 12086:|| Three days later, on July 29th, Weizsaeker sent a secret dispatch by courier to Schulenburg in Moscow.It would be important for us to know whether the remarks made to Astakhov and Babarin have met with any response in Moscow. ||Not until I was well past that second sentence did I realize that this was the contents of the dispatch. At first I thought the author was saying that it would be important to him and other historians to know what the response was. The present tense \\"have\\" was my first clue that this was not an authorial observation.Some other instances are even more confusing, but I didn't start flagging them with a bookmark until I got so frustrated that I decided to mention the problem in a review."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"It's incredible and horrible truth,very detailed and never should have happened and never should repeat.

Why would I want to read a book about an idology and people that had spread so much hate and who had been defeated?Time passes and while I had seen just about every documentary on Germany that explained that time period, current events have made me question much about the rise of Hitler. I thought I \\"knew\\" all I needed to know about the subject. I was so very wrong. Shirer's well researched and documented material is worth the time, effort and thoughtful reflection about the events of post WWI Germany and the fertile bed of self-interests that fueled the rise of a man like Hitler.Hitler writes in Mein Kampf that his only \\"real talent\\" was to give good speeches. He drew from others the base for his ideas and brewed them in the broth of anti-Semitism. He selected thugs, perverts, sadists and pimps to be in his \\"inner circle\\". Whenever he was challanged by others, he would enter into triades that silenced those who opossed him,or disgraced them, or eliminated them out-right. His total control of the German people and the policies he put into place was seen \\"as the right thing to do.\\" Sound familiar?Pages 61 and 62 strikes a very haunting cord. I strongly urge everyone to read those two pages about the distruction of the German economy from 1921 through 1923....read it slowly and think about it in depth.All in all, this is a work that puts truth to the phrase...\\"Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\\"It is a long (1143 pages without the notes 1245 with references) missive but take your time.

Shirer brings to light, with marked detail, one of the darkest periods in world history. His use of captured German documents and secret communiques between the leaders of Nazi Germany opens ones eyes to evil that pervaded the Third Reich. Anyone who calls themselves a World War II historian or enthusiast NEEDS to read this book. I know far more now that I have read it. Without Mr. Shirer and his dedication to a topic that was contained within volumns of paperwork a much needed work of history would have gone aside."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is by far the best , as well as most informative book ever written on Russia and Germany during the Third Reich. Shirer is a genius. The book was long and sometimes the reading seemed tedious, but the knowledge that I GAINED was amazing. I was actually able to remember many facts that were present in the book, unlike in any of the other books that I have read. My favorite section in the book would have to have been THE NEW ORDER. Though it was on the gruesome topic of the concentration camps it was so flowing and descriptive that I felt the hurt. It wasn't presented as a bunch of facts on a page but was written out to tell the true horror. Mr. Shirer's research was so extensive and painstaking, but in the end his result was far more superior than any other book ever written. I would like to end my statements by saying that THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH will forever touch me, and Mr. Shirer's work shall never be forgotten."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer was a journalist who lived in Berlin during the '30s and '40s and saw first-hand the horrors and the allure of the German Nationalist Socialist party. Based upon his own personal experiences and a large number of official German documents captured in the war, he has written _the_ history of the era. It covers the history of the Nazi party from the birth of Hitler, all the way to the bitter and shattering defeat in 1945.The writing is superb and the story he tells is both compelling and horrifying. If you must buy one book on the 3rd Reich then this is the one. A classic."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I have wanted to read this book for what literally amounts to 50 years and finally decided to treat myself to the 50th Anniversary edition as a Christmas present. As expected, the book is a riveting account of a very dark period of world history, expertly written by William L. Shirer. Unfortunately, due to a printing error, my particular volume did not include pages 837 through 868, 30 critical pages chronicling the beginning of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. I have contacted Amazon and they are going to send a replacement but I only hope the error was caught by the publisher and the replacement does not have the same missing pages. I also hope no one else has encountered this disappointing dilemma. I am certain that if it was a complete volume, I would be rating book with 5 Stars."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"First I want to point out the negatives I see in Shirer's work. Shirer wrote the book over five decades ago, and this in and of itself, makes the book less reliable in some areas of study. It has the obvious flaw of not having the time nor the resources now available to write a book from a well-balanced and documented viewpoint. There is also the weakness in the fact that Shirer was a journalist and not an historian. This fact is really negligible given the fact that history is written by people who observe and write about events. Saying he was unqualified to write history is like saying that Anne Frank was not qualified to write about the experiences reflecting all Jewish families during the Holocaust. Her experience may be characteristic of most, maybe even all Jewish families; however, this means nothing to relevance of her story. Shirer also has the flaw of verbosity, which is a major reason why it lasts 1100 plus pages. Finally, the Kindle version does need work with commas, periods, etc.. This is not Shirer's fault. He has been dead since 1993, long before the Kindle or its version was in existence. That issue should be taken up with Amazon and not used to rate his work.The book stands alone as a classic among the works that attempt to explain what went drastically wrong with Germany and its Third Reich. Even with the flaws mentioned, he makes a grand attempt to bring to life some of the key events and ideas that created Hitler and Nazi Germany. Most of his facts are dead on, and the work has the benefit of reflecting attitudes and dispositions of those who were on the \\"winning\\" side of WWII. The study of history is not for the faint of heart. To be successful at the endeavor requires reading primary and secondary sources that sometimes are excellent due to the fact that it is \\"less than perfect.\\" The field is a critical thinking field that forces its true students to hash through information that is sometimes long, tedious, and sometimes misguided. Shirer's book contains all of these. One of the greatest uses of the book is the window that it provides into the past, not just the past of the Nazis, but the time that it was written in and its audience.I was first assigned this book in college. It was the longest book I had ever read at that point on any single topic, and I was petrified. However, I tackled it, suffered through some of it, and then found it fascinating. I have a real problem with students who write about the book saying it is boring or even asserting that their requirement to read the book should somehow critically apply because they think they deserve to \\"have a life.\\" I am sure the people who experienced the Third Reich felt that they were worthy of having a life as well. I believe that both Nazi and those who were persecuted would stand amazed at the fact that we live in a \\"free world\\" where people believe that history (or any academic study) should be based on entertainment quality and brevity. The book is dated in its language, but can be read by anyone with a middle grades education (or should be). I am not dismayed by the fact that you do not understand what you are reading because that is simply a reflection of what our schools have allowed in an age of \\"make 'em successful and not necessarily educated.\\" If you fall into this category as a student and do not wish to push through and learn to deal with a challenge, I suggest you explain to your parents that their desire for you to become a well-round liberal arts student is not for you and pursue an endeavor that is more suited to your motivation and interests. Our colleges today are graduating far more non-thinking imbeciles than we can ever hope to gainfully employ. There are fields that need you and will pay you well without torturing you or taking advantage of your right to have a life. The schools may be promising you an A but academia does not grade quality on a 4.0 scale or your ranking in the graduating class."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"An epic historical masterpiece. William L. Shirer delivers an exhaustive account of the Third Reich that even to this day has been surpassed by none."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"A very wise man once said if we did not learn our lessons from history, then we are destined to repeat it. When I bought this book I was looking for parallels from history to these current economic times. Although we are supposedly more enlightened,which I am doubtful, we are facing perilous fractures in the economic wall of conformity. The object of a global ecomony was to create a parity in monetary systems (theoretical). We need to reel-in our theories and repair the breeches in light of history. Hitler was rebellious, yet he honed his powerful rhetoric in the slum hostels of Vienna. He nationlized everything once he became the ruling authority. There comes a time when looking back on the fiercest dictator in the 20th century can be a valuable tool. More people need to investigate his method and come to some chilling conclusions."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I have owned this volume since it was originlly published. It has a place of honor in my personal library. My recent purchase was a Christmas gift for an adult son who requested it. This volume, at over 1200 pages, is not for the person with a casual interest in American and World history. For the history buff, it is a fascinating tale of how a relatively small group of thugs hijacked a country and, in a few short years, 1933 to 1945, brought that country to ruin. It stands as an important cautionary tale for the United States today as it has to deal with thugocracys around the world. William Shirer was not an academic who researched ancient writings of other authors to produce his book. He was a reporter who lived in Germany after World War I and watched the events unfold from inside the country. The writing is authentic. The tale told is gripping. For the serious history buff, I can only say that it is worth the time to read every page. After you have read it, you will want to pick it up again, from time to time, to remind yourself how important it is to pay attention to what YOUR politicians are doing and to RAISE HELL when they are not truly representing the people."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I consider myself a fan of good history books yet I am no PhD in history or anything like that. Quite simply, this it one of the best history books I have ever read. It is all-encompassing in that is completely explains the 3rd Reich from its inception to his death. Every detail is there including Hitler's childhood, coming of age, the War, the death camps, all of it. Yet despite this broad scope, the novel is a remarkably easy read. The prose rarely bogs down in technical details. The Nazi regime comes to life. And most chapters are literally page-turners since it is so heart-wrenching to watch as the world tries to cope with Hitler, failing to realize what a evil maniac he truly is. If you like history books yet dread dry, technical prose as I do, this is the book for you. I was truly sad when I finished it and will liklely read it many times again."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"At well over a thousand pages, one might wonder how \\"readable\\" such a history could be, but Shirer's work is excellent. I won't repeat much of the acclaim already found here.One stumbling block is that in a very few places the terminology is outdated, and most certainly not politically correct. For example, the homosexual leadership of the SA are described as \\"perverted\\" and \\"deviant\\", and its hard to say from the book whether they truly were or if this is just a 1950s label for gay. Similarly, the Japanese turned down negotiations with \\"Ah, so sorry, please\\". I doubt that's a direct quote.Those two snags aside, the rest of the book holds up exceedingly well, and there are actually very few references that are lost on the modern reader, especially compared to the writings of, for example, Churchill, which are full of references to then-current names and events that have lost their relevance over time.The thesis that the readiness to accept National Socialism was built into German culture and mythology of the day may not be a popular one, nor commonly accepted today, but Shirer provides enough supporting material that one can at least see his point.Be prepared for a lot of detail: D-Day doesn't occur until well past page 1000, for example. One thing I loved however was that the book was not full of throwaway names that appear only once. That's usually an issue for me (names and dates that will be forgotten soon after reading) and this book is largely absent of them.It's also relatively even, in that there are very few places where it drags. With few exceptions, the narrative progresses smoothly and its as much of a \\"page turner\\" as non-fiction can be."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This tome is the horse's mouth for getting inside the Nazi regime. Shirer was there, it is as simple as that. Although, as others have complained the history is too turgid with facts, I found myself skipping over many of the drier parts to vignettes of Hitler himself, and Himmler Goebbels and Goering and Mussolini and the incomparably brave Rommel. I shuddered. The insane fanaticism of Goebbels and his wife who had their six children, who had just before been playing in the bunker, destroyed by lethal injection belies credulity. How COULD they murder their own children? Mussolini's more or less grovelling before Hitler gave me the creeps and I sweat through the various plots to assassinated Hitler. In a famous case, the briefcase containing the bomb was kicked inadvertantly from its place right next to Hitler's feet by a staff member who had no idea a bomb was in it. Hitler thus escaped being blown up by a hair. Eva Braun's character is woven throughout the book. Not very intelligent but described as very, very nice, she languished for twelve years as Hitler's mistress and rather like an obedient dog determined to die with him without fuss or without fanfare. Hitler did not love her.There are descriptions of Hitler in the bunker when his face would turn red with rage, the blood vessels in his forehead could be seen pulsating, his hands would shake, one leg would shake, he would practically scream out his vituperation. I got this horrible impression of a puppet on a string being controlled by demons.The macabre wedding breakfast in the bunker replete with champagne after Hitler marries Eva almost belies belief.I can see the group probably looking at their shoes, smiles that were grimaces plastered on their faces, having to listen as Hitler ranted on and on.The man who destroyed his own country ended his long soliloquy by saying he wished there was peace again so he could go to the opera or other pleasures.Don't let the length of \\"Rise and Fall\\" deter you. This book is a masterpiece.I didn't read it all but the characters who played on this monstrous Third Reich stage and who are revealed in the book, will make me cringe forever and wonder how mankind could be so evil."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Considering the subject matter this was never going to be an easy book to read but would it be factual, objective and well-written?Well, factual certainly: the great number of records and archives that became available after the war has made it possible for historians to have a much clearer picture of this period of history than they have had of possibly any other event previously.Objective? Shirer was a correspondent living in Germany during the war and he openly admits that there are some aspects of the book that are more to do with subjective opinion than objective fact. Nonetheless, any recounting of an historical event is based on whatever documentation you can find (which may or may not be embellished, falsified, inaccurate), photographs, memorabilia and always, in some part, word of mouth accounts.Well written? As a correspondent Shirer was a career wordsmith and he does write eloquently. When I initially began reading the book, it did seem to jump around a little but I quickly became accustomed to Shirer's style. His sudden leaps ahead from, for example, pre-war events to conclusions drawn as a result of Nuremburg trials did have a logic. So many things were covered in this book that an entirely chronological record would have been extremely difficult to follow.World War II is a period of history that all of us must have some knowledge about, no matter how perfunctory. As it happens, this is a period of history that I read extensively about a few years ago and I felt sure that The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich would simply retell facts I already knew, rather than add anything additional to my knowledge.I was, of course, wrong. This book ran for 45 hours (I listened to the audio version) and a great many things were new to me. William Shirer's first hand observations of Hitler and his formidable rages, the rumours Shirer picked up from correspondents, the events he was privy to as a member of the press: these are all things that are unique to his story. This is a factual chronicle of events that led to Hitler's rise to power and the subsequent political events that led to the war but it also serves as a memoir of a foreign correspondent's time living in and reporting from a country at war.I found the political aspects of the story easier than the military aspects. Shirer does discuss military movements with some considerable detail, which I found difficult to follow at times and as a result I struggled to remain engaged. However, his telling of political events was utterly beyond reproach. He paints a conflicting picture of Hitler, which fits so completely with the fact that Hitler was a very conflicted man with a very conflicting persona. Charismatic one moment and raging blindly the next, he was beloved to his people, feared by his peers, abhorred by his enemies.Shirer bravely states what many of us would feel unable to utter: Hitler was a remarkable politician and tactician. It was these traits that made him such a formidable opponent and made his regime so frightening. When you place someone utterly brilliant in such a position of power, it is the recipe for disaster and Shirer witnessed this first-hand.There are some who have disagreed with Shirer's assessment of events or the way in which he perceived things that were occurring around him but I have read few chronicles that can rival this for the sheer amount of detail. Any book about this period of history will be difficult to write and difficult to read but this is an excellent effort from Shirer to document a horrific period of history."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Reading this book, it is easy to draw relevant parallels between the events that led to the rise of Nazi power and current political activity in America. It is frightening reading for anyone open enough to understand that history DOES repeat itself. This book should be required reading for any high school graduate, and especially anyone running for or holding a political office."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is a history book that reads like a novel. 1100 pages? I found myself re-reading sections and when I reached the last 200 pages or so, I found myself stalling, like an amazingly gripping novel which the reader wants to avoid the unpleasantness of it ending, though wanting the sweet satisfaction of completion. Shirer's work is one of the finest historical account balanced between massive research and eminent literary value. This should be mandatory reading for high school or college.Reviewers here have said it all; there is little needing to be said. However, when Shirer writes about Hitler's negotiating with foreign leaders, it is as if the reader has been invited to the meeting, and are witnesses to the deception that was Hitler.Shirer also does a good job of portraying Hitler; not always the genius, nor always the street demagogue, she allows us to see how, at times, Hitler bantered back and forth between both roles, and how the frustrated 'b' artist's early childhood abuse led to both cruelty and insecurity. ***** Star research ***** Star interest ***** Star literary value. I struggled to put this book down, night after night."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Given the genius of the German people, it's amazing that Hitler rose to power. What struck me most was this: the great generals, from the old school, were attempting to conduct warfare as soldiers, whereas Hitler and his henchmen were butchers. I'm not going into an in depth review, but Shirer was there, and writes from first hand knowledge and good documentation. The reading is gripping: in the final analysis, those generals who wanted to end the war were executed as traitors. If you want authentic reading, this is it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is a great review of Hitler's early life, what shaped his ideology, how he rose to power, and how he eventually fell. It's also a good start on what was going on in Germany in the 20's and 30's that allowed Hitler to take power. Gives a great view of the calculating nature of Hitler that pushed him to become the most powerful man in the world while also giving insight into the complete insanity of Hitler that caused his downfall. Shirer does a great job of showing the people around him that helped him to power. He also dives into great detail about those who could have, and should have, easily stopped him but waited until it was too late.The only reason I give this 4 stars is for the lack of maps, as one reviewer already stated. I would actually give it 4.5 stars, but it's not possible. I would advise having a map of 1939 Europe available while you read this book. I would also advise finding a list of all of the German generals and Nazi figureheads (or at least have google ready) with a brief biography about each. Shirer talks about so many people that it is hard to keep up unless you're a historian.This should be mandatory reading for high school history classes. Everyone should know what horrible things happened as to open their eyes so it does not happen again. Not spoon fed in 10 pages of a so-called history textbook. I would say that at least 95% of high school kids really have no idea what actually cuased WWII. I cringed when reading this book thinking about a half dozen places where similar situations are currently going on. How long until we are forced to relive history?"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I read this important book, here in Brazil.This book was published about 50 years ago.And even so, this book remains important.There are failures in this book.One is that about the war itself, it is just regular.Many things revealed, after the publication of this book, such as the breaking of Enigma code machine, has no space in this book.The author saw the fall of France in 1940; he realized that France fell because of lack of will to fight, not weapons.Even so, he is weak about France's fall, because only more a decade later, the people could to know that France had more and better tanks, than Germany in 1940. About the massive amount of money from then Soviet Union and from famous germans, such as Paul Warburg to the nazi party also has no place on this book.The book itself is a little more than regular, but there's a good thing about the author:he lived the Third Reich and the war.He was there.William L. Shirer saw the facts.There's better options about the Third Reich, than this book?Yes, but this book remains important, after 50 years."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer's book, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, is an extremely detailed and accurate acount of the rise of Hitler and Nazism, and the early fall of the supposed Thousand Year Reich. Shirer goes into great depth of Hitler's rise to power in Germany through the NSDAP(Nationalist Socialist German Workers Party). He doesn't go into vast details of the actual battles, and war, however he does give enough that I learned alot of new facts. But he goes into more detail of Hitler, and the diplomacy of other countries with him in the pre-war and throughout the war years also. Because I am only 13 years old, it did take me a couple weeks to actually read the whole book, but it was a great expeirence for me, and I would recommend this book to anyone who has enough time to read a 1,200 page book, and is interested in Nazism and WWII. I would also recommend Mein Kampf, by Adolf Hitler, which was a very hard book, but I gained great insight on the mind of Hitler by reading it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Superb work by William L. Shirer. Although it is a long book, I have read it many times. WW2 is an immence subject. Shirer focuses on Hitler, his reich, his country, his policies, his evolution. This is first hand storytelling; Shirer was there. Altogether great history. Technically and by organization, it is well constructed, but goes far beyond mere expertise. The tale of human history and human nature is profound. One becomes a fly on the wall as witness to unbelievable extremes of human conduct on a monumental scale; cowardice, heroism, deception, stupidity, indifference, hatred, struggle, brutality, and more. The focal point is the contradictory and confounding evil genius of Hitler; simultaneously fascinating and repulsive."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I probably have read this book a hundred times, and will keep reading it until it falls apart. Shirers writing has a quality about it that makes the complex very clear, and takes dull facts and transforms them into fascinating reading. Shirer provides insights and descriptions that only a man who saw it with his own eyes could, and the result is that the book is not only an excellent coverage of the war, but it also touches on the individuals who played key roles during this time in history. This book is not always perfectly objective, but the historical account is accurate and among the best I've read. It can also be very funny, and with its outstanding collection of photos it is a very educational and entertaining piece of literature. I've been recommending this book to readers for years, and not one person has been disappointed yet."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"It says a lot about any book to remain in print for forty years, especially historical non-fiction. Historians never rest. New information is always being uncovered. And, unfortunately, facts tend to change with the political winds. Nevertheless, Shirer's work is so comprehensive, fact-based, and readable that no other book has come along to displace it as the best volume on the complete history of Hitler's Germany. There are certainly other great books on the subject, but most deal with only specific aspects, not the full story.Shirer was fated to write this book. He had location, access to the German documents, and training as a journalist. The world benefits from his five-year effort to leave a definitive record of the origins, machinations, and demise of the Third Reich, possibly the scariest and best organized evil empire mankind has ever seen. This complete and accurate record can play an important role in helping prevent future generations from making the same mistakes.Though the 1500-page book is of daunting size, the topic is so amazing, and the text so readable, you hardly notice. What struck me after reading it was that, despite now knowing and understanding the individual parts, I still could not comprehend the whole. How was Hitler able to get such a large number people to behave so badly? It could be 15,000 words, and I still wouldn't know. Therein lies part of Hitler's mystique. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Every home ought to have a bookshelf in the family room where classic, timeless books are kept as homages to reading and learning, and this book is required for that bookshelf. So thorough, so well-written, so engrossing: it is undeniably a masterpiece."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Shirer did a fine job explaining Hitler's origins; for this he deserves full credit. However, the book follows several blind alleys--parts of the story of WWII that are not really relevant 55 years later. Example: Shirer catelogues the multitudinous plots against Hitler that never were carried out. In retrospect, only the 1944 assassination plot had any real significance (by indirectly leading to Rommel's death, among other things).My advice to everyone is to read this book, but when Shirer starts diverging from the main topic, to just flip through those pages."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I've read with dismay some of the reviews on Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. The first time I read this book, I sat down and read it cover to cover in one reading. It is not too long. Then, when I finished it, I turned around and read it in depth again, comparing it point by point to other histories I've read with their different points of view. I have since read it several times along with Manchester's books about Winston Churchill and Churchill's 6 volume personal account of the war from his perspective, to name a few favorites.This book is a personal account of the rise of Nazi Germany as Shirer witnessed it. It is what he saw at the time. You don't have to like it, but it is fascinating. There are not alot of battles in it. It concerns the politics of the country, how such a man as Hitler could rise to power, what he did when he grasped that power, and how he self destructed, nearly razing the country and a whole generation in the process.This book detals how Hitler controlled the people by controlling their information, the experiments done in the concentration camps and details on how he shaped the minds of the youth through Germany's public education. It is enlightening and applicable to things in the world today.The book's approach is from that of a journalist. That's what Shirer was. He was in Germany while it was happening. Furthermore, before the captured records were shipped back to Germany, he was granted free access to them. He used them to further document his book. Read the preface and afterword.This book requires a little education to appreciate. Some wisdom and life lessons, ie., maturity, will help make it more understandable.I highly reccommend it.My wife wrote this review using my Amazon account. I am in the process of reading the book and endorse every word of the review based on what I have read thus far."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I must confess that this can be a debilitating and exhausting work to read, especially when one must plow through the section detailing the Nazi atrocities; considering the amount of literature published on the Holocaust since the 1970s people today will not find much new here, anyway (and there is not as much information on the Holocaust as there is on the attempt on Hitler's life). Shirer has his prejudices, including the anachronistic charge of homosexuality (or \\"perversion\\") leveled against Nazi leaders - a charge not unjustified in certain cases, but myopic in light of the Nazis' persecution of homosexuals. He is annoyingly simplistic in his characterizations of the most famous Nazi leaders (they are evil, and therefore unappealing, ineffectual, and unattractive - my goodness, how could such losers captivate a nation? Had they no magnetism, no charm?), and certainly there are omissions in his account of how Hitler rose to power (Britain's and even the United States' relationship with Nazi Germany was complex but is given short shrift), but overall this is an excellent resource on the subject, the first definitive history of this era, comprehensive (although flawed), and a literary classic in its own right."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"One subject that seems to produce countless new books every year, is the Second World War, yet some 40 odd years ago one of the, if not the, most authorative accounts of the war and it's circumstances were written by mr Shirer. He draws on the best sourcematerial there is, personal diaries of the German generals, interviews, whitebooks and such, and delivers a truly interesting tale of a Germany rising from the Great War en route to an even greater one. He writes it in a fresh, journalistic style, which, dispite it's bulk, makes it an easy and enjoyable read. The force of this volume is really in it's detail. It covers a lot of ground and thus presents and explains a lot of the background for second world war (which is sadly lacking in many other books) and lays a solid foundation for further reading. Mr. Shirer stays resonably objective throughout the book, although he at times slips in his own opinion (eg when he calls G&ouml;bbels an idiot).As can be seen from the post script, mr Shirer is clearly biased against Germany, even to this day (he mentions \\"the German problem\\" anno 1991) and seems to think, that another war with Germany is inevitable. Luckily this dosen't shine through in the main text.This is a great work and is worth of all the praise it has received. It belongs on any and all bookshelves around the world as it, in my eyes, is one of the best books on the Thousand Year Reich readily available today. If you want to know about WWII this is a good place to start. Highly recommendable."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"It is exceedingly difficult to put the excellence of this book into a review. I have read many books, this is the very best. For contemporary, documented history, RAFOTTR is the greatest story every told. To call a 1200 page, densely written book a quick read it hard to do, but it is.The sheer humanity of this work is what makes it so special. The reader is taken back to 1920's Austria. Imagine Hitler, a vagabond former corporal, with no direction or prospects in life, who was a failure at his only dream (painting), discovering his calling in life. You follow Hitler from these depths to the heights of \\"most powerful man in the world\\", a megalomaniac drunk on power, who falls to the absolute depths as quickly as he rose.As you are reading this book you have to constantly remind yourself that it is nonfiction, that this spectacle really happened and in the not too distant past. I recommend this book to anybody that can read."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I am a beginner in WWII history and knowledge. I picked this book up to do some research for a paper. After reading pieces of it for research I decided to read it in its entirity at the moment.

The way it is written it makes it readable opposed to dry like a text book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"having read this book, you really feel you have the a-z on the unfolding of this unforgettable chapter in history.

It is an excellent work by someone who was there at the beginning and reported on the whole thing.He heard and saw Hitler and his henchmen and writes about what he saw. He may be a little slanted in his work, but how could he not be, when he saw the outcome of that disastrous time.Don't expect to read it quickly, you wont. But is is worth the time."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book comes as close as anyone to answering why a supposedly civilized nation could act so barbaricly. We shall see."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is certainly no light read. It is almost 1300 pages in length and no one would describe the subject matter as light reading. However, it is a fascinating in depth account of the brutal anc calculating decisions that led to the rise of the Nazi regime and the overreach, backbiting, and poor decisions that ultimately led to its downfall. William Shirer has been criticized for his theories on what led the German people to accept such a regime, but I am not an expert worthy of commenting on that. I'll just say that I find those portions of the book less interesting than the behind the scenes account of the political maneuvering anyway, so I wasn't at all put off by it. My only criticism is that the terror wrought on the Jewish population seemed to be given less attention than it may have deserved. However, there are plenty of other accounts that are focused solely on the Holocaust itself, so this book fills another role."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I'm only maybe 1/2 way thru this book , but I had to stop & write a review ! I tried to read this book about a year ago,but, it was \\" over my head \\" ! So, I marked my page & now after having read several more books on WW2, I picked it up & Can't Hardly Put It Down ! It's definitely not for the novice, if you just recently got to reading about WW2, go ahead & familiarize yourself with D-Day,The Fall OF Stalingrad, & other battles. And THEN read THIS book, but IF you can get it NOW...Buy IT & put it back for a spell. Ever wonder how Russia aligned herself with Hitler & why ? You know Russia hated Germany, no? How did Germany pull off the [Supposed] Poland Incident, ? How did Hitler Actually RISE To Power, break treaty after treaty & Get Away with It Etc. You got'ta read this book, it'll floor you with the information Mr. Shirer brings out, & the easy reading style. At times I was almost laughing at some of the stunts pulled [ or tried ] by various Powers, Britian, France, Germany, Poland etc., talk about diplomacy, !!! Ha ! He takes you step by step through all the shenanagans, backstabbing , double crosses, political ploys, murders,deceits,etc. Mr. Shirer draws you deeper & deeper into the web until you can hardly wait to get to the next page ! I'm totally amazed at HOW HE EVER managed to put all this info into an easy read & sooo informative & totally interesting format. If you're into WW2 this book is a MUST READ !

Tottally Loved It .Did I mention it was Very Informative?"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I have not really gotten into this book yet, due to a malfunctioning Kindle, but it appears to be well researched.

However, for those of you who have an interest in the Hitler- Nazi years but do not want to get a boring history book than this is the book to get. This book just flows very easily and you will not find yourself lost after every other page. It is very entertaining and in an easy to follow cronological order so that you might actually remember some of the dates. A great read; full of important and useful knowledge. Some people say that Shirer is biased! Biased against or for who? To me, he just seems to be telling a story as he sees it backed by plenty of documentation and even first hand knowledge. I don't see the &quot;bias&quot; point of view. Anyway, a great book for all who can read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"One of the most important books of the 20th Century. This book documents each baby step towards totalitarianism. Just at the Black Book of Communism illustrated Marx's Communist Manifesto, Rise and Fall of the Third Reich documents fascism in action. This book is a chilling read. I could not finish the chapter about the human experimentation that was conducted in concentration camps. This book shows in vivid detail the dangers of concentrating all governmental power into the hands of a single man. No single man is more worthy of the hell he now resides in than Adolf Hitler."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Although contemporary histories may have revised the story first told here, few have ever told it better than Shirer, who was a correspondent in Nazi Germany until 1941. The writing is tremendous and the narrative flows very smoothly. The only element of the book that has not aged well is Shirer's credulous acceptance of some of Hitler's farfetched &quot;table-talk&quot; strategizing, which were not so much his plans for world conquest as running off at the mouth."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Shirer's book on the Third Reich is the ultimate textbook on Hitler's Germany. It follows in detail Hitler's extraordinary rise from the gutters to the most feared, revered and hated man in modern history. It is all embracing - from the Versailles indignities, the war itself, the blitzkrieg of Western Europe, the Battle of the Atlantic, the initial triumphs on the Eastern Front to the total war that that front eventually became, to the horror of the Holocaust. Don't miss this magnificently researched book by an author who lived in Nazi Germany through its early formative and powerful 1930 era. With Hitler's suicide now exactly 55 years ago it remains a timeless study on an era that reshaped the world we now live in. We all said it should never happen again - but it did in Yugoslavia some fifty years later, proving that the human race has a tendency to repeat its history; irrespective of past \\"lessons\\"."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Anyone interested in WWII and Nazi Germany should read this book. I have read few accounts of how the Nazis rose to power in Germany better than the account in this book. The book is long, but reads like a novel. If you want to learn about Nazi Germany, this is the book to read. Don't be afraid of its size. It is worth it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"A completely absorbing study of the characters and events that shaped the Third Reich. Together with the &quot;World At War&quot; video documentary series, this is the most accessible way to study WWII. Perhaps it's only minor weakness is that he didn't have access to all the extra information on technological developments that we do now. He correctly identifies radar as key in the Battle of Britain, but couldn't know how crucial the Enigma codebreakers at Bletchley Park were to the Battles of the Atlantic, North Africa or D-Day. But as a study of the people at the heart of the Reich, it's superb."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Bill Stevenson's critique of this book on Amazon should be ignored. We should remain grateful that one man dedicated so much to write this book. 485 tons of paper he shuffled through. Bill, I'd like to see you do that! Sure the book is written in a cold, sometimes clumsy manner - but the effect is chilling. As a 35 year old I now understand the madness of the German regime and Hitler. The crucial memos and communications have been preserved forever in this book. I felt the holocaust was dealt with in enough detail considering the hugely wide brief the author allowed himself. There are plenty of books on this issue Bill, and I personally didn't feel Shirer was skimming over the most sickening tragedy one can imagine. I have been surprised since reading this book to discover just how many other people have read it. I gave it four stars - with the only fault the 1959 broadsheet writing style. However it is an extremely valuable piece of journalism and the ultimate condemnation of Nazism."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I definitely reccommend the unabridged large paperback as opposed to the mass market paperback- it's easier to read---it's typeset better. There aren't any photographs, so you have to use your imagination."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"A complete and comprehensive book about the rise and fall of German nazism and WW II. The book is my WW II bible; it is very well written; it gives details of WW II from inside the German HQ where decisions were made, and it tells how these decisions were implemented. The book is full of details without beeing boring. An excellent piece of history."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I had the good fortune to spot an old dusty hardback of this volume in my local bookstore. I was at once pleased that I bought it. William Shirer managed to acomplish something very rare in the business of non-fiction: he actually made it an enjoyable read. I sometimes found myself chuckling at the actions of the respective governments. This book reads like a novel, it is superbly written and very entertaining. I regret to say I have not finished it yet, but am on page 678 of 1240. To let the length of the book deter you is a mistake, if you pick it up and read a little at a time, you will breeze through the insightful pages like a swift winter wind. A very throuogh account of the roots, humble beginnings and the eventual downfall of the Third Reich, &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; is a masterpiece for anyone remotely curious about this unique era of the Twnetieth Century. Have fun with it, the content more than makes up for the length."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Shirer's book is still very important to this day. Even several decades after hitler attempted to destroy the world, this publication provides the best assessment of the face of tyranny. We can, and must, assess current events using Shirer's definitive assessment of exactly how hitler climbed into the seat of power. We must use this as a guide to help future generations take on - and defeat - future attempts by evil when it raises its ugly head. We must still look this history in the eye and use it to prevent another outgrowth of tyranny when it comes - and it WILL come again..."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I'll keep this short.I've read a lot of histories of the second world war, but this one I found the most interesting. It covers the entire war, including the build-up, from a unique perspective, that of an American journalist and war correspondent (later a historian) who experienced the rise of the Reich and the first half of the war first hand. He saw and reported on Hitler's speeches, he was there when the French signed their armistice, he saw in person men like Goering and Goebbels. It's a fascinating read.It's also extremely well researched, with one important caveat. You have to remember how long ago the book was written, some fifty years ago. Much of what we now know is based on evidence that was not then available, so sometimes he'll conecture things, for example, that we now know the truth of. A good example is his description of Johan Elser, a man who attempted to assassinate Hitler in '39, and of the attempt itself. Suffice to say, his speculation is very different from what's generally reported today. There are also some occasional anachronistic biases, like his listing of the homosexuality of certain top Nazis as though it were one of their 'perversion'. Different times, I suppose, but still uncomfortable to read.There's one last problem, the conversion to E-book format. For one, this is not the fiftieth anniversary edition, with the new introduction by Ron Rosenbaum (I'd dearly like to read that, ah well). Worse, though, is the sloppy transcription. It seems like the book was scanned into digital format without even so much as running a simple spell-check afterwards. You'll see 'words' like \\"uves\\", a misreading of \\"lives\\" by the scanner. You'll find end-of-chapter notes occasionally not linked, and if one of those asterisks is on the end of the same sentence as a footnote number, the links merge into one that only goes to the footnote. It's not formatted properly. Long quotations are sometimes not indented, or sections of text by the author ARE indented when in the middle of two quotes, so you have to be careful sometimes to keep track of who's talking, author or source.All of this is unfortunate, but what really matters, the content of the book, is stellar, and well worth putting up with the issues. You might want to pick up the new edition in book form, but I don't shy away from recommending the Kindle version if that's what you're looking for.I guess I wasn't as concise as I meant to be!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The Rise and Fall of the Third ReichBy William L. ShirerBook ReviewBy Richard E. NobleWith \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" Mr. Shirer achieved the dream of every writer. He wrote himself into immortality. This is one of those great books that will never die. As long as there are people, this book will be read.I purposely postponed the reading of this work until I finished writing my book \\"Mein Kampf - Analysis of Book One\\"Mein Kampf - Analysis of Book Onebecause I feared that my work would be unduly influenced by Mr. Shirer's work. After reading \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" by W.L. Shirer I feel I made the correct decision.I was pleased to find that many of the quotes selected by Mr. Shirer from Adolf Hitler's autobiography \\"Mein Kampf\\" were also selected by me as being important and worthy of additional analysis.Mr. Shirer's book is exactly what the title states it to be. It is a detailed and well documented study of the rise and then the fall of the Third Reich.This book is over 1100 pages long. To write a thorough review would be impossible. So let me simply highlight a few of the things that I learned or found interesting.One thing that has always been a curiosity to me was why Germany (Adolf Hitler) declared war on the United States after the bombing of Peal Harbor on December 7, 1941. If he had kept his mouth shut he would have had the U.S. occupied in the Pacific while he could have concentrated on his war in Europe. From my reading of the times, it would have been difficult for Roosevelt to win the American people over to an attack on Hitler's Germany in Europe when we had Japan who just attacked us in the Pacific.I was told that this was mandatory because Germany and Japan had an alliance.This was true; Germany and Japan did have an alliance. But this agreement was only called into play if either Germany or Japan were attacked by another nation. The alliance did not come into effect if Germany or Japan were the aggressor and attacked another nation.This is why Japan did not come to Germany's aid in its struggle with Russia. Germany requested Japan's support in this cause several times but to no avail. Germany had attacked Russia. Russia did not attack Germany. Therefore Japan had no mandate to come to Germany's aid. And Japan never did assist Germany in this effort.Japan then attacked the United States. Germany had no treaty obligation to declare war against the U.S. but nevertheless it did. Why?If Germany had not declared war against the U.S. it would then have been up to Roosevelt to declare war against Germany after we had just been attacked by Japan.I think with all the pro-German sentiment in the U.S. at that time, such a declaration would have been difficult for President Roosevelt to get past the legislature. In which case the U.S. would have been distracted from its efforts in Europe and forced to concentrate in the Pacific on Japan.Once again it seems that Hitler had gravely underestimated the capacity and spirit of his enemies. It seems that Adolf felt the U.S. to be a paper lion and not ready or capable to form any great war effort. He made the same mistake with the British and then again with the Russians. I suppose it could be said that he overestimated Germany's abilities rather than underestimated his enemies but either way, he was gravely mistaken in his projections.Mr. Shirer's book also corroborates my notion that one of Adolf's greatest attributes was his ability to dull the compassionate instincts of an entire nation of people.Unfortunately we have a similar circumstance happening at this time in our own country.Hitler used patriotism, national pride, the German flag, military prowess and strong appeals to individualism and selfishness to immunize the German people. One can only hope that these tactics which are being pushed relentlessly here and now in our own country by right wing extremists will not be as effective here in the U.S. as they were in Nazi Germany.I also feel supported by Mr. Shirer in my bias that the Nuremberg Trials were not the great success that they have been portrayed to be historically. Even Alfried Krupp was let off the hook. As I now know, from other reading, many American businesses who aided, supported, and profited from dealing with Nazi Germany during the war were able to skirt prosecution and investigation via the attention and publicity provided by this event.Mr. Shirer also puts to rest for me the notion or excuse that \\"people\\" were not aware of the slaughterhouses and extermination camps. Somehow Hitler was able to keep it all a secret from everybody, we are so often told.Well it seems to have been far from any secret. People who lived around the extermination camps were constantly complaining to the local authorities about the \\"burning flesh smell\\" emanating from the camps. The public bids from construction companies, with their detailed drawings and explicit instructions and suggestions on clever, new machinery and methods on how to kill the most people and remove any \\"waste material\\" and dead bodies at the cheapest cost are ridiculously blatant.These detailed bids should also be put on display in all nations around the world and specifically to any \\"free market\\" capitalists who are presently advocating the moral integrity and the notion of \\"self-policing\\" by banks, insurance companies, the stock market and the so called free market system in general.I also thought it interesting to note in this era of \\"body art\\" that tattooed skin was a first priority for those purchasing or collecting \\"human skin\\" furniture and lampshades for their homes and apartments.I could go on and on, chapter by chapter, making comments and pointing out interesting references but better to suggest that if this subject interests you, your time will not be wasted here. This is one of those monumental works that should be and I am sure will be read for years and years by students, historians and all those interested in what we can only hope will be our last ever World War."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"If you want to be taken seriously as a historian of the Third Reich, this book must be in your collection. Shirer's meticulous research and ability to meld multiple sources into one compelling narrative remains a definitive work on the Nazi party. This in political and top-level government history; those looking for the fun military stuff should look elsewhere. But get this book, read it and keep it for future reference. Your fool brother in law might spout off sometime and here's a great tool to hush him up."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I just finished this monster of a book over the weekend and I'm still digesting everything I just read.First let me state this is one of the best books I've ever read, hands down.I love the horror genre but wanted to transition into non-fiction, and this book accomplished both those needs--it's definitely one of the scariest books I've ever read because it all really happened (not too long ago either when you step back and take in all of history), and in this crazy world we live in with values people are willing to die for and kill for, you realize everything in this book can certainly happen again.Maybe in a different place with different people and a different goal, but with the same murderous zeal and commitment to death.From beginning to end Rise and Fall hooks you and won't let go--from Hitler's undistiguished origins to his early manhood as a failed artist standing on the brink of mediocrity ready to fade from history, to the outbreak of WW1 and his unbelievable change of fortune and his subsequent meteoric rise to most powerful man in the world guided by some horrible fate. You know how this story ends, but still Shirer masterfully keeps you on the edge and the book remains suspensful throughout.A must-read for anyone interested in WW2!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is really an exceptional book. I avoided it for years simply because it was too long but once I picked it up and began reading I couldn't put it down. It has actually changed the way I view the world around me. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I have been a student of WW2 off and on for years. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MY FIRST BOOK! I can't rate this book highly enough for exactly what the title states AND how WW2 started, etc. After reading this book, I and I believe anyone else will be able to watch any documentary on Nazi Germany and will have a firm grip on the chronology of events as I have found films have a tendency to bounce around and become confusing. This book ( since I have read topics in reverse order apparantley) is a great jumping off point to reading other topics on the Nazis, there is no end to the madness. There is a serious lesson to be learned from the Nazis and the events found in this book and applies to events today; Appeasement never works or accomplishes anything but destruction...eventually. For evil to flourish, requires good men to do nothing"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is probably the finest historical work on the Hitler regime ever put to paper. Even after 51 years, Shirer's incredible work is still a potent and worthy read.Although the last five decades have shed a considerable amount of light on the Third Reich, this book is still a must read to get a great general understanding of how this group of gangsters took over an entire nation. Those obscure moments when Hitler could have been thrown from office, e.g. the march into the Rhine or the march into the Sudentanland, show how important it is for politicians of today to be able to see \\" around the corner\\" and use one's common sence and do what is right no matter how difficult it is to do what must be done. Shirer also brings up a point that I have never heard any other historian use about Hitler and it's this; Hitlers fatal flaw was his Eurocentric way of thinking. The man had absolutely no concept of the power of the United States.I suppose that A.H. was a man of his time and saw America,(as Goebbels put it), \\" a country that made good refrigerators and razor blades but nothing else\\".Well, his hubris was our gain, we destroyed him utterly.In conclusion, William Shirer's book is a timeless, magnificent read."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This bestselling classic book by a foreign correspondent and historian is fantastic. It describes in great detail the situation leading up to Hitler's assumption of power and how he and his cronies took power and led Germany to commit some of the most despicable atrocities ever. The author gives a number of detailed passages about some of these horrid acts of inhumanity. He describes the period leading up to World War II and the war itself. He explains Hitler's deceptive methods and much, much more. A must read book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I've listened to the audio version of this book and bought it immediately in print , because it must be on everyone's bookshelf...Most thrilling reading I've ever experienced. Killer book!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Don't be intimidated by the 1100+ pages of \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\\" It reads more like a novel than a dry historical narrative and -- trust me on this -- this book is awesome.As a reporter for CBS, William Shirer lived and worked in Germany during much of the Nazi movement. Until he left in 1940, he saw firsthand Hitler's rise to power, the consolidation of that power, and the use of that power. As a fallible human being, his prejudices may show through at times, but this is not necessarily a weakness. In today's climate of political correctness, works by historical revisionists -- that purport to show that Hitler and the Nazis weren't so bad -- are not only published, but they're even taken seriously. Perhaps our modern view of Hitler has been distorted by allied propaganda and Hitler and Goerring were fun loving and lovable guys, they say. At the extreme, some revisionists even claim that the Auschwitz death camp didn't even have gas chambers - they were added later as a tourist attraction! Yeah right.In that sense, Shirer's book, published in 1959 is refreshing. He doesn't hold back one bit with his opinions.Hence, Quisling is \\"pig-eyed\\", Rohm is a \\"pervert\\", Goebles is \\"dwarfish\\", Goering is \\"corpulent\\", Ribbentrop is \\"vain as a peacock\\", Brauchitsch is \\"unintelligent\\", Eva Braun has the \\"brain of a bird\\", and so forth. Such epithets may offend the sensibilities of some modern day readers, but they certainly spice up the telling of what could otherwise be a boring tale. (If you don't know who these people are, buy the book. Believe me, if you read it all the way through, you will become a formidable expert in Nazi trivia).Because \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" was finished a mere 14 years after the fall of Nazi Germany, some facts that have come to light after its publication are necessarily missing. The premier example of this would be the breaking of the secret Nazi military codes by the British. But writing this book in 1959 also had its advantages. Many of the participants were still alive when William Shirer was doing his research. Hence, when encountering a slight inconsistency in General Franz Halder's war diary [The Chief of Staff of the High Command (the OKH)], William Shirer wrote to the old General and received \\"a prompt and courteous reply.\\"Perhaps Shirer's most vivid firsthand account of all is the several page description of the French surrender in the rail car at the forest at Compiegne:\\"I look for the expression in Hitler's face. I am but fifty yards from him and see him though my glasses as though he were directly in front of me... He glances slowly around the clearing, and now, as his eyes meet ours, you grasp the depth of his hatred.\\"Amazing stuff.But these personal accounts only take up a very small portion of this absolutely fantastic book. Particularly well covered was Hitler's rise to power -- a story that is not often told. The Hitler that Shirer paints during these early years is a very astute political observer who shrewdly plays the German people like a violin. He promises the people what they want, plays on their fears, and is extremely ruthless to anyone who dares to oppose him.In later years, Shirer's Hitler's political savvy falls apart. At one point Shirer calls his inner circle a \\"lunatic asylum\\". Except for very occasional bursts of brilliance, Hitler has no idea what the heck he is doing politically much less militarily and yet his fanatical followers still go along with him. Hitler's megalomania goes on overdrive until, like a Viking in a Wagner opera his body is burned in a last stand against the Russian army just blocks away from his bunker.While making my way through \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\", I can't tell you how many times I would read about a pivotal event and wonder \\"WHAT THE HECK WAS GOING THROUGH THESE GUYS MINDS?\\" I always knew the Nazi's were nuts as well as scary. This book provided all of the details I needed."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This review is not of the excellent scholarly work of William Shirer but of the Kindle version of this book. Clearly the book was converted electronically without even cursory proofreading. Problems that I encountered include, but are not limited to:* Readability is impaired by the incorrect placement of commas instead of periods and apparent random insertion of periods in the middle sentences, usually due to incorrect interpretation of a comma but in some cases this appears to be random insertion.* There are many instances of random incorrect capitalization of words within a sentence.* Many words are not correctly recognized. For example \\"Uve\\" is printed in the Kindle conversion when the correct word would have been \\"Live\\" or the conversion interpreted \\"attack\\" to be \\"a tack\\" with the apparent two spaces between the two incorrect words.* Since this was a conversion from the original printed book most, if not all, of the hyphenation that was used for word wrapping now appears in the middle of a line instead of being combined into the correct single word.* Footnote hyperlinks are often misplaced and in one chapter the footnote links were not even present. The hyperlinks for footnotes often overflow in the text and in the worst extreme an entire paragraph is converted to hyperlink meaning that a user would not be able to select individual words, lines, etc. This version also attempts to hyperlink certain key names, locations and events to the Index, however the hyperlinked text far too often is only for part of the word or phrase which is extremely annoying when part of the word and/or phrase is in blue and the rest is in normal font color.* Many letters are incorrectly translated - most of these are the confusion between \\"1,\\" \\"I\\" and lower case \\"L\\" but as noted above this occurs with other words or letters.* Despite the updates to the Kindle for Android software, page numbering was not available, just the not formally defined position.Overall the book as originally written and published deserves 5 stars, or more, but the Kindle conversion is what I am rating at 2 stars. It would have been a single star but having previously read the 30th anniversary printed version I am better able to make the corrections within my mind although it sometimes takes several re-readings of a sentence or paragraph to determine what was really written. Correction - after previewing my review changed the rating to a single star.What is needed is to have each and every conversion of a book from print professionally proof-read before releasing this. To date I have only read two Kindle books and both share the same poor quality of conversion to Kindle format.What is Amazon's policy if a Kindle book is eventually corrected and replaced with a more readable version? Do previous purchasers receive the correct version via sync and are they informed of this in the event that they were unable to finish the poorly converted version?Another problem is that the dates published for virtually all titles are only the date of release in Kindle version and do not reflect the actual date of release of the actual text being read or the edition. Others previously noted that this poor quality conversion was not either the 50th anniversary edition as indicated in the product description or the updated 30th anniversary edition but an apparent conversion of an earlier edition. While this sometimes can be gleaned if one carefully reads each and every word of the description but a more honest presentation of this information would be to make that a separate line item in the product details, not buried in the product description or in reviews.Correction - I have read three Kindle books and all share the same problems although one was to a much lesser degree.UPDATE: I copied and pasted this review into a support email to Amazon using their webform. They responded asking that I provide citation to the problems and their locations but I am not willing to be an unpaid volunteer proofreader. My reply was limited to a single example of most of the problems that I reported but the problems are spread throughout the entire Kindle version fo this book as well as another that I wrote a review of. I am reading these books on a 10-inch tablet using Kindle for Android.UPDATE: April 26, 2012 - Amazon still hasn't taken any action except to find or manufacture over 350 additional reviews to dilute the negative reviews of the extremely poor kindle conversion. Somehow the number of reviews went from 31 to 385 in just 3 days. What a coincidence!UPDATE: May 2, 2012 - received a response from Amazon.com's Executive Customer Relations. It stated that there was an update in progress by the publisher with a subsequent conversion to Kindle format by Amazon which should hopefully correct many of the errors that so many of us have reported, a time frame for replacement was not offered which is probably best as unforeseen delays would artificially create ill feelings.. They also responded favorably to a suggestion to clearly indicate the edition or date of publication as this is very important for historical books. Finally, the addition of so many extra reviews is being attributed by Amazon to merging reviews of other versions. While I may not agree with the last as the reviews of various editions were previously mixed before the Big Bang occurred it is also possible that the complaints and poor reviews may have triggered some of this as well as correction of existing errors. Again, Thank You to everyone that chose to post accurate feedback of the problems with the Kindle edition.UPDATE: August 8, 2012 - I could not get the version to update including many instances of deleting the title and finally Amazon forced a send. It took three more tries but I now have a version with page numbering. Having so recently labored through the defective version I am unable to re-read this new version to determine if most of the errors have been corrected or new ones added. Getting this updated required significant complaining finally resulting in addressing an email to Jeff Bezos and associated reassignment to higher level customer service representatives as the lower level representives declined to initiate investigative action."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is a great book for not only its detail, but also the unique perspective that the author provides. Every stage in the history of Germany during the mid twentieth century is explored in fantastic depth. The Kindle edition however appears to have never been edited. Typographical errors occur frequently enough to distract from the text. There are also numerous footnotes that are not active, or lniked to other citations making them inaccessible. It is a shame that this was offered in such a condition, it has made me far less likely to purchase Kindle editions of older works."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"It would be difficult to overstate the importance of this book. It was the first comprehensive popular history of Nazi Germany to appear in English, and it is probably more responsible than any other single source for shaping the way that Americans think about Nazi Germany, World War II, and the Holocaust. More than that, this is an estimable work of history. Shirer has done an admirable job of combing through the mountains of primary source material that the Nazis left behind and assembling a coherent and comprehensible narrative from it.Of course, it would be a mistake to view this book as simply or even primarily a work of history. It is intended as an indictment of the evil and barbarity that the Nazis perpetrated in Germany and across Europe for more than twelve years and as an indictment of the men and women in Germany, in France, in Great Britain, and elsewhere who allowed that evil and barbarity to occur. Shirer is not content to point out that Hitler and Himmler and Goering and Frank were monsters; he also is intent on showing how complicit the German Army and the German people were in what happened and how the ignorance, stupidity, and cowardice of the politicians of the West and the Soviet Union actively assisted Hitler's monstosities in coming to pass.The reader can almost visualize Shirer shaking in outrage when he considers the evil Hitler wrought with the help of the rest of Europe. This outrage is, in many ways, both the book's greatest asset and its greatest shortcoming. While Shirer's indignation makes this a great moral work, it also causes him to be more than a little unfair to some of his subjects and to present the history as being more one-dimensional than it in fact was. Shirer never tells, for example, that one of the principal reasons that Chamberlain and Daladier were willing to appease Hitler was that the Depression had bankrupted both Britain and France. They believed that they could not afford to rearm so that they could stop Hitler militarily, and so they sought to get the best deals they could at the bargaining table. Their policy was, of course, dangerously short-sighted, but it is unfair to both men to suggest that their policy was almost solely the result of cowardice.Then, too, is the fact that Shirer almost invariably describes Rosenberg as a befuddled dolt, Goering as fat, and Ribbentrop as vacuous. It is readily apparent to the reader that he does so because he feels he must constantly reiterate their lack of praiseworthiness, but it is disconcerting to the reader. I am at a loss to explain what Goering's girth has to do with anything, or what it was about Rosenberg's writing that made him any stupider that most Nazis. While I believe that Ribbentrop deserves almost all of the calumny that can be heaped on him, Shirer never makes a real case for his vacuity.Finally, it must be said that Shirer appears to run out of steam towards the end of the book. All of World War II is covered in the last 25% of the book, and many important topics, including the Holocaust, get short shrift as a result.These criticisms should not be taken to mean that I believe that this book is not meritorious or that it should not be read. On the contrary: one would be hard-pressed to find a better, more comprehensible, more accessible one volume book about Nazi Germany. It ought to be the starting point (but not the ending point) for anyone interested in World War II or Nazi Germany."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer was an American journalist in Germany from 1934 until presumably 1941 (when Germany declared war on the USA after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour). Shirer occasionally mentions his participation in reporting history from Berlin or the front lines and admits to having been influenced by the endless barrage of Nazi propaganda. Occasionally his sharp post-war opinions on the characters of the various leaders depicted breaks through. The book is based on the huge amounts of documentary and verbal evidence that became available after the war and the Nuremberg trials. The book represents a huge work of research - one wonders, however, whether the author's motivation is an atonement to his blindness (along with many millions of others) to the monstrosity of the Third Reich as it actually happened.On reading the book (a rich 1200 pages!) one wonders whether it should not have been called \\"The Rise and the Fall of Adolf Hitler\\" for it centers around Hitler and his generals and seems to almost forget Goering, Goebbels, Himmler and other Nazi leaders after their initial appearances. A central conclusion from the book is, no doubt, that the Third Reich and World War2 would not have come about were it not for this one man - Adolf Hitler. All the other players in Shirer's story pale into insignificance beside the genius, charisma, madness, vision, evil, manipulativeness, leadership and single-mindedness of the one man. The only other \\"heros\\" of the book, although not covered in great detail, are Stalin and, rather more so, Churchill whose vision, inspiration and leadership changed the course of history.Besides Hitler, Churchill and Stalin most other players in the drama of the Third Reich appear in Shirer's book as sycophants, ditherers, brutes or nonentities. The weakness and blindness of pre-war England and France are difficult to imagine. The blind neutrality and unpreparedness of the governments of Belgium, Holland and Norway is also noted. The world's blindness is all the more noteworthy considering, as Shirer carefully points out, that Hitler laid out his philosophy and intentions very clearly in Mein Kampf which he wrote in the mid 1920's. [This andThe Myth of the 20th Centuryby Alfred Rosenberg who had a huge influence on Hitler's thinking are two 'must reads' for anyone interested in the background of Nazi thinking and philosophy.]In hindsight, one is open-mouthed at the success of Hitler's bullying which allowed him to annex Austria and dismantle Czechoslovakia without firing a shot. Hitler also intimidated his generals who dared not disobey him even if it cost the lives of thousands of their troops and endangered their own. As the war progressed more and more of them either resigned or were fired in Hitler's increasing rage and frustration at ever increasing failures. It is quite amazing to read about the chain of events which led the ex-Austrian corporal to take over direct command of the German armed forces in the first place. There is no doubt that, during the early stages of the war, Hitler's ideas of where and how to attack and invade were smarter than those of his generals, as was his assessment of the procrastination and unpreparedness of the countries to the north and west.However Hitler had a number of critical blind spots that were to cost him the war. He underestimated the will of the Russians to fight for their homeland as he misjudged the tenacity of the British and readiness to fight of the Americans. Hitler was more paranoid about the dangers close to home to his regime and his person. He made sure to eliminate (literally) any real or supposed opposition including the many members of the July 1944 plot. Shirer documents the various attempts within Germany during the war years to overthrow the Fuehrer which all failed from combinations of bad luck, ambivalence, mutual distrust and lack of resolve of the plotters.The book's main themes are the rise of the Nazi Party, the build up to and then the conduct of the war until its demolition of the Third Reich. From a history of the Third Reich, I would have expected something more on the instruments of government and power under the Nazi regime. There is also little on the Nazis' innovative, systematic and extremely successful uses of deception and propaganda to further their aims. Shirer, however, chooses the more exciting stories and gives us a tantalizing insider's view of the Reich. The detail furnished by some of Hitler's loyal subordinates of meetings give us the feeling of having been there in the Chancellery or in Berchtesgaden as it happened. For those of us who grew up on the Allied story of the war, this glimpse into the enemy camp is a memorable one. I will not forget this book for a long time."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I grew up near Lenox, Massachusetts, where author William Shirer spent his last twenty years, and we often drove by the old Victorian where he lived, set back from the road as it was, with a large, lovely lawn hiding the rather reclusive author from public view. I picked up this book again to reread it once more, for I find that it is a wonderful treasure trove of personal observations and actual eye-witness history, written on the run by a man married to a German woman and living in the shadow of the nazis as they climbed into power.William Shirer's comprehensive treatment of the curious rise and horrific fall of the Nazis in post-Weimar Germany is the benchmark volume to measure all other treatments of the era by. There are so many monographs on Nazi Germany that one reels before the list looming in a relevant bibliography. Save yourself the trouble; this book gives one exactly the kind of complete immersion in and coverage of the realities of the era that too many of the other books lack. Shirer, an American journalist stationed in Berlin as a newspaper (and later radio) correspondant during the rise of the National Socialists, was there, on the ground and at the scene witnessing many of the events he describes in such detail.He has, of course, written extensively on these experiences, both herein and elsewhere in books like 'The Nightmare Years' and 'Berlin Diary'. But this book has to be considered his masterpiece, and is worth the time, trouble and price for this hefty best-selling volume. After all, it has never been out of print in the forty years since its original publication in the early 1960s. I promise that if you read this, you'll never think of World War Two in the same way. It is indeed a long and difficult read, but one that is well worth the effort. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William L. Shirer's classic &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; is the most complete single volume account of the history of Nazi Germany ever written. Shirer was a journalist, not a historian and the advantages of this show in his very readable prose and his vivid descriptions (for example, often referring to Herman Goering as &quot;the fat Field Marshall&quot;). The book starts with the birth of the Nazi party and how it found a spokesman early on in an ex-serviceman named Adolf Hitler. The narrative continues through until the end of the war, Hitler's suicide and the final few days under Admiral Doenitz. The only warning to the casual reader is that the book's length exceeds 1100 pages and it is crammed to the brim with facts. Also, it should be noted that the book was published over forty years ago and does not include more recent information that has come to light from, for example, the former East German archives. Nevertheless, this is still a classic work of jornalistic history."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Lest anyone mistake the three star rating for rejection or dislike, let me say up front that Shirer's monumental work is absolutely informative, eye-opening, and, as so many reviewers have said, probaby *should* be read by just about everybody, not just those with an interest in World War Two.That being said, there are some criticisms to be had. First is the length. I have nothing against 1000+ page books per se. Shirer's work, however, could have been several hundred pages shorter but for his near obsessiveness toward recording every detail. The days leading up to the invasion of Poland, for example, are told almost in \\"real time.\\" Second is the complete lack of maps. There is very little more frustrating than to be bombarded with place names and to have only a rough idea of where these places are. Third is the lack of focus on the Germans themselves, especially once the war starts.Some parts of this book do stand out. Shirer's two chapters on life in Nazi Germany and the occupied countries are both gripping and horrifying. Shirer's forays into his own recollections are also welcome diversions from the endless barrage of Nazi documents, memoranda, and diaries and are, perhaps, the best parts of the entire work. And Shirer's account of the Nazi party's rise is fascinating reading, and shows that, indeed, Hitler and Stalin had more in common than one would have thought.All in all, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a worthwhile read. It is not great \\"literature\\" in the sense that Gibbon or Will Durant are (contrary to what some others have suggested), but it is an investment in time and attention that will pay off for the reader."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"If you only could read and own one history book on Nazi Germany, this would be it. Don't let the 1245 pages daunt you, this is a very well written and readable book on the subject. Shirer was apparently a journalist and started research on the book when he first went to Germany in 1925. He spent 5-1/2 years writing it. The title pretty much explains it, it covers the rise of Adolf Hitler to the eventual fall of Berlin. There are other history books that cover specific aspects of the Nazi's, such as the recommended 2002 publication of Antony Beevor's The Fall of Berlin 1945, but this is the one history book on it all. Considering how the events covered set up the modern world, this should be essential reading for everyone on the planet.I see that this is the first review for the hardcopy version of the book, which is the version of the text that I have. Those wanting to read other reviews should go to the paperback version site."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"For those who have never read this monumental and essential work, the issuance of a 50th anniversary edition represents an excellent opportunity to acquire and read it. For a reader and student of modern German history like me, who bought the first edition as a high-school student 50 years ago, it represents an opportunity to revisit the book and refresh one's understanding of that singular and mystifying era. But an anniversary edition should bring something new to the table in addition to being a commemorative edition to add to the bookshelf. Ron Rosenbaum, the author ofExplaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil, does his part toward this end by adding a modern specialist historian's perspective at a distance of half a century from the original publication, and in that, this book fulfills the requirement for something new.But because I ordered the book sight-unseen, I was disappointed in the lack of new typography, which would have made the book much more attractive. It is evident at first glance that the pages carrying the main text were printed not from masters newly composited for this anniversary edition, which would have given freshness to the appearance and readability of the book, but from masters made by photocopying the pages of the original book. This process gives the characters on the page a slightly eroded appearance, with sharp points blunted, lines and curves ragged, and interior corners filled in, lending an antique if not archaic, and definitely B-list, appearance to the typography. The resulting appearance is distinctly inferior to that of the original book, which of course was originally-composited, and far inferior to the fresh compositing and modern printing, in the same typeface, of Rosenbaum's introduction. The irony is that (or so I should think) a publishing intern with a high-resolution scanner and modern compositing software could have produced a clean new file for each page, with identical line breaks, justification, and pagination to the original, scanning errors corrected, in five minutes--the whole book thus cleaned up costing the publisher three weeks of an intern's salary. The index might have been too complex to scan and verify in a cost-effective manner, but leaving this part in photocopied form would not have been too jarring. And the whole main text would have had the same beautifully clean and sharp typography as the introduction (which, juxtaposed to the main text, only adds to the latter's visual disappointment). In summary, I'm glad to have the book, but I'd have been willing to pay more for a book done as above."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I wish this book was available to me when I was in High School. For students in school, such as my daughter who is now in the 6th grade, WWII is waxed over. They seem to get the Cliff's Notes version of what happened. They have numbers, dates, and statistics thrown at them, with little substance behind it. However, this tends to raise more questions than it answers. I first read this book while in the Army back in 1987 while stationed in Nuernberg Germany. It was a long read, but one definitely worth the time. Most books on the subject focus on the horror of the Third Reich and the Holocaust. They cater to the &quot;what&quot;, but too seldom tend to the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot;, which were two of the biggest questions in my mind. William L. Shirer. His work sets the stage for what is to come, gets inside the machinations that took place, economic hardships, the total desparation of the Germanic people. A people who were at a point where they would take heed to the words whispered into their ears, and unfortunately, Adolf Hitler told them what they wanted to hear. Since '87, I have read this book another three times, learning more each time I pick it up. I agree wholeheartedly with General Eisenhower about those who don't learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. The more information we have about the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; can help us prevent such horrors in the future."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer was an American journalist in Germany from 1934 until presumably 1941 (when Germany declared war on the USA after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour). Shirer occasionally mentions his participation in reporting history from Berlin or the front lines and admits to having been influenced by the endless barrage of Nazi propaganda. Occasionally his sharp post-war opinions on the characters of the various leaders depicted breaks through. The book is based on the huge amounts of documentary and verbal evidence that became available after the war and the Nuremberg trials. The book represents a huge work of research - one wonders, however, whether the author's motivation is an atonement to his blindness (along with many millions of others) to the monstrosity of the Third Reich as it actually happened.On reading the book (a rich 1200 pages!) one wonders whether it should not have been called \\"The Rise and the Fall of Adolf Hitler\\" for it centers around Hitler and his generals and seems to almost forget Goering, Goebbels, Himmler and other Nazi leaders after their initial appearances. A central conclusion from the book is, no doubt, that the Third Reich and World War2 would not have come about were it not for this one man - Adolf Hitler. All the other players in Shirer's story pale into insignificance beside the genius, charisma, madness, vision, evil, manipulativeness, leadership and single-mindedness of the one man. The only other \\"heros\\" of the book, although not covered in great detail, are Stalin and, rather more so, Churchill whose vision, inspiration and leadership changed the course of history.[Reviewer's personal note: WW2 and the Holocaust are themes of enormous importance to me personally. Both my parents were born in Germany and, had it not been for Hitler I would have been born a German. Once the Third Reich existed I might not have been born at all were it not for Churchill, and I almost certainly wouldn't have been living in Israel if weren't for WW2 and the Holocaust. The realization (sharpened after reading this book) that my life ,and that of so many millions of others, would have been so different were it not for two men is quite shattering.]Besides Hitler, Churchill and Stalin most other players in the drama of the Third Reich appear in Shirer's book as sycophants, ditherers, brutes or nonentities. The weakness and blindness of pre-war England and France are difficult to imagine. The blind neutrality and unpreparedness of the governments of Belgium, Holland and Norway is also noted. The world's blindness is all the more noteworthy considering, as Shirer carefully points out, that Hitler laid out his philosophy and intentions very clearly in Mein Kampf which he wrote in the mid 1920's.In hindsight, one is open-mouthed at the success of Hitler's bullying which allowed him to annex Austria and dismantle Czechoslovakia without firing a shot. Hitler also intimidated his generals who dared not disobey him even if it cost the lives of thousands of their troops and endangered their own. As the war progressed more and more of them either resigned or were fired in Hitler's increasing rage and frustration at ever increasing failures. It is quite amazing to read about the chain of events which led the ex-Austrian corporal to take over direct command of the German armed forces in the first place. There is no doubt that, during the early stages of the war, Hitler's ideas of where and how to attack and invade were smarter than those of his generals, as was his assessment of the procrastination and unpreparedness of the countries to the north and west.However Hitler had a number of critical blind spots that were to cost him the war. He underestimated the will of the Russians to fight for their homeland as he misjudged the tenacity of the British and readiness to fight of the Americans. Hitler was more paranoid about the dangers close to home to his regime and his person. He made sure to eliminate (literally) any real or supposed opposition including the many members of the July 1944 plot. Shirer documents the various attempts within Germany during the war years to overthrow the Fuehrer which all failed from combinations of bad luck, ambivalence, mutual distrust and lack of resolve of the plotters.The book's main themes are the rise of the Nazi Party, the build up to and then the conduct of the war until its demolition of the Third Reich. From a history of the Third Reich, I would have expected something more on the instruments of government and power under the Nazi regime. There is also little on the Nazis' innovative, systematic and extremely successful uses of deception and propaganda to further their aims. Shirer, however, chooses the more exciting stories and gives us a tantalizing insider's view of the Reich. The detail furnished by some of Hitler's loyal subordinates of meetings give us the feeling of having been there in the Chancellery or in Berchtesgaden as it happened. For those of us who grew up on the Allied story of the war, this glimpse into the enemy camp is a memorable one. I will not forget this book for a long time."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I'm 43 years old, and I first read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich when I was ten years old. In the intervening years, I've read it two more times, and everytime I do, I understand more about the Third Reich. Shirer's book is an excellent work by an author who was most intimate with the subject, having been CBS Radio's correspondent in Berlin from the mid-30's until December 1940. Having met most of the major players and seen the major events, such as the Anschluss, the Sudeten crisis, Prague 1939, and the surrender of France in June, 1940, few people were in a better position to be able to interpret these events. Also, the massive amount of research involved is staggering. The Nazis churned out tons of records, which, because of their thoroughness, help to convict them at Nuremberg. This ocean of documentation Shirer waded through to give us this magnificent book. A more-than-worthy addition to anyone's library of the history of World War II and Hitler, Nazism and the Third Reich."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This gripping classic thoroughly covers Hitler's rise (via free elections), life in Nazi Germany, and the inexorable march to disaster. The book touches nearly all bases, including politics, economics, social policy, diplomacy, the war, holocaust, etc. Readers see how Hitler was named chancellor in hard times, reducing joblessness thru rearmament, while tightening his grip via arrests, murder, and Gestapo terror. We also read his secret war directives (and plans for mass atrocities) from before Munich through utter defeat in 1945. Readers learn all major players and events, plus how a majority of Germans backed Hitler's lunatic regime. Author William L. Shirer (1904-1993) was a foreign correspondent in Nazi Germany from 1934-1940, and he later spent five years examining captured German documents to write this outstanding volume. I like the readable blend of eyewitness journalism and scholarly history, plus the skilled inclusion of authentic documents to illuminate events.This stellar book isn't flawless; a couple of Shirer's conclusions seem debatable, he name-calls top Nazi's he personally detested, and his coverage of events ranges from superbly in-depth to merely adequate. Also, denied access to certain now-open archives, Shirer missed facts like Britain's breaking of Germany's military code ENIGMA. Still, this is a superb achievement overall, and so readable despite its length that it's sold over 20 million copies since 1960 - incredible for non-fiction.This superb bestseller left readers amazed, academic historians jealous, and many wrongly assuming the author was Jewish (he was Protestant). In a dangerous world, this book plus Shirer's other volumes on Nazi Germany (BERLIN DIARY-1941, NIGHTMARE YEARS-1984) are timeless reminders."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is one of the longest books I have ever read. But don't let that get in the way. It was also one of the most readable books I remember.While it drowned out all my other reading and occupied all my spare time, its 1143 pages of small print captivated my attention, spellbound me, drove me to google images of the key players, review historical accounts, look up other books on the subject and dig into fringe Internet sites like those of Holocaust denial movements.Since I always read before going to sleep, sometimes my dreams were deeply disturbed. When I turned the last page today of Shirer's afterword, I was relieved. This was hard work, it was consuming.Shirer starts telling the story of Adolf Hitler, with that of his parents and grandparents in Austria in the latter part of the 1800s. All through the story, of course, I knew how it ends, but I never knew any of the details. Shirer was actually present in Germany during the early years of the Nazi regime and he was often in the room - or in the arena - when Hitler spoke. As he told the story of the Third Reich, he guided me through conversations and events, making me feel like the proverbial fly on the wall when momentous things were going on. He showed events from the perspective of the German perpetrators, every step of the way, memo for memo, order for order, phone call for phone call, speech for speech.Reading Rise and Fall laid open for me how disastrous this period of history was for Germany and for the world. I always knew it was bad. However, it was much, much, much worse than my worst nightmares could have played out. I am now stunned, shocked, disturbed and astonished. Most importantly, I am motivated to learn more and to research further.I regret only that I didn't read this book when I was 18 years old. Why is it that as young people, with few exceptions, we are not very interested in politics and history? Somehow, for most of us, history does not captivate us until later in life.I cannot state enough times how important it is for every citizen of the world to read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. It should be required reading for humanity.Somebody should dictate that!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The late William Shirer left us one of the very few sober accounts written about Hitler and Nazi Germany.The credence of this book lays in the fact that the author lived in Germany, witnessed and felt the pulse of the WWII events.We do not see many silly \`labelling' of Adolph Hitler \`the mad man', his \`illegitimate father'. Or Hitler loitering the street of Vienna \`roaming on his face', having failed his exams at National Art Academy, deciding to avenge from Austria \`to vindicate his honour'.In this book we can learn the early events that led to WWII.We can see how Churchill's reticence to respond to many peace overtures Hitler offered in 1939 and after - when the British and French leaders were fighting much among themselves - hampered the quest for reconciliation.Shirer spoke the language and mixed with the German people, he ate with them, rode their buses, listened to their radio, read their newspapers, and what is appreciable though is nowhere in the book one can see accusations that Hitler was a world threat - no wonder why the author was blacklisted in the early fifties for his daring and open-minded views.Shirer couldn't have possibly seen how Paul Reynaud, the French Premier, listened to his mistress - Madame Helene de Portes - to sign the armistice with Germany at the time Churchill was equivocal with his promises to help France when Roosevelt was unprepared.Shirer wrote on Page 740 \\"Hitler was determined above all not to allow the French Fleet to fall into the hands of the British\\".........\\"the armistice terms were designed to keep a French government functioning on French soil, and the French Fleet neutralized\\"... Whereas Churchill had aimed at getting the fleet scuttled because he was not sure the French were able to fight from North Africa, and sending the fleet to British waters would have been a liability on GB. Churchill would be held responsible for French towns destruction from the German air raids \`as long as Britain held the French fleet'.This is a great book to read, and a must read by scholars...."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"There's a remarkable passage in Shelby Foote's history of the Civil War where Foote speculates on the true nature of patriotism and courage. Describing Pickett's Charge, Lee's epic mistake during the Battle of Gettysburg, Foote first acknowledges the tremendous courage it took for the Confederate troops to march across a mile of open field in the face of the Union Army's guns. But then he goes a step further. True courage and true patriosm, he says, would have been to defy Lee and refuse to make the charge, to tell him he was making a horrible mistake and ordering Pickett's division to committ suicide.This is the underlying theme of Shirer's book The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. The German soldier was undoubtedly brave in battle, but genuine courage and genuine patriotism would have been to defy Hitler and not obey orders. Tragically, although many in the higher levels of the German officer corps were aware that Hitler was no patriot, but an evil, demonic man leading his country to destruction, few of them had the courage or the imagination to disobey his orders. There was something lacking in the German soul, Shirer argues, that prevented even the best educated Germans from the best families from stopping the Nazis destroying their country in an act of suicidal folly.The book, in the end, is Tolstoyan for, as Tolstoy argued in War and Peace, Kings and generals, in the end, have little effect on history. Ordinary Germans made Hitler possible. It was ordinary British, Russian, and American soldiers, not the Christian aristocrats on the German general staff, who finally had the courage to fight and die to bring down the Third Reich."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This very readable history is indispensable in understanding the political psychosis which propelled a self-styled Fuehrer to fashion, with horrifying consequences, a Third Reich which came close to achieving total domination of Europe (and perhaps even the world itself.)Shirer witnessed first hand Hitler's consolidation of political power in the dying days of the Weimar Republic and likewise the grim aftermath of postwar ravaged Europe.Shirer's impassioned recognition and denunciation of pure, unmitigated Evil may be out of fashion in our ironical, postmodern age, but his first hand experience with Nazi Germany lends a moral authority to his critique and, along with his meticulous documentation of Nazi archives, is the book's main strength.Sadly, in the fifty some odd years since Hitler's defeat, the capacity for evil and the appetite for mass destruction still burns within human hearts. THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH should be essential reading for a new century and a new millennium. As Shirer writes in the foreword:&quot;In our age of terrifying, lethal gadgets, which supplanted so swiftly the old one, the first great aggressive war, if it should come, will be launched by suicidal little madmen pressing an electronic button. Such a war will not last long and none will ever follow it. There will be no conquerors and no conquests, but only the charred bones of the dead on an uninhabited planet.&quot;"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book, is truly one of the finest of its genre following the origins of one of the most opressive regimes in modern history to its bitter end whilst maintaining a distinctly unbiased stance throughout.Clearly, Mr.Shirer spent many hours,days,months etc on this book as he leaves no stone unturned in his presentation of the rise and the fall of Nazism.If there is one criticism, it has to be that it reads in a manner that allows perhaps 30mins to 60mins at the most per session as it has so much sheer information to digest.Apart from that, a Tour de Force."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is clearly the finest one-volume &quot;briography&quot; if you will of the Third Reich. But it is not without its problems. The book badly needs maps. When the author discusses troop movements, the reader is left in the dark unless he has an atlas by his side. Too much time is spent on the plot to assassinate Hitler, which, after all, was a minor event. He doesn't even mention the sinking of the battleship Bismark and what a devastating effect that had on Hitler's ability to conduct a sea war. Allied generals are mentioned, but given short shrift. Nevertheless, Shirer has managed to compress tons of documents into an understandable and often fascinating narrative. This book reads like a novel and was, for me, impossible to put down. A great achievement despute the reservations noted above."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is a masterpiece, hands down. It took me a few months to read it, but I wanted to take my time to get something out of reading a book of this length and breadth. It was worth the effort. This is the best overall account yet that I have read about the Third Reich - it's a must have for any serious World War II buff of the European Theater.If you are really intent on learning a great deal from reading the book, take notes, especially of all the names and abbreviations; it can be a bit hard to follow at times.A true masterpiece."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Yes it is huge but if you are interested at all in the Nazi era then you must read this book. It covers everything... what I was most impressed by was Professor Shirer's coverage of Post WWI Germany under the Weimar Republic. Simply astounding. This book reminds all of its readers why history is so important. Just get the book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Shirer's monumental study of the rise of Hitler's Third Reich is a historical classic that will surely be admired for centuries to come. From the serious student of history to the casual nonfiction reader, this book should be read by all. As a literary work, Shirer's writing rivals Gibbon's classical study of the Roman Empire. As a historical masterpiece, it is without comparison.Shirer leaves no stone unturned, discussing history, biography, diplomacy, military tactics, economics, even romance within his piece's 1500 pages. All areas are amazingly well-researched (the end notes and foot notes alone are an undertaking of mind-boggling volume).As a history lover myself, and one who subscribes very much to the notion that history is cyclical and we must learn about the mistakes of the past to prevent their repetition, I suggest Shirer's work to ANYONE (except, of course, children, as Shirer discusses at some length the gruesomeness of the Third Reich's racial theory and practices)."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I have just finished reading Mr. Shirer's work. I found it utterly fascinating on many levels...- the author's prejudices, foibles, weaknesses AND strengths are out front on every page. For me, the inhumane horrors of the Third Reich become more real as seen through the eyes of the all too human Mr. Shirer."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Since the time of Herodotus, the debate has always raged as to the distance someone must have from an event in order to objectively cover it historically.If too far away in time or place, the historian cannot be expected to fully grasp what has happened. He or she would probably not have the right access to the documents and wouldn't truly know what it was like.On the other hand, if you live during an event, you develop biases. Other reviewers have often commented (either favorably or not) on Shirer's biases in this book. Some are explicit, such as when his repeated value judgments on the evil nature of the Third Reich. Others are more insidious, such as when he refers to Hitler's cronies as bungling, stupid, piggish, etc. when these characteristics have nothing to do with the event he is describing.Shirer makes very clear his bias in his introduction when he states that totalitarian dictatorships are abhorrent to him. They are, in truth, abhorrent to almost everyone nowadays, yet most modern historians would not portray the facts with quite so much bias, in this case directly as a result of the author's terrible experiences living in the Third Reich.In addition, his biases towards others also sometimes raise their heads. He is very quick to point out the homosexuality of early Nazis, as if this is a universally acknowledged weakness in their character. He describes them as therefore perverted and even at one point makes reference to their inability to adequately lead directly due to their sexual &quot;perversions.&quot; While garrishly outdated, this particular bias serves to outline some of the others that Shirer, albeit not purposely, sprinkles through the book.However, while biases in this book do sometimes color the facts, the sheer number of facts is staggering and completely convincing. The access Shirer had to important people who lived through (and died during) the Third Reich is simply astounding. While I might not believe Shirer when he says that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was a bungling arrogant stupid diplomat, I certainly believe it after getting a glimpse into diaries such as Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's and German General Staff Chief Halder's.His access to facts and his knowledge about where to look for them is a direct result of his closeness to the events as they were taking place. This access and presentation is the victory of this book and what makes it a triumph and the definitive work on the Third Reich.One other small point. I am a little bit confused as to where Shirer was able to get his numbers as to number of victims, particularly the number of Jews that died in the Nazi Holocaust. It is today accepted that 6 million were killed, yet Shirer repeatedly mentions the figure of 4.5 million. What facts did he not have that we have today? I would like to point out that this may be a result of the insurmountable difficulty for someone writing a political and military history to comb through the records of the Final Solution and a bit too much of a reliance on that work by others, who vary widely in their reports."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I am by no means an historian, but I enjoyed this book as much as about any I've ever read. Shirer has deftly woven hard facts from captured Nazi documents, the Nuremberg trials and other sources with his own personal experience in Germany.Despite the ample supply of facts, he does a tremendous job of making his history an interesting story. It is truly a page-turner, as the reader wants to find out what happens next. I think his personal experience with some of the leading players allows him to make them human, easier to relate to than most historical figures. Shirer seems to have a keen grasp of the human psyche, and uses his perceptiveness to get frighteningly inside the head of men like Hitler.Reading &quot;Rise and Fall&quot; is much like reading a novel. The story is amazing, and because of the vast documentation available, we have as complete access to the events as possible. Some historians may shun this work, but I find it of immeasurable value and pleasure.A word of warning: The book is very long (1100 pages in the hardcover edition), and isn't exactly what I'd call quick reading, despite its intrigue. I'm a fairly fast reader, and it took me a long while to finish it. Even so, I would recommend this to any and everyone."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is a treasure trove of information consisting of not only the historical facts, but of unparalleled insights into the psychological make-up of those invoved in that history. The author seems to have been involved directly with the Reich, as he points out clearly he was close at hand during many historical moments. This view allows the reader to envision the scenes and understand not only the madness... but the reasons behind that insanity. On the low point, the author sometimes bears out to be somewhat prejudicial. When reading, one can't help but notice the pro-Nazi sentiments that are hidden between the lines as he rails against the regime. This makes the author appear to be less credible after around 600 pages. But...if you can get over the author's contradictions and read through them to the story itself, this is one great book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I have to say that I was never a fan of historical accounts but I found Shirer's history of Nazi Germany remarkable. If you are a historian and an expert in the field, this book will meet your expectations (the primary resources are most impressive) but if this is the first time you read something that is non-fiction, the author's style is not too oppresive as he presents the incredible events that transpired during World War II. The miracle at Dunkirk, the flight of Rudolph Hess, the rescue of Mussolini... if you don't know what I'm talking about, yet you're reading this review, you owe it to yourself to read this book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer's book recounting in extremely fine detail one of the most covered subjects in world history has a unique, magical quality. I will not dwell on its accuracy and breadth of documentation, other reviewers have already noted it. The sheer quantity of original and secret material from the Nazi administration archives Shirer was able to use as a background to write this book boggles the mind - and he himself admits it would've taken many men many lifetimes to go through it all; but this is not my point. My point is that in anyone else's hands, this material would probably have resulted in a jaw-droppingly boring listing of names and minutes from cabinet meetings. What truly astonished me about this book were its overpowering demand for attention, its totally consistent clarity, its lightness of style and exposition that never, ever forgot precision and in-depth observation. I read this 1,100+-page book in two weeks, and not once through it I felt I wasn't understanding what it talked about. I'm not a faster or smarter-than-average reader: it was simply impossible to let the volume stand there, so much so that for two weeks I brought it with me everywhere I went, using every minute of free time (and also a few hours of work time) to read a few more lines, a few more paragraphs, please, just two more pages, I promise. For all the countless historical characters and extremely complex situations presented here (how could there not be, given the subject?), Shirer leads the reader through them with such powerful grace and insight that you have to strain to remind yourself this is not a Dashiell Hammett mystery, and that Adolf Hitler wasn't simply any Little Caesar. Though Shirer's judgment on the whole story is fairly explicit - and please let me add that it should simply be any reasonable person's judgment - he never lets it cloud his narration. People here are mostly shown through their actions, not ex-post interpretation or psychobabble. They lunge for your throat. Even the first page starts, so to speak, in mid-action, at the end of January 1933, with Hitler rising to Chancellorship after 14 years of founding the NSDAP. As you turn the pages, as story - and history - unfold, you feel the same uncertainty with which life itself unfolds, as if the Third Reich is growing day by day before your eyes and you actually don't know what tomorrow and the next page will bring, as if you didn't already know how the story ended. Shirer's book is the perfect example of how all history should be written."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is the benchmark book on the subject. Reading it has great relevance for today. It is a treatise on the dangers of avoiding conflict and denying that, while we do not like it, there are and will be enemies of freedom in the world."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"While there are numerous books about Hitler seeking to understand what made a man like him--and many are quite good--this one relates the true history and chronology better than any of them. Shirer personally witnessed much of what happened first hand, having previously authored the classic Berlin Diary. Written circa 1960, this wonderful book digs into the notes of meetings from frontline surviving Nazis rather than waiting a generation to interview an extremely old man, widow or descendant. With memories fresh and information available for this barbaric regime like no other, Shirer has weaved a true masterpiece. Do yourself a favor and read this book"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"There is not much more that I can add to those who have already posted before me but I'll try. This is the first comprehensive review of the rise and fall of the Nazi's. There is a bit of bias in the author's work but it is plain to see and he does not try to hide it. I think that it adds a bit of flavor that is lacking in other works where other authors who had not been there lack. The work is the first so as time has progress so have the knowledge base and analysis. Having said this I don't think that we should ignore this book it is a timeless work that few have ever written. There is so much information in this book, starting from the family tree of Hitler, to the personal backgrounds of his advisers, meetings of the high counsel, and strategic military plans. The author lived and reported in Germany before and during the war, so he is able to provide a first hand account of the plight of the average German during the war. The details the details the details is what make this work so great. They are so many and presented as a journalist would present them (because that is what the author was). I recommend this work to anyone especially to those who have forgotten what the name Nazi was really all about and so carelessly through it about now."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Shirer's world-famous book is nothing less than a complete history of Nazi Germany. It begins with a summary of Hitler's childhood, and gathers steam as Hitler becomes more involved with what begins as a rag-tag group of misfits in a Vienna basement. From there Shirer details the countless strategies done, lies told, and careers ruined in the creation of such an incredibly powerful new era in European politics and world history.A mere book review can never adequately convey the scope of the work, so I can at best describe how well Shirer achieves his aims in writing the book. The book throughout is fascinatingly told, even when its voice dryly accounts confusing maneuvers Hitler made in rising within the ranks of the Wehrmact government in the first part of the book. It obviously gains steam as Hitler begins to formulate his plans against France, Poland and the Soviet Union, and by the time the defeat at Stalingrad comes around it is consistently absorbing. What also differentiates this from the standard work of history is the emotion that Shirer puts into it (the war could not have been over for very long before he began the writing of the book, as it was published in the early '60's), his expansive access to German documents (secret or otherwise), and his physical presence in the actual places where some incredibly important WWII events occurred. In describing a scene between Chamberlain and Hitler in Munich in 1939, the writer recounts watching the two men actually leaving their meeting place, chatting, and walking past him. This detail wouldn't necessarily heighten or decrease the quality of the overall work, but it does give it a freshness and immediacy that both helps the reader be more than just a casual observer and gives it a street cred that other works written long after the fact may lack. It is this closeness to the subject matter that you continually feel throughout the book, which combined with the painstaking detail and concentrated scope of the book make it vital reading for anyone with any interest in the subject matter. From the early victories to the quick and stunning defeat, there is also a high level of tension and excitement in the book that really sets it apart. My only real issue with the book would be its occasional pacing; some of the events in the book are mysteriously given more detail than others (the Valkyrie assassination attempt section is much longer than the section on the entire Holocaust, for example). Read it a little bit at a time- it will go by faster than you'd think. One of the century's most important books."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I read the Chinese version of this book in college within two weeks, back to 1994. I had never finished a book with more than 300 pages, except course textbooks. This is the first book that I had read through every sentence, and it has some 1200 pages! Three years later, I read it the second time and still felt fascinated.It gave you a thorough view of the third Reich in an amazing detail and true objective view. Here you can find how and why German people chose Hitler and the country embraced Nazism at the time. Definitely the best history reference for the third Reich.To have a thorough view of the Nazi Germany, you just need to read this book. All others are waste of time."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is a phenomenal book by a reporter who was in Germany before the war and personally witnessed and recorded Hitler's rise to power and then, after the war, was one of the first allowed back in to look at and categorize the Nazi achieves that read like so many bureaucratic memo's from hell.If every American capable of doing so would take the time (a lot of time, it's a big book) to carefully read this book, then we would soon live in a different country.Our country would be changed by its informed citizens who see all around us the beginnings and beyond of the very things that the 20s and 30s presented in Germany and the world.If anyone could have known the results of letting Hitler get in (and they could, all they had to do was read Mien Kampf and believe it) they would have done anything to stop him. But \\"him\\" was more than just one man. He was the result of social and economic times and political decisions, primarily by the allies, that allowed and ushered in the Great Man onto the world stage where he began his ten year orgy of destruction.This is a carefully written, very well documented book. A must read for every thinking person. Make the effort, read the book. Then look around and see if you can tell me I am wrong."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer's famous Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is THE historical record of WW II Nazi Germany. However, that 1200+ page highly-detailed scholarly work is a bit more than many of us \\"short attention span\\" people can handle . . . not so with this edition.This 10x13 oversize hardcover blends the Reader's Digest abridgement of Rise and Fall with about 400 priceless photgraphs, illustrations and maps from the era of the Reich. On heavy glossy stock, nicely done.For many of us, this is the best way to enjoy Shirer's work. For the more scholarly, this version, with all of the illustrations, is an excellent complement to the complete unabridged original."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I would just love to know why the author has such a special dislike for Goering. Almost every single occurrence of the man's name is accompanied by some mention of his girth. One might expect a similar treatment of Hitler. The mad dwarf, the crazy diminutive, the nutty midget etc etc. Although Shirer does mention the fact that Hitler was a WWI corporal over and over as if that should be some sort of insult.At any rate, the book was wonderful. Much detail but at the same time very engrossing and interesting. The majority of the book deals with the rise to power as opposed to the fall. I would not recommend this work to anyone interested in a military history of the Nazis in WWII. This is a political history. It tells who how when and where the party came to power and it deals with the governing of the party more than the military aspects. Which is why this book is of such interest many man books have been written about the military aspects. Similarly the holocaust is also dealt with rather quickly though not glossed over.All in all I would suggest this book to anyone who would like a political history of the Nazi government. Just be warned if you are interested in a history of WWII the 1130(+-) of this book won't quite be enough."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer's titantic (1250 pages) volume on the third reich is an awesome achievement. Written by a journalist who witnessed the rise of Hitler first hand, then spent years combing through the mountain of documents left after the war, it is a definitive and comprehensive telling of how Adolf Hitler rose to the highest peak achieve by any conquerer and then fell into ashes, a victim of his own megalomania.This is NOT a history of World War II. Japan, the United States and other nations come into the story only so much as they impact Germany. The internal politics of Russia, the US and UK are not touched on. In fact, much of the military history is glossed over. But that is the book's strength -- it keeps it tight focus on the question; How did Hitler become so powerful and how did he fall from that lofty peak? We start with an exploration of Hitler's life and personality, go through his rise to power (I was stunned to find out that the Nazis never actually won an election). Then we get into the heart of the book -- Hitler's conquest of Austria and Czechoslovakia without a shot. You'll find a vital lesson in history when you learn the France and Britain could have ended Hitler in a week had they stood by the Czechs instead of trying for \\"peace\\" and only fighting him when six years and tens of millions of lives had to be sacrificed.The days preceeding WWII drag a bit. Shirer spends way too much time on negotiations over Poland -- negotiations that were ultimately false from Germany's side. But then he hits Olympian heights again with his depiction of Hitler's insane war on Russia, the horrific regime he was putting in place and his ultimate collapse before the unimaginable armed might of the Allies.The unexpected surprise for me was my sympathy for the German people. Their country was reduced to ashes by their blind obedience to one of the most evil creatures our race has produced. While I felt enormous satisifaction when justice finally found the most evil of Nazis -- I was saddened at the fate of the average German who knew nor cared little for conquest -- especially when I read that Hitler's ultimate plan on defeat was to raze his own country to the ground. The defeat of the Nazis was not really a triumph but the necessary conclusion to the 20th century's worst tragedy.This book is long and slow. But when you put it down, you will understand World War II better than you ever have."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I hated history in grade school. But was encouraged by a co-worker to try the book. Now, nine months later, I've just completed reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich : A History of Nazi Germany, a fascinating 1100-page collection of details. The style reminds me of James Michener's affinity for detail. Amazing how one person---apparently a close relative to Jiminy Cricket---could have witnessed so much history. The thought of accomplishing what William L. Shirer has overwhelms me.Thanks Mr. Shirier.I'd recommended this book to anyone who is fascinated by human behavior and appreciates detail."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is both a classic and as grippingly readable as anythriller, though unfortunately not a work of fiction. I first readit when I was a teenager and have re-read it several times since then, my enjoyment actually increasing with every new read. One problem with this particular edition is that the binding quickly comes apart. The new epilogue (written just after the Berlin wall fell) is a must-read though. I love this book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I got lucky and bought this in September-ish 2012 when it went on sale for $1.99. Based on other reviews, I might not have spent the money had it been its normal price. I am glad I bought this. This read is simply amazing- what a treat to see this period of history through the eyes of one who actually lived through it. It is thought provoking and enlightening. As others have mentioned it reads like a novel.Since others have commented on the contents of the book itself, I will limit myself to the kindle version. While it hasn't been fixed to the level it should be, is now quite readable. There are a handful of instances where a \\"1\\" replaces a Capital \\"I\\", and a few other things along those lines. For me it didn't impede comprehension of the text, rather just caused me to roll my eyes in disgust. The gross errors that, based on previous reviews seem to have plagued previous editions, are gone. Having said that, \\"quite readable\\" isn't really good enough- the kindle version of this book merits a real proofread by a live person. I dropped a star because of the lack of that human touch.I do read these on an app, and did find it awkward to check the footnotes. My application frequently froze when trying to access them. The footnotes added quite a bit of depth to the text, so I was frustrated by this. Hence the removal of the second star. I think if I were to read this again, or in a scholarly setting, I would buy the hard copy. Actually, in my opinion, this book merits having as a hard copy on the shelves so generations will be able to enjoy/benefit from it. The ebook is much easier to carry around, however!I do agree with previous reviewers and commentators, that the optical scanning done to convert books to digital format results in poor quality. That does limit my ebook buying, and I really hope that Amazon will make a visible effort to address this issue and improve the quality of kindle books. It's the reason I don't have a kindle- until the quality of kindle books matches that of the print versions, I refuse to marry myself to the technology."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This size of book is perfect for the Kindle instead of having to handle a massive tome. Ive found it to be a great and insightful look at history. Since the author was present for many of the events he has a unique insight to the people and the moods of the country."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"In my view, William Shirer, Antony Bevor and Vasiliy Grossman are the three major Authors and Experts on WW2. Shirer had started it, Grossman continued and Bevor is currently carrying the torch.\\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" is fundamental because it also sheds light on a pre-war period, i.e. the rise of Nazism, the early life of Hitler, Fuhrer's way of thinking, his character. Yet, Shirer's book is not just about Nazis arrival to the world stage, it is also about politics and economics of XX century in which a citizen was reduced to a cog and where big business and political elite formed an alliance which is still in place today, though with a one difference. If earlier this alliance was formed under the banner of National Socialism, today's banner endorses Democracy and Free Market Economy, the best possible combination for Capitalism to make profits.Egor Paanukoski, M.Pol.Sci"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"If you read only one book about the Third Reich and WWII, this book is by far the best option available. Mr. Shirer has written a well-researched, comprehensive and engaging account of Third Reich from its inception till its demise. And despite its intimidating thickness, it is surprisingly readable, and on more than one occasion, quite thrilling. This is quite rare for a nonfiction and such a weighty tome."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is a great history book on the third reich. be warned, its HUGE and has no pictures. the author writes in a style that is easy to read and follow"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"While I have not quite finished this book, I highly recommend it to anyone interested in history in general and the Second World War in particular. The author was personally present during that time and witnessed many of the events first hand. It is a very long book, but well written, covering in detail the period from the end of WW I through the end of WW II. It has given me vastly greater insight into the period and the events surrounding the entire Nazi movement. Most fascinating are the intimate portraits of the major characters in Germany as well as those from Britain and France."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is, of course a classic which has been read by all literature and history buffs. The thing that makes this purchase so great is that in electronic form it is so easy to read. Anyone who read it knows it is a huge, weighty volume, difficult to hold, impossible to take anywhere. In my Kindle I can enjoy the knowlegable, factual story of the worlds biggest happening, in comfort. I can take it everywhere. All large books should be converted to electronic form as soon as possible.Anyone who hasnt read this book, should. It is the single most import piece of recent human history. It is beautifully written and difficult to put down. Even though we, of course know the outcome, learning how we got there is very valuable for modern understanding of human failings that lead to disaster. Being able to read it on an ereader means it is accessible to everyone. You should definately download this book. It is so worth it!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"An excellent insider's documentation and review of Hitler's Germany. The Rise and Fall of the Third should be essential reading for all as the degree of manipulation of the German population by a brutal, maniacal sadist is both astounding and frightening. It behoves us all to diligently guard against a repeat of that eventual worldwide disaster."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer did a masterful job in this book of revealing how Adolph Hitler led the German people into this chaotic mindset of his. Most of his communication to the German people was lies and misrepresentation of what he had in his warped mind for Germany. Once it got started it traveled through out the country like a virus to a populace that had been put down since the end of the first World War; that was looking for something, anything to bring back a proud people to their previous position in the world order. Shirer knew first hand what transpired since he was a War Correspondent (American) that lived in Germany in the 30\`s as the Nazis were coming to power, and on into the war in the 40\`s. Wonderful book, ranks in the top three books I have ever read.Robert L. Hayes"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I appreciate the extensive research of this book. It's quite a big one to tackle, but it holds great value and insight not only into the past, but perspective on the future. This is in the top 5 most important books I have ever read, and will ever read."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is deservedly a classic. It is reporting, not scholarly analysis, but Shirer was there and reports what he saw."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is probably the best book ever written on the subject of Nazi Germany. Absolutely required for any student of the subject, and highly recommended for any history buff."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I read this book when it was first issued and then loaned it out and it never came back. Was so happy to see that I could buy it for my kindle. It is a good reference book and excellent reading."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"this is a book which brings the true about what happened in germany. we must all learn from it. very concise and believable."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is an incredible book...I can't believe I had never read it. It is a fascinating look at a chapter in history that we should all study and hopefully learn from."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Most history books tend to be very dry, spending much of the time listing names and dates and very thin on context & motivations... this book is the complete opposite of that! I especially like how the author spreads blame around judiciously and evenly. That he lived through this history gives Shirer the opportunity to draw on real insights and impressions of people and he takes advantage of this opportunity early and often. This will easily remain my most favorite history book for a long time."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is a lengthy book on World War II. Shirer examines every aspect of the war. If you are a student of history, you must read this. It is as if Shirer was witnessing history as it happened."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"It is a Bible for all European's history fans. One of the best books about Third Reich I have ever seen. And I've seen a lot of them - I am Polish. :-)"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Enjoyed reading the book. Hard to fathom that an eccentric individual can influence a country and attempt to rule the world."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is the book that interested me in history many years ago. I purchased the Kindle edition to replace my very old, falling apart version I had not read in over 30 years. The story is well told, and having the perspective of Mr. Shirer, a reporter at the time of the events, is a treat.Mr. Shirer occasionally lapses into non-objective language, which is forgivable. His book can be read as finding advocating that there was a flaw in the German national character, something I think is an unwarranted judgment. I find that his judgment of the failure of France, Great Britain and the Soviet Union to act earlier fails to take into account the full political situation in all of those countries, and that earlier actions may have had serious consequences that are not appreciated. Still, to get a great overview of Nazi Germany with a lot of colorful detail, this book is worth returning to again and again."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"What is best about this is that the author was there from 1934-1941 and witnessed the Nazis firsthand. It's always the best history from those who were there and SAW. Also the amount of detail is what also makes this a classic and a must read."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is the definitive book on Nazi Germany. Shirer's masterful study covers every single aspect of this period of the world. From the birth of Adolf Hitler to the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials, everything is in this book and no aspect is deemed to small to be dismissed and not included. No study of this time can fully be completed without reference to this book. Perfectly readable and very easy to access for reference, it is the best book this this reader has read on the history of Hitler and his 3rd Reich."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Shirer's book is engrossing and gives the reader the details behind the devils. Although the subject matter is very disturbing in many ways, it also is interesting to review the path to power of the Nazis and their eventual defeat. Reading Shirer's book you feel as if you are looking over Hitler's shoulder as he and his court make decisions that seal the fate of their enemies and their nation. An important lesson for Americans is the fact that the Nazis were able to manipulate the democratic process to their advantage and upon gaining power were then able to consolidate through favors to the military and industry. Although the ending of the story is well-known, the details of life in facist Germany, including narratives about daily life, education, and industry, illustrate the total control Hitler gained as his regime continued. It is chilling to think of what Europe and the world would be today if the Nazis had prevailed. I think the book would be especially interesting to younger generations who have enjoyed the freedoms provided by the Allied victory, but have not had direct experience with the cost."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"It is indeed the most splendid work of history of our time! A highly recomended masterpieces!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Schirer's exhaustive chronicle of Nazism rarely strays from the evil cabal of men who created, imposed and perished under it. Hitler, Goebells, Goering, Himmler, Papen, and countless others are described in great detail. Schirer relies on his personal recollections when he lived in Nazi Germany along with captured Nazi archives he sifted through after World War II to tell his story. His personal biases for democracy, individual freedom, and equality are clear throughout the book (especially when recounting the horrors of the Holocaust) and he does not apologize for them.RISE and FALL reminds us to stand guard against people who would take away democracy, individual freedom and equality if given the opportunity."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Remembrance of the past helps us to understand the future. - William L. Shirer, May 1990.A democratic government is formed after suffering defeat in a long and costly war against the western nations of the world. Soon the country begins to experience the collapse of its new government amid economic uncertainty, currency devaluation, mistrust of the banking system, food shortages, and difficulty in maintaining ruling coalitions within its government. Germany and it's Weimar Republic experienced all of the above after World War I and before Hilter and his Nazi cronies came into power. But is history repeating itself with the democratic efforts of modern day Russia? Understanding this period of history and why the Weimar Republic failed may be the key to avoiding a repeat of history with the Russian democratic efforts or any other nation that pursues democratic reform after a long history of oppression.William Shirer, a journalist by trade, presents the history of the Nazification of Germany and its subsequent destruction in the who, what, when, where, why and how format of a true reporter. Relying on the tremendous store of Nazi documents recovered by the allied liberators of Europe, Shirer recreates the \\"GENISIS\\" of Hitler and the Nazi's rise to power. Their subsequent corruption and ultimate destruction of Germany's great institutions, including the education system, the medical and scientific community, the arts, and finally its vaunted military tradition, should have been a warning to the world. Instead, in the \\"NAME OF PEACE IN OUR TIME\\" the world stood by and watched until it was to late to stop the madness.I recommend that this book be used as the basis of any study on the history of WWII. Especially for those who wish to understand how this could happen to such a great nation and how we can prevent this from ever happening again."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The Rise and Fall of the third Reich was one of the best books I have EVER read. It has much research information, and gives details never known to us before. I feel that the best section of the book was THE NEW ORDER.Shirer is a genius of his writings. Though it was horrific, it was a realization of the sufferance that happened during WWII. It also provays Russia's strong part in the war. All the dates and places of the war are in the book. To the greatest account, the book describes the war.If you want to know anything about WWII, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is the book to read!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Shirer's Rise &amp; Fall has been a classic for over 37 years, I finally read it during the last two months. I found it be extremely well documented, with facts, footnotes. Surprisingly, despite it's length, it is a book which keeps the reader involved, brings this horrific period to life. I would recommend to any person interested in world history as a must read."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I will be the first to admit that modern German history and WW2 in particular have always been a topic to avoid. I belong to the generation that grew up with &quot;Hogan's Heroes&quot; on one side and a profound cognizance of the holocaust on the other making objectivity toward the subject elusive at best. Shirer delivers the facts with about as much objectivity as possible (especially for an eye-witness of much that went on). The strange personalities behind the Reich, the socio-economic envrionment that made it possible and, of course, the evil paradoxical mastermind at the center of the Reich...it's all here laid out in a lucid narrative that is really hard to put down."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I have read this book at least three times and find each read as fascinating as the first time I picked it up. His detailed story of the Nazis from their humble beginninigs in Munich to the terrible conclusion in 1945 is gripping reading. Simply one of the best books I have ever read"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is truly amazing. It should be read by every human being on the planet. An unprecedented historical account about the gangsters of the third reich, their rise to power, the takeover of western europe, and the fall of one of histories darkest and most deceptive aggressors. The only complaint that I can see people having is the author's tendency to express his opinion on the tons of factual evidence presented. This did not bother me, firstly because the author was THERE to witness the rise and the fall of the third reich, which gives literary license to write about what he saw and expirienced, and secondly because his opinions are of a superficial and briefly stated nature. It is a long read, needing a fare amount of contemplation, but certainly worth it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Originally published in 1960, this book still stands as one of the most comprehensive biographies of Adolf Hitler. (It covers all major events of the Nazi Party in general but gives most of the individual attention to Hitler, Goering, Goebbels and any other high leaders of the infamous party.)Perhaps the best part of the book is the first third of the novel in that it contains a narrative of German politics and the actions Hitler used to force control of the government through the Nazi Party. Throughout the book, the author is careful to point out many subtle events in history that could have altered the future of Nazi Germany if not for someone's change of actions. (For instance, Hitler was almost born Adolf Schicklgruber. Would the fascist leader have gained such a following with his &quot;converts&quot; required to shout, &quot;Heil Schicklgruber!&quot; An interesting fact and one of the many that the author has surfaced with his thorough historical novel.)If there is a negative part of this book, it is that the author shares viewpoints of mid-20th century Americans. He frequently cites the problems of Nazi leaders who were &quot;sexually disturbed homosexuals&quot; or &quot;deviant drug addicts.&quot; While many of the party's leaders were definitely not an angel by any stretch of the imagination, the author speaks as someone who lives in his time. In other words, the author implies that a Nazi leader's homosexuality is a source of his sociopathic criminal behavior. While this opinion made sense in 1960, it sounds strange to many 21st century Westerners and fails to give the reader a logical choice on what made these men tick.The author gives us a fair look into Hitler's mind. Sometimes mixed with admiration for his political savvy, horror at his brutal policies, sympathy (in the sense that he has become a pathetic figure) for his last days, amazement at his manipulation - the author takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride through the actions and mind of a world leader that will always be looked at as one of history's most evil figures."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The definitive book on Nazi Germany. Painstakingly written and researched, some of which drawn directly from the author's own experiences. Rating a book is often a subjective matter. In terms of sound judgement and objective method, Shirer has done a remarkable job creating a benchmark historical work on an era few who lived through it would like to remember.- Louis"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I am in the process of reading the book at the present time and as a fan of history (particularly the World Wars and the Civil War)I devour all the facts and information that the author provides. Be cautioned that if you are not interested in the why and the details of how the Nazi party was able to control Germany, this book can be a ponderous read. But, if you want to delve into the mind and the politics of history's most notorious dictator and his cronies, then this book will provide you with much detailed information."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I have to admit that this book is probably the best (and most truthful) book I've read on World War 2.Even though I like the World War 2 parts, the thing that interested me the most was Hitler's rise to complete power.Anyone who wants to read about World War 2 must read this book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I have wanted to read this historical account of WWII for years but was always daunted by its length. I'm glad to have gotten over that psychological hurdle because the book is a quick read, it is engrossing and therefore interesting to read for hours at a time. Shirer did a tremendous amount of research for this project. Moreover, his ability to organize vast amounts of information it truly impressive.The text covers everything from the political, to the military, to the nationalistic, to the anti- Semitic aspects of the Third Reich. While Shirer does not shy from stating his points of view, I thought his incites only added to this work. Shirer was a journalist in Europe during the war and therefore has compelling view and perspectives about the events surrounding the Third Reich.

A twenty something female family member is reading it for the second time! Very well researched and well crafted. I learned a great deal and am still ruminating over much of it. This remains one of the most compelling and interesting books I have ever read. It sucked me in and I could just not stop. An essential read for all."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I've had this book in the typical print for years, but never wanting to start something I wouldn't finish,it still sits on the shelf. However, once the audiobook was listed, I grabbed it for my ipod....WOW! The narration is fabulous, which is always the deciding factor for me in an audiobook. A fifty-seven hour masterpiece!!Five stars!!!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I don't see the point of a long review, there are plenty of those here already. Suffice to say that if you have an interest in history, the second world or just a good solid read then this is one of the must have books."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"An excellent breakdown of the events leading up to the darkest period in modern history, and the period of expansion and finally destruction of the Reich."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The book I received was an illustrated version of Shirer's text, condensed by the Readers Digest. It was not as advertised. Anyway, I like the photos. The condensed version is easier to read in short sessions. You need to be careful when you order, otherwise you're in for a surprise."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I found this book to be an excellent information piece of not only Hitler but all of the facts surrounding the Third Reich and a lot of facts about Nazi Germany I have found nowhere else. Its a bit long with a lot of speculation. Make sure you have a lot of time because once I picked it up I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"A well documented, frightening, extremely detailed account of the inner workings of Nazi Germany, this ook is a must-read for anyone studying WWII. It's also useful for compiling a further reading list, since the author cites a dizzying array of other books throughout the text. One note for purchasers of the mass-market sized paperback: put your copy in a book jacket of some sort right away, as the flimsy paper cover is not strong enough to hold the 1500+ pages together!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I had read this book about thirty-five years ago. Since then I have gone through several books on World War II - Churchill's great memoirs volumes, Toland and Fest biographies of Hitler, books on the Nuremberg trials...So I thought that Shirer's book would be a simple re-hash - it wasn't.If I were to be asked to recommend only one book on Nazi Germany this would be it. I was also very moved by the elegance of Shirer's writing. His prose is stirring and makes these cataclysmic events of the twentieth century very vivid.It is all here - Hitler's rise to power in the 1920's, the appeasement of the European powers during the 1930's, the sordidness of the Hitler-Stalin pact and then the war itself with, for a time Britain and Churchill standing alone. Enveloping all this is the hatreds of Hitler and the Nazi party; above their hatred of the Jews and then the Slavic and Russian peoples, their hatred of democratic values (what we would now call human rights), their hatred of the Versailles Treaty.Shirer makes no excuses for these and puts the blame squarely on Hitler and the German people. Versailles was never the humiliation it was made out to be. As Shirer points out this \`stab in the back' myth was also propagated by Weimar as well. Hitler knew how to rally the nationalistic fervor and pagan impulses of the bulk of his people.All the personalities are in here - and they are a powerful and colourful lot - but sad, as both German and non-German acquiesce to the force of the German leader. Chamberlain's fruitless efforts to achieve peace are overlooked today as he is framed with the word appeasement; but what politician today would be as honest as he was. Shirer quotes Chamberlain's honest and touching \`declaration of war' speech when Poland is brutally invaded by Germany -quite possibly one of the most poignant passages in the book as the world is now stepping over the precipice into war.Shirer uses many of Hitler's speeches to illustrate how the German people adored their beloved leader. One is struck by how a people could swallow these words so whole-heartedly - words that are so diametrically opposed to the best values of the Western World. The speeches are filled with hatred for Jews and ridicule for the leaders of the Western World. Hitler's reply to Roosevelt in 1939 before the war - though so successfully manipulative - is haunting in retrospect.There are perhaps a few things left out. One is the destruction of the Polish resistance uprising in Warsaw that Stalin left to the Germans to ruthlessly suppress - with the Russian army just outside Warsaw watching as the Germans slaughtered the Polish resistance movement.And there is maybe too much, I feel, on the Stauffenberg plot to kill Hitler. But again Shirer is correct in pointing out the hypocrisy of these \`anti-Nazi' conspirators who waited too long (Germany was obviously losing the war at this stage and its cities were decimated). Were they not morally inept - were they doing this to seize political power only? Were they really morally repulsed by the Nazi regime - or just mere opportunists?As mentioned if one reads only one book on Nazi Germany this has it all. But as a warning - reading over 1,100 pages on Nazism can wear one down - it becomes very depressing. However you are left with a greater understanding of this tumultuous era."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The work of William Shirer is without a doubt an enormous historical effort, that goes into depths and internals of the Nazi Germany as few other works. It brings to light the multitude of facts, transcripts and first-person perspectives about the Nazi leaders.However, it makes several important omissions. First, it concentrates primarily on the leaders of the Nazi Germany and doesn't research well enough the empire beneath (industrialists, people, antisemitism, foreign relations, etc). It wasn't just a bunch of maniacs who managed to ruin and bled Europe almost to its death. Secondly, the book is unbalanced in its treatment of the Allied and Soviet role in the war. But the most alarming, if not shocking, is the final conclusion the author makes about Germany and German people. Born in Russia, I'm well aware that Soviet and modern Russia, despite the casualties suffered which are orders of magnitude greater than those suffered by the Allies, always stressed that it fought against Nazi Germany and Nazism, and NOT against the German people. Any author's generalizations about German people simply don't agree with the philosophies of the Allied forces, which fought against any racial or ethnic prejudice of Nazism."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"First of all, a lot of people ask me how come I am reading a 1200+ pages book with the tiniest font ever printed on a book! My answer is that, if they ever start reading this book, they will swear by them too!Fantastic recap of Third Reich -- Please note and emphasized -- this is not about Hitler, but it is would the Reich led by Adolf Hitler -- so therefore, there are some chapters dedicated to Hitler's life etc -- but as you read this book in its entirety -- one will understand that (a) portions dedicated to Hitler is not that much, and (b) most importantly, why Hitler did what he did!I must say that I have a completely different perspective about history (not restricted to Germany) but overall (at least during the periods of 19th and 20th century) as to how things have happened, and why some one gets demonized and while some got away with it. Hitler might have done certain things atrocious and was publicized in a negative way in the world to earn hatredness, but there are a number of others who did exactly the same, but never one talks about it -- Wonder why? It is not my justification for anything that Hitler did, but the philosophy of few get noticed and others, however blatant getaway with it, is very intriguing. Worth a research, but am sure will never get published due to political correctness, of course.If you like any shade of history, this is one of the books. History always teach a lot to any one, and as they say history repeats itself, but after reading the book, that history repeats itself not every 200 years, rather every 10 years -- it seems so; not necessarily the similar set of events -- but in terms of people's behaviors.I know this review may not be helpful for many to decide on whether to buy this book or not -- but I somehow wanted to put in a word for my ardent respect for this book and express some of the peripheries of the book, rather than simply write a review of this book. In fact, after reading this book, I am not worthy to write a review on this book!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is one of the greatest works of non-fiction ever written, and well worth the time (in fact it's a quite a fast read). You will be an improved, more well-informed person for reading this book, and perhaps taking some lessons from it. I don't think I'll ever forget it. Powerful. Awesome. Majestic. Shirer was there as a correspondant, and he also spent an extraordinary amount of time reading through the masses of the regime's documentation (German efficiency) that weren't destroyed on its fall, which gives this book an almost impervious sense of truth and accuracy."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This well-known work from an American journalist present in Germany for some years before the Second World War and author of other famous books, deserves to be read for the sheer volume of the material covered. After reading David Irving's Hitler's War, I came to wonder how much respect writers deserved who were inaccurate or just plain dishonest in their presentation of some or much material regarding Nazi Germany. I specifically refer to his superficial dismissal of Dr. Theo Morell, Hitler's personal physician, as a quack. It was only in reading David Irving that I was able to see Dr. Morell as a conscientious GP who in fact did much more than give his patient pills. He ran EKG's on him and sent them under cover of anonymity to a leading Berlin cardiologist. As for the \\"pills\\" he prescribed, the pharmacological options at the time were severely limited compared to the present. Nazi Germany, its leaders, Adolph Hitler as military figure and the facts about the Second World War are still in need of objective study. There has been a great tendency to present the Nazis as supermen/monsters/clumsy fools without considering how contradictory all this is. IN addition, in the West, material all too often emphasizes Western battles without considering the overwhelming importance of the Russo-German war in the ultimate resolution of the conflict in the European Theater. Read this book, but read beyond it and read more recent studies, even if they challenge long-held conventional \\"wisdom\\"."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Shirer's, \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" is the definitive history of that regime. He takes the reader from Hitler's early years as a waif in Vienna, to his service in the trenches of France in WWI, to the beginnings of the Nazi movement in post WWI Germany, through his ultimate rise to power, and finally to his downfall. Written by a journalist who witnessed firsthand the events he describes and had unrestricted access to volumes of Nazi government documents, Shirer produced the most complete work on that subject ever. His work is as important today as it was when it was first published, perhaps more so.Hitler and his entourage produced a blueprint for dictators that is still being followed. The plan is simple: seize power by any means necessary, then use state assets to effectively control the population. In Germany, the Hitler Youth replaced hearth and home. Schools taught only the Nazi philosophy. The media broadcast the \\"Party\\" line exclusively. Churches? \\"They will preach what we want them to preach,\\" stated Hitler. Bound by these constraints an entire generation did the bidding of their Nazi masters without question. It can happen again, anywhere, including the U.S.A. It's a warning worth heeding. Adolph Hitler is alive and well today!Hitler alive? Yes! He showed up as Josef Stalin in the U.S.S.R., and again as Mao Tse Tung and his \\"Cultural Revolution\\" in China. He appeared as Idi Amin in Uganda, thoughtfully providing his executioners with an unlimited supply of marijuana after dispatching their victims with iron bars. He turned up again as Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, his \\"Concentration Camps\\" now being called, \\"New Economic Zones\\" and \\"Reeducation Centers,\\" and subsequently as Pol Pot in the \\"Killing Fields\\" of Cambodia. He surfaced in the Mid-East as Saddam and his acid baths in Iraq and appears regularly as Hezbollah/ Hammas suicide bombers in Israel. Air travelers constantly fear he will reappear as an Al Quida terrorist working for Osama bin Laden. And let us not forget, almost 50 million people have died in abortion clinics here in the U.S., far more than died at Auschwitz, Treblinka etc. The dictators named simply follow Adolph's plan. And like the democracies of the Nazi Era, we stand idly by while they conduct their nefarious activities. We have no right to criticize the British, the French or even the Germans. We are as guilty as they!Edmund Burk said, \\"The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.\\" Shirer has shown the world how dictators operate. Armed with this knowledge, we should be able to prevent despots from rising to power. Clearly, this we have not done. The Allies did nothing until it was almost too late. Armed with Shirer's work and the bitter experience of history, hopefully, we will not continue to be guilty of the same."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I did not realize the version of the book I purchased did not include maps and images but was just plain text."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"A massive book (1200+ pages according to the Amazon information). I got it as a Kindle Daily Deal for $1.99 back in mid Sept and started reading it about the same time. That it took me a month and a half to finish it suggests both its length and that it was good enough to stick to it. I probably read about 10 hours a week.As history goes, it has some issues. The author insists on putting personal commentary into the book, mostly in the form of negative comments about various historical characters. To me this calls his objectivity into question. Having said that, I am not real sure I disagree with most of his opinions on these characters, but I think the book would have been better off without them.One of the things I found somewhat surprising was his seeming shock that the Nazis would have lied so much. They were mass murderers! Why would a few lies matter any? In any case, lying is a routine thing for most politicians and diplomats. Why would it have been any different in the 3rd Reich.I also found his continual suggestions that the army \\"should\\" have deposed Hitler to be a little odd. The German Army had a long history of serving the government in power, much as the US military serves the government of the US. Suggesting somehow they should have broken that allegiance makes me wonder if the author actually understands the difficultly that military men have in breaking the chains of loyalty that is a huge part of who they are. This was not a 4th or 5th world African country where the only history the military knows is one of taking over the country periodically. In any case, it is not clear that throwing the country into the chaos of a civil war would have been something German military leaders would have done lightly. It is also pretty clear from the few attempts that were made that the German military just was not good at this kind of thing, and maybe just never had the capability to do it.But, overall, the issues I had with the book were more than outweighed by a fascinating piece of history."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"While I haven't completed reading this book, as it is covering a long period in history, I find it fascinating to see the insights of how Hitler seized power in Germany in the 30's. I'm hoping to draw comparisons between the rise of the Nazi party and our current political status in the US."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Received as a gift. Very well written. Great detail and insights into Hitler and the horror of his thinking."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I ordered this book and it arrived earlier than expected and in perfect condition. A great buy!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"By far the most magnificent book I have ever read - something to pass on to our children. We must never forget."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is an informative and well-written history. There is an extensive index and meticulous source information -- making it invaluable to history majors -- but it is not overly pedantic or academic, so anyone can enjoy it. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting an informative overview of the history of Nazi Germany."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I have to confess. I am only a freshman in high school. My aspiration is to become a history major, and so I read this book in 5th grade. This is the book that was mostly responsible for making me want to chose this path. Shirer is a genius, and he makes the reader want to learn more about each and every one of the historical characters that he introduces. Truly #1 on my list."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I read this book between semesters last year because I was going to take a History course that covered this period. I had wanted to read it for a long time--but the thing is so big, I kept putting it off!I am so glad I finally got around to reading it. I took a razor blade to my softcover copy to seperate the six books. It made it so much less intimidating! Only now I have to buy another copy!Shirer took a lot of sophisticated material and put it together in a very readable form. The first hundred pages were a bit hard, but after that the book absolutely soared! These are 1,500 pages that I will read again.Another thing I liked was Shirer's introduction. There are those who say that historys should not be written so soon after an event, but Shirer is well justified in his task as was Thucydides in his--and for the same reason. He was there."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"A must read for anyone who wants to expand their mind about history and the destructive power of hate. I just moved from Washington State, USA to Heidelburg, Germany and I was told that this book would fill me with pertinant knowledge. It did. The only drawback: Shirer is a homophobe. Very ironic, dissapointing, and distracting to the reading and learning experience. In teaching us how truly atrocious racism is Shirer feels the need to enlighten us on the fact that the Nazi leaders are &quot;Homosexual Perverts&quot; at every turn in the text. For those of us with good friends that are homosexual, it takes away from the story. If you can ignore that road-bump, this book will impact your life."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book was torture to read. It started off very exciting and interesting, Hitler's background and Vienna days and the formative years of the party were fascinating, but starting with the party's rise to power and with it EVERY twist and turn about how they intrigued and bullied their way to the top and then the occupation of Austria and Czechoslovakia it became excruciating and suffocating to wade through. Characters appear and vanish with breathtaking rapidity never to be heard from again, or else hang around for hundreds of pages (especially Schleicher and Dahlerus) and won't go away. This book's pious and mindboggling coverage of basically only the political events comes at the expense of details about other aspects of the Third Reich (like the Ss, Gestapo, Hitler Youth, Heydrich, Speer, exactly how Germany rearmed, etc.). For example, did we really need a blow-by-blow account of every single turn and setback and last minute comeback and every trivial detail (complete with date, time and even weather descriptions!) regarding how these gangsters came to power? So often I threw up my hands and tore at my hair and screamed as I kept reading about how so and so telephoned so and so at 2 a.m. in the morning then waited all day for a reply... or how many times Hitler flew into the absolutely worst rage in his life... it was sickening enough reading about how dirty and slimy Nazi politics had been but to have every minor character unearthed and every trivial detail thrown a spotlight on through virtually all of 1500 pages including huge footnotes--the footnotes may as well have been a separate book!--it was all just too much. And Ribbentrop, whom Shirer sneered endlessly at is on practically every page in the last two thirds. If he was so pompous and intolerable, did every item in his daily itinerary really needed scrutiny? I'm not exaggerating. Except for Hitler, Ribbentrop is the leading character in the narrative; as a result, more fascinating people like Heydrich and Rommel were given short shrift. Even a little more on Himmler--heck, Streicher--may not have hurt and may have tendered the endless monotony of diplomacy and backstabbing and squabbling. I guess what I am trying to say is that if this book had been a little more well-rounded, it might have been better. I realize one could read other books for more information about other characters and events, but I really wanted it all from this book. After all it has the all-encompassing title of &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; and everyone claims it the definitive history of those days. Also, Shirer has an annoying tendency for Monday morning quarterbacking, and his personal phobias mars the seriousness of this book somewhat. Also, his prose style is distracting and ebbs as much as it flows. The acute sections on the Holocaust and the July plot however were very worthwhile. Overall, three stars. Perhaps this book was not meant to be read from cover to cover; you have been warned."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Horribly dated piece of work. Shirer was a homophobe, and made it quite clear in this sentence: \\"Many of the S.A.'s top leaders, beginning with its chief, Roehm, were notorious homosexual perverts. Lietenant Edmund Heines, who led the Munich S.A., was not only a homosexual but a covicted muderer. These two and dozens of others quarreled and fueded as only men of unnatural sexual inclinations, with their peculiar jealousies, can.\\" The S.A. was a cesspool because of their bullying and murderous nature, not the homosexuality of a few of its top members; they were Hitler's muscle and they had no issue flexing that muscle much to the peril of many decent people. This alone should earn a reader's contempt, but undoubtedly readers in the early sixties probably saw homosexuality as a deep moral flaw. It just isn't that way anymore.I did, however, enjoy the manner in which Shirer rails against many of Hitler's \\"yes men\\"--Ribbentrop gets absolutely exposed and it seems Shirer took joy in revealing his shallow intellect (The passage describing the incident in which Ribbentrop almost knocked over a British dignitary with a sudden, unexpected Nazi salute was laugh-out-loud funny.) Also, the captured Nazi documents, many of which are reproduced verbatim, enlighten the reader as to what was going on inside Hitler's Germany. Shirer often falls back on these documents, as well as post-war testimonies at Nuremberg, giving the reader fleeting breaks from his slanted journalistic approach. The section about the Einsatzgruppen was particularly moving--it moved me to tears--and the insight from Halder's journal is key throughout much of the text. It's fairly long (somewhere over 1100 pages), and if you can adjust to its being horribly dated, you still may enjoy it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"For anyone eager to gain a fairly comprehensive understanding of the development, growth, decline, and collapse of the Third Reich, this book is it. With Shirer, you have someone who was a witness to many of the events described in this book - e.g. the Nazi Party rallies at Nuremberg, Hitler's marching of troops into the Rhineland in 1936, the incorporation of Austria into the German Reich in March 1938, the Munich crisis, and the French surrender in June 1940.Shirer also makes skillful use of the wealth of Nazi archival materials to give the reader a full scope of the characters and policies which defined and shaped Germany between 1933 and 1945.In today's uncertain times, reading this book should also serve to remind the reader that any democratic government, whether threatened by real or perceived enemies, can succumb to Fascism if its people permit the slow or precipitate undoing, by executive or legislative fiat, of their civil liberties."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is the fourth time that I have read this very important book by Wm. Shirer who was there during the ascension of Hitler. I re-read it every seven years or so as I always find that current events have their precedent in earlier history. The 'National Socialist Workers Party' sounds like something that Obama might lead, but it is the full name of the Nazi Party. Hitler started out as a left leaning politician with his vilifying of the established order of the day and he pushed for universal health care among other things. Does this sound familiar?This is a must read for any thinking individual who has an interest in politics and public policy."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The Angel HunterThis is an excellent account of the soulless wretches that established the Third Reich. The spine chilling events and political maneuvering that took place within the borders of the Fatherland beginning with the Treaty of Versailles cannot be digested in one reading; they are, in a phrase, too terrible to believe on the first pass. If you are looking for a firsthand account from a journalist who lived in the midst of this madness as it gripped Eastern Europe, this book is for you. If you ever doubted the inhuman suffering inflicted on the world by Nazism, or thought maybe the Holocaust was a Jewish lie, READ THIS BOOK! But be ready for a disturbing revelation that can only be reached by reading this work: the evil doers, in any generation, believe in their hearts, they are right. My God... how frightening."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Shirer's definitive work on the history of the Third Reich is still as relevant to the subject today as it was when it was published back in the 1960s.The book was unique at the time (and quite possibly is still) because there was no precedent for a government such as the Third Reich being so utterly defeated that all their dirty secrets were laid bare. Government documents, memos, notes, even the diaries of some of the German leaders were opened up to the world when the Reich fell. Shirer used those sources as well as his own experiences as a journalist in Nazi Germany and conversations with living members of the former Reich to put together this book.Shirer's defiance of convention at the time in writing a history so soon after the actual events initially brought criticism of his work. The unique circumstances of the fall of Nazi Germany demanded such a history though and time has shown his book to be one of the most important works ever created on Nazi Germany.Shirer's opinion of the events of the time may not ring true for all readers, but he doesn't portray his own opinion as historical fact instead letting his sources speak to that point. Because of his position as a foreign journalist in Nazi Germany before, during and after the war Shirer's opinion of events and the people he met (including some of the most important figures in the Nazi government) is at least as valuable as the facts he presents and deserving of inclusion in this book.A must read for anyone interested in Nazi Germany and World War II."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I was in junior high. Since then I've reread it at least three times. It never ages. There is always something I didn't understand clarified. The author tackles a difficult, at the time, subject with an eye for his audience. I still have the Bantam copy I read in '65 and a newer version with larger print as concession to my eyes."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Without a doubt, this has to be one of the most important history books ever written! Let's look at why...1)The author: His credentials to write this book are unbeatable. He lived among the Nazis as a correspondent from their birth till half way through the war. Because of this he got to see and hear all the key players and personally meet many of them. This gave him great insight into Germany and germans during the growth of the Nazi virus. Couple this with the fact that he was an action journalist, and was therefore an extremely gifted writer, and his credentials are truly unbeatable.2)Subject: Although this subject is well covered, it has not been covered before or since this writing as thoroughly as in this book. Shirer had access to ALL of the Nazi papers, including diariers, memos and minutes, and you therefore get an insiders view on what was going on inside the top secret meetings of the Nazi leaders. Here, exposed for all to see, are the diablolical reasonings for everything they did or tried to do. Here spelled out step by step is the entire history from the youth of Hitler to the death by strangalation by the russian and allied armies. It has sections on the history of Germany back to Martin Luther, when the mindset of the german people was developed that would allow for a tyrant like Hitler. Sections of the book also give an insider's view into the combat decisions, Concentration camps, basic principles of Nazism, and the normal German's pied piper attitude. It cover's EVERYTHING!3)Lessons: It is possible to draw lessons from this well of historical knowledge that will blow you away. It has been said that when we stop learning from history we are bound to repeat it and this book clearly portrays the evil that has already occurred and is possible if we don't watch world affairs closely. The U.S. may get derided for meddling in others' affairs, but this book shows the danger that is possible if we don't! We also need to learn not to nourish the seeds of racism as Hitler did in his youth that led to the eventualy death of 40 million people. So many great things can be learned from this book...Overall: It is simply a great book. One of the best I have ever read! It never bogs down...I finished it in a month, all 1500 pages.In conclusion: If you havn't read this book you absolutely must!!! You will not regret it!!!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I read this years ago in college and I thought I'd never read it again since it is so huge. About five years ago I picked it up at a bookstore in Louisville and took it on three trips to Europe. When I got my Kindle Fire for Christmas, there was no question what book I was going to download first, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. Anything you want to know about the rise and fall of Adolf Hitler, you can find here. This is, undoubtedly the best work on the subject period. All other books pale in comparison. If you don't read any other book connected to World War II, this is the one to get. Forget the others. I HIGHLY recommend this one."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is the best book I have ever read on World War II Germany that I have ever read - I've read a few. It is written from a unique perspective. The author was a journalist in Germany at the time Hitler came to power. He stayed in Europe and reported on the war up close and personal. His insight is amazing. He was certainly a brilliant man, very observant. This book really puts the pieces together. World War II did not happen in a vacuum nor did the rise of Hitler to power. Anyone interested in Hitler and/or World War II should read this book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is hard to beat when it comes to detailing the causes of WWII, particularly in the European theater. I have read many different books on WWII history and thought that I had a pretty good grasp of what happened, when it happened, how it happened and the eventual results, but upon reading this book, I realized that there were much that I did not read about. Shirer filled in many of the gaps in my knowledge of this crucial period in history.Considering the amount of names, dates and details that Shirer put in the book, he has managed to write a large work that rates very high on readability. At no point in the book did it get dry (at least for me). He has managed to weave together his voluminous research into captured German papers as well as interviews and correspondence with those involved into a very coherent, &quot;story-telling&quot; way.The reason I didn't rate this book the full 5 stars is because Shirer, as a journalist and not a military historian per se, couldn't resist injecting his strong personal biases and prejudices throughout the entire book. I understand that a certain amount of personal bias is sometimes inevitable in a work written by a journalist, but when those same views get repeated over and over again, it just becomes plain annoying.The first glaring bias that gnawed on my nerves was Shirer's repeated attack on some of Hitler's henchmen because they happened to be homosexual. He was trying to make a point that Hitler employed some of the worst scums of the earth during his early rise to power. I would fully agree with the fact that these men were scums because they were also murderers, thieves.... but homosexual? To place someone's sexual orientation (and we're not talking about pedophilia here) on the list of the world's biggest crimes shows Shirer's worst inconsistencies - you simply can condemn Hitler for being the worst bigot in the world and yet demonstrate such glaring bigotry yourself.His personal attacks also get very tiring after a while. True, Goering was one of the most despicable characters to come out of the Nazi era, but when an author of a supposed work of history chooses to refer to him time and time again as &quot;the FAT Field Marshal&quot; or &quot;the CORPULENT Field Marshal&quot;, it kind of takes a lot away from the reader's sense of the author's objectivity. Moreover, the fact that Goering wasn't a thin man doesn't have anything to do with the events of that period. For that matter, Churchhill was no model of fitness either, but the author doesn't point that out at all.Sometimes, Shirer lets his personal biases contribute to silly inconsistencies. One moment, he'd be talking about &quot;typical German clumsiness&quot;, and a few chapters later, while talking about another event, he would write about &quot;typical German orderliness&quot;. Which one is it? Were the Germans slobs or perfectionists? Maybe he just shouldn't have made generalizations so freely like that throughout the entire book. Tell us the events that happened and let us make up our own minds. In similar ways, Shirer also seems to be torn between deciding whether Hitler was a genius, or a bumbling maniac. His views on that differ from chapter to chapter.It may seem like I've written more about the book's weak points than its strong ones. The thing is, the book is invaluable as far as WWII history works are concerned. I'm just trying to emphasize that although you won't be disappointed with the mountain of details offered by it, it is also extremely important to know that this book must be read with an open mind, knowing that the author has liberally injected many of his personal biases into the narrative. At no point should it be considered strictly a work of history (in the vein of Stephen Ambrose's &quot;D-DAY&quot; etc. for example). Shirer gives you history the way HE wants you to see it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer was well qualified to write this all-to-necessary book. As a war correspondent, he lived in Nazi Germany, covering the darkest chapter in human history thoroughly and objectively as possible. This 50-year old classic is a story that tragically is not told very factually anymore.This book should be read to counterbalance all the misinformation that now envelops the Third Reich. While the politically correct spin often claims that Christianity is responsible for massacre of the Jews-the National Holocaust Museum in Washington DC is founded on such fatuity--this book details Hitler's hatred and oppression of Catholics and Protestants. He imprisoned thousands of priests, nuns, and ministers in Germany and warned that he would exterminate all clerics in Poland who failed to preach his message. Shortly after seizing power he ordered all churches to replace the crucifix with a swastika and to substitute Mein Kampf for the Bible-not exactly what the radical liberal left likes to teach about this evil dictator, who in reality despised Christianity as much as he abhorred Judaism. Pope Pius who today is regularly singled out as being insensitive to nazi atrocities is evidenced to have been one of the few vociferous voices who repeatedly denounced nazism from its earliest days.Another current myth debunked is the nazis' systematic annihilation of homosexuals. The book documents that many of the founders of nazism were in fact homosexuals themselves. When innocent homosexuals were brutally murdered it was during Hitler's purges of party members who had aroused his suspicions. Often these targeted gay advisers were caught in the company of innocent young men who were killed along with their nazi lovers. Even Hitler's questionable sexual preference is alluded to in this voluminous narrative.The most shocking aspect of the book is its portrayal of Hitler's incredible ability to manipulate. He did not gain his power by force or treachery-rather he was one of the most skillful politicians in history. When he gave a speech, he could feel the German people's pain. He promised a brighter future for the all the citizens, and skillfully avoided discussing his fanatical plans in his campaign stemwinders. As a politician he accomplished a great deal. He gave Germany a booming economy, low unemployment rates, and his approval ratings were high right up until the end. Obviously, he failed in providing moral leadership, but The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich does a remarkable job of detailing how the one of the most evil people in history was able to assume and maintain so much power for so long. It should serve as a warning for all generations to come.At 1500+ pages, it is an endeavor, but it's a story that must be told and more importantly it must be ACCURATELY told. Far too many innocent lives were wiped out by the depravity of nazism to let the story be doctored to suit the purposes of special interest groups. The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is that rare work that truly dissects a historical period in a very readable fashion."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"As many others have said, the book is excellent, but the copy editing is terrible.Far too many typos, and the footnote system is abysmal.Hopefully, they will update a corrected copy, with footnotes inserted into the text body.If they do, I will update my star rating."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This colosus of a book will tell you most of what you need to know about the 3rd Reich's inner workings. I say most in that this book focuses on the top dogs in Nazi Germany - for example Eichmann is only mentioned a couple of time, as is Mengele. In addition, not all the facts had come to light when the book was written, a fact that Shirer readily admits. However, the advantage of having this book written so soon after the facts means that many of the participants (those that weren't executed after the Nurnberg trials) were still alive and knew the author personally (or at least by reputation) due to his coverage of German affairs for the US media. He used this contact on several occasions to flesh out the official documents.Because of the fact that the author was a correspondent, the &quot;Rise&quot; part of the Nazi party is a far more personal and interesting read. It is liberally sprinkled with personal observations and commentary. After the American journalists were expelled from Germany, the book is not quite as interesting, but still a page turner.The highlights for me were the comparative critisisms, e.g. comparing Guderian's claims (in his autobiography) with the information taken from OKW or other people's diaries. A lot of the Axis leaders tried to downplay their roles in books after the war (another prime example is Speer); the book points out the lies and half-truths.In addition to the value of the book for giving a full and coherent picture of the workings of the Third Reich, I've found it to be an invaluable reference tool. I come back to this book again and again to look up information when reading other history books, when something pertaining to the era is mentioned in the media, etc. It is well indexed and sources are explicitly defined. Essential for the armchair historian as well as those more professional ones."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This monumental volume - 1300 pages - is one serious piece of history. The author has lived in Germany under the Third Reich, as a journalist, and this is a massive plus for such a book, as the author can add his personal experience of the events and of some of the people involved.Most of the book is based on astronomic quantities of secret papers captured at the end of the war. Thus, the narrative of this book is peppered with direct quotes from all these sources: telegrams, letters, diary entries, transcribed phone discussions, etc.If you wonder what the book is like in general, I will say this: the first parts deal with Hitler, the situation after WW1, and the likes. Then, once the Nazis are in power, you get an extremely thorough and detailed narrative of the events. That's the bulk of the book. It may repel some people, understandably, but that's a great way to get to know what really went down and how it went down. But be warned, this isn't the tale of horror you might have been interested in reading.You'll very rarely read about the Jews, for instance. Chapter 27, \\"The New Order\\" is the only part where the death camps and scientific experiences are dealt with at any length; the rest of the book, as said before, is really about political history. That means you will read about foreign ministers, diplomacies, Mussolini and Ciano's diary, the communication between various governments, etc. So if the gruesome is all you're interested in, read chapter 27 in a library, but don't buy the book, you'd be disappointed.It took me a very long time to read this brick! But I don't regret it at all. It gave me a much deeper understanding of WW2. I also appreciate the author's more involved tone than a regular historian would have used. Shirer does not hesitate to call Goering \\"fat\\" or \\"obese\\" when Goering was indeed fat and obese. Himmler is depicted as an ex-chicken farmer, and most Nazis as thugs.Recommended to anyone into WW2 and Nazism, and who wants a really thorough history of Nazism. Again, I stress that this book is 95% political history, with events, and not ideology (not much)."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I promised myself that I would get around to reading this book &quot;someday&quot; when I was twenty--now I'm nearly forty and feel badly that I waited so long! This is a great book; not so much for its literary prose or intellectual bearing--but for the honest, straightforward way in which William Shirer tells the story quite literally of the rise and fall of the Third Reich. Shirer was a newspaper man and broadcaster working in Germany and he saw the early rise of the Nazi party first-hand; although the book is long (1100+ pages in hardback), it reads like a giant newspaper story--as if each paragraph was written &quot;top down&quot; and cut at exactly the right point to keep you on the edge of your seat. Shirer has a curious habit of footnoting almost every fact--and his notes are at least as fine a read as his text. Although he freely admits his predjudices in the foreward (and only a robot would not have them)--he does a fine job of sticking to the job of factual story telling. From the standpoint of someone living in a western democracy in 1998, it's almost impossible to fathom the breadth and depth of the terrible deeds accomplished by Hitler's Third Reich--and how he was able to remain in power. Shirer really focuses the perspective here. Do yourself a favor--don't try to speak intelligently on the Third Reich at some cocktail party without having first read this book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This was loaned to me by a friend, so I can't say that I paid for it, but if I had I would be upset. I read this for a class in high school and was blown away by the detail and yet how intimate it was. This is one of the best histories ever done in my book.The transfer rates as one of the worst, however. Wrong words (see other reviews to get a better understanding of what this means), choppy chapters, and the like. This begs for someone to come along a proof read this one."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Hard to put down. Very good, but two major weaknesses: in Shirer's intense hatred for the Nazis he makes them too clownish to have been able to accomplish what they did. Easy to understand, but better if we came to share his feelings through a more dispassionate presentation of facts - they're more than sufficient. And even near 1200 pages it needs a few more - he sometimes leaves out background that would explain how important situations came to be, especially military and industrial ones. One day Hitler takes a wild gamble against vastly superior French forces by reoccupying the Rhineland; a few months later he has the most powerful military machine in Europe making mincemeat out of Poland overnight. We know the factories were humming in violation of Versailles, but what was produced when and in what numbers isn't much explained, nor how the army was grown so rapidly. And one day there are no German troops in Italy, then suddenly they're spread around the peninsula. How they got there and when, where, how many, what types of divisions - are hardly explained. (There are better explanations of these things when Germany confronts Russia in the East and the Allies in the West.)Shirer also doesn't explain much about German developments of new military tactics and technologies, which were crucial to the Third Reich's rapid conquest of Europe (and to modern warfare generally) - these just appear with invasions and battles. Granted this is a history of the Reich, not a military history per se, but the Reich's history is as much military as anything else (though Shirer does shed interesting light on Germany's recovery from the Depression under the Nazis).Both problems are probably partly due to the book's being written so soon after the events; Shirer seems to assume his reader is an informed person who lived during the war. Valuable as it is, the book's a reminder of why historians are skeptical of writing recent history. But it's still a classic and a page-turner at that. Also Shirer, besides having been a journalist in Germany from before Hitler's rise until 1940 (or '41?), did an enormous amount of research using a wealth of primary sources. This direct experience and considerable research probably make the book a must-read, but one to be supplemented."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I was always puzzled how such a patently evil group of characters could rise to power in a cultured, accomplished nation like Germany. I've read other books such as Churchill's brilliant \\"The Gathering Storm\\" (Vol I in his personal history of the war), Hitler's Willing Executioners, and so on. Shirer's book fills in an important gap as he was present as a reporter as Hitler rose to power, and highly focussed on the events of the day, and was therefore close to the machinations of the German political system. His detailed and often personal commentary on leading characters provides the reader with some sense of what it would have been like to watch what was going on as a member of the German general public. The book is extremely well documented and he frequently notes if supporting documents for events exist. There are also excellent asides about various things, such as the possible reason why Hitler used the term Fuehrer (although it just means leader, it was also used in a boys club he enjoyed as a youth).Some people object to Shirer's descriptions of Goering's girth (whereas he didn't disparage Churchill's size) or Himmler's appearance, for example, as being unprofessional for a would-be historian. But as journalism it seems acceptable, and few would fault him for making personal remarks about these evil characters, who he often encountered in his work and despised, and indeed it added colour to the book for me. These remarks are valid descriptions, as well, and moreover frequently lend insight. Goering, in particular, had degenerated into a gluttonous character in all matters, whether that be food, jewellery, art, or clothes (there is a description by Ciano of \\"bloated, overbearing\\" [Ciano's words] Goering's boorish discussion of his jewellery over dinner, and his ridiculous furs, which remind Ciano of what a \\"high class prostitute wears to the opera\\"). There is also good reason for highlighting their physical shortcomings, sexual orientation, and perversions: the Nazis pursued eugenics and held themselves up as the master race, and often condemned others for things they hated in themselves. This is critical: As comes through strongly on every page, a preponderance of senior Nazis were arrogant, unabashed hypocrites, and were misfits of German society until they gained power via the Nazi movement.The dominant insight I got from this book was that the Nazis were pathological liars and criminals, through and through. In the language of the day, to quote Roosevelt's frequent description of Hitler (which we discover angered Hitler), they were gangsters, though of course saying that is doing a disservice to gangsters given the magnitude of the crimes. I came away from this book feeling that to comprehend their actions better I would have to know more about the psychology of the criminal mind, and of antisocial/sociopathic/psychopathic personality disorders. I am grateful to Shirer for this work."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"'The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich' may be one of the most important non-fiction books ever written. Read on to find out why.William Shirer has done the world a great service in creating this monumental work. Anyone who may continue to wonder at the presence of evil in the world would do well to read Shirer's book. The author expertly describes how evil manifested itself to produce one of history's greatest villians, Adolph Hitler. Shirer traces how Hitler became the Hitler we know today and how his twisted ideas led converts, demanded allegiance, and terrorized millions. Nearly the entire work is taken from journals, diaries, and eye-witness accounts of those who experienced the years leading to Nazi Germany and beyond. (Shirer himself was an eye-witness to many of the events recorded in the work.) This is a completely readable, comprehensive look at one of history's darkest hours.The first thing readers will encounter is the immense size of the book, nearly 1200 pages of text. Please do not be intimidated by the number of pages. They are well worth your time. Not a word is wasted. Take it in small bites.As I read the book, I kept thinking over and over of the parallels with our current situation against terrorism, and I wondered, \\"Have we really learned anything?\\" In the late 1930's, anyone who had read Hitler's \\"Mein Kampf\\" would have known exactly what the dictator planned to do to the world. He spelled it out. Either no one read it (which is doubtful), or no one took him seriously. Bin Laden also told this country what his plans were before Sept. 11. Clearly. We didn't listen then either. Of course, that's not the only parallel. There are more, and as each presents itself, the more relevant this book becomes to us today. Reading the book, you will learn that Hitler did a multitude of things expertly, but was not thorough in many of his plans. The terrorists are extremely thorough. Hitler many times did not look far enough ahead (especially with respect to Russia). The terrorists obviously plan months and years in advance. Many of Hitler's henchmen were incompetent in many areas, military and economic. It doesn't appear that incompetence is a major terrorist problem. They know what they're doing. When the time came, the United States was prepared for the Nazis of the Third Reich. May we be even more prepared for the evils that we face today. Don't fall into the trap of thinking 'The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich' is a crusty old history book that belongs on a shelf in a library. Read it now and look around you. I think you'll see that Shirer's work is frighteningly relevant."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I've wanted to read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich for fifty years and Kindle made it possible without lugging around a 10-pound book.Though some of the language and social references are dated (Shirer frequently refers to \\"homosexual perverts\\"), there's no doubt that this is powerful and compelling history, giving the most complete look at the Nazi gangster state and the way many millions of people simply let an evil genius take over their lives while millions of others gave their lives. Learning what might have been--that the German Army's general staff ALMOST overthrew Hitler before the Nazis swallowed up Czechoslovakia--is enough to break your heart. It's a cautionary tale about the rise of fanaticism for today's world, too. For the work Shirer did, five stars isn't enough.Unfortunately, the Kindle formatting leaves much to be desired. Some excerpts Shirer quotes from other texts are indented to easily signify what's going on. Most others are not, forcing some rereading to get the context right. Paragraph indentation is tiny (one character), making reading harder than it needs to be. And the \\"native\\" problem with Kindle of not being able to go back to reference something you've already read (which is important in a book as dense with facts as this one) makes this a struggle sometimes. Sure, you could bookmark, but there's no way to know when you read something the first time that you'll want to refer back to it tomorrow night. I consciously traded the ten pounds for this problem, but sometimes I wish I hadn't.Finally, this isn't escapist literature. You have to concentrate. But it's more than worth the effort."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I am a detail person, and so this book really hit the spot for me.I would listen on a hike, I would listen on a bike.I could listen in my car, I could listen in a bar.OK, I never actually listened in a bar, but I did listen pretty much anywhere and everywhere because of how much this book kept my attention, despite being over 50 hours long. The only drawback to this book is that my audible credits built up for a couple of months while I listened. William Shirer combines amazing depths of study and research with his personal knowledge and eyewitness accounts to make sense of the Third Reich and give understanding to the dynamics of it's rise and fall.Despite it's length, this book is extremely well organized and easy to follow, while at the same time the true story of Nazi Germany is woven in a way that maintains your interest from beginning to end. I have never been a history buff, but since reading this book, I am ready to learn more."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I've purchased this 1960 edition of the book. It has two maps of Europe on the inner parts of the cover: one showing the German Empire (when Hitler had conquered almost every corner of the continent) and the other map showing the paths followed by other armies to regain the control of it. This edition is really old and pages were a little yellow (as I purchased an used book), but it was in a very good condition.As many others said, this book is a masterpiece of history. The author had access to many sources of information, in addition he lived in Germany during the first year of the conflict and has many historical background and knowledge about the Germans, the way that they lived and what was like to live in Germany before the Nazi party gained the control of the people, the army and the people living there.I'm just a casual reader, and this book seems giant for me because there are around 1200 pages of text, each one well documented and with many references. I love to read historical books, and this one is the perfect description of what really happened during the war. I think of it as an encyclopedia because events are cronologically sorted and presented in a simple way, as if they were happening again.Finally, when I read this book I imagine the complete situations as described, and in a couple of pages I'm transported completely to a different country. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer developed an amazingly detailed job with his \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\". It does not only tell us about Adolf Hitler's throne of tyranny, but also about Nazism environment in terms of philosophy, ideology, doctrine, and methods. Based on original documents, this book is extensive due to the amount of detail that was put into it, and it makes this book a piece of art for studying and historical purposes. As well as Allan Bullock's \\"Adolf Hitler: A Study in Tyranny\\", the story told takes the reader to the actual locations in which events took place, gets to know the people who were involved in this reign of madness, and tries to identify the reasons that led the world to it's darkest era in the XXth century. Very recommendable work."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is nearly as astonishing as the facts themselves. The Third Reich, National Socialism and Adolf Hitler from cradle to grave: (unfortunately for humanity) a long tale told directly and comprehensively. The facts need no embellishment to captivate the imagination, and beyond the frequent sarcastic jibe at the men responsible for the upheavals (the Norwegian traitor Quisling derided as a &quot;Baltic dolt&quot;; Goering as the &quot;fat Reich Marshal&quot;), Shirer gives them none. He gives full treatment to the historical and contemporary political conditions that shaped Hitler, his followers, and the German Republic he seized, as well as European political conditions that allowed Nazi Germany's rise. Shirer's political astuteness and scholarly approach are not blended together in journalism today, but they should be. This is as well-written and interesting a historical treatise as you will find, perhaps on any subject."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich was a good book in its day, but its day has passed. Tons, literally, of documents have become available, thousands of specialist studies of various aspects of the Third Reich and the war have been written, as well as deep biographies of all the major actors. William Shirer simply did not have this information available to him. Just as one example, Shire recognized that Albert Speer was more intelligent and honest that any of the other men around Hitler, but there was no way Shire could know much about what difference this made to Hitler and the German war effort. Shirer was a journalist, not a historian. And he wrote more on the basis of what he saw that what he researched. That was about all he could do at the time.His book \\"Berlin Diaries\\" may have lasting value since he wrote it as things happened in Berlin until he had to leave. So it gives insight into how things looked to people as events occurred, which is usually very different from the dispassionate 20-20 hindsight of history."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"It is a pity this book isn't required reading for all Americans; George Bush.

This book glorifies Hitler's rise to power as a &quot;fly by night&quot; phenomenon, and insists that German nature is to blame for the rise of the NSDAP (Nazis). It forces upon you, the idea that all Germans are bad natured. For a better account, and more comprehensive account of this period, I reccomend &quot;Nazi Germany,&quot; by Klaus Fischer. Fischer's book is well document, and very accurate. Fischer gives a comprehensive review of all the social and economic reasons that contributed to the rise of this politial monster.

My dad grew up in Nazi Germany. We were not the best of friends. Yet, this was a very fascinating book to me! I bought it because I figured that Hitler was a foreurunner of the Antichrist of the Bible and maybe this book would give me insight into his character. And it did. Yet I found some strange humor in it as well.Both my dad and one of my German professors had used the expression \\"he ought to be shot!\\" before as a reference to the frequent use of firing squads in the Third Reich. There is some of that gallows humor in there. Like a description of the quaiity built crematoriums for the death camps-made with the finsest of materials and German craftsmanship! My dad always was big on German craftsmanship and efficiency. I even found myself joking with my therapist about how cool it would be to become a dictator like Hitler where I could put all my enemies into concentarion camps, have them executed and have it filmed as the master had done!I seemed to know more from that book about Hitler that my dad did. I discovered Hitler was a failed artist. My dad had tought he was a house painter. As my dad had terminal cancer and we visited once a month with him, we could talk about how he was living in Romania when Hitler invaded Russia and when they were repulsed that he and my aunt Margit had been evacuated out of Romania by Hitler. My dad was pretty tight-lipped about his childhood; yet this book actually gave us something to talk about befeore he died. What did we have in common? Quantum Theory? NOt! Bible Prophecy? NOt! We could discuss old \\"Uncle Adolph\\" as he had once called him!So, I did see a twisted sort of humor to it. Just like on a News Radio Station from the Eastern US I had heard about a man who had a custom license plate in Virginia that said ZYKLON B on it. And how the state of Virginia had the plate revoked when they found out what it was. In Shirer's book, I discovered that ZYKLON B was the chemical that IG Farben had produced which Hitler used to carry out the \\"Final Solution\\" of the Jewish problem.This book is jam packed with all kinds of trivia and interesting details. Just like I said, my dad grew up in Hitler Third Reich and did not know some ot these things!There is an interesting lesson in this book in the life of Hitler. Hitler went to Vienna to study to be a painter. They rejected his application. So, he blamed this on the Jews and made it his ambition to erradicate them from the face of the earth-The Final Solution. Or in more modern times, I had seen on TV how the woman who had prayer banned from the public schools hadd been discriminated against in church; so she did not want to make her kids have to pray in school!

If Germans massacred Jews/Slaves/Gypsies, British, too, have had many Ghosts in their closet. The British Empire systematically wiped out many so-called natives over a period of time. It may be pointed out that British engineered the Great Bengal Famine that led to the death of millions, not to speak of contriving to create Pakistan that took lives of several millions. Astonishingly, there was no Nuremberg for British Criminals like Churchill. It makes my blood boil when they talk of saving democracies, I wasn't aware that democratic forms of government was an exclusive domain of Whites! Democratic city-states existed 2000 years ago in India.Jew bashing is not an invention of the Nazi Junta, but has been festering in Germany since the Days of Martin Luther whose teachings, whinny remonstrations will chill the blood of many and HE is considered the father of Protestantism.Now I know why the Bengali Leader Netaji took the help of Nazis to get rid of the British Menace.

Or the US on some German cities!I am no way disputing the fact that many Indians toed the British line and helped them in many a scandalous endeavor where they often surpassed their masters in subjugating and exploiting their own brethren.The writer has very little to say about his own doings and thoughts during the whole period - saving it for better sales of his other book, I guess!Message to The Old Book Worm: Can you dispute any of the facts presented above? You are just a stupid Nazi, licking your dead-white skin like a street dog!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Wonderful book describing how Hitler persecuted and killed Christians--both Catholic and protestant--and how the Pope strongly condemned Hitler and Nazism.Hitler's goal was to establish a statist cult based on barbaric paganism. He loathed Christianity, and admired the violent aspects of Islam and the Japanese-style emperor worship.Atheist/Humanist/Socialist/Darwinists such as Hitler, Mao, Lenin, Stalin, Pol Pot, and others killed more people during the past 100 years than all of the so-called \\"religious war\\" in all of the previous centuries combined."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I listened to this book on audio, all 56 hours of it, and I found it rivetting from start to finish. Shirer's interest is clearly political, rather than military, and this is reflected in the balance of the book, which goes into mind-boggling detail about the early political history of the Nazi party in the early 1930s, while moving at an increasingy rapid pace through the massive subject of the second world war in its last third. As a result there were certainly times in the early parts of the book when I found myself saying to myself, \\"Come on Shirer, let's get on with it!\\" - but at the same time being unwilling to miss anything of this spellbinding listening experience. Meanwhile in the later stages I was thinking, \\"Hey, just slow down a bit!\\"Shirer was of course a working journalist in Germany throughout much of the period covered - presumably up to the time at which the USA entered the war. Perhaps it's understandable that his interest centres on the period when he was present and actively involved in the unfolding of history, and wanes a little after his enforced departure. More than anything, it is the knowledge (he refers to this frequently in the text) - that Shirer was himself present in the audience to listen to many of Hitler's speeches, and walked the streets of Berlin drinking in the public mood, which particularly brought the book to life for me.Some of Shirer's attitudes - for example towards homosexuality - may strike the modern reader as a little bit 'quaint', but probably simply reflect the period in the 1950s when he was writing. The Nazi's interactions with the Christian Church tend to be a bit glossed over - more detail on this would have been welcome.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and more importantly found myself educated by it and provoked to thought and reflection not only about the past, but also about the present and future. I recommend it strongly."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"If there was on book to read on Nazi Germany it would be William L. Shirer's, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,\\" not only did he see the rise of Adolf Hitler first hand in Germany, he was one of the only historians to gain accsess to the mountains of captured documents. His writing is so good that at times you forget your not reading a first class novel, but that it is all real, and well documented for that matter."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"a well written, easily flowing, history of hitler's riseits pretty amazing how all of the info was gathered here"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer gives an excellent account of a National Socialist Germany from its grass roots of origin to its climatic collapse. It thoroughly covers the impact Hitler had on Germany as well as the rest of the world. While incredibly well documented, it clearly gives a \\"Who's, Who\\" in the Third Reich.

Its mammoth size is a little daunting but it is highly readable. Shirer gives you all the facts without being heavy handed or boring. He also provides a relatively unique view of the inner workings of the regime being an American working inside and around Nazi Germany. One can tell that the experience affected him deeply which gives his prose a more genuine feel but never clouds his vision. A great place to learn about this horrible institution."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book gives an in depth study of the rise to power of the Third Reich and their fall into history. It only took me a few months when I was in high school to go through it; and now that I am older I find it quite a good book to refer back to when I need to point out facts in an argument."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I usually have little patience with tomes this voluminous. However, this book was an extremely interesting read. I finished it in less than a week.Although extremely informative, sections of this book are clouded by Shirer's personal opinions. He dismisses several top Nazis as buffoons which seems somewhat unbelievable."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Having read and re-read this book, I often wonder how it is possible that Germany was let off the hook so easily despite the incredible moral and physical damage which it inflicted upon human civilization. Shirer makes it abundantly clear to all that this sorry history should never, ever be forgotten, nor repeated. This book is about why so many Americans died in Europe at that time, and why Americans should feel the values behind our constitution, our democracy and our ideals of social justice."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book provides a fascinating look at the terrible war of attrition waged by Hitler and his horrific Third Reich against the very core of Western civilization and culture. It is both historically precise and masterfully written, a true historical classic. As the saying goes, &quot;Those who do not learn from the past are bound to repeat it.&quot; We should all remember and learn from this tragic period of human history so that we might not have to pay the teriible price that was charged to our progenitors. Shirer's the Rise and Fall provides the perfect backdrop."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I am a WWII fanatic. I've read an amzing amount of books on the subject, yet I've never encountered one as good as The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich.Shirer is not too harsh on the German people, like many Jewish and obviously influenced writers have been. He gives all aspects of everything and doesn't merely present the one-sided stereotype Allied view of things.It's a pity he was American. Otherwise there might have been some hope for him."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer provides an excellent first hand account of how the Nazi Regime came into power and then tracks its spectacular decline. Using his position as a journalist in Germany he explores many facets of the regime from the military to the social structures. The book is very well written and don't be deterred by its length. This is a great book to start off with if you want to learn about Nazi Germany. I found it quick to read and an essential collection to my library on the history of Nazi Germany. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I consider this the greatest history book ever written. Not just because I am Jewish. It reads like the greatest novel ever. It is surreal and more bizzare than Vonnegut or Orwell yet the events are painfully true. We watch as a seemingly highly evolved country turns itself over to the worst criminals and misfits that the world has ever known and becomes the greatest killing machine civilation has ever known. It is exciting to read as the noose tighens around the Nazi regime - you just can't wait till they are crushed into submission. I have read almost all of Shirer's books but this is the bible. I have read it three times and will surely read it again. We should never forget this part of human history - lest we relive it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Albert Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich's 1100 pages remain to this day one of the best single volume histories of Nazi Germany. The Author, who worked in journalism in Germany during the 1930's personally recorded much of what he writes but also used copious research to create a book that is both academic and journalistic. While this book is an investment of time I believe it will be well enjoyed by the reader and also provides a great resource for further reading through a fantastic bibliography. If you are looking for a book that focuses on World war two this book really might not be for you. This book is definitely more political than military but with the vast selections of combat histories and memoirs a book that solidly describes the politics that caused the Hitler's Rise to power and the political climate that caused and lasted through WWII is an important resource. The book differs vastly from other histories of this time period as it really attempts to explain the issues at several levels by describing life for the ordinary German and political Climates in England, France and other countries. This may be its best feature.Being a journalist, Shirer focuses on events more than character. While he does use character portraits to some extent in describing Ernst Roehm, Goering and of course Hitler, this book really is about dates actions and events. This does not detract as these are important to understanding history on the whole. If you are looking for a great foundation to an understanding of the third reich this is a great start"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Being a WW2 buff, I have many, many books on Hitler, the Naziesand the Third Reich.

A historical document in itself. You should own it and read it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The book provides a great overview of WWII including many good details of the workings of the Third Reich. Sometime there are too many details which gets very tedious, but otherwise the book seems thorough (although I do not know enough to say if it is all fact). There is an awful lot of opinion in the text which may alter the facts."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This was probably the very first book I read (I must have been 13 at the time) on what would turn out to be my very long and exhausting search for the truth about the man called \\"Hitler\\". This book set the standard for many others to follow. Although it is certainly not without its flaws, it is nevertheless full of important facts. It numbers among the best books on the subject and offers readers some very valuable facts about Hitler and his Reich."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"While not always written with the broader and less emotional perspective of an academic historian, there is tremendous value in reading this book. And it is very readable. The use of so much inside information is very well done. No one interested in the extreme distortions and extraordinary destructiveness of Hitler and his era should skip this book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Same gorgeous, flowing writing style as in &#34;Berlin Diary&#34;.

I found it to be just about right in detail and in covering the subject of the book. I strongly recommend it to anyone woh wants to get a feel for Nazi Germany and how Hitler came to power."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is one of a few I am reading about World War Two. Shirer's very readable volume about Hitler and Nazi Germany traces the roots of the regime up to its death. Shirer aside from extensive access to documents from the regime, recalls his own experiences living in Nazi Germany, knew several of the key players and witnessed several of the historic events detailed in the book. Thus, in some ways Shirer is a primary source. He details the influences and ideas that went into Hitler's mad plan for world dominantion. Surprisingly he detailed nearly every step of his plans in Mein Kampf years before he was able to put them into action. Hitler was a gambler and more to chance and the inattention of many good people he was able to grab nearly absolute power and most of Europe. There were numerous times where his own people, the military and other countries could have put a stop to Hitler but choose to appease him instead thus demonstrating the dangers of using this strategy in international policy. The content of the book is packed with information yet written so that you will be driven to read to the next chapter. The narrative of the book ends when theThird Reich does but when appropriate Shirer in footnotes details the various fates of notable persons. He provides a vivid picture of life under Nazism, the military triumphs, the desperate gambles and the blundering mistakes that shaped events of the war. I'd highly recommend this volume to anyone wishing to understand World War II."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is filled with information from start to finish. It's an amazing history and as far as I know the book you should read on the \\"Third Reich\\" if you only read one. It's a huge book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Put this book in a different environment and give the characters different names and it would be one of the greatest gangster books ever written. It's basically grown men player toy soldiers with real countries and real people.I cannot recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Shirer knows how to write a book. Informative, intresting, and mind blowing, Rise and Fall of the Third Reich was a great book!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is a piece of art. It is written masterly and interestingly. Shirer dips into every fact that he knew and expands on it. It recounts every bit of information from the childhood to the death of the infamous Adolf Hitler. I am 14 years old, and I loved to book so adults should love it even more. I would also suggest Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler to learn about Hitler's logic."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer's book \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" is the best book that has ever been written about Nazi Germany. Shirer meticulously researched his account. Its not short, and someone who doesn't want to take the time to get a thorough account should settle for something else.Shirer covers the rise of Naziis and explains the conditions that brought them to power. The post-war chaos from World War I had an awful effect on Germany. Although, Shirer disputes some things that are commonly spouted. For instance, he disputes that the boundaries given to Germany by the treaty of Versailles (following WWI) were inadequate. He also disputes that the entire treaty was as unfair as many Germans claimed it to be.That a rag-tag group like the Naziis could become a major political party and eventually win control of the German government is testimony to the despair that can be created by an economic depression, human stupidity/gullibility, and the effect propaganda can have. One must assign a good part of the blame for the rise of Hitler to the German upper classes and the German professional classes. Most of these people did not initially support Hitler, but they went along and did nothing to stop him.Some of the chapters in the book really stand out. The chapter on the \\"Battle of Britain\\" is fascinating reading. Its amazing how England--greatly outnumbered-- was able to hold its own against Germany for over a year before other countries joined them in the struggle. The chapter on the invasion of Russia is interesting reading as well. That Russia managed to hang on after such a massive assault is a miracle. The chapter on the death camps called the \\"New Order\\" is a detailed and sickening account of Nazi atrocities against Jews, gypsies, and people of slavic ancestry. If you read it, have a strong stomach.Shirer's book is a one volume way to educate yourself about most of World War II. Anyone interested in this subject simply cannot pass it up."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The must-have book for the European Theatre. If you want to understand WWII and its causes - this is it. Written by the greatest historian on the Third Reich and one of the greatest correspondents of the modern era. There's really nothing more to say! Get it (along with Shirer's &quot;Berlin Diary&quot;)!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Despite its heft, as of the time of this writing I am reading Rise and Fall for the 4th time. It is a compelling avalanche of information. A must read for anyone who lives in, and wishes to try to understand, the post-Nazi Germany world."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is not only a book about facts and history, but also one about conscience and morality. Granted, much has been scrutinized about the Third Reich in multiple media, whether in films, documentaries, dossiers, first hand material or novels. Yet, Mr. Shirer remains, after 40 years, one of the top authorities on what took place in Germany between 1933 and 1945.This work has become a default must-read for 20th century history scholars, high school European history students and novice World War II snoops. If it may lack in articulateness and style, it compensates in its breadth and balance of facts. A &quot;fait accompli&quot; for any research-obsessed historian."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Please IGNORE all of the 1 and 2 star reviews here. I have read them and they are completely inaccurate! This book is well worth the read. It flows smoothly and effortlessly while keeping your attention. It is difficult to put down! The author lived and worked in Germany during WWII and saw Hitler speak on many occasions. Therefore, the author was intimately familiar with what he writes about. BUY it and ENJOY!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Even though this book was written quite some time ago (1960's) it is still highly readable and an excellent overview of the Nazi regime. Shirer is an excellent writer and brings to life the origins of the Nazi movement, the war and the various German generals. Though you may have learned much from the endless media exposure to Hitler and the Third Reich, this book really is a scholarly overview written in layman's terms that will provide with interesting insights into Germany and the war. There are a few areas where the expressions are dated, but overall this book really holds up and despite its length (over 1100 pages) is a pretty quick read for such a long book. It really makes me want to learn more!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Though it took me just about as many years to finish this massive tome as it took for the actual Nazi regime to play out, I would still rank this as one of my favorite history books. And even though it is very long and detailed, it is actually written in way that is fairly well-paced and at times even highly dramatic. I doubt there will ever be as definitive a work on the whole Nazi regime as what is presented here."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I bought a used copy of this book over a decade ago, and kept in in my library as a \\"to be read\\" selection for a future date. The swastika on the binding stared out at me from my bookshelf for all those years. From time to time, I brought it down from the shelf and would put it aside, intimidated by its length. Don't be intimidated! If you are interested in reading a one volume history of Nazi Germany, start here. Much of this book reads like a series of journalist pieces of a quality you might find in the New Yorker or The Atlantic.Some criticisms: 1) this edition of the book, at least, lacks helpful maps and pictures of key figures (a shot of the dock at Nuermberg would have been nice), 2) Shirer's story is best during the \\"rise\\" years, when he was present in Germany as a journalist, and his telling of the story loses some of its color in the \\"fall\\" years (though it is never colorless), and 3) Shirer's book was finished in the 1960s, and so lacks the benefit of some more recent scholarship.None of this is to say that this is not a fascinating read and worth the investment of time. Don't be intimidated! Just pick it up and get started, you'll be drawn in too."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I prefer non-fiction books and can't imagine how I missed ths one for so many years. My mother-in-law was a member of the Hitler Youth and I've always wanted her to explain to me how the whole nazi thing happened. But she doesn't like to talk about it. And I honestly never understood how the average Wilhelm in the street didn't take action; didn't speak out. Shirer's book explained it well. They were terrified and worn out with being terrified. I'm very glad I read this book as it's helped my insight. What it also did was make me very uncomfortable with actions my current governement is pursuing now. Often the hairs on the back of my neck went up when I read how easily and subtly facism took hold of a whole country. A long read but well worth it!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The fact that at the very start of the book Shirer makes it clear that his target while writing this book is to be as objective as possible clearly highlights his maturity not onl as a journalist but also as a successful history writer. Through out the whole book Shirer makes sure that arguments are based on quotations and other sources of evidence of which there was no shortage as he had complete access to all the caputred German documents. He also acknowledges that there might be certain prejudices of his involved in the book in the way he interpreted facts. This incident too clearly highlights the fact that he took extreme care of the objectivity of his work. There are not many places in the book where one can see the author's interpretation somewhat independent because Shirer has based the vast majority of his argument on evidence. This is the most impressive characteristic of the book.However, I felt while reading the book that the author in some cases placed too much emphasis on events on the sideline although related to Nazi Germany but perhaps it was not necessary to put so much details in narrating those events. For example, the tremendous amounts of detail given to the planning of invasion of Poland and the details given about German treatment of Czekoslovakia and Austria sometimes drag down the narrative somewhat.Overall, it is a classic work on Nazi Germany and some of the evidence and quotations presented in the narative from the top Nazi officials in staggering. Sure enough, Shirer had a big advantage of being stationed in Berlin until 1940 later moving to Paris so he could examine the scene much closer than any other historian writing an account later would. However, it must be said that the placing of facts within the narrative and the expression in the book is extremely impressive. I would recommend anyone buying this book to buy 'This is Berlin' by the same author. It is not a book but a series of reports made by Shirer from Berlin for CBS and NBC in New York."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I read it somewhere as a teenager. It is long but interesting. The writer is a journalist. He has opinions, but I thought the book was a good one. It does what the title says generally. It chronicles the rise and fall of the third reich.I felt like the book sets the flavor or tone that is necessary when learning about such a thing. I also suggest Inside the Third Reich by Albert Speer and Order of the Death's head, which is about the rise of the SD and SS. Between the three of them I feel like I have more knowledge than most about Nazi Germany. I would guess so would anyone that read these three books.This book is long. I read all three books over the course of maybe five years. I was in no hurry. Each of these books leaves a lasting impression to say the least.I would argue that a focus on power is the right way to go. There are plenty of mindless racists around. Hitler and his peers were able to sieze power and nearly take over the world. There are many reasons to be informed about these people and people like them. Thank you for your time and enjoy the book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I am not a big historian or student of any means, but just a regular dude who knows how to read. :-) I mention this because some historical books tend to be so out of order and full of dates that skip back in forth through the years that you can't remember what happened the last time you read about that year. However, for those of you who have an interest in the Hitler- Nazi years but do not want to get a boring history book than this is the book to get. This book just flows very easily and you will not find yourself lost after every other page. It is very entertaining and in an easy to follow cronological order so that you might actually remember some of the dates. A great read; full of important and useful knowledge. Some people say that Shirer is biased! Biased against or for who? To me, he just seems to be telling a story as he sees it backed by plenty of documentation and even first hand knowledge. I don't see the &quot;bias&quot; point of view. Anyway, a great book for all who can read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Shirer compares to Gibbon in the process of detailing of an empire. Gibbon drew on historical research to write about Rome. Shirer was there on the spot to write about Nazi Germany. This history details why Germany was susceptible to the rise of the nazis, and their subsequent rise to power, their trampling of all opposition, and the inevitable road to war. A fantastic read for someone who wants to know why the second world war happened."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"A full, in-depth examination of the historically-stunning existence of the Third Reich. This book gives a tremendously-detailed and well-annotated insight into Hitler, his psyche and rise to power. If you want to know as much as possible about this topic, read this book. If you are looking for more of a summary, pass it by. I believe this book would be fully appreciated by those who have an understanding of Machiavellianism and an interest in the sordid world of calculating human behavior and politics. The book does not go into great detail on the specific military campaigns. It is more about the way the Nazis operated and is a must-read for anyone who is a student of 20th-century history. Basically, I wish all adults would read this book to realize the dangers of hate that can repeat themselves."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Although this book is one and a half thousand pages long, it still can be described as a general overview of the most fateful time in human history. This book is well written, informative, and easy to understand; however, it is not very objective. The author clearly has a bitter anti-German bias, which sometimes results in utter sarcasm. Although he sights his sources with amazing detail, he often puts a negative spin on many Germans, particularly the Generals of World War II, making them look like bumbling cowards. Still, anyone who reads this book will not regret the experience, and will become a better person for the knowledge which they have gained."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Despite its length and density (the author devotes almost 200 pages just to the month before the Germans invaded Poland), this is a fascinating book. Well written and still up-to-date, though from today's perspective it contains the occassionally &quot;politically incorrect&quot; phrase, such as when Shirer refers to the &quot;perverts and queers&quot; that populated Hitler's inner circle and the Nazi party. Nevertheless, this is wonderful history and required reading for anyone interested in the World War II era--a time still resonating and still influential on the world today."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer is the &quot;poster-boy&quot; for his age of reporting. He delivers hard facts and keeps the atmosphere of the time period in perspective. That's what makes his book &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,&quot; a page turner. Eventhough some Germans have described Shirer's book as being one-sided, he allows us to view the world through his journalistic ventures into Nazi Germany and to political strategy in Churchill's England."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a very informative and reliable account of the Nazi regime and the rule of Adolf Hitler. The book is very interesting, but it is also very long and detailed. One could read it several times and still gain new information each time read. In order to understand and gain the most from the book it helps to have some prior knowledge of German history during this time period, however, Shirer does a good job of giving the necessary background information, so one can appreciate why events unfolded as they did. This makes for a most interesting reading experience. In sum the book was not only informative, but also it made me appreciate the many facets of life during the Nazi Era."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book gives us a great insight into the working of the Nazi government, the personalities in it and its dealings with other countries. It is extremely detailed and leaves out nothing."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is a \\"must read\\" for any one. I just finished listening the audio book and I am still reflecting on it. However, I can already report that it shook my worldview.Also note, the audible edition is very good."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I bought this book when it first was published, because Shirer was a highly regarded journalist/expert on Germany before and during WWII. I had such a high opinion of the book after reading it then that I bought it in the Kindle version when I saw it on the Amazon list. My Kindle says it was published in 2011, but I first read it in the 1950's or 60's. It was a thick, heavy book but easy to read and very factual.This book gives the best description I have seen of the development of Hitler's mind and the formation of his twisted ideas and the ingredients of his rise to power. It removes him from a slightly comic--and very deadly--tyrant to an almost inevitable product of the period between the wars. This book will not tell you everything about WWII, but, in my opinion, you cannot fully understand the war without reading it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"One cannot claim to understand the terror of Nazism until they have read this book. Shirer does a magnificent job of examining the rise of Hitler, arguably one of the most evil men who ever lived. He was so astute in gathering like minded evil men to his inner circle while convincing the German people to accept him as their leader--while the rest of Europe and the US failed to recognize the magnitude of the threat until it was too late. This book comes as close to answering both the \\"how\\" and \\"why\\" questions of the rise of Nazism. The author keeps us in constant suspense as the Brown Shirts rise and fall, the SS comes to prominence, and Hitler comes to power supported by a disgracefully servile military leadership. The political and diplomatic treachery that follows is mind boggling. It is shameful to note that the German people supported Hitler all the way, even to the end! A very worthwhile reading effort!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The Long Night is a very powerful nonfiction book. The plot concerns Hitler's rise to power and the destruction that ensued after. Shirer, the main character, was the only reporter who reported every brutal event. He was one of the few not to fall for Nazi propaganda while still remaining (for a little while) in Germany and among the soldiers and Nazi elite. The author has the ability to make the events appear as if they are occurring right when the reader is reading about them. The atmosphere and permeating fear and horror is tangible, as is the desperation.Shirer is an admirable character to read about. He reported his findings accurately, much to the chagrin and impending threats by the Nazi party. He advocated early warnings about the true intentions of the Nazi party and he stayed for as long as possible in the heart of the chaos. The reader will grow close to Shirer while reading this novel and share his hopelessness and need for the truth to be known. Shirer and the reader both will feel increasingly disparaging towards powerful leaders and the people who should have listened and taken into consideration Shirer's reports. A history buff and the average nonfiction reader will devour this nonfiction book.*Complimentary copy received for this review, does not affect my opinion in any way*"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This superbly readable account is one of the great works of history. Journalist William L Shirer (1904-1993) touches nearly all bases, including politics, Gestapo terror, diplomacy, economics, propaganda, war, etc. The author begins by examining the obscure Nazi party in the early 1920's, then desribes its rising influence with the onset of the Great depression. Soon Hitler and the Nazi's were able to grab total control over Germany (and destroy the Weimar Republic) by a combination of politics, Gestapo arrests, and murder. Readers see how re-armament reduced joblessness, the improved economy leading many ordinary Germans to view Hitler's odious regime as national saviors. Then, of course, we read about the devastating war that Hitler launched in 1939, leading to the deaths of tens of millions, plus the holocaust against the Jew and Gypsies (plus other undesireables). Finally, the pages end with the utter destruction of Nazi Germany as the Allies closed in from all sides.William L. Shirer was a correspondent in Nazi Germany from 1934-1940, and he used hundreds of captured Nazi government documents to write these stellar pages. The result is a partly eye-witness, partly historical, thoroughly superb volume. Not that it's flawless; Shirer name-calls top Nazi thugs he knew and detested, and his coverage ranges from excellent (politics, diplomacy) to merely adequate (military history, the holocaust). Still, this superb best-seller captured a national book award, and is so readable in its 1,000+ pages that it has sold well over 20 million copies.This book made professional historians jealous and led many others to believe that Shirer was Jewish (actually, he was a Protestant Christian). Even many that typically avoid books of history have read this engrossing volume from end to end. You should too."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is an amazing book. For someone who only knew at a cursory level of the events of WWII I had always wanted to know more. This book follows Hitler and his Generals and field marshals and his life closely and explains it all clearly also citing actual documentation along the way. It's not too over stuffed with statistics or heavy data, its simply a clear concise and easy to read journey from start to finish of the third reich. There are many situations where eye witnesses describe exactly the situation, such as when the Army staff attempted to murder hitler. (** I agree with one critic that the Kindle version has some misgivings with the references slightly confusing at the end of chapters, but the book is so good I was happy to put up with that. Overall it would be better to read the hard copy version - which you then have to lug around with you !!)"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is very long, but it is very good. If you want to know almost everything about Germany in Hitler's lifetime; this is the source.

Anyone with a taste for accuracy in details will fall in love with this masterpiece."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book needs no review really as it has already been done in the hundreds. It was written in the 1950's and is known to millions. I was born not long after the end of the war but never really understood or knew the truth about Hitler, his philosophy, why he did what he did or why the war was started. For those of us with parents who lived during the war, we may not have known anything because our parents couldn't bear to talk about it. So here is this book with everything you need and want to know. I read Shirer's 'Berlin Diary' which is riveting, so this was an obvious read. The book was known to me of course, but I had always felt it would not be to my taste and be dry and boring. Not so. Buy it if you want the down and dirty, if you want to know what made Hitler click, if you want to understand. If I had the energy, I'd read it all again. Shirer was a wonderful writer and lives it all for you. A GREAT read."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Everyone should read the Rise and fall of the third Reich. The 1200 pp were perhaps too detailed however accurately took the reader through 1936-1945. It is a lesson of how efficient a dictator can be contrasted to a naieve and complacent democracy. An evil leader can find sufficient evil followers to eliminate the opposition having no moral conscience as to how it is done. It is also a picture of the power of speech. Hitler had no accomplishment in life however he could excite a mass audience with speech. Mob rule quickly becomes a powerful tool. The book is important alerting us to evil people using propaganda methods to remove freedom. Germany was suffering from the results of World War One and quickly caved in to promises even while watching millions being slain, mostly Jews. Lynn in Jacksonvile OR"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This should be required reading for everybody. It's a chilling reminder of what will happen when people don't stand up for others against tyranny: eventually that tyrant will turn on you. Reading the book, you feel what the author felt while experiencing WWII first hand, then researching the secret NAZI documents for a decade. You start wary, then outraged, then unbelieving, then I hit a point where things just seemed so ridiculous that they were sardonically funny, then incrediably sad and tired. You pity the German people for having been duped by a sweet voiced liar. You pity Chamberlain for being so naive while wanting such a noble goal. You pity the small states around Germany capitulating (sometimes after bravely fighting) to a vastly superior force. You even pity the ineffectual Italian forces under the Duce. And most of all you pity the horrors that the people who lived under Hitler's reign experienced. A short passage of NAZI documents that coolly describe how little Jewish childrens' grandparents tried to soothe the kids before they all faced execution was something that people shouldn't be allowed to forget."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is a must read for anyone living on the planet earth. An incredibly well researched and well written documentation of one the most compelling chapters in world history. Don't believe in monsters? You will after reading this book.

Read this book....it will take a while, but well worth it!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Some what terse in details near the end of the book. specifically regarding the russian armies in approaching Berlin. On another note some detail lacking on the Italy campaign and German army in the budapest sector."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is a \\"must read\\" for any person interested in understanding how the German people fell for what became to be the worst criminal in the history of the world and also is a lesson on how politics can ruin a nation."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This was one of the first books I ever really read about Nazi Germany and is still my favorite. Shrirer has a way of captivating the reader with the facts and detailed story line. Although it was written before the Berlin Wall fell and therefore doesnt have completely rounded off ideas I would still say that it is 97-99% accurate in its details and explanations.Shrirer traces Hitler from childhood throughout his adolesence and then through to his death with vivid accounts from his closest friends. All of his triumphs and mistakes. Tracking back somewhat into the origin of the nazi doctrine through philosophers and professors Shrirer gives a decent picture of how the National Socialist doctrines came about. There is one chapter dealing with the \\"Final Solution\\" and I wish he would have done more with that, but it was still satisfying.This history, written by a man who experienced it first hand, is excelently written and an amazing read. I have read many other Nazi and WWII books and this is still easily my favorite. A recomended read for anyone.One caution I give is that Shrirer has a very profound and broad vocabulary; you may, at times, need a dictionary.Pick it up and read it, its great."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I had put off reading this book being intimidated by the length. I also feared that it would be extremely dry and boring. I'm happy to say that it was neither of those. This is very well researched and very well written. You get a real sense of all the history before during and a little after. It put so much of what I had already read into perspective. If you read nothing else about this time period, read this book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Though this book was written 50 years ago or so, it is still compelling. Written by someone who was there, a trained journalist, who witnessed the rise of Hitler and the Nazis. It is a very personalized account. Though much has been written on this subject, this book is still must reading for anyone who is interested in this pivotal period of time. We still live with some of the results of this war."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I think the highest praise you can give a book is stating that you had a hard time putting it down. That's certainly the case here. Shirer puts you at the scene of some of the most secretive and important meetings between Hitler and his staff, and between Hitler and the leaders of other countries. You get a chance to experience the mind of Hitler, how he operated, and how he treated others. This is possibly my new favorite book. I spent many late nights reading this book and lost sleep because I simply couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"From beginning to end this is an outstanding work. Extremely well documented, thanks to the extensive files left by the Nazi leaders. It is not an easy read, but a must for anyone looking for an accurate and detailed history of Nazi Germany and that time in world history.I remember WWII as a child reading the newspaper and watching the newsreels in the movie theater. I listened on the radio to Edward Murrow describing the marching of the German soldiers through Paris. After 70 years my memory of that period in history is still strong."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I first off want to say this book is amazing in terms of its sheer volume of knowledge. It is just packed with information. Despite its length it is not a dull book at all in my opinion.The only problem I have with this book is it seems to portray the classic stereotype of the soviets having essentially unlimited manpower from the empire to draw from. I don't think it really gives the germans enough credit for how close they really were to beating the soviets. The author can be a little anti german in his views(can u blame him?) and somewhat overestimate the soviets power.Other than that this was a great book. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is hard to get started in but once you get the characters defined it is easier reading. I had fogotten a lot about Hitler's rise to power. It is hard not to make a comparsion to our own events that are happening in this country. It seems that history does repeat itself every so often. The more yuou kknow about history the more it seems that we never learn the lessons from previous history. A must read!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Shirer's book is an engrossing history of the Second World War with exceptional coverage of the political and diplomatic events that shaped the war. It is Shirer's focus on the conduct of nations and their diplomatic machinations that distinguishes this history from the crowd of World War 2 books and makes this a must read. The flaw is Shirer's racism regarding the German people and his failure to recognize that the evil of The Third Rich was a universal human condition. The lessons of world history, of which the Third Reich is a incomparable example, is that the centralization of power and the subjugation of the individual to the state is a universal recipe for the eventual abuse and degradation of the individual. In Shirer's 1990 \\"Afterword\\" he still insist in asking, \\"Have the Germans Changed?\\" and \\"Is there a solution to the German problem?\\" Shirer's racism will appear throughout the book, and while that clearly detracts from the objectiveness of the narrative, the book remains a must read."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I don't have a whole lot to say in this review other than that the rise and fall of Nazi Germany is one of the most intriguing and horrific events in history and this book brings together the findings of objective and thorough research.

The author lived through the days of the Third Reich and then spent lots of time sifting through a large mountain of important papers to get the history right."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"A pretty meaty book to plow through, but full of insights into Nazi Germany and the Fuhrer in his prime and during his decay. Fascinating book about the most wonderful country on Earth during it's darkest period of history."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is the first history of WWII book that I've read so I can't really compare it to anything. One of the first things about this book, as the title suggests it only focuses on the Third Reich. Other countries are introduced only as the pertain to Nazi Germany (so for example stuff like the bombing of Hiroshima are completely absent), so I'll have to get a more complete WWII book after this. At 1200 pages though, I'm not sure it would be worthwhile to expand the scope of this book.The book itself it is excellent. Shirer is a journalist and not a historian, I've seen some complaints from historians about some of his conclusions, but he was a journalist living in Germany during the Third Reich so you gain some personal insight and he also writes very well and is entertaining (something you might not get with a true historian). Shirer covers from Hitler's birth (born Adolf Schicklgruber), childhood, to his rise to power. One thing which was surprising to me is just how much aggression Hitler got away with before the Allies finally declared war.As I read this, I sort of had mixed feelings about Hitler. On one hand he was a great orator, was able to unite a nation and have them follow his plans. Germany seemed powerful easily conquering nation after nation. Part of me kind of respected them and their might, although Hitler got a little overconfident which finally lead to his and his nation's downfall. On the other hand, one looks and sees Hitler as a maniacal dictator, the Nazi terrorized anyone who stood in their way, but those things were nothing compared to his final solution. Millions of innocent people were systematically murdered and in the end The Third Reich goes down as having preformed some of the worst atrocities mankind has known. When I think for a second on those facts, any respect I barely started to have for Hitler is quickly lost and in the end, Hitler is mostly remembered as one of the most vile people to have ever lived."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I liked this book because it is factual. The author did remarkable research. I would recommend this to anyone who lived through the second world war, or anyone who would NOT want another war."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Everyone should know the mistakes/atrocities of the past so that we know that we should never allow them to be repeated and Shirer illuminates that period with detailed information from diaries, journals and confidentional information preserved in records kept by the Third Reich."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I am not usually a history buff, but Shirer really brought to life the events of WWII Germany - the highs, the lows, and everything in between. Through colorful & descriptive narration, Shirer puts the reader at the scene, to experience the history of Nazi Germany during the time of the war, as if the reader were actually there. The book is thorough, thus the many pages, but it is definitely worth the read!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"As a journalist stationed in Germany prior to U.S. entry into WWII, Shirer had the unique opportunity to interview many of the country's military and civilian leaders before and following the war. That, plus access to Nazi secret archives, gave the author an insider's perspective on the chilling events that led to Germany's ultimate destruction. Hitler may have built the autobahns, but the evil nature of his mind is clear when he repeatedly assures leaders of other countries that they have nothing to fear from Germany while simultaneously ordering his generals to prepare attack plans. One must re-read this book occasionally, lest one forget how egomaniacs worm their way into political power, here and abroad."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is not your average bedtime read. It will take many sessions to wade through its eleven hundred plus pages, but is well worth the effort to understand the forces that led to World War II and the reslting balance of power that lasted for nearly fifty years.The hour by hour account of events leading up the the final declaration of war gives a fascinating insight into the fevered and devious mind of Hitler. The lily-livered behaviour of Chamberlain blandly \\"giving away\\" Czechoslovakia, again in a blow-by blow account rings down the ages as an all-time act of high-handed self-interest and sheer stupidity on the part of Neville Chamberlain.If Shirer is perceptive then also he is fair-minded and gives credit where it is due. References and footnotes are complete, almost to the point of tediousness, but will be a rich source for students and historians. Of interest to the everyday reader is the familiarity with historic figures and events from someone who was there observing throughout.A star is sacrificed for some rather odd digitalizing for the Kindle -- a random sprinkling of commas and capitals and no page numbering. This last particularly onerous in a work of this length and beware not using the bookmark when checking references or footnotes -- you may never find your spot again!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"&#34;The Rise and Fall of the third Reich&#34; -William L. Shirer. Amazing how Hitler, through observation, manipulating, conniving, deceiving, broken promises, was able to build Germany to the power it became. Hitler knew the weakness of other nations and used them to his advantage without bloodshed. That is, until he confronted Poland, the only small country that stood firm to his demands. Thus the beginning of the Second World War. Anyone interested in history should read this book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is exceptional in its scope, depth of analysis and historical perspective. The subject is horrific, but Shirer writes brilliantly and knowledgeably. It is the authoritative work."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book was written by an eye witness to its story and takes you along with him as he moves around Europe throughout the war and its aftermath in a way no classroom teacher ever could. While long and detailed it never bogs down or becomes heavy except with the most authentic facts from the regime. Due to the capturing of the Nazi files the context is rich in detail and personal accounts which are chilling. 800 pages never flew by so quickly and so readably."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Since this book is so well known i will keep this short. If you are a reader of history; if you are interested in how a society can fall off of a cliff; if you are interested in a cult of personality; if you are interested in learning and knowing about the single most influential event in modern history then this is for you.If you are mostly interested in military strategy, battles and field maneuvers then this book may leave you wanting; but just a little.Yes at times the book is too long (for me too much time spent on failed assasination attempts on Hitler) and yes at times Mr. Shirer conjectures his own thoughts on what may have been but, all things considered, this is as good as it gets in terms of the history of Nazi Germany."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"History does repeat itself! Anybody interested in military history who may be concerned about the rise of tyranny should read this book. We should all understand the great lie, and how a political movement can come to power by fooling the people."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The edition that I own of William Shirer's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich advertises that the book is one that \\"shocked the conscience of the world.\\" I saw this mainly as an indication of what the book must have meant to a public that might not have been as familiar with the crimes of the Nazis and, well, accustomed as we are today to frequent and thoughtless analogies; from goofy Mel Brooks Hitler parodies to the Soup Nazi, as a society we seem to have digested this period of human history as just that, a period of history, distant and with little relevance.I think we may be doing a disservice to ourselves. I don't mean to say that this terrible period should not be the subject of humor and satire -- it must! -- but having now completed Shirer's enormous book, I am beginning to think that we are forgetting too much.It's easy to say that, for example, the tea-baggers calling Obama Hitler and comparing the health care bill to the Final Solution are out-of-bounds, an example of overheated rhetoric. But in a way, saying that these kinds of comparisons \\"go too far\\" really doesn't go nearly far enough. And it may upset some of the more bloodthirsty liberals as well to hear that, yes, even doing a Bush or Cheney-to-Hitler comparison is way, way off base.Let's not even deal with the Obama/health care comparisons; they make no sense in the least. But the Bush/Cheney comparisons usually stem from the idea that the Bush team was imperialistic, hungry for the resources of other nations, and mainly heartless about who it hurt in its quest for power. Fine. All of that was true of Hitler. But it's also true of just about every other imperial power in human history. You can't be imperial unless you build an empire. You can't build an empire unless you take someone else's territory. You usually can't do that without committing -- or at least sincerely threatening -- unthinkable violence.But we use Hitler and Nazism as the standard of human evil for good reason. The Holocaust might be the most evil, horrific event of our species' history even if had been merely a mass extermination -- but it was not the first nor the last genocide, not the first or last slaughter of millions, that humans have known. The Holocaust was that plus, if it can be imagined, several additional levels of cruelty; the starvation, the slavery under unimaginable conditions, the insane medical experiments, the sadism of the Nazi captors, and the raw industrialism of the killing -- rounding up the populations of already-rotted-out villages and systematically executing whole neighborhoods and families at once, forcing the soon-to-be dead to jump into pits filled with their dead neighbors and relatives before they themselves were murdered.And when all was lost for the Third Reich, it was not enough to lose the war. Had Hitler had his way in his final days and hours, the entirety of Germany would have crumbled with him, as he ordered every aspect of German life -- stores, waterworks, utilities, factories -- destroyed so there would be nothing left for the Allies to take. As horrifically as he had treated his enemies, he was about to let the same happen to his own \\"superior\\" people for no other reason than pride.Perhaps it's not worth trying to figure out whether anyone in human history was \\"worse.\\" I'm no historian by any means. There are probably men and systems that were more evil but had less opportunity to do such harm (I don't put it past the likes of Al Qaeda or the regime in North Korea to behave so madly and cruelly given the means to do so), and those who may have done more damage and caused more suffering, but are not remembered in the same way. But trivializing the terror that was Nazism in our daily parlance, to use the imagery as something applicable to our current politics is to forget. It's to forget the tens of millions who not only died because of Hitler and his henchmen, but to forget the deep, unspeakable suffering of all those who found themselves beneath the Nazi boot.And it is to forget what it is that brought Nazism to the forefront of German life. It is instructive that Hitler never succeeded in some violent takeover of Germany, despite attempts to do so. In the end, Hitler achieved power through \\"official\\" channels, bit by bit gaining the approval and acquiescence of the government and institutions, and bit by bit exploiting a frustrated and angry populace by stoking its rage, its fears, and its pride. Shirer himself, in a 1990 edition of his 1960 book, wondered whether a then-newly-reunified Germany might be ripe for another similar episode. 20 years later, his fears have not come true. Not there, anyway.But he was right to be watchful. To trivialize the Third Reich today is to lose sight of how it could happen again, not in the Obama-is-Hitler sense, but in the sense of a charismatic person or persons taking advantage of a weakened and frightened public and a spineless government, and doing things in their name that they did not think human beings were capable of. It can happen again, but if we don't learn the right lessons from history, we'll miss it. And it will be too late.All that said, do your brain a favor and take the big chunk of time you'll need to read Shirer's book. Learn something, why don't you."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is journalistically interesting, and that describes both its strengths and its weaknesses. This is not history - it is journalism. There's a difference. Shirer was a journalist and this book is a compendium of his impressions while working in Berlin during the 1930s. Like much journalism, it manages to be entertaining, but is essentially shallow. For depth, I would suggest Hitler's 30 Days to Power by Henry Ashby Turner, or Hubris, by Ian Kershaw. For the casual reader, this may be sufficient, but it is a light read."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Overall, this is an excellent, highly-interesting account of Hitler's Germany, from the early days of the nazi party in the 1920s to the holocaust inflicted upon Germany by the anglo-american and russian forces. I do not mention the Jewish holocaust inflicted by the Germans because Shirer himself doesn't really mention them.And that, I must say, is one of the big problems of this otherwise splendid read. Several aspects of Nazi history are given huge spans of pages and examined in minute detail -- such as the July 20 plot against Hitler, and the wheelings and dealings at Munich in 1938, and yet one of the biggest reasons for the NSDAP's existence -- the eradication of jewish people and their nearly succeeding in achieving this goal, is hardly mentioned.Also, even though this book is hardly ever boring, provided you read it a chapter here, a chapter there (because if you try to read it straight through it will get tedious), the author's continuous, heavy-handed opinions on the facts (are they really all facts?) come off as being rather unprofessional. For example, Shirer blithely dismisses Joseph Goebbels as a \\"stupid man\\" (see the chapters on the July 20 plot). While I recognize in full the evil of the nazi propoganda minister's character, to write him off as a moron is irresponsible. We all know Dr. Moriarty is evil. We all know Dr. Goebbels is evil. But to dismiss either the fictional Sherlock Holmes villain or Dr. Goebbels as an imbecile demonstrates a lack of research at worst, or at the very least a lack of historical objectivity.Even if a person dislikes another person, one must \\"know his man\\" if he is to deal with him. We all know Hitler made a lot of mistakes and committed many crimes. But Shirer here goes out of his way to constantly refer to Hitler as a clown. Evil? Yes. Flawed? Yes. Criminal? Oh yes. Moron? Yes and no.It is Shirer's refusal to examine objectively how Hitler repeatedly outbluffed and outsmarted the world (as in NO, he's not a moron) in addition to examining how Hitler foolishly declared war on the world's biggest power's and was in possession of a lot of discredited racial/political/religious theories (and now hitler enters moron territory).Shirer's refusal to examine with a historian's eye the strenghts of the third reich's villains makes him come off as trying a little too hard to emphasize to the reader that he hates the nazis.Relax, Shirer, no one's going to call you a hitler-lover if you don't call him a fool every two pages, or if you refer to Ribbentrop (the same Ribbentrop who had Molotov crawling in 1939) as a blithering idiot of a wine salesman every time he's looked up from the index at the back of the book.No one's going to blame you -- who had the gall to socialize with the nazis for decades -- for allowing hitler to remain in power, though you constantly defame nazi generals who couldn't bring themselves to murder their commander in chief in wartime.Oddly enough, this book spends exorbitant page space in which the \\"German character\\" is given a thorough schellacking, as though it is intrinsic for German people to want war and to hate the French and to be a vigorous, jealous, bellicose people -- which Shirer implies makes their actions almost understandable if not forgivable, and yet Shirer doesn't seem to examine the tenuous sense of duty and order -- however perverted and exploited -- that prevented German generals from assassinating Hitler.For someone who spent so much time hobknobbing with nazi bigwigs (why didn't YOU murder hitler, herr shirer?) Shirer ought to have known the absolute sense of terror pervading over the German people lest they say the wrong word or make a wrong move. Everyone knew that it would be a Gestapo cellar for them and a firing squad for every member of their family and friends.Would you commit murder, no matter how justified, if you knew your wife, children, relatives, and friends would be hunted down and tortured for your act? Maybe you would, for the good of humanity, or maybe you wouldn't. It's a huge decision and Shirer ought to have explored more the German psyche as to why they could not successfully kill Hitler with conditions prevaling in Germany.Shirer seems to want to reader to think the generals loved hitler while the third reich succeeded and stuck with him until the end because at the core they believed everything he believed. He wasn't there, and he isn't inside their heads, so he should just state the facts and leave his opinions for himself."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"It was with much hesitation that I began reading this book several years ago. I had been forewarned that it was well written, but that it alone was responsible for creating much of the historical myth surronding Hitler's Germany and the rise of National Socialism. Many critical points and assumptions in Shrier's book have been questioned and re-evaluated. If their was any single flaw concerning this book it would be that it attempts to report the facts, but on occasion delivers myth. The notion of black-shirted &quot;boogie men&quot; saw it's embryonic formation with Shirer's work. Their are many other authors, such as David Irving who have strived to report and record the truth as it happened. Irving, unlike Shirer, manages to give us a pragmatic, sobering analysis of Hitler and his Party, and the war years, without the exssesive speculation and drama...which leads me to my last point; Shirer's book is well written and is a pleasure to read and I suppose that is it's main appeal. You can tell Shrirer strived for sense of continuity and rhthym throught the chapters. It almost reads like a piece of fiction. Unfortunately, Shrirer sacrificed objectivity and good old fashioned research in the process."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Shirer's book is an engrossing history of the Second World War with exceptional coverage of the political and diplomatic events that shaped the war.

As a well documented eye witness account, it has merit. As a serious attempt at providing a useful history of the Third Reich it has many flaws. The book is poorly written notwithstanding comments to the contrary. It is full of incorrect grammar not least of which is an eccentric misuse of puncutation that persistently obfuscates the author's meaning. Shirer is overly concerned with pendantic details related to translation issues, which have no usefulness to the general reader. The book lacks balance. The event of paramount significance for the Nazis was, of course, the holocaust. Shirer deals with the holocaust in a scant few pages, while following that with a long discourse on the failed attempt to kill Hitler in July 1944. On balance the holocaust far outweighs the significance of the failed and futile effort to rid the world of Hitler through assassination, which would simply have made him a martyr to his followers. Shirer's view of the Nazi leaders is quite clouded. Perhaps this is an unfair crticism for someone who lived in Germany and saw it first hand, but his antipathy really clouds his judgement. His disparagement of the capabilities of Joseph Goerbels, for example, are laughable. For any history to have usefulness, it must appeal to it's intended audience. On that level, The Rise and Fall...is a brilliant success. To be truly useful, however, it must help the reader to understand the what, why and how of events. Shirer did not understand what he witnessed. The readers of his book, who rely only on this resource for their understanding, will remain as confused and puzzeled as Shirer himself."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"With many pointing out the parallels between the Bush administration and fascism, I decided it was time to read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. The book was surpringingly readable. The story was presented in such a way that it was possible to keep track or the many players.Perhaps the most painful part of the book was the confiscation of Germany's neighbors prior to the war, knowing that Hitler had laid out his plan in Mein Kampf and was sticking to the script. Hadn't anyone in Foreign Office read Mein Kampf? I can understand the fear of another war following the slaughters in WWI, but Hitler's game plan should not have been a mystery at the time. For this reason, every American should be familiar with The Project for the New American Century."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"A definitively balanced account of WWII in Europe has not yet been written. Are we to believe that all Germans of this era were sociopaths, or that 6,000 Jews were gassed daily at Auschwitz, requiring over 340 tons of human remains to be cremated and disposed of per day? As you read this book keep in mind that the evidence and motivations on all sides are just beginning to crystalize in the historical record. Many aspects of this epic history were not ready to be accurately told at its 1959 publishing, as Mr. Shirer appears to have been content to let the propagandists fill-in many of the blanks."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Although certainly full of detail, this epic account of the Third Reich is often tedious and uninteresting."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is a detailed history of the Nazification of Germany during the 1920s and 30s.

Hitler was a conniving character.2. West was filled with appeasers and had no stomach to stand up to Hitler.3. Hitler was a gambler in the battlefront and most of German successes was because of luck\\\\posturing.4. Hitler's luck ran out in Russia where he expected Russians to lay down and surrender but Stalin had other plans.5. Even until the last minute before becoming the chancellor Hitler could muster only 40% of German vote. Only when he took over power he went on a rampage of all established parties and starting getting 99% votes.Overall a very good book and gives an overview of the political side of the WW2."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is recommended for anybody who wants to read the inside story of the rise and fall of Hitler and Nazi Germany. Although World War Two itself is covered extensively on television and in books, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich covers everything that happened during \\"the rise.\\" Fascinating look at how Europe, and particularly Germany functioned before and during WW2."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"If your looking for a book full of history and a book that goes in depth of the subject this book is for you. It's a long book and it is worth reading for history sake but not one I'd be willing to read again. I found the history about the Nazis interesting and this book tells you how it started and how it ended. There is a lot of information I don't think the average person would even know in this book and I found I learned a lot from reading it. If it were not so long I'd probably read it again. Worth the time and money just not one I'd read again."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"a must read, seriously, if you have eyes, a brain, and a heart, jewish or not, veteran or not, current member of the armed forces or not. this is a must read for everyone"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"thank you for selling me this product in great shape as you said you would. i also received it quickly.thank you"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"A sobering outlook behind the truth of global politics. You will read an excerpt of almost every major correspondence between both great leaders (famous and infamous) and their ambassadors.In my own personal opinion I found that this book unknowingly throws the appeasement theory right out the window (the author is a big fan of appeasement) and shows that Britain, France and the United States were all playing cards at the same table as Adolph Hitler himself...and possibly still are. But that is my opinon.If you are noromally not interested in historical documentary, the part about Hitler changing the Bible's pages to the pages of Mein Kampf seem that they should be most engaging to almost any reader of any faith. We see how important money and desparation become as factors in making deciscions in times when our livelihood is tested. The author also illustrates how times of strife can be easily empower darker forces to control large groups of people through simple repititious hoax. The German economy was just beginning to recover, but it was simply not fast enough for the uneasy and outright angry mob of working class citizens of the time, who believed every bit of propaganda the German gov't staged in order to keep them angry."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"THIS BOOK HAS GOT ALL THE IMPORTANT INFO., IF YOU WANT JUST ONE BOOK ABOUT THIS SUBJECT THEN GET THIS ONE!, HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer provides a detailed book sure to fill the needs of any historian or person that is interested in this period of time.

The brutality of the reign of ADOLF HITLER is vividly described. The strategies of NAZIS, their personal agendas are all well described."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The information that is unveiled in book is unbelievable. The hours of college work and classes dealing with Nazi Germany doesn't hold a candle to the information that is in Shirer's book. The Background information shows how easily Hitler could rise to power. From the formation of the Republic to the rise of the Nazi Party to total domination by Hitler to the Fall of Hitler, Shirer describes each event with passion and factual information. He, without a doubt, has done the best and in my opinion the only work on Nazi Germany"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I found Shirer's book very entertaining to read as i did his Berlin Diaries, but not too useful as a historical source. After all, Shirer was a journalist by trade rather than a historian. It tells a pretty good story (with some exaggerations here and there) and is a great who-is-who book of the Nazi era too. If you are interested in the history of this period it is a good introduction, but do consider looking at other sources before you make up your mind about some of the topics."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I have just finished reading this book. The historical facts are fascinating. Mr. Shirer lays out everything in chronological order with a great detail of facts and background. My only criticism is that he imparts too much of his personal opinion into the book. No doubt that Mr. Shirer must have seen, first hand, and uncovered in his research very horrifying material. However had he just presented the facts, every reader would have come to the same conclusions which he wanted us to come to. If an author does his homework well, the reader doesn't need to be guided by personal opinion to come to the same conclusions as those of the author. I would have come to this on my own. With such horrifying facts, how could the reader reach another conclusion anyway. In keeping his personal feelings and opinions out, this would also have shortened the 1600 pages of this book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Shirer's account is one of a journalist, not a historian. His facts are researched and exhaustive, but he brings no intelligent analysis to the tale. It is a book written with emotion, with prejudice.It is an invaluable work that no student of the Great War must leave unread. But it must be tempered with more balanced works such as Alan Bullock's Hitler: A study in Tyranny and AJP Taylor's Origins of the Second World War. If you're going to read only one book about WWII, Shirer's shouldn't be it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Written in a nice narrative format, this book is big but easy to read with nice back ground for all the events. The only negative would be its a bit heavy on the Nazi hate. Yes, yes, the Nazis were way bad, it just starts to get a bit heavy so that it can distract from the history."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Exactly the kind of book I needed to get some understanding of what happened there!

I would recommend this book to anyone looking for information on that period in history."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Shirer's rise and fall of the third riech has to be #1 on the list of dramatized biased sensationalist works of the third reich.In it he claims it is partly based on his account of the Third Riech based on having drinks with some of the high command, including Hitler,(who some say didn't drink but I think he did have German beer but not to excess). The only thing I think this book got right was probably that it was the first complete chronology of events and their dates. Beyond that it is needlessly written in a way that gives the reader the obvious impression that Shirer hated Hitler and wants the reader to have the same sentiments. It is another one of those books that says on every page \\"Hitler is a bad guy and you should all hate him just like I do, because I am a good guy so I hate Hitler too, you see that dont you?\\"Shirer gives his theory that Hitler became an antisemite very early in his childhood,(which contradicts Hitler's own account of his childhood in Mein Kampf and other sources too). He describes Hitler's down and out day's as a young man as being a derelict because he lived in flop houses. This is also documented in Toland's book. His art work is also insulted by Shirer, while others prominent in the art world praise his work(which we should not forget was self taught because he never had any formal training). I guess the journalist can't figure out weather he'd rather be a historian or art critic. Shirer's rise and fall of the Third Riech is ok if you want events and their dates in chronological order, but it is otherwise very one sided, and worst of all incredibly inaccurate.It is said to be the best historical account on the Third Reich by some(although their are plenty of movies these days that make fantastic claims about how good they are and turn out to be terrible). It sounds more like a sales pitch to me. I would recommend reading several other books in this area and do not assume this one is going to educate you on all of the facts without painting them the color the author wants."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Shirer's, \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" is the definitive history of that regime. He takes the reader from Hitler's early years as a waif in Vienna, to his service in the trenches of France in WWI, to the beginnings of the Nazi movement in post WWI Germany, through his ultimate rise to power, and finally to his downfall. Shirer was a journalist who witnessed firsthand the events he describes and had unrestricted access to volumes of Nazi government documents. He produced the most complete work ever written on the subject of Nazi Germany. His work is as important today as it was when it was first published.Hitler and his entourage produced a blueprint for dictators that is still being followed. The plan is simple: seize power by any means necessary, then use state assets to effectively control the population. In Germany, the Hitler Youth replaced hearth and home. Schools taught only the Nazi philosophy. The media broadcast the \\"Party\\" line exclusively. Churches? \\"They will preach what we want them to preach,\\" stated Hitler. Bound by these constraints an entire generation did the bidding of their Nazi masters without question. It can happen again, anywhere, including the U.S.A. It's a warning worth heeding. Adolph Hitler is alive and well today!Hitler alive? Yes! He showed up as Josef Stalin in the U.S.S.R., and again as Mao Tse Tung and his \\"Cultural Revolution\\" in China. He appeared as Idi Amin in Uganda, thoughtfully providing his executioners with an unlimited supply of marijuana after dispatching their victims with iron bars. He turned up again as Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, his \\"Concentration Camps\\" now being called, \\"New Economic Zones\\" and \\"Reeducation Centers,\\" and subsequently as Pol Pot in the \\"Killing Fields\\" of Cambodia. He surfaced in the Mid-East as Saddam and his acid baths in Iraq and appears regularly as Hezbollah/ Hammas suicide bombers in Israel. Air travelers constantly fear he will reappear as an Al Quida terrorist working for Osama bin Laden. And let us not forget, almost 50 million people have died in abortion clinics here in the U.S., far more than died at Auschwitz, Treblinka etc. The dictators named simply follow Adolph's plan. And like the democracies of the Nazi Era, we stand idly by while they conduct their nefarious activities. We have no right to criticize the British, the French or even the Germans. We are as guilty as they!Edmund Burk said, \\"The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.\\" Shirer has shown the world how dictators operate. Armed with this knowledge, we should be able to prevent despots from rising to power. Clearly, this we have not done. The Allies did nothing until it was almost too late. Armed with Shirer's work and the bitter experience of history, hopefully, we will not continue to be guilty of the same."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I want to preface this review by stating that I am only 640 pages into this mammoth volume on the Rise and the fall of the Third Reich. I am just getting into the meat of World War II, but have read enough to give a fair review, and will up date when I finish the book.This book is awesome in its in depth look at the rise of Hitler's fanatical Third Reich. It provides great background information on Hitler, his early years, the establishment of the Nazi party, and the road to war once Hitler had his full diabolical plan in place. One of the many interesting subplots so far I've learned about is how immensely out numbered the Germans were in 1939 by the French military forces...yet they did not attack, and did nothing, allowing Germany to build up its military even more for its own future offensive against the French in France. Hitler was very beneficial to this cowardly act of the French government and military. Hitler's fanatical personality is also well chronicled throughout so far and it's amazing how so many fell for his \\"charm.\\"Great book, would definitely recommend it for all."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This in-depth, well-written and meticulously researched work remains the benchmark on this topic. Shirer was an eyewitness to many of the events he described. One of the things I liked about this history is how Shirer spent time examining the political and diplomatic events, along with success and foibles, on both sides.You would have a very difficult time finding a better researched and written book that examines in detail one of the most horrific periods in the world. I can't recommend this book enough. Definitely a must read not only for fans of history but for everyone so that these events will never be repeated in the future."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Good balanced account of key events of world war 2.

Many others exist, but none are as clear, logical and understandable as The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. I taught a semester-long course on Nazi Germany in college and used this book as a textbook.

Shirer's history of Adolf Hitler's life & times is a welcome antidote. Though a vast tome of information and facts, it is an easy but absorbing read, an insight into the mind of one of the most reviled but fascinating characters of the 20th century. Despite the dictator's life being well-documented in books and on film, the book reads like an adventure story yet it provides context, both political and personal, historical and chronological as it charts each stage leading to the summit of his career and his eventual downfall. An easy read on a complex subject.James R. Vance"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The definitive work on the political rise of the Nazi regime in Germany by Shirer. William Shirer presents a fully documented masterful work on the ruination of a great civilization. A detailed description of the total destruction of Germany by Hitler and the Nazi Regime that covers the range of social, institutional, and cultural changes that destroyed a people of great intellect and accomplishments. One wonders how the German people could have allowed this to happen to them. The conduct of the Wehrmacht High Command is shown as cowardly and shameful and a betrayal of their duties to the German people by blindly following the Maniac Hitler."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is my second time reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. The first time I did was during high school, and when I finished the book, it was a monumental achievement, considering the number of pages and the intricateness of the politics involved. It took me a couple of weeks to complete the book largely because I was fascinated with subject proposed by the author. Obviously, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich served as a historical lesson of how World War II came and the coming of Nazi Germany. Prior to reading the book, I had very little knowledge about it, and when I finished the book, I learned so much and did not want to read any more of this subject. Mainly, it is because of the disgust I have with the Nazis rolling out the murderous machine and the obedience of the German people, allowing it to happen. Ten years later, I decided to give The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich another go just for the sake of remembering the information again. This time, it took me a few months because the information, especially the politics within the politics, is extremely bogged down. It doesn't mean that The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a worthless read; it is really a masterpiece of a historical construction. I had a hard time motivating myself to keep going through nearly 1,500 pages, so I took lengthy breaks between reads and had better things to do. I noticed a few things this time around. One, William Shirer tends to select and deselect topics of interest to elaborate in details that go for pages. Two, he doesn't pay much of attention to the battles of Europe, frequently giving terse details to them. Three, he lays personal opinions of the key figures involved. In this one, I personally don't care because it is his book and he was there. But I rather Shirer to refrain himself from calling Hitler a \\"genius\\" which he was not. In fact, he was a big-time loser who believed in his ego, leading to death and destruction at all costs. I saw Michael Jordan to play, but he is not what I call a \\"genius.\\" The word is applicable to somebody who does something that is beyond the natural ability which nobody has ever done. Leonhard Euler and Michelangelo fit that description. Hitler's accomplishments are no different from different rulers of various centuries; it's the same old story: rise to power, rule by ruthless means, and fall before death with no standing monuments. Anyway, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a great book, and I've enjoyed the lesson tremendously. And I will never, in earnest, care to embark for further information because it's too ghastly and disturbing."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I've always been fascinated by WWII and in particular by the Nazis and Hitler and usually read or watch anything I come across on these subjects immediately. Oddly this book sat on my shelf for about 5 years before I finally dove into it (and it's quite a plunge). It took me about 3 months to get through it, not because it was boring (anything but) or even because of it's length but because I found myself re-reading whole sections as I learned details of events I'd never known before. This is certainly one of the best books I've ever read.I recommend having access to a map of Europe and SW Asia while you read."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William L. Shirer's novel is so well written that I cannot put it into the right words. I want to say that it felt like I was there, his descriptions of people and places were very, very heavy. That is the least of my concerns because this is a novel that goes so much farther into the history of Nazi Germany than perhaps any other I have ever read.Shirer's book starts with exhaustive research that takes you into the childhood of Adolf Hitler. While known the world over as a monster, it was still important for me to see what this man's days were like before his deadly actions. Srategies, Socialism, tactics, politics, betrayal and so many other things are brought out and although some historical figureheads better versed on the subject than me may know some of this, I found a lot of it to be somewhat of a lost history that tends to take a back seat to WWII in general."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is an incredibly detailed account of the rise and fall of Nazi Germany. I can't put it down and it's give me a whole new perspective. I knew, of course, of the savagery and brutality of this regime. I didn't know how the Nazi's tricked, murdered and lied their way to power or how the French and British could easily, and should, have stomped on Hitler before he started the war. It's also very depressing but it needs reading."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I re-read this recently on a whim. \\"Rise and Fall\\" has always been a classic and still ranks as one of the best histories of of the Third Reich that I have seen. Well documented from historical records as well as the author's own personal experience from being inside the Reich. Despite the tremendous amount of information, Shirer keeps the story moving and avoids allow the book to devolve into a military history of WW2. The perfect starting point for any study of the subject."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"On the very eve of the birth of the Third Reich a feverish tension gripped Berlin . . . Wow! what a great first sentence! Having read this book almost thirty years ago, it still remains the best and most complete history of the Third Reich I have read. Shires purpose is not merely to describe the events that led up to the founding of the Reich and its eventual destruction; but to discover and document the intrigues, treachery, motives and aberrations that precipitated its rise and fall.I will let others review the history and critique Shire on his research, I would like to comment on the beauty of his prose as he describes what must be the most hellish and destructive state that has existed. Historians have the tendency to be dull, they get so caught up in explaining facts and documenting the movement of armies across strange and foreign landscapes, that the reader tends to get lost in a maze of statistics, foreign names, and seemingly insignificant details. Shire avoids this common pitfall. For instance, after quoting from a German generals diary which described Hitlers intentions in occupied Poland, Shire describes the Nazi intentions in vivid prose. . . Nazi terror. . . forerunner to dark and terrible deeds. . . Nazi barbarism reached an incredible depth. Although Shire, in the introduction of this book made the assertion of strict objectivity, he did not let his objectivity hide the awfulness of Nazi atrocities.Although well written, it is not an easy book to read. Its sheer length of over 1100 pages may be daunting to the faint of heart; yet, if you are not familiar with the Third Reich and want to have an understanding of the people whom were instrumental in its raise and fall, no other book will give you better oversight and understanding of it than The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Very few books in the last 20 years have done what he has done. William Shirer explains from the beginnings of Hitler's youth to the end of the Reich as well as the legacy. He explains how it happened, and why. This is historical journalism at its best."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I rate this book in my all time top 10. It is very well written, goes into fascinating detail without getting bogged down and above all you get the feel of the eye witness account especially during Hitler's rise to power. For example Shirer was present during Chamberlain's visit in 1938 and again at the surrender of France in the Ardennes in 1940. He describes Hitler's demeanour on the latter occasion as he passed him on the way to the railway carriage to accept the surrender. This level of detail and insight elevates the book beyond just another historical work and gives it an authenticity, which is just brilliant. It's a long book, it took me the best part of 5 months but it was time very well spent."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer's book has been an incredibly well-sold book for many years now, largely due to the fact that he was a reporter in Germany for an American news agency during the years that Hitler and his political party grew from being a rabble-rousing minority party to the only one. He provides details about all aspects of the Nazi rise, and implementation of their beliefs and dogmas upon the people. The sheer size of the book, coupled with its small text, can be daunting for some readers at first, but the book's well-written and organized effort make it very compelling and authoritative so many years after its first publication. We used this book in my International Baccalaureate class, and only in specified selections, but the book was so well-written and compelling that most of the students went back and read what they didn't have to afterwards. This book would serve anyone well seeking information on how Nazism took hold, how it ruled its people, and what caused its inevitable problems. Shirer's unusually lucky access to all that happened as a witness makes this a fantastic resource."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"If you ever wanted to know how National Socialism came to power this is the book. It covered areas that are not common knowledge particularly the interaction between Hitler and Foreign leaders in the years leading up to World War II.It will leave you wondering what would the world have been like if Hitler had not opened the Eastern Front with a war with Russia, or if Britain and France had moved against Germany in 1937 or 1938. Would it have been Europe controlled by Germany and Russia with Britain and the US neutralized and at the mercy of Germany, Russia, Italy and Japan or could early action have cut off the rise of the Third Reich.This is a must read for anyone interested in WW II history."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I think this should be recommended reading in secondary education.

It is one of the best books I have ever read, certainly in my top ten. It is not a normal historical document produced by uninvolved historians. Rather, it is the experiences of the author who lived it combined with his post-war research. This is a properly biased historical document. Mr. Shirer writes it from the perspective of the good guys to detail the vast immorality and criminality of Hitler and Germany. This is a must read for those interested in international relations. The book defines and gives context to the term appeasement so that when politicians apply it to trivial things, they reveal they are shameless manipulators willing to misuse history for political gain.One reviewer complained this book is too long and doesn't contain maps. I disagree. When you have a great book, long is good. This book is primarily about politics, domination, and death, not geography. Maps are readily available if you desire one. I believe the original editions had maps on the inside of the covers, but I am not sure. I might also add the book does not contain any videos, but I did not miss them either."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Massive volume, with extensive research done on Nazi Germany, from Hitler's birth to his rise to power as Chancellor of Germany and dictator.

A journalist by profession, Shirer writes in an engaging style that holds the reader's interest through complex courses of events and makes what one expects to be a massive literary undertaking to be quite accessible.The book is also very well researched. In his foreward, Shirer notes the illustrative stat that the captured Nazi documents weighed a total of about 500 tons (!). Based on the proliferation of original quotes and annotations, it seems clear that Shirer has researched these as extensively as most authors could. He lays out events in great and careful detail, and for the discerning reader interested in a great level of detail, this is of great value. Despite the detail though, I felt that Shirer's perspective of the larger picture, of long-range trends, causes and effects, and the kinds of analysis that make history so fascinating was somewhat deficient. Perhaps it's because he's not a professional historian, or perhaps it's because, as others have noted, he's writing with an agenda and uses facts as weapons, but I found this to be a minor deficiency in the writing, though it is easy to overlook since his style is so readable.Another common complaint is Shirer's clear anti-Nazi bias. Of course it's foregiveable, since it would be very difficult for any person, especially one who lived under them, to not hate the Nazis, but as the prerogative of a historian is to assume the mantle of objectivity, I find the criticism somewhat valid.As the title of the review suggests, I found the book too heavily focused on the military picture, and I felt it paid to little attention to other aspects of the Third Reich. He describes most of the personnel changes in the German general staff, in addition to standing orders and other minor events, in great detail. This may be because he is fixated on downplaying the German resistance movement. In any case, I found that much of this was unnecessary and felt that more detail on some of aspects of the Third Reich which the author treats more lightly would have been more valuable. Examples of such topics include foreign relations with the US, the middle eastern countries and Switzerland, as well as trade policy and the Japanese alliance. While many of these topics may not be pivotal, I feel they should have been covered in what is supposed to be a comprehensive work.Finally, Shirer's discussion of life in the Third Reich is very informative and valuable, especially since most of it is from a first person perspective. He discusses culture and the arts, popular sentiment, militarism, etc. I wish there had been more of it, but what there was was good.I recommend this book as a good introduction to the period, and an in-depth exposition on the military events."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I deeply believe that there is no question about the excellence of this great book. William Shirer, this outstanding historian, did one of his best (or maybe the best) lucubrations. My admiration directly goes to this durable work and I recommend it to all professional readers who want to know about the most infamous era of the 20th century, World War II, truly!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"By far the most definitive account of the Nazi era, this book is brilliant from almost all viewpoints. It touches upon the German inter-war government, European politics during that period, the German Wehrmacht and the great battles of the War, the turning points and then the end, all in sufficient depth and detail.The reader also gets a clear insight into the mind of the adolescent Hitler, his frustration on not being able to study arts at Vienna, his decision to leave home, the years he spent on the streets of Vienna (where his only company were the \\"rats, and the excruciating hunger\\") and his years as a Corporal in the Austrian Army, and finally his meteoric rise to become Chancellor of Germany.In over 1200 pages, Shirer explains how a regime of unimaginable cruelty came into place, and took over Europe, despite the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations, and the utter misery of the German people at the end of 1918.It seems to me as if the horrors of that age continue to be relived, as the oppression of peoples goes on, around the World. The book makes it clear, in no uncertain terms, that besides the tumultuous changes within Germany itself, the single biggest factor that led to the War was the policy of appeasement followed by the western powers of the day. In their burning desire to see the fall of Bolshevik Russia, the West betrayed many lands, before they finally realised the enormity of Hitler's militarism. Today we once again live in an age where neo-colonialism has arisen, and the world is once again bent on appeasement. I am reminded of the words of Hans Frank (Governor General of Poland), at his trial at Nuremberg. He said, \\"A thousand years shall pass, but the guilt of Germany shall not be erased\\".Before buying this book, it might be well worth remember that this is a book on Nazi Germany and the Third Reich, and not on the World War. For example, you wouldn't find too much on Pearl Harbour or the Imperial Japanese Navy. Also, while Mussolini's rise to power is dealt with, this book doesn't deal with the many dubious characters who arose in Italy during that period. And it certainly doesn't speak of the Red Army in detail. While some of these subjects do acquire passing reference, more authoritative books on them have been written and read.This book comes close to being perfect; even so, it has its vices. Shirer seems to have prejudices against some of the wily characters he writes about, like Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hermann Goering, etc. while some of the other equally scrupulous characters don't seem to invite adjectives as harsh. A more conspicuous drawback is the superficial treatment of the Holocaust. Although scores of pages have been devoted to describe the capture, transport and execution of prisoners, as well as the conditions at the concentration camps, Shirer fails to fully capture the reader's imagination, as he does in other chapters. The author time and again stresses that the topic is vast as well as deep, but in the end fails to narrate as much as was necessary, considering the fact that the Holocaust is the most striking symbol of Nazi flagitism.In spite of these negatives, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich remains an immortal classic. It shall forever be a reminder of the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany, and indeed the causes that led to it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich stands out as one of the best and most complete volumes on Nazi history. While long, it is still very approachable. For anyone who is looking for a starting place in World War Two or Nazi history, this is a good choice. Shirer covers the Nazi era from start to finish. Excellent detail and numerous primary source excerpts are found throughout. Even though it is considerably older than many Nazi history books, it is still relevant and useful. Check it out."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"In reading this book, I found the research into history past and present Germany to be fascinating. Going back to the 18th century was vital for us to understand how Germany came to the thinking it did in the 20th century. Mr. Shirer must have spent numerous hours in painstaking research and eyewitnessing accounts. This book is truly an eye opener for the next generation. However, this book is not without flaws. First, the footnotes are too long, and at times become pages instead of footnotes. Secondly, he imparts to his readers too much of his personal opinions and views. A good author would not spend so much time on this. When an author does his homework as throughly as Mr. Shirer did, and presents the facts, and just the facts without his opinions, the reader is going to come to the same conclusion as the author intended without his guidance by embedding into almost every page his personal view. The horrors committed evoke an opinion from each reader without being guided into the author's opinion. These opinions of the author, if removed, may have shortened the book by a few hundred pages."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is magnificent,it tells about the life of Hitler from the day he was born to his teenage childhood up to his rise to poqwer,Shirer has capture the real drama of the most famous leader during the WW II.He describe the way how Hitler reract after the fall of France up to the height of the campaign at the war in Srtalingrad up to the last days of Hitler."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Almost 1500 pages. If you start on this book, it is so compelling and well written that you will read it to the end. William Shirer writes with authority having been a Berlin correspondent through much of the events set forth in the book. He personally knew many of the people set forth in the narrative (example when Shirer was on the reviewing stand with several high-ranking Nazi officials) and based on his personal knowledge does not cut any of them any slack. (Ribbentrop especially seems to draw Shirer's ire). If you have any interest at all in the Third Reich, this is the book to read. I think the biggest compliment is that, at 1500 pages, you will read all of it!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Despite the exhuberance of the other reviews, I suggest potential readers think twice before reading this particular work. Shirer's arguments are outdated on certain subjects and the book really drags in some places. There are several other histories of the Third Reich that tell the story more effectively and in less time. That said, I enjoyed Shirer's book and his coverage of the major battles (especially Stalingrad) is dramatic. Those willing to invest the time to read it (1400 pages! ) will be better for it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Although I respect this book immensely, I have doubts about just how much the author's prejudices play into it. That is often the case, but I think it is always good to remind people that bias can occur even in great histories.For example, Shirer's references to homosexuals is always homosexual perverts. When homosexual generals disagree it is characterized as \\"the usual petty bickerring common to these kinds of men.\\" Just a few pages later when the \\"straight\\" generals are fighting and disagreeing and trying to out do each other -- it's characteriezed as simple disagreement. There really was no reason for these jibes. They didn't add to the history.If Shirer can let his personal bias in in one area, how much of his history is equally colored by it?Some of the lessons to be learned from WWII and the Reich are centered around hatred, predjudice, bullying, people feeling that they are a master race better than their fellow humans. I wonder if this great author missed some of these major lessons even though he wrote the finest chronicle of the war written to date."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I've been meaning to read this for years (and years). - Not totally easy to read, but VERY interesting and relates to present-day events easily. Buy it (or check it out of the library), read it, and TELL YOUR FRIENDS."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"\\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" is one of my all time favorites. It is not just history but it feels more like a thriller revealing the plots as you read it on. The most remarkable fact is that it is based wholly on facts. Hats off to William.L.Shirer for preparing a book like this. Imagine how he would have consolidated all the facts. The book has quite a good no. of pages(more than 1100). It takes some time to finish it but still it is worth the time spent on it. If any one is interested in the history of Germany under Nazi rule and the insides and outs of the role of Germany in the Second World War then this is the right book. Moreover it also covers enough details of the character and life of Adolf Hitler. Overall one will not regret spending time on this book."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read on this subject. The minute by minute account of the events and happenings, from the ascendance of Hitler to power, to his defeat, keeps one totally gripped. The part where Mr Shirer deals with events just before the attack on poland and eventually the start of the war is the best. He tells us history in such an interesting way that it is unbelievable. It is a must for every person interested in knowing such an important part of our past."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"A must read for all people interested in the history of this century. Should be required reading to all American high school students."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"For anyone who wants to know what really was happening in Germany in 1933, this is simply the best book. I've have read many books about the subject but none has captured my attention like this masterpiece. It is full of facts and details but unlike many books about this subject, it never gets dull or boring"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is one of the most dog-eared books in a small collection of books devoted to the WWI time period in history because it has been read and re-read many times.William L. Shirer captures the times in a way only one who lived through them can possibly do. It struck me as odd at first how interesting reading about history can be, when one already knows the outcome of the story. But there are lessons to be learned from repeated readings and Shirer does a great job making sure that the reader does not put the book down for long. The footnotes are well done and provide an even greater in-depth look into the events that were unfolding on the pages before you. Shirer is careful to avoid opinionated writing and sticks to the facts as they are known to him like a Captain sticks to his plotted course. Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The book tells everything about Nazi Germany.We can learnhow those mad men tried and finally started the war.The booktakes special attention to the political environment and background, where the most fateful decisions are always made, and ordinary people never know nothing about."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"THE GOOD: This entire book is awesome - a must have for any history/WW2 buff, or anyone who is just a fan of great literature. Shirer writes the war in an informative and entertaining way which captivated me and kept me turning pages (ignoring that there were like 10,000 pages to turn!) I absolutely loved this book and have reread it until the pages fell out. This is the definitive book on WW2 from beginning to end.THE BAD: Nothing about this book is bad.THE UGLY: Absolutely nothing.Ubermonkey says that there are tons of books which cover the WW2 era. But without a doubt, none of them cover it like this."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"As a history major I've read a fair number of WWII books, from terribly specific ones like \\"The Psychopathic God\\"- a psychological study of Hitler, to memoirs (like Churchill's) to comprehensive survey texts. None that I have read is remotely as thorough as the Rise and Fall. I started it once as a high-school kid, but found the size a bit daunting. Now that I don't hang out at the mall as much, I've had time to start it again and finally finish it. If you want to know about the war, at least in the European Theater, I doubt you can do better. The author was there, and saw things up close, and while clearly had no use for the Nazi party, he was able to write with a clinical and truly journalistic eye so that the story unfolds under its own power instead of being directed. The book begins with Hitler as a youth, with the bitterness of Versailles and reparations, and ends at Nuremburg, with the final justice. There isn't much that isn't covered in between- putsches, battles, economies, treasons, assassination attempts, diplomacy, ad infinitum, and it is all written well enough to keep a reader's attention. Again, it is a big, big book, and there is probably not much point in tackling it unless you have an interest in ww2 history, but if you do and haven't read this book then your ww2 education is still a bit incomplete."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is an excellent book on the history of Nazi Germany and is full of valuable information. At nearly 1200 pages long i didn't think i would be able to finish it but i couldn't put it down! Even though it is history, it reads kind of like a novel with new plots unfolding and new characters being introduced. It deals alot with diplomacy and the inner workings of the Third Reich so you won't find alot of detailed information on the campaigns of World War II.The story of the German resistance in this book i found to be the most fascinating since the author spread it out throughout the entire book. It started right before Munich as an effort to prevent Hitler from dragging Germany into a war they knew it could not win. And then for the next six years numerous plots against Hitler were hatched only to be aborted at the last minute. Finally on July 20, 1944 they carried it out with a German officer involved in the plot hiding a bomb in his briefcase at the Fuhrer's headquarters in East Prussia. The plot failed and Nazis murderous repraisals against the conspirators are then described.Some people are critical of the author for being too \\"biased\\" an example of this is him always describing Goering as the \\"fat Reich marshal.\\" But can you really blame a guy who witnessed the rise of this truly evil regime? William Shirer admits this himself in the epilogue of the book. Get this book whether you are a beginner or an expert in Third Reich history you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Although we covered Hitler and Nazi Germany in high school history, William Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich provides the details that were lacking from those lectures.- Hitler was a genius at reading situations, people, and motivations, and in manipulating his enemies into a corner. I knew that he was a master orator and a skilled propagandist, but I didn't realize how well he was able to outmaneuver professional diplomats.- The English and French could have stopped Hitler during the Sudetenland incidents (but instead abdicated their responsibilities with Chamberlain's Munich capitulation), and prior to and again during the invasion of Poland (by proactively allying with Russia, and by invading Germany while his army was busy in Poland). At the time of the Sudetenland adventure, the army staff was ready to rebel if France and England had forced Hitler to declare war to get his way.- The defeat of the French was due to a daring tactical use of a new weapon (concentrated tank formations) and a feint of the failed von Schlieffen plan.- An error in judgment allowed the English to escape at Dunkirk. Another error in navigation allowed the RAF to recover from its initial disadvantage.- There was a conspiracy among some high ranking officers to get rid of Hitler throughout the war, but they didn't follow through until the war was nearly over. Shame and ruin came to Germany because nobody had the greatness, courage, or tactical ability to stand up to the increasingly megalomaniacal sheissekopf.For me, the price was well worth the description of the diplomatic intrigue that led to the war. Shirer dedicates nearly half of the book to diplomacy and international issues from the Reichstag fire to the invasion of France. Using primary materials such as diaries, captured German documents, and Nuremberg testimony, Shirer weaves the story of the maneuvering that allowed Hitler to capture Austria and Czechoslovakia without firing a shot; to capture Poland without being attacked by France England, or Russia; and Norway, Holland, Luxembourg, Belgium, and France with minimal loss of life and materiel.On the negative side, Shirer allows his personal opinions to color the narrative far too often. Goering is always described as fat, Ribbentrop is always described as vain, etc. Roehm and several other Nazis are described as homosexual in such a way as to imply that \\"perversions\\" like Nazism and homosexuality [Shirer's characterization, not mine] are necessarily linked. Fortunately, he puts those issues aside when he gets to the meat of the story. Also, I agree with another reviewer that the book could have used a few maps to remind the reader of the location of certain key cities and/or defensive positions described in the narration.On balance, the book is as good as could be expected given the scope of the task. Shirer was a journalist, not a historian, so he approaches the events leading to the war from that perspective, while his history of the Nazi movement prior to Hitler's appointment as Chancellor leaves much to be desired. For example, he doesn't seem to notice how often key figures shift alliances between the \\"mortal enemy\\" Communist party and the Nazi party. His firsthand observation probably influenced his choice of key events to describe, whereas a historian coming along afterward, with no personal experience to bias his selection of events, might have chosen differently. For example, Kristallnacht, the 1936 Olympics, and the Spanish Civil War are all glossed over. Still, the book covers most of the key points; any more depth or breadth would require the book to be longer than its nearly 1200 pages."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer's book is the definitive text on Nazi Germany, and shall be forever more. Anyone who has read it will be awash in the tyrannical obsessions that made 1933-1945 in Europe a true living nightmare. Although it is obviously long, with more subtitles, annotations, and footnotes than one is generally accustomed to, these are essentially to the very nature of the complex subject material. Without peer, its comprehensive study of the years leading up to WWII are both gripping and frightening. Yes, most aspects of the Holocaust (Shoah) are given short shrift, but Shirer never pretended to be a definitive expert on the subject, and other texts define the atrocities much better. What really seperates this book from all the others of its genre are the use of captured Nazi documents. Recently, I saw a 2002 documentary called \\"Blind Spot\\", about Hitler's personal secretary, Traudl Junge, who recounted the last days in the bunker under the Chancellary in Berlin. Most of the commentary she recounted were nearly composed verbatim in this book, written over 40 years ago. If one wants to learn history, and not subjectivism, then this is the account to have in your library."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I can't give a long review to this book. It would take a book to review this book. It's simply a must read for every human being on earth. The book doesn't begin in 1939 or even 1933. This book starts where it should, with the birth of Hitler's grandparents. Shirer takes you through generations then the life of the young man noting key points of Hitler's life that shape his personal evolution into becoming one of the most evil men ever to walk the earth. Shirer's first hand accounts are important as is the meticulous research he did. We owe an enormous debt to Shirer. This is one of my favorite books of all time. Kevin Hogan, ..."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"It can be very difficult to jump in, pick up a random book, and start reading about a subject so large, complex, and contriversial as Nazi Germany. Moreover, the terminology and huge cast of characters can be daunting to a beginner. I read this book as my first introduction to Nazi Germany and highly recommend it to others looking to \\"get their feet wet\\" and obtain a broad overview of Hitler's Germany. Through this book, I was able to obtain a good overview of the chronology of the Third Reich, as well as introductions to the main Nazi players, including obviously Hitler himself, which I was able to use as a spring board to jump into more detailed subjects. In that sense, Shirer's book has been invaluable to me. The other strong point is that Shirer himself lived in Germany during the early of Nazi power and provides a unique prospective of life in Germany after 1933.While I still highly recommend the book, there are some things I think readers should be aware of:1) The book was written in 1960, only 15 years after the end of the regime, and some facts are obviously dated. Much more information has come to light in the past 45 years, especially with the opening of the Soviet archives. However, this is understandable and does not detract from the quality of the book, though I do encourage folks to read some more modern texts.2) I found Shirer to be an obvious homophobe, specifically when discussing Ernst Rohm and the SA. Again, this is understandable given the times, but I did find it annoying.In summary, great book. Every student of Nazi Germany should read it, but shouldn't stop with it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I've read this book a couple of times now. Each time I'm struk by new details and thoughs over the past. There is a lot of &quot;What-If's&quot; over the whole third Reich. This book illustrates in a convenient detailed level of the whole history from Hitlers young days as a stray in Wien until his death in Berlin 1945.As a reference the book is splendid. I have read a couple of other documents from WW2, I always discover that I can go back to this book to get more informationConsidering this book was written before any of the &quot;Spandau 7&quot; was released (and able to release thir Memoars) its a quite accuracte hostorical document.

However for those of us born in the 20's it reminds us of the things that were going on as we were growing up and becoming adults. It is a worthwhile read"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"The book is a political history of the Third Reich; it's very light on legal, social, economic and military aspects. It could equally be titled as a biography of Adolf Hitler since almost all of the book revolves around this central person. Few other people are covered in as much depth as their importance would warrant - with exceptions of course. Franz Halder and some high placed plotters against Hitler are given good coverage.It's very long but although it could benefit from further editing, it's very readable. Shirer has a flowing style and is not at all dry. It's certainly not an academic text. It's full of the author's opinions, many of them superfluous and fatuous (do we really need half a page to tell us the Nazi leaders didn't look like the conquerors of Europe while dressed in shabby clothes in the dock at Nuremburg?).Shirer is scathing of just about everybody involved, even such people as Birger Dahlerus who did everything he possibly could to avoid a war despite his very limited means. Shirer seems to throw around words like stupid, naive, dim-witted and cowardly quite lightly considering he's often describing highly intelligent people who worked their way to the top of their societies and had to wrestle with difficult ethical and practical decisions (for example those who risked plunging their country into civil war and exposing it to foreign occupation by assassinating Hitler).As a political history written for non specialist readers, it's fascinating, packed full of the well documented detail necessary to get a good understanding of how things happened and why.Much of the analysis is unconvincing. Shirer subscribes to the theory is that Nazism was a more progression growing out of German culture and philosophy prior even to the First World War rather than a response to the difficulties faced by the German nation (such as the prospect of Communist revolution) during the Weimar period. As such, he brushes over such important influences as the starvation caused by the British naval blockade of the First World War - and the huge impact this had on the German psyche (not to mention military strategy).Also notable is that the 1998 Arrow paperback copy is of poor printing and binding quality; many pages were misprinted due to being bent prior to printing; and many pages have fallen out despite gentle handling during the first reading.In summary, although the book is hardly balanced and overly long it's a reasonable non specialist political and diplomatic history of the Third Reich."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"First, the \\"supposed order\\" claim, in which it is argued that because no written order was ever given that such an order never occured, is an easily refutable claim (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examination_of_Holocaust_denial#Evidence_for_Hitler.27s_complicity_in_the_Holocaust). Second, this book is not about the atrocities of Stalin, it is about those of Hitler, and it is not fair to deride it because of this. Third, why is the supposed \\"decline and dissapearance of the white race\\" such a threat, if it is actually more than a myth? And why are \\"diversity and multiculturalism\\" so horrid to you? Why is it so terrible that other cultures than the dominant one be given time to show what their beliefs, values, and historical perspectives are?

It certainly lacks historical objectivity occasionally, as it never covers colonial atrocities and exploitation committed by the United Kingdom or France. Also it improperly refers to German guns with American titles. For example instead of correctly calling the German sub-machine gun an MP40, he will call them \\"Tommy Guns.\\" Hitler shot himself on April 30, 1945 with a PPK not a \\"revolver\\" as the author erroneously writes, and the Germans used primarily (but not exclusively) the P08 Lugar and the Walther P38 as side arms, not \\"revolvers.\\" I do not mean to niggle over minor details but these are the things that drive historians insane.

William Shirer's comprehensive treatment of the curious rise and horrific fall of the Nazis in post-Weimar Germany is the benchmark volume to measure all other treatments of the era by. There are so many monographs on Nazi Germany that one reels before the list looming in a relevant bibliography. Save yourself the trouble; this book gives one exactly the kind of complete immersion in and coverage of the realities of the era that too many of the other books lack. Shirer, an American journalist stationed in Berlin as a newspaper (and later radio) correspondant during the rise of the National Socialists, was there, on the ground and at the scene witnessing many of the events he describes in such detail. He has, of course, written extensively on these experiences, both herein and elsewhere in books like 'The Nightmare Years' and 'Berlin Diary'. But this book has to be considered his masterpiece, and is worth the time, trouble and price for this hefty best-selling volume. After all, it has never been out of print in the forty years since its original publication in the early 1960s.

It is replete with typographical and other errors for which there is no excuse. This book is a classic and deserves better presentation for readability.

Along with several other books that cover the holocaust, this book will be read by future generations to remind them of how some of the worst criminals in history came to rule a continent.Why you should read this book:Like I mentioned in the title of this review, it is essential to mankind. This is the foremost history of the Third Reich from a perspective inside the Third reich. The perspective of the events is at times cold, but its was written with the greatest attempts at objectivity. The reader is not automatically forced to make moral judgements by the author; Shirer gives the reader the cold facts and the reader can feel the sorrow of Germany and the world at the evil that thrived on the ignorance and naivete of pre-war policy makers. At times it can be dry and long-winded, but for the most part this book was hard to put down (I read the unabridged version in under 2 weeks). The reader will not be disappointed in this book. Shirer painstakingly studied thousands of captured Nazi documents, memorandums, orders and news releases to come up with this detailed history.What you should expect to see in this book:This book chronicles the life of Hitler from his ancestors to his final hours in the Berlin Chancellory bunker. The main players throughout the Nazi party are given detailed historys alongside Hitler's. Most importantly this book shows the failures of the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations and the Weimar Republic and shows how an Austrian tramp rose to the Dictator of Europe. Mussolini and Italy's dealings with the Third Reich is also given a lot of attention. The details of the diplomatic dealings with the Allies in Munich and the events that led up to the invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939 are thoroughly described (I counted approixmately 100 pages on the events that led up to that invasion). The accounts of the holocaust are well detailed, but are not definitive. Shirer describes the holocaust some, but the reader might desire more.What you should not expect to see in this book:There are no maps to speak of in this book. I would suggest that you have a few historical maps on WWII when you read this because the action can become fast paced and it might be a little hard to understand without a thorough knowledge of the geography of Europe. This book is not a military history, so don't expect it to go into detail about the weapons or other aspects of the military. I think only about 20 pages talked about Hitler's invasion of Poland, and that was mostly about his dealings with Stalin in carving Poland up. If you are looking for a military history of WWII, I would suggest Chester Wilmot's _The Struggle for Europe_ (which starts during the Battle of Britain), or Liddel Hart's _History of the Second World War_. In addition, this is not a history of the holocaust. Shirer gives an account of it, but it is by no means comprehensive of definitive. Lastly, this book was written before 1960, and a lot of new information, especially from the former Soviet Union has been uncovered which will be able to shed more light on the Eastern front."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"It would be nearly impossible to overstate the importance of this book. It is, I believe, more pivotal in shaping the American popular understanding of Nazi Germany than any other book ever published. As such, it has helped shape everything from representations of Nazis and their victims in motion pictures to media protrayals of accused war criminals living in the United States.As a work history, this book is also extremely impressive. Shirer makes extensive and critical use of a plethora of primary sources, including captured German documents and testimony from the Nuremburg trials, and this gives his account considerable credibility. His writing style is engrossing, making the length of the book seem less gargantuan than it is. I doubt that I would be able to identify a more comprehensive or readable single-volume history of Nazi Germany.It should be understood, however, that Shirer does not really intend for this book to be merely a history of Nazi Germany. It is a morality tale. Shirer is aghast at the destruction and barbarity that Nazi Germany wrought in the world, and this book reads like an indictment of everybody everwhere who had a hand in allowing the barbarity to occur. Nobody can escape responsibility, not common Germans who brought Hitler to power, not the German generals who were unwilling or unable to control Hitler, not the German businessmen who profited through Hitler's various barbarities, not the Anglo-French architects of appeasement, and most of all not the Nazis themselves.Of course, Shirer's sense of moral outrage sometimes causes some unfortunate lapses. It is rare that Shirer does not call Goering fat when Goering pops up in the narrative. Similarly, he invariably uses &quot;fatuous&quot; to describe Ribbentrop and reminds us on numerous occasions that Rosenberg was a &quot;dolt.&quot; I have no idea what Goering's girth has to do with anything, and Shirer never really gives us a real idea of why he thinks that Ribbentrop was fatuous or Rosenberg was any stupider than any other member of the Nazi elite. Gratuitous pejoratives are distracting and unfair.And then there's the matter of Ernst Roehm, Hitler's chief of the SA. Roehm and the rest of the members of the SA were a bunch of terrorist thugs who got votes for the Nazis by intimidating the opposition, but to Shirer, this thuggery is eclipsed by the fact that Roehm and some other of the SA leaders were or were thought to be gay (which Shirer consistently refers to as a &quot;perversion&quot;). To say the least, the credibility of Shirer's moral outrage at the racist and anti-semitic doctrine of the Nazi party is undermined by his bald homophobia.More than that, Shirer makes no real attempt to understand why the British and the French behaved as they did in appeasing Hitler. He ascribes it to some sort of moral failing, and while this may be the case, it is only part of the story. France and Great Britain were bankrupted by the Depression. They couldn't really afford to rearm, and they were desparate to avoid a war at least partly out of a misplaced fiscal restraint. This fact does not obscure the reality that the appeasement policy was short-sighted and stupid, but at least it makes the whole thing more comprehensible. Likewise, Shirer doesn't really understand that Germany's rearmament was paid for with checks that the Reich couldn't cash without plunder. By 1939, the German economy was a house of cards that was about to collapse without a capital infusion. Unfortunately, one wouldn't know that from reading Shirer.Finally, the emphasis that Shirer puts on different periods of the Third Reich is disproportionate. The war years, especially from 1943 to 1945, are sped through with very little detail about anything except the various plots against Hitler. It's almost as if Shirer ran out of gas after 800 pages or so. It is admirable that Shirer does not get bogged down the military details of the war, but at the same time, I would think that the war years deserve more than 25 or 30% of the book.By all means, read this book, especially if you have only cursory familiarity with Nazi Germany. It is generally well-written, accessible, and reasonably comprehensive. Just beware of the problems with it as you are reading."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is a brilliant book - tremendously well researched, incredibly well written, and packed full of unparalleled insights. It is highly recommended for anyone interested in Adolph Hitler, the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany, and the Third Reich at war.Written soon after the end of the Second World War and first published in 1959, William L. Shirer's \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" remains the monumental history of Adolph Hitler and the Germany he created.The author, William L. Shirer, served as a newspaper correspondent and CBS radio reporter in Europe and Nazi Germany during the war and witnessed first-hand many of the events that led to the beginning of the Second World War in Europe. More importantly, Shirer, the correspondent turned historian, was among the first individuals to avail himself of the confidential archives of the Third Reich and all its branches seized and held by the U.S. government after the war in Alexandria, Virginia.These documents included the official diaries of the German Armed Forces High Command, the German Navy High Command, the Chief of the German General Staff (General Franz Halder), and those of the Minister of Propaganda (Dr. Joseph Goebbels). Shirer also made good use of the stenographic records of Hitler's conferences on the daily military situation, as seen and discussed at the Fuehrer's headquarters, and the texts of the Nazi leader's table talk.The result is an extremely well documented and detailed history of every aspect of Hitler's Germany. Shirer makes it clear early in his book that although he detested Adolph Hitler and the Nazis, he sought to write an objective history of events. Certainly his observations on the leader of the Third Reich are of special interest to readers and historians alike. Shirer calls Hitler: \\"The man with the Charlie Chaplin mustache, who had been a down-and-out tramp in Vienna in his youth, an unknown soldier of World War I, a derelict in Munich in the first grim postwar days, the somewhat comical leader of the Beer Hall Putsch, this spellbinder who was not even German but Austrian...\\"Writing about the rise of the Third Reich, Shirer shows conclusively that many of Hitler's beliefs as well as the basic tenets of the Nazi Party, including its' highly centralized, authoritarian and violently anti-Semitic nature, were deeply embedded in German history. It is for this reason that most of the German population and military so willingly followed their Fuehrer into another destructive two-front world war and continued to believe in him and victory until the very end.There is very little about the German leader and the Third Reich that is not in this book. Shirer was able to detect early on, for example, the Nazi program to murder its own citizens, who were mentally retarded or otherwise physically incapacitated, and the resistance by the German population and the Catholic Church to that program. He also shows that, contrary to the view still held by some historians to this day, the vast bulk of Hitler's generals fully supported the German leader and his Nazi party. At the same time, Shirer was among the first historians who attempted to record the civilian and military resistance to the Fuehrer.All of this makes Shirer's \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" wonderful and compelling reading. It remains the monumental history of Hitler's Germany and one of the most important historial works of our time."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer, a journalist/broadcaster stationed in Berlin in the 1930s and 40s, had a unique opportunity to witness Adolph Hitler's rise to power. Few can say they attended Nazi rallies or stood behind Hitler as he delivered some of his famous speeches. Shirer, the consummate narrator, delivers his experiences to the rest of the world in this book, first published in 1960. It covers Hitler's young life and many experiences that probably helped form his anti-semitism. It is fascinating to see how many of these major characters of the last century came together at first in small restaurants and bars, and later in stadiums before hundreds of thousands of Germans.This book remains one of the great docu-historical writings of the twentieth century. Part history and part opinion, it is quite stunning in scope and character. True, Shirer does occasionally transcend his role as journalist, delivering intense personal opinions on characters from Ribbontrop to Goering to Goebbels. Some have faulted him for this, but I liked it. Who else would be in a better position to deliver such information? If Shirer has spent the time with these people-if he knows enough of them, then by all means, he should expound in this manner.This is a very long book. At 1200-some pages, It was daunting and enjoyable at the same time. While some details blurred over time, the amount of information erred on the safe side-better too much than too little. While this is a valid criticism, it has no bearing on my feelings regarding the book when all is said and done. This is masterful history mixed with first hand drama and (despite what some have said) intense documentation.Essential and highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Probably more English-language readers have learned about Nazi Germany from The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich than any other book. That William Shirer's mammoth study is still in print, still widely read and still cited as a basic text by historians and researchers, is a testament to its importance and staying-power in shaping popular perception of Adolf Hitler, Germany, National Socialism and World War II. For many readers, this is the Ur-text of Nazi history. This is very problematic however, as Rise and Fall, while very readable, is incomplete and outdated in analyzing Nazi Germany.Certainly, even the most skeptical reader must laud Shirer's efforts. An American journalist who spent the early years of Hitler's reign in Berlin, Shirer brings a formidable mixture of first-hand experience and exhaustive research of German archival material and primary sources. His personal encounters with Hitler (witnessing several of his Reichstag speeches, say) give the material an added edge and authority that latter-day historians lack. Additionally, Shirer is a formidable writer, and the book is extremely readable despite its flaws and near-1500 page length. His depictions of the inner-workings of the Nazi regimes, and his blow-to-blow accounts of Hitler's rise to power, WWII and Nazi atrocities are gripping and admirably thorough. There's not too much to quibble with here; it's elsewhere that we run into difficulties.Shirer provides a blunt, straightforward picture of Nazi Germany that easily squares with the layman's understanding of the subject. In Shirer's eyes, Hitler was an evil genius who came on the political scene with a clear program for European hegemony (if not world domination) and extermination of the Jews. He embraces the \\"Sonderweg\\" theory that Germany is particularly susceptible to domination by repressive, nationalist dictators, and depicts the German citizenry as a more-or-less willing accomplice in Hitler's atrocities. The author's palpable hatred for his subjects bleeds through every page: Ernst Rohm is a pervert, Herman Goering fat, Joachim Von Ribbentrop a moron and so forth. Less enlightening is when he extends this attitude to other figures, as when he brands the anti-Hitler resistance as either irrelevant or merely self-serving opportunists.The fact is, despite their popular endurance, few reputable historians still hold these opinions, at least without serious reservations. The Sonderweg theory isn't unique to Shirer, but it displays a remarkable ignorance of German history, disregarding the country's strong history of liberalism, Otto Von Bismarck's modernizing policies as Chancellor and, perhaps most importantly, Germany's remarkable tolerance towards Jews before 1914. Wilhelmine Germany's bellicose imperialism was certainly troubling and unduly provocative, but can't really be seen as a direct precursor to Hitler. Historians still debate how much of the Holocaust and Nazi foreign policy was mapped out in advance, but few (except maybe Daniel Jonah Goldhagen) would agree with the simplistic conclusion that Hitler never deviated from Mein Kampf. How much Hitler was an \\"evil genius\\" - a phrase Shirer employs multiple times - rather than a crafty opportunist blessed with uncanny luck is very much open to debate. And so on. A knowledgable reader can't take much of Shirer's reasoning seriously, but unfortunately many lay readers will.Of course, some of this can be excused: the book was written in 1960, after all, and a great deal of documentation has become available since Shirer's day. However, sloppy reasoning, limited historical understanding and the author's own biases are harder to excuse, as they obfuscate the true lessons to be mined from his subject. More recent writers like Joachim Fest, Ian Kershaw and Richard J. Evans provide a more nuanced version of Nazism, placing Hitler and Co. in a proper context without diminishing their evil. The Third Reich and the Second World War were not simple morality plays as Shirer would have us believe; history is never as simple as that.For all its flaws as a historical work, Rise and Fall is undeniably a fascinating read. Its sheer visceral power can't be denied and most readers will learn a lot. It's a fine introduction to Nazi Germany, but anyone seriously interested in the subject should follow up with more scholarly works."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"My parents bought this book when it first came out, about 1960, and I struggled to read it cover to cover and eventually finished it. I was eight years old. This may seem amazing to some of the high school students who have reviewed this book as &quot;boring&quot;, but it amazed and frightened me. What kept me reading was the vividly portrayed methodical and unfolding horror in Europe that I had known nothing about (what eight year old does?) I'm sure that I missed a lot on my first reading, but I remember that first reading vividly even today. The reason this book is a &quot;must read&quot; is that today's tyrants, today's wars and today's massacres follow much the same script. I believe that most tyrants are often also fanatic students of history for &quot;how to&quot; guides to achieving their aims. Those they would enslave should be equally diligent. The book is sometimes disparaged for its long quotes of previously secret Nazi letters, memoranda and cables, but it is precisely that detail that stays with you for life. You will never read a bland government white paper again without scanning it for the incredible couched in passive, obfuscatory language.I have read a great deal more history since then, and have read many books on military tactics and strategy from ancient times to the present, but I have never read a better portrait of a world gone crazy. Military strategists can only tell you how. This book tells you why by someone who was there when it happened.Obviously there have been further revelations since this book was published in 1960 based on declassified and more recently translated documents, but this book stands the test of time in that such revelations supplement but do not undermine its veracity."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"In the nearly four decades that has passed since the first printing of this book, nobody has written a better researched, more accurate volume on Nazi Germany than William L. Shirer. He holds our hand throughout the book, showing us how Hitler &quot;rationally&quot; developed his warped and horrific political philosophy. He allows the story of Nazi atrocities to be told by the Nazis themselves...through chilling memos and the almost fanatical documenting of orders that even the most tedious bureaucrat participated in.Holocaust deniers often claim that the allies exaggerated the effort Nazi Germany undertook to exterminate Jews, Slavs and other &quot;undesirables&quot;. Shirer's book shows that the Allies didn't need to...the Nazis documented it for themselves. Current volumes on Nazi Germany try to re-write history based on faulty memories and &quot;mysterious new evidence&quot; that comes out of now ultra-capitalist Russia. Most of them are either a money grab, or written for some insidious ulterior motive. None of them capture the authenticity and the horror of this champion of histories."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is the perfect introduction to Nazi Germany for those who, like me, are just beginning to study this disturbing and fascinating period of history. There are a number of things which I think make this the perfect introduction.First, Shirer was a journalist and an excellent writer. This is diplomatic history at it's best. Shirer does an excellent job of both presenting the big picture in terms of the overall narrative of events as well as the fascinating details which make a history like this truly engaging. This is easily one of the most readable and enjoyable history books I have ever read.Second, Shirer was actually present at many of the major events that he narrates. He was present in Vienna on the night of the Anschluss of Austria, he was present at the French surrender at Compiegne, and he was present during many of Hitler's speeches. He was in Berlin just before the outbreak of war and is able to describe the mood, and the tension, of that city and its inhabitants on the eve of war. This adds a vividness to Shirer's account which is unique.Third, despite what some negative reviewer's have claimed Shirer's scholarship was excellent. I have no doubt that scholarship on Nazi Germany has progressed a great deal since this book was published, and it will no doubt be possible to find errors here and there, as well as questionable interpretations. But one should always remember that fifty years from now people will be saying the same thing about the books that are being published today. Does that mean they should not be read? Of course not. The fact is Shirer quotes extensively from captured foreign documents, Nazi diaries and letters, speeches, as well as testimony from the Nuremberg trials. It would be hard, I think, to find a single unsubstantiated claim in the whole book. Shirer was not just a journalist writing down his personal reflections, he did his research, and it shows.I agree with some of the reviewers who have said this should not be the only book you read on Nazi Germany. But it would be impossible, in my opinion, to find a better place to start."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"William Shirer's book is truly a must-read for anyone interested in exploring the subject of World War II in depth. He writes as a journalist, as many other reviews have pointed out. But he has an historian's desire to do more than report. He searches for the social causes and effects of the rise and fall of Nazism in Germany.Since his book was written, there have been many excellent histories of Hitler and the Third Reich. However, few have captured the immediacy of the period in the way that Shirer has. Some books have corrected some factual slips that Shirer made, and others have focused on issues that Shirer didn't. Even so, this is a great starting point for understanding the Third Reich. Sixty years later, the book is still a fascinating read!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"\\"By a hypnotism that defies explanation--at least by a non-German--Hitler held the allegiance and trust of this remarkable people to the last. It was inevitable that they would follow him blindly, like dumb cattle but also with a touching faith and even an enthusiasm that raised them above the animal herd, over the precipice to the destruction of the nation.\\"This remarkable book is based principally on the captured German documents, the interrogations and testimony at the Nuremberg trials of German military officers and civilian officials, the diaries and memoirs which some of them have left, and on Shirer's experience in the Third Reich. Shirer became one of the most respected journalists in wartime Europe.The book is exhaustive and detailed with extensive notes and bibliography. A bit of patience is needed to get through the dialect, often quoting Mein Kampf. Shirer brings forth wonderful descriptions of the people who played a role in those troubled times. The individual battles are not detailed, so one will need to refer to other sources for a more detailed look at these battles and horrors that ensued. This is an important book for those interested in Germany and life in the Third Reich at this time.The Reich rises with a quick run through of Hitler's youth and the German history, then the politics and Hitler's megalomania that led to national socialism and the rise to dictatorship. The Treaty of Versais and the fall of the mark lead to Germany's economic fall, allowing for the people to welcome in a dictatorship, a new messiah by deceit. The military buildup could now begin. The coups to overthrow Hitler and the Nazis had already failed and will continue to fail throughout the war. For the officers it was either death by Hitler or death by fighting. The massacres of the Russians began soon after the invasion of the East. The French and other countries were also caught up in the massacre, and William gives us the eyewitness reports. The \\"Jewish cleansing\\" started soon after the nazis took over their first countries. The Nazis kept developing more and more efficient means of extermination and experimentation. There is an exhaustive lead up to the start of W.W.II, the invasion of Poland. There was freighting information discovered on what would have been in store for Britain if invaded, not to mention the world and the slaughter of Russia. The Nazi's pinnacle arrives at about 2/3 of the way through the book where the fall begins with the Allied advance.It took military action eventually to stop Hitler's \\"New world order\\", not the people. The lack of doing anything to stop Hitler from walking into the Rhineland should not be forgotten. Does not the blame fall partly on the people, Chamberlain, and the military generals? Maybe if more would have read Mein Kampf, and not disregarded it's contents millions would not have lost their lives. The Nazi propaganda took over the press, and soon indoctrinated the German people. There were many opportunities to stop Hitler by France and Britain early on. Have we not learned anything from the past? Is there not a parallel in our country?\\"The Germans imposed the Nazi tyranny on themselves.\\"Hegel was one of the many influences on Hitler and Marx. Hegel and Marxism is still very much alive today in humanism, nationalism, \\"supreme state\\", racism, and mysticism."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book was one of the first histories of the Nazi era that I acquired for my library. Shirer had the unique perspective of actually being an American journalist for CBS in Berlin for many of the Hitler years. His journalistic aptitude shows itself greatly in the writing of this most important book. The book reads like a LONG newspaper article. Facts are presented and then there are extensive footnotes and references at the bottom of most of the pages for those who would like to follow up. Also, there is a wonderful index at the end of the book for those (like me!) who just want to read certain passages. Being that the length of the thing is 1500+ pages, sometimes, it is necessary to use the index!This book is an excellent resource for someone who is just starting to learn about Nazi Germany. Shirer does an excellent job of presenting the history up to point where he did his writing. Unfortunately, his history has become somewhat dated since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 (and the Soviet Union in 1991) has allowed the secret KGB archives concerning WWII to be opened. The availablity of this new source of information may make some of Shirer's conclusions about the end of the war invalid. Therefore, I highly recommend that one also read the Ian Kershaw biographies on Hitler which were published in the late 1990's/early 2000's (Hitler: Hubris and Hitler: Nemesis). These new biographies incorporate the newest information which has been released from the KGB within their pages.Otherwise, Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is an excellent history and an instant classic of this most important era of the 20th Century. This book should be used as a companion to Hitler's Mein Kampf, as it will help the reader of that book to understand some of the things that Hitler talks about. However, one can read this book on its own...but you will find yourself intrigued and wanting to read more! This period of history is most fascinating, and Mr. Shirer's work makes it all the more so!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I feel unworthy writing a review of this work, but I was so impressed with it that I feel moved to do so. I had been putting off reading this book for years, simply due to its volume--over 1100 tightly packed pages. But believe me, anyone who wants to understand how WW2 came to be, and what the Nazis were all about, should read this one.William Shirer was a journalist in Europe during most of the Third Reich's duration, and his first-hand experience with the major figures of the era give this book a wonderful, authentic feel. This is not a dull work of scholarship (as I had feared!) It is a priceless well-written and thorough history of the Third Reich. Shirer himself notes that perhaps a better history could be written 50-100 years following the war, with the benefit of detached perspective. However, this book proves that the opposite is also true--had Shirer not written this book we might never have had the opportunity to read a thorough work on this topic by one who observed much of the actual events and who saw and met many of the key figures of the Third Reich.Neville Chamberlain springs to life as one of the most craven politicians ever. Other figures of the time are vividly portrayed. After completing this book I felt that I had a much better understanding as to why the sellout at Munich, and World War II in general, have had such a profound effect upon the politics of the modern era--not merely because of the horrific death and destruction that the war entailed, but because of the tragically bad decisions that resulted in the war itself.Anyone who wants to understand the European portion of WW2 should read this book. And a great read it is."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I first read this in the 9th grade, a long time ago,and have checked into it often since then. Looking back,the history of Hitler's ideas are clearly explained,and anti-semitism in Europe had a long,sordid history way before anyone had heard of Hitler. His rise to power,ideas,and plans are shown to have been clear very early on with MEIN KAMPF, a book not read or taken seriously by enough people. I thought the blackmailing of Generals Blomberg and Fritsch in 1937 was a highlight,since that episode has often been overlooked elsewhere. The planning for the attack on Poland (9/1/39) is well done,as is the British and French response. The actions of the &quot;Supreme Warlord&quot; throughout the war are so well described that it's easy now (without looking at the book)to remember Mr. Shirer's account.And the horrors of the death camps are made as clear as can be. My only perhaps negative remembrance,after having read many volumes on this subject, seems to be that Mr. Shirer did not adequately explain the appeal of this ex-corporal on a great,modern nation. He does not really explain the complexity of the Fuehrer, a many faceted individual, not just the carpet-eating, raving, single-testicled person of myth. No one gets to such a position in the world,starting out from nowhere, without a dynamic side. In short, it seems Hitler's personal magnetism,even charm,his photographic memory, his seeming amazing ability to make the right decisions, even after looking into the abyss, made him a fascinating figure for many,who followed him to the bitter end. It seems that Mr. Shirer only paints the monster and not the whole man, and perhaps that does not really explain all the horrors that rest on the shoulders of this person and his lieutenants,and followers."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Nobody can be more qualified than William Shirer to writea book on Nazi Germany, having not only seen the reich fromthe inside but having assimilated most of the siezeddocumentation at Nurnberg.He gives a very good idea of what political and social reasonsled to the situation where a megalomaniac could take overthe country with the full backing of its people. The variousplots and plans made months or even a year before they wereput into operation are very well detailed.On the cons side, however, Shirer cribs a lot about whatcould have been done if the British or the American governmentswere more on the alert and had not followed a policyof appeasement of Hitler. This is justified to an extentbut a little into the book it comes in the way of theflow of narration.Overall it is an amazing book and a must read for anyhistory lover. Those who do not learn from history arecondemned to repeat it and what better way to learn fromhistory than read about how political games were played inthe past and how it lead to a holocaust.As a supplement to having read this book a couple of yearsback I visited the Dachau concentration camp near Munichand it hit me full force especially in the context of thisbook."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"An encyclopedic yet immensely readable account of the spectacular rise to power of Adolf Hitler &amp; the German Nazi party &amp; their subsequent downfall.Shirer's account has the freshness &amp; verve that only the best journalism can provide .He traces the rise of fascism in post WW-1 Germany against the backdrop of the latent authoritarianism inherent in the Teutonic makeup____Fichte,Hegal,Wagner &amp; Neitzshe____which in turn may have its roots in the Reformation of Martin Luther.Hitler's rise from a penniless,homeless vagrant in fin-de-siecle Vienna to his stint as a low level soldier in WW-1 is ably narrated .The birth of the Nazi party in the early 1920's ,the Munich beer hall putsch and the undeniable role of the great depression(&amp; the ensuing inflation/unemployment) in catapulting Hitler to power is mentioned in detail .

The terrible story of how a group of madmen brought sorrow to the planet is brought vividly to life in this classic history. It is a titanic work on a titanic subject.The author, Bill Shirer, took some risks. He interposed his own judgements and feelings with the facts which he sets down. Seeing as how Shirer saw the Nazi regime with his own eyes, and his revulsion is based on his own experience, and almost all of his readers will share that revulsion, the risk pays off. Few historians could take a risk like this, or should. Because of what Shirer (and the world) saw and suffered, he did right.Do not rely solely upon this book to learn about the Holocaust. The section of this book which retells the story of this ultimate crime is based on German documents and testimony gathered immediately after the war (and before almost all of the surviving perpetrators decided to collectively shut up). As a result, the section uniformly treats the Jewish and other prey of the killing system as passive victims. A balanced view is required, to say the least, and I am sure that most readers with a strong enough stomach to tackle this book will go on to read the testimonies of survivors and get closer to a real view of this almost unbelieveable story. However, the German sources quoted here at great length are useful should there be anyone reading this book who is so unfortunate as to believe that the Holocaust never happened. It did, and you can read about it here, in the words and documents of the men with blood on their hands.Once again, this is a true, scary, unforgettable classic of the art of historical journalism."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"It is a very sad thing to see that this ancient, very shalow and badly researched book of Shirer is still considered by many as a source of reliable information about the Third Reich and Nazi Germany. It tells mainly about the level of knowledge about the subject at hand of the people who think that. Shirer's book has but one thing to its credit: it's very well written. A long, charming, feather-weight journalistic report. As a boy, I have read it with fascination. It's a marvelous thing to read when you're 11 years old. It's like the light classical music records you hear when you make your first steps into hearing classical music. But things change and people grow up and just like listening to Peter and the Wolf or the Toy Symphony so with the Rise and Fall. Past a certain age and level of knowledge it is pathetic to consider it a worthy reading material. The book is simply childish."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Shirer's rise and fall of the third riech has to be #1 on the list of dramatized biased sensationalist works of the third reich.he claims in part to base his account of the third riech on having drinks with some of the high command,including hitler,(who didn't drink).the only thing I think this book had right was probably that it was the first complete cronology of events and their dates,otherwise it is needlessly written in a way that gives the reader the obvious impression that shirer hated hitler and wants the reader to convay the same sentiments after redaing his book.shirer states his theory that hitler became an anti-semite very early in his childhood,(how can one so young no anything of such matters unless it's imposed on him?).also,he describes hitler's down and out day's as a young man as being a derelict because he lived in flop houses.his art work is also insulted by shirer,while others prominant in the art world praise his work,(I guess the journalist can't figure out weather he'd rather try be a historian or art critic.)Shirer's rise and fall of the third riech is ok if you want events and their dates in cronilogical order,but it is otherwise very backdated,extremely one sided,and worst of all increadibly innaccurate.although it is said to be the best historical account on the third reich,(although their are plenty of movies these days that make fantastic claims about how good they are and turn out to be terrible.it sounds more like a selling angle to me.)try reading hitler's war by david irving.you will not get a more accurate and updated account by a real historian than this."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"i was made to read this book for a class i am taking and it was torture. i didn't understand a word of it, it was way too long, and just plain not enjoyable. unless you are a nazi enthusiast i do not recommend it!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Although this book may be a classic it is not at all high school reading. It is required reading for my Honors World History class and many honors students are failing to understand this book and are in turn failing the class. Its too long and Shirer rambles on about stupid things. I think it would be better written if he got to the point and didnt beat around the bush."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Easily the best historical work I have read on either World War I or World War II. The sheer amount of information Shirer waded through and placed in his book shows a massive amount of research and investigation was involved. Not only is there an abundance of information, but it is extremely well-written, as Shirer has a great way with words. If you want a book about the Second World War and that period, this has to be your first choice."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is one of the best histories I have ever read (I have read many.) To describe this book as boring beggars the imagination. Maybe if you are used to reading \\"graphic novels\\" ...Shirer was there, he witnessed the Nazi regime and WWII as a journalist on the spot in Europe, mostly in Berlin before the outbreak of the war. He had a priveleged position (in this, he is much like Churchill, when Churchill wrote his monumental history of the war -- another must-read.) Shirer was also a journalist who learned his craft when good writing was valued. He is an excellent writer, this story flows.I was intimidated by the length of the book -- for many years. Once I picked it up, I could not put it down. What a spell-binding story of a pivotal time/event in world history.I see some one picking nits such as the type of gun Hitler used to shoot himself: \\"Hitler shot himself on April 30, 1945 with a PPK not a \\"revolver\\" as the author erroneously writes, and the Germans used primarily (but not exclusively) the P08 Lugar and the Walther P38 as side arms, not \\"revolvers.\\" I do not mean to niggle over minor details but these are the things that drive historians insane.\\" You are. Niggling over unimportant very minor details. If that sort of thing drives you insane, get a grip. If the choice of suicide weapon (hmmmmm ... 9mm? 44-mag? 12-ga pump-action? what'll 'er be this fine morning?) had ANY bearing on the historical impact of the event (Hitler dead by his own hand) or was a mistake of some weight (say, he threw himself out of a window vs. shot himself with a pistol ...) I might bite. But forget it. The fact that the complaints about this book fall to this level should indicate the book's quality to you. (Do you really care about the name and family history of the foreman of the factory that made the carpets that the \\"tapis-fresser\\" enjoyed chewing? Think anyone would publish the book about it?)Historical objectivity? That-there's one of them oxymorons folks. At least Shirer was an eye-witness to most of the events recorded. At least he tells you straight-up when he's expressing his opinions ... All histories are written from a particular viewpoint. Pretending to be objective doesn't make you so. \\"[I]t is not without its faults\\" No kidding? I guess if your standard is perfection you had better throw out all history books.I have read most of Shirer's books on this period: Berlin Diary, The Nightmare Years, Midcentury Journey. They are also good and provide some additional context. But this book stands alone.Want a good history read? Want a good look at the Nazi regime, what brought them to power in a liberal democracy of well-educated people, and the reality of life under the regime? Here's your book. Superb, a must-read.At the very least, please read the chapter titled, \\"Inside the New Order,\\" which discusses the horrid, brutal realities of the Nazi regime and its system. Amazing.(If I were king, I would require this book for all 12th grade students as a prerequisite for graduation from high school. Democracy can provide fertile ground for evil. Beware!)I also highly recommend \\"Hitler's Willing Executioners,\\" by D. J. Goldhagen and \\"Berlin Journal\\" by R. Darnton, in addition to Churchill's history of WWII. (Anything by Churchill, for that matter.)"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Anyone who aims to cover the history of WWII in Europe thoroughly will necessarily read this book. Its greatest weakness - that it \\"was published relatively soon after WWII, by a journalist not a government minister, academic, or soldier\\" [S. Knasick, below] - is also one of its greatest points: Shirer may not have been a professional historian, but he lived in Germany as a journalist during Hitler's rise and he had a lot of direct experience to draw upon as he researched this story. To the later day reader, this read is as much interesting for the author's own contemporary prejudices and cross-cultural paradigms as it is for its historical depth. I only had two personal gripes with the book: First, it could have said more about the Soviet contribution towards defeating Germany (it is very much an English speaker's perspective on the war); and second, Shirer's severe judgments on the German people as being almost fundamentally flawed would no longer appeal to many readers. However, as I have already said, these inadequacies are also somewhat interesting insofar as they very much reflect the mood of the times.\\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" is probably the biggest book I've ever read. Just to fit it all into one volume requires exceptionally small print - and then the footnotes belonging to many pages carry a print that is smaller still. At first glance, therefore, its sheer size probably puts off most potential readers. But the book is highly readable, thoroughly interesting, and one doesn't have to get too far into it before they realise that found in its size will be hours and hours of fascinating and compulsive reading. From Shirer's thorough account of Hitler's own rise and fall to the rise and fall of a fascist nation, this book is an excellent read. It will remain a must read on WWII for a long time to come."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is truly an incredible work of history -- almost journalism, seeing that Shirer was actually present during most of the build-up of the Nazi state. His combination of documented scholarship and personal insight produce an extremely accessible while still very detailed account of what happened and, more importantly, why the events occurred the way they did as a result of the individual and state-level beliefs and motivations.That said, however, the book has one critical flaw, in that it fails to offer a reasonable answer to the most fundamental and desperately important question: how did so many people (the German public) allow such abominable atrocities to occur in their name? Shirer's answer basically comes down to bloodlust and a will to dominate being fundamental to the German national character. This is simply unacceptable, a complete cop-out on the very question that he is probably solely positioned to fully answer. There is *no such thing* as 'national character'; cultural differences to be sure, but no people are fundamentally so different from the rest of us that they take wholesale slaughter and oppression as a natural way of life.Perhaps there is no rational answer, and I can't hold Shirer responsible for finding one. But to blame the nature of the German is akin to the bigotry that brought the Nazis to power. I think the question of how Naziism gained so much support while being so extremely evil must be visited and re-visited until we recognize how to stop it. Common decency is the last hope of mankind, and we now know an entire nation can abandon it. Bush's 'Americans aren't like that' arguments aside, we need to make sure we know how to prevent it happening to us."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Nazi Germany fell so swiftly in the spring of 1945, the Third Reich had to surrender the minutely detailed records of the regime before those documents could be destroyed. This capture involved most of the archives of the German government and all its branches including Heinrich Himmler's secret police. Never before has such a vast treasure fallen into the hands of historians. Particularly interesting were the records of the &quot;Fuehrer Conferences&quot; on the daily military situation, the Nazi warlord's table talk with his party cronies, and his deliberate deceptions (international, national, and personal), all of which prove that he and his followers were criminals. How these criminals got to power and how they stayed there was no accident. It involved the social psychology of our species, the tendency of all of us to follow the herd even when the herd is going over a cliff. The lessons are clear and the truth of George Washington's advice is even clearer: &quot;Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.&quot; Yes, society is controlled violence. The reason we sleep well at night, one of the reasons anyway, is that the cops have guns. This book proves that what counts is who does the controlling. Who do you want? George Washington or George III? FDR or Joe Stalin? Harry Truman or Hitler? As for me, give me our bumbling politicians every time. They mean well and they won't foul up the universe. So please make it your new year's resolution to read Shirer's definitive work on Nazi Germany, a book that tells one of the most spectacular stories ever, a masterful vivid account of depressing and grim political, social, economic, and military violence. Once you start its 1500+ pages you will have trouble putting it down. And when you do put it down, you will pick it up again just as soon as you can."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is, to me, the best &#34;biography&#34; of the Third Reich that exists. This author himself is a primary source, because he witnessed much of the rise, actually living and working as a correspondent in Germany. Even so, his historiography is so good, He backs up every nuance of a &#34;fact&#34; with ample data and citations.We need to understand that nations--including ours--can be destroyed by the negligence, the lazy irresponsibility, of the &#34;adult voting&#34; public. People in a democracy need to at least try to educate themselves on what is REALLY going on in their state houses, and around the world, particularly before just lazily sending their children off to die in wars they really don't understand (2003 comes to mind...). Germany of the 1930s shows this in Shirer's works, particularly when emotions (fear and phoney patriotism) are used to simply, easily rile up the public. Racial issues seem to always play a role, then and now.We need to learn from books such as this what we quite evidently didn't learn from the Vietnam War, where I for one, as a young, idealistic American Airman, almost lost my life for nothing but the ugly stupidity of rich politicians in Washington who were wagging the dog."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I can see why some readers love this important book. It is a great report of a terrible time. Schirer did a wonderful job of mining primary sources to write the first draft of the history of WWII.As a book, however, it is not very exciting. The most interesting things are in the endnotes at the end of each chapter. The narrative itself kind of slogs along and suffocates the reader with endless detail.Reading the book and its descriptions is little like watching Mad Men on TV. The book is something of a cold war period piece. Schirer describes the Nazi leaders as \\"homosexual degenerates\\" as if that description will help us understand why they did what they did. He finds it preposterous that Japan would be a defender of \\"Western\\" civilization (the italics are his); and he continually comes back to the idea that the power of Hitler was connected to Germany's loss of its historic Christian character.Unlike the detailed descriptions of Hitler's miscalculations and fall, apart from the continual reminders that Hitler's rise and Germany's loss of its Christian character are somehow connected, we get little detail of the conditions that led to Hitler's rise and consolidation of power. A better title might be the Fall of the Third Reich because we learn very little about the rise.In the end, I would recommend reading the book, but like the invasion of Russia, it is a long slog. And that slog is made worse by the horrid Kindle version. If authors, publishers and Amazon want to charge for ebooks prices that are comparable to those they charge for print, they should at least proof read them before inflicting their computer generated output on the unsuspecting public."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Despite the \\"flaws\\" noted by others, I find the Kindle version a highly valued resource. You can search the entire book in nanoseconds, make notes and bookmark pages for later review. While maybe not as perfect as the print version, I find these electronic benefits more than worth the cost."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I picked this up on a friend's bookshelf and can't seem to put it down. Hitler's story is fascinating and terrifying. It demonstrates how someone with the type of ruthlessness that will stop at nothing can usurp ultimate power. We in America seem to have had a taste of fascism recently. Everyone should read this book and remind themselves that it can happen again.If you let a country or a people get too disenfranchised the seeds are sown for disaster. This author seems to have really done his homework. This is an important historical document."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Excelent book, very well written. The book is HUGE, with more than one thousand pages (!), but it is no boring at all. It is very complete, covering all the facts from the years before the WWII start, until some years after its ending. It puts you in each important fact place and time, explaining the real situation that leads to each movement. The chapters are well splited, that means you won't loose the main idea, eve if you read a chapter per month (for example). It is very reach in details, tolding even about the personal life aspects of each main piece who somehow had an important impact on the greatest war ever.

When I had a chance, I was turned away by the thickness and the weight of the book. With the Kindle eBook at a bargain price, I read the book recently and felt ecstatic. The book itself is well-known without needing further comments. I just want to say how happy I am now that I can enjoy the book with my light-weight Kindle eBook."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is a monumental work in the field of historical journalism. Mr. Shirer graduated from college and took a cattle transport to Europe to spend the summer sight-seeing. Fifteen years later, he was chased out by the Gestapo who were planning to nab him on a trumped up charge of espionage. In between those two moments he witnessed first hand the fall of the old European states France and England, and the emergence of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich.Shirer taps into the Hegelian historical model of the superman, or the individual, who through the force of his own personality and will, shape the course of world history for better or worse. Indeed the mid-twentieth century was perhaps the crowning moment of such a feature in world history, with such dynamic and driven personalities such as Hitler, Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill testing their abilities to lead their nations against each other. And the vacuum of such leaddership in France highlights the Hegelian model as France disappears from the stage in the first months of the war and does not return.This is not a book about World War II, however. It is a book about the Third Reich. The only details of the war in the pacific that emerge in the book are those relevant to events in the European theater. The book also focuses on the years leading up to World War II, rather than the events of the war itself. Shirer illustrates a pattern of behavior within the inner circle of the Third Reich and shows how that pattern was responsible for both the rapid rise of Nazi Germany and its downfall. It is a pattern of grim determination, ruthless paranoia, historical distortion and shrewd exploitation of the media to always blame its victims for the wars they start.Once the pattern is adequately defined and illustrated, however, the book seems to run out of steam towards the end. Tis could be due to the fact that Shirer was forced to leave Germany before the entry of America into the war, but I believe it has more to do with the relentless momentum of events created by Hitler and his inner circle which began to collapse all around them, and the puerile desperation of their final end game decisions which only hastened their demise rather than reclaim the momentum. In effect, the rooster they had created had come back home to roost, and they were caught in a web of their own making.I believe this is one of the landmark historical works of the twentieth century, alongside Shelby Foote's \\"Civil War,\\" and Oswald Spengler's \\"Decline and Fall of the West.\\" That said, the book does have its flaws. Shirer seems to have an affinity for Homeric motifs, such as \\"Goering the corpulent Reichs Marshal,\\" \\"Himmler, the mild-mannered chicken farmer,\\" and so on. It is not clear why Shirer uses this device over and over again. Perhaps it ihe wished to remind us of Goering's greed and Himmler deceptive self-effacing nature while he plots your downfall. And it fails to address the real tragedy--the wreckage of those great European states that had dominated world history for over two centuries. Britain alone would emerge from the ashes but its empire of the Sun would be no more within a generation after the war. Britain no longer had the resources or the wherewithal to maintain its hold on it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"this had to be by far the definitive history of nazi germany.this book is well written,and very informative. if you ever wanted to learn about the origins of the reich this book is for you.this book goes into great detail about adolph hitler's rise to power..his contempt for the west, his dreams of a 1000 year empire...its a compelling read and hard to put down.sure, its a bit long, but this is an important book. if you are a fan of ww2 or are studying this time period..you need to read this.."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Don't let the massive size of this book intimidate you: it is a first-class piece of work and is extremely readable despite its length. Mr Shirer is arguably the most qualified person to write this book, chronicling the entire history of the Third Reich. Starting with Hitler's rise to power, Shirer goes into incredible detail as to the circumstances leading to World War II (particularly under \\"Book 3: The Road to War\\"); this is due to his accessing secret Nazi documents discovered after the war. I have yet to read Shirer's complementary piece \\"The Rise and Fall of Adolph Hitler\\" nor John Toland's book on the same subject (both of which I have heard are great historical accounts in their own right), but they are on my \\"To Do\\" list!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is the complete history of Hitlers Germany from beginning to end.

The book was more in depth. When I hit this part of the book I could not put it down until the end.Another movie that readers of this book might find interesting is titled \\"Downfall.\\" It is a German movie with English subtitles that shows the last few days of Hitler in The Bunker. Here again the movie and the book both coincide and it is dramatic.Hitler was a \\"nut\\" with a force of conviction that held the whole house of cards together by sheer willpower."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"There are few threads of thought to consider in this book. First there is a prevailing theme throughout the book represented by the German word lebensraum, meaning \\"more land.\\" For the people of neighboring lands an onslaught of terror was felt. Hitler's original goal was always to conquer Russia and the Slavs as he despised Communism and the Jews that were driving the Russian state of mind as he believed it to be. This belief took root in him as a vagabond in Austria where he felt oppressed by Jewish merchants and businessmen. Secondly and ironically he always looked to the East and waged war with the West, presumably out of some poorly thought out strategy. While he held a vengeance towards France, he was willing to leave England and the West alone. Albeit his actions of bombing London for months on end contradicted even that of his many shallow convictions. Third was a theme that became a consistent irony was one where on the eve of every onslaught upon a neighboring country, leaders held out hope that \\"it would not happen\\". One could make an argument in defense of Poland and perhaps even France individually, but collectively the world leaders could not gain consensus on eminent threats or preventive action. They had to wait until the fox was in the hen house. Fourth, I am left aghast at Neville Chamberlain as he sold out the Austrians and the Czechs, but more so, the world leaders who through silence allowed this to happen. After closing the last page in this book I stand even more firmly in my view that this world of \`East' or \`West' ideologies owes a world of tribute and gratitude to Sir Winston Churchill. Finally, though the book incriminates Hitler, it is also about German people with Hitler as their representative and scapegoat of the servant German mind. They had eleven hundred years of practice through the first and second Reich's, and shallow convictions seemed to loom just below the surface of the German people of this time as well.to view my complete review please reference keword cigarroomofbooks"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"read this book when it was first published.

Shirer was a CBS correspondent who was at the right place at the right time. He kept a diary of the happenings in Germany during the time of the formation of the Nazi government. He saw the political maneuvers of the Nazi Party in gaining power in German Politics. The audacity of the Party gaining control of a Democratic Government without a majority. The effect of a weak centralized government under President von Hindenburg leads to Nazism.Shirer witnessed the formation of a totalitarian government. He saw the tightening of all cultural activities and the progressive pogroms against the Jews.Shirer details all the scheming of the taking over of the Rhineland, Sudetenland and Austria. His plan to enter into war with Poland under false pretenses finally has England and France entering into the great conflict. Shirer was there recording all that had happened.This book was first published 14 years after the end of the Second World War. This exhaustive study was based on Shirer's observations, which in itself are classic. He was there. He saw it first hand!! Richard Evans study seems to be a definitive study in the English language of this German time period.

Although reading past this book would be a great investment in time and energy - one should at least start here (regarding a real study of history). The history channel can only go so far in presenting facts about Hitler and the Nazis, however; the devil is in the details, and Shirer's book is full of them. If one weren't to read this book and merely gather information of the subject from television, then that person would have to be considered ignorant on the subject.

Shirer was one of \\"Murrow's Boys\\" broadcasting the WWII from Vienna and Berlin. The size of the book put me off then. Finally I got around to reading in June-July 2012. IT IS DAZZLING! Horrifying. Brilliant. The extra filip: Shirer was on the scene. He knew the bastards. He spoke German. Heard Hitler live numerous times. Covered the Nuremberg trials. Mined all the secret Nazi documents and diaries of the perpetrators. Hitler was a mesmerizing nutcase and you get to to see the guy up close and personal. The book is filled with revelations. For example, Hitler delayed Barbarossa (the invasion of Russia) for three weeks while he dealt with Romania. This delay cost Germany the War, because that critical 3 weeks was when the Russian winter closed it. This book is delicious. Brilliant. Infinitely satisfying. See how the master dictator did it (and how he screwed up). Absolutely relevant today in the era of Saddam Hussein, the Assads (p&egrave;re et fils), Kadafi et. al. Buy it and savor it!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Almost since its initial publication in 1959, William Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich has been regarded as a classic text in the canon of historical narratives documenting Germany under Nazi rule. I've never been an aficionado of this material, but I became interested in the history of mid 20th century Germany following a trip to Berlin and reading Richard Bessel's \\"Germany 1945: From War to Peace\\" and Erik Larson's \\"In the Garden of Beasts.\\" Shirer's enormous tome was something that I had wanted to attempt since then but I found its length a bit daunting. While it certainly does require dedicated reading time (and lots of it), it is undeniably a complete, thorough and highly readable history, worthy of the critical praise it has garnered over the decades.Shirer offers a unique perspective among historians of this era since he witnessed many of the events surrounding the rise of the Nazis while serving as a foreign correspondent for CBS radio. The eyewitness aspect of his account, coupled with the fact that it was written relatively soon after the events of World War II lend it a powerful sense of reality in that many histories, often written long after the events being chronicled, may feel \\"diluted\\" or slightly fictionalized. Shirer's effort feels very \\"of the moment,\\" when the horrors of World War II and its aftermath were still fresh in the global consciousness.I've often been baffled over how an advanced western culture like that of 20th century Germany could have ever descended into fascism and totalitarian rule. Shirer's narrative suggests several primary factors: (1) the extremely punitive reparations imposed on Germany by the allies following World War I; (2) the economic deprivations of the 1920s and 30s (often tied to those reparations); (3) the fact that Germans had never known true democracy made them somewhat predisposed to leadership from the top, down; (4) the inherent weakness and ineffectiveness of the Weimar Republic; and (5) the political craftiness of Adolph Hitler who, despite being the embodiment of human evil and megalomania, was a gifted politician who knew precisely how to outmaneuver his opponents at every turn. Momentous points in history often turn on such confluences of unique conditions.Shirer covers all of these conditions in detail such that the reader has a very clear sense of the atmosphere of Germany and the mind of the German people during Hitler's rise from obscurity, to prominence and ultimately, to complete dominance. Hitler's political maneuverings during the 1920s and early 1930s make for fascinating reading as Shirer documents all the points at which history could have easily taken a different path but did not.Of course, most will be familiar with the major events of World War II but Shirer devotes many pages to the politics leading up to Hitler's initial conquests. He relies on reams of documents made available through capture at the War's conclusion to trace the discussions, negotiations and demands made between the German state and its weaker neighbors, all of whom would eventually come to be controlled by the Nazi party. These communications offer a true insight not only into the minds of the Nazis but also of their enablers like Neville Chamberlain and his feckless administration. Fresh from the horrors of the first World War, Europe's leaders were prepared to do almost anything to avoid a second massive conflict. They never imagined that their efforts to avoid it would actually set its stage.There were times when I felt that Shirer provided almost too many direct quotations from official governmental communiques and diplomatic documents, to the point where they became somewhat repetitive. It's my only real criticism of the book and the only reason that I deducted one star from my rating.So much of the book is dedicated to the politics of Nazi germany and its interactions with other governments that it almost seemed like a straight-ahead military and political history. I wondered: where is the coverage of Nazi atrocities? I needn't have wondered. They're covered in full detail towards the end of the book. Every time one is tempted to think that they cannot be further shocked by the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis, there's always more. The capacity to be shocked where these men were concerned seems to know no limits. Shirer does his duty to remind anyone who reads his book of precisely how evil human beings can be when under the thrall of a immoral leadership.At the end, I was thankful to reach the conclusion of \\"Rise and Fall.\\" Not because it's not a well-written history, but because the horrors and national insanity that it documents become difficult to bear after a while. I felt relieved that I had the freedom to simply walk away from this history without ever having had to live through any part of it."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"As someone who lived during the period described by Mr. Shirer I have found this history to be the most accurate and detailed description of the start of the Third Reich. How Hitler and his henchmen, all cruel and evil men, used everything from cajoling to murder and horrible atrocities to gain and keep power. Shirer also shows the reader how power, and the desire for power, lead to the corruption and limitless ambition that caused the ultimate fall of the Third Reich. I am anxious for Amazon to make this book available again as my copy is worn out and falling apart and I want a new one. Please hurry."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"An excellent price for this huge paper back! I have read the first book and find it very enlightening. Hitler is described as an orator, a propagandist, and an organizer. Maybe a bit too much like someone in today's world? Scary...."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I was well and truly satisfied with my purchase of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany. It arrived well within the timeline promised in good condition. Thanks, guys.David W. McPeak"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Let me tell you firstly, this book was a summer assignment for me to get into AP History at my school. I picked this book for I was looking for a World War II novel to read. I was not prepared for what I was about to read. This book is filled to the brim with facts and good facts they are. Shirer makes this book flow with easy and grace, which I would not think possible. This book takes you through the whole war(from the German view) and before and after. I found the infomation on Hitler's rise to be quite interesting. From the streets of Vienna to the Beer Hall to the Chancellory and so on. Very interesting and good read. I must now say that I may read this again in the future, but is ain't going to be for any class, just enjoyment of history!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"It is hard to adequately review a book that is almost 1,150 pages in length without missing at least some detail that is critical to the assessment. That being said here's my review:This book was written in 1960 and draws most of it's substance from a list of sources which Shirer describes in the Foreword. These include many of the remaining OKW and Nazi HQ documents which the Allies confiscated in the capture of Germany. Additional sources include first hand accounts by those surviving Germany generals who escaped the death penalty at Nuremburg. It does not, however, contain the more recent military history that was released with the fall of the Soviet Union.Rise and Fall was a mammoth undertaking for it's time both in scope and in size. It's greatest strength lies in it's ability to describe, in detail, the many major events of the war from the rise of the National Socialist party under Hitler and Rhoen to the Russian counteroffensive into Berlin. It's main focus is on the political history of both the Nazi party and Nazi Germany itself; the main players are the leaders of the great powers at the time: Neville Chamberlain, Molotov and Stalin, Churchill, Roosevelt; the leaders of the Nazi party: Hitler, Goering, Goebbels, Himmler; and the leaders of the Germany army: Jodl, Keitel, Rommel and others.Most of this book concerns what lead to World War II and how those events are what led to September 1, 1939. The actual events of the war take up only a small portion of this book as they serve as a backdrop and catalyst for the political maneuverings of all the above mentioned individuals. Throughout the book the main emphasis remains Adolf Hitler: his rise to power, his anti-Semitism, his ruminations in Mein Kaumf and his megalomania.I highly recommend this as a good \\"starter\\" book for World War II. All of the main characters are intimately described, all of the major events are very thoroughly detailed, and the book covers the entire war. Finally, the book is written in a dramatic fashion which makes it a great page turner and helps get you through the sheer size of a book which will need atleast 2 months to really read."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I will spare everyone a stupid review by trying to make myself sound like a wannabe book critic and instead I'll get straight to the point. This book is great from the first page to the last. I didn't have much knowledge of the Third Reich before reading this book but this book easily changed that. No, it doesn't go in depth into the war but this book ISN'T based soley on the war, but on the Third Reich itself! The last 300 pages or so are incredible, mainly when it talks about the final attempt to kill Hitler and what happens to the plotters afterwards when the attempt fails! My advice is even if you aren't interested in reading about Hitler and the Third Reich, start reading it and you WILL be!"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I have looked at this book on my shelf for over 35 years. It is so massive at 1,150 pages - I think it could stop a bullet - that it has intimidated me. So, in a moment between jobs, I took it on: it sets, in a word, THE STANDARD for all subsequent histories of one of the darkest chapters of the 20C. This is brilliant and will survive as a classic of the genre of first-rate history as written by a reporter who was there.The first 1/4 of the book is about the rise of Hitler. He was a bum and dreamer in Austria, had a galvinising experience as a corporal in WWI, and linked himself to bizarre and parochial right-wing nationist groups in the 1920s, which were terrible years of crisis in greater Germany. Shirer brilliantly delineates the stages of this, as Hitler stepped to the stage of an obsure Bavarian group of about 30 fanatics, to become the indisputed leader of Germany by 1933. This was a work, in a peculiar period that was not as cosmopolitan as today, that was political genius. Shirer demonstrates, without depth-psychology vocabulary, how Hitler felt what his generation suffered deeply and then articulated it in a political format. This is truly brialliant scholarship and, at times, great writing.The next quarter of the book is devoted to diplomatic history, from the audacious triumphs of Hitler (Munich, etc.). While it loses its psychological acuity, the international context - and what a dictator could at the time accomplish in it - comes to the fore. It is an entirely different set of circumstances from today that involved Mussolini, the weakness of Chamberlin's England, and the neutral US. While there is much about the character of the actors, such as Germany's foreign minister Ribbentrop, who is characterised too frequently as an arrogant mediocity. This is where Hitler gains parts of Poland, the Sudeten, and Austria bloodlessly.Then comes the last half of the book. This makes for dreary reading in two ways. First, with the Blitzkrieg and the industry to support it, Hitler is momentarily triumphant. He takes France and Norway and the low countries with extraodinary speed, shocking a world mired in economic depression. This new war tactic involved tanks, airplanes that dominated the airspace to cut supply lines and communications, and quick movement of troops by rail or truck as they overwhelmed their confused adversaries by encirclement. As a fully developed system, it was a totally new form of warfare, and it took the great power France by surprise.Second, once Germany attacked the USSR, the war became one of attrition, a more traditional form along the lines of WWI. The USA entered and the vast resoures of the USSR created the traditional nightmare for Germany of a two-front war. It became a question of resources then, and Germany was essentially lost. The unbelievably vast machinery then set itself in motion to smash Nazi Germany, and it was then, as de Gaulle said, only a matter of time.So the last 1/3 of the book is about Nazi Germainy's mistakes and collapse. It is dreary reading, and has an inevitability about it that makes for boring reading. This was a slog and I have had enough of German history for at least two years!Shirer also covers what happended in Germany and then in the occupied countries. It was ugly and so well known that I will not go into it here except to say that modern Germany is no longer so parochial and this kind of thing can never happen again.Shirer is not perfect. His work is bound to its time, the 40-60s. He calls the SA, for example, \\"homosexual perverts\\". This is a traditional view of the times, but it dates the book. Nonetheless, this work sets the standard for all follolwing scholarship, and that makes it a classic. His writing style is clear and very personal.All is all, warmly recommended as a great work of scholarship, with many personal asides that add character and honesty t the work. This is a truly great book and the masterpeice of a lifetime."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book was phenomenal. A bit long, but an interesting read with tons of background throughout. Really enjoyed it even though it took a while to get in to the more &#34;exciting&#34; portions. The lead up is important, though, since as is often pointed out &#34;everything Hitler did was legal at the time.&#34;"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"Rise and Fall is not just a book about Nazi Germany and World War II. It is the book.The author used to be an American correspondent in Germany in the 1930s. After the war, he obtained access to secret German documents. Using said documents, he was able to write this account of the rise and fall of Hitler and Nazism.Rise and Fall is more than fifty years old and a lot of research has been done since there. Historians might cast doubt or question a detail here and a detail there, but there is no doubt that the book's narrative is overall truthful and accurate. Anyone who is interested in a serious study of that time period must absolutely read this book. Unlike many historians, the author, an old school journalist, does not engage in hypothesizing and debating, but simply describes what was happening behind the scenes at that time. If he says that X had happened, it is because he has documents that plainly state that X had indeed happened.The book is mainly about Hitler and the Nazis, which in many ways was one and the same. It starts with Hitler's origins, before he was even born, and moves on to his early life, rise to power, and then WW II. The section about Hitler's early life is short, but interesting. Hitler was a complete nobody before 1920, so there is precious little information about his youth. The fact that Hitler himself took pains to erase and lie about that period of his life does not help either.The lion's share of the book is about 1920s and 1930s. It covers Hitler stumbling on the Nazi party (he was not its founder) and leading it from an association of a few dozen people into a political powerhouse. The book then follows with Nazis overtaking Germany and the buildup to WW II.The section on WW II is quite long as well, but in my opinion not as quite interesting. It talks mostly about military operations, which are a matter of public record. This is in opposition to the 1920/1930s section, which focuses on the secret dealings that went on behind the scenes. But rest assured, no part of the book is boring. Even those who are familiar with that time period can find lots of new interesting things to learn about."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"great read, very informative, and makes you feel like this happened yesterday.i highly recommend this to anyone. cant wait for the coloring book to come out....weeeeeeeeeeeeee"},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"RECEIVED FREE COPY FROM LIBRARYShirer digs deep, going back to the 1800s to provide insight into Germnany's conditions and Hitler's lineage.

It was a historical work so well written and original in its research that I was sad to turn the last page but grateful to Shirer for the incredible work he'd done.Shirer was a CBS news reporter in Berlin during the pre-war years during Hitler's meteoric rise and covered the appeasement of Nazi Germany by the Western democracies, revealing thru his research that the Nazis were fully aware that if they were called to task at any time they would have been roundly defeated militarily and finished politically. This was evident from the internal papers Shirer was given access to after the war.Shirer uncovered many other previously undiscovered facts about Nazi political interference in the Wehrmacht High Command that ensured Nazi defeat, such as Goering & Hitler's decision to \\"terror\\" bomb London in retaliation for a small British bombing raid on Berlin, which turned out to be a disasterous decision on Hitler's part, because the strategic bombing of England's manufacturing had nearly destroyed Britain's radar defenses and defense manufacturing capacity at the time of Hitler's decision to abandon strategic bombing for \\"terror\\" bombing.This was a great book and if you are put off by the sheer volume of the book, don't be. It's a great read and if you have an interest an WWII, this is one book you simply must read."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"I haven't completed this book, yet. However, it is a frightening prophecy of what could happen again and again. Our civilization is still capable of the evil that was perpetrated by the Nazi demons.

Every day, evil men murder hundreds and thousands of innocent people, merely because of race and/or religious convictions.

As an advid World War two amateur enthusiast, I have a new appreciation of how Hitler came to power, and How the stars aligned to make this madman as influencial in the vast brainwashing of the german people as he was. He took a demoralized, defeated people and controled them with the promise that he would make them strong again and bring them out of the ashes of WW I.

I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This is a real reading project. My unabridged hard cover volume feels like the Manhattan phone directory, making it unwieldy to sit in bed and read. I had to buy a book stand to hold it on my lap desk!Once the ergonomic problems were overcome it is, of course, a most worthy read.Rather than recounting the details of the many battles of WWII (for example, the entire D-Day invasion is dispensed with in just a few pages), Shirer's book is instead focused on the mad genius and sheer will of Adolf Hitler and the fascinating story of his rise from poverty and obscurity to a position of absolute power. The book exhaustively details the political and diplomatic machinations that propelled Hitler and Germany into - and out of - WWII. Many pages are filled with footnotes (at a much smaller font size!) that give further detail about a subject in the main text. This virtually doubles the actual number of pages of reading material - it took me a solid three weeks of reading 1-2 hours a day to get through it.Coupled with this is a keen insight into the German mindset, both from a mythological and historical standpoint, with a particular emphasis on the sense of injustice and deep anger the German people felt following their defeat in WWI and the Treaty of Versailles. All of this is vital to understanding how Hitler - who by all accounts was a hypnotic orator - was able to manipulate those around him and, ultimately, the German people.Shirer has a unique perspective on the matter, having been both an eyewitness to many of the key events plus having had access to mountains of captured Nazi documents. He was also able to gain information directly from many of the principal figures involved. This allowed him to demolish the many self-serving recollections by various Nazi figures, and also to ferret out the inconsistencies and bona-fide errors found in many previously published works - even a few by Churchill himself.The countless numbers of diplomats, generals, world leaders, obscure figures, Nazi thugs and unfortunate victims are woven together to produce an historical reference without parallel.This is essential reading. It is the cornerstone of knowledge for any serious student of WWII and the horror of Nazi Germany."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"If you can only stand to read one book on Nazi Germany this is the one to pick. This book was written in 1960 and is still superior to any other book on Nazi Germany in print.It explains, without any psychobable or political correctness what Nazism was, why it was so attractive to the German people and how Adolf Hitler almost got away with conquering the world."},{"Title":"THE RISE AND FALL ON THE THIRD REICH","review":"This book is over 1000 pages and it is brimming with facts about Nazi Germany in particular and World War II in general. The author, William Shirer, does an excellent job of maintaining the reader's interest throughout this voluminous book. Chronicling Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist Party from the very early days to the end, he provides profound insight into a phenomenon which has left a deep and indelible mark upon modern history. Shirer resided in Germany during the years preceding World War II and he personally witnessed many of the events that he writes about in the book. Although more information has become available from East German archives and other sources since this book was published , The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich remains the most comprehensive and informative book on the history of Germany under Hitler."},{"Title":"The Last Flower - A Parable in Pictures","review":"E. B. White thought this was Thurber's best book I agree that it is among the best. Written for his young daughter, it is an anti-war book of the right sort, emphasizing both the inescapability of war hostility and the devastation war causes. It is a perfect book for an adult to read to a thoughtful child--or for any adult to read in any circumstance. The line drawings (cartoons is not quite the word for Thurber's unique visions) are simple and eloquent throughout. The book was prescient when it appeared just at the outset of WWII. The story ends with hope symolized by the one surviving flower that may restore happiness and beauty to the world. It is the flower we still enjoy contemplating, sixty years after Thurber drew it."},{"Title":"The Last Flower - A Parable in Pictures","review":"Definetely, a great Anti-War book.

There is not one, not even one funny thing in this book, but horror and tragedy and misery and darkness, all men made maladies being repeated over and over and over again. Nothing funny about it.

I read the British version, entitled 'Whispers of Betrayal' but I assume that this is the re-titled American version of the same book.The book is about the consequences of political actions and involves a disgruntled military man that disrupts life in London, through causing traffic congestion and taunting the Prime Minister, to make his pointThis was my first introduction to Tom Goodfellow, the books protagonist, but I was impressed with the character and may read some of the earlier books in the series now that I've completed this one. The book provides an interesting look at the British political system and how it runs but wasn't as fast paced as some of the American books that I've read in the same genre (i.e. Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware books). I'd give the book big points for how seriously it takes it's characters and how it doesn't take the simplistic black and white moral position that American books of this type seem to take.If you're looking for a political thriller about England that respects your intelligence, and teachs you a little bit about the British system of government, I'd recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"The Unheralded: Men and Women of the Berlin Blockade and Airlift","review":"&quot;The Unheralded&quot; fills a gap in the literature related to the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War. The book advances on a single theme - the resolve of nations and people who are caught up in great events and epic times. The author divides the manuscript into three essential parts: review of the period, personal sacrifices by the British and American participants along with the plight of 2.5 milion Berliners, and finally the future. This book should be of special interest to those who follow the history of the period, foreign relations, and personal sacrifices during periods of international upheaval.Ed Gere, airlift pilot, Professor of International Relations, and Historian, has written a seamless account of one of the great humanitarian events of the 20th Century. The Berlin Blockade and Airlift was an epic undertaking that turned on the national resolve of the governments of Great Britain and the United States and the resolve of individuals.The author opens with the final stages of World War II with a review of the conferences at Teheran, Yalta, and Potsdam. The period was characterized by the naive hope that the Allies could work at the problems of peace in the same spirit they had used in winning the victory. Gere notes that this simplistic notion of &quot;Trusting the Russians&quot; failed as the Allies watched the Soviets plunder their occupation sectors of Berlin and Germany.Several sections of the book focus on &quot;The Unheralded,&quot; or a sampling of stories everyday service men and women from Britain and the Dominions, the United States, and the Berliners who chose to stay during this period of uncertainty, had to say of their experience during the airlift. These are the memories of &quot;little &quot;people&quot; and not of Generals and Pilots. These are memories of those who loaded and unloaded the coal, fueled the aircraft, sentries who walked their posts in freezing rain, and the Berliners who refused to abandon hope for a better life. Ed Gere also devotes space to those who paid the supreme price: Commonwealth, German, and United States casualties are written in detail.The author wraps up the book on the 50th anniversary of the end of the blockade and beyond - what was gained? As President Truman said in the beginning as he wrote in &quot;Years of Trial and Hope,&quot; this was not a struggle over Germany. In a larger sense it was a struggle over Europe. It was won by the thousands of nameless and faceless men and women from the Commonwealth, the United States and 2.5 million Berliners."},{"Title":"The Unheralded: Men and Women of the Berlin Blockade and Airlift","review":"The Berlin airlift was one of the watershed events of the twentieth century. Had the Soviet Union expelled the Western powers from Berlin, history might have taken a different course. There might have been a third world war or all of Germany might have been drawn into the Soviet orbit.Author Edwin Gere helped avert these potential disasters. He flew in the airlift, but this is not a memoir of his 184 trips down the corridors. Rather, it is one pilot's tribute to those he calls &quot;the unheralded&quot;--the thousands of people outside the cockpit who made those flights possible. The heart of the book presents the personal stories of dozens of Britons, Americans, and Germans who contributed in one way or another to the airlift's dramatic and unexpected success. Although Gere tells each individual's story simply, without hype or spin, the cumulative effect is tremendously moving and inspiring.Historians like to argue whether great leaders or impersonal forces control events. Heartwarming, stimulating, and informative, &quot;The Unheralded&quot; vividly recreates a time when ordinary people overcame an extraordinary challenge and changed the course of history."},{"Title":"The Unheralded: Men and Women of the Berlin Blockade and Airlift","review":"If you are interested in history, especially WWII and the beginning of the cold war, this is a great read. The author gives voice to the many unsung heroes of the Berlin Airlift, and chronicles in a remarkable way each of those who died in the endeavor. Gere provides a fascinating insight into the politics of the time and the personal stories of those who helped alter the course of history. The author, who flew in the airlift, is too modest and leaves out his own story. Still, a great piece of history."},{"Title":"The Unheralded: Men and Women of the Berlin Blockade and Airlift","review":"This is one of the best books on the airlift that I have read so far. You can not get any better than reading a book that was written by a pilot that actually flew during the airlift. The best part about this book was that I got to meet Edwin Gere personally while we were shopping at the local PX in Stuttgart, Germany. It was exiting to hear his personal accounts from that time. After listening to his stories, he presented me with a SIGNED copy of this book. I will never forget that day, and will keep that book for as long as I live. GET THIS BOOK NOW!!!

Given my beliefs, am I a \\"postmodernist\\", \\"Critical Theorist\\", \\"symbolic/interpretivist\\", \\"constructionist\\"? I know I'm not a positivist anymore. To sort this out, I had read directly in philosophy (difficult going), social theory (less difficult but still not easy), and management theory but I was having trouble getting a handle on it. Then I found Hatch & Cunliffe's book on Organizational Theory and I thought it was great, that is, until I discovered Understanding Management Research by Johnson and Duberley.Johnson and Duberly not only clearly define and describe the various views but more importantly they clearified two issues that had been bothering me. First, what is the role of ontology? To me that seemed to be a bifurcation point but this wasn't clearly laid out in Hatch & Cunliffe's book or the other readings. Johnson and Duberley make it very explicit in a table in the last chapter and I think they've got it right. Second, I was having trouble placing ethnography and other qualitative types of research. They are often placed in the constructivist/hermeneutical realm but I knew some of it was clearly positivistic. Johnson and Duberley clarified that it can be in either area. As with most things, it is not always black and white but shades of gray.

However, this collection does little more than offer superficial information on every country in Central Europe. If you want to go anywhere besides the capitals and most well-known tourist &quot;traps&quot;, forget it. I was particularly dissapointed with the book's treatment of Germany and Switzerland. Very vague, very minimal. If you want to visit any of the countries in Central Europe, buy the Lonely Planet Guide to that country or look for a different publisher. Sorry guys, this one doesn't go in my travel bag."},{"Title":"Pictorial Archive of Lace Designs: 325 Historic Examples (Dover Pictorial Archive)","review":"I know and appreciate very much Ms. Grafton's books. Being a lacemaker, a crocheter and an embroiderer, I really love the variety of laces presented in this book. Antique prints, drawings and photographs bring us many examples of historical laces. Needlelace plus Bruges, Venetian, Milanese, Teneriffe, Battenberg laces and Square-net embroidery are all presented in this book. Although very appealing to the eye, it could disappoint the novice lacemaker, because there are no instructions, prickings or diagrams; only a wealth of exquisitely detailed laces from many ages and countries. Anyway, it's a good source for advanced lacemakers (embroiderers, crocheters...): they can draw inspiration from those patterns to develop their own designs and prickings."},{"Title":"Pictorial Archive of Lace Designs: 325 Historic Examples (Dover Pictorial Archive)","review":"I ordered this book in the hopes that I would find something I could use for work. I am a graphic designer. From my point of view, this book is perfect. Every page is filled with black and white, (probably bitmapped) images of lace. Some are art deco in style. Some look more like they are from the arts and crafts style. Some are more geometric. All are intricate. There are about 2 pages of publisher's note focusing on the history of lace. There are 2 sets of alphabets and 1 set of numbers. It was an excellent find for me. Hope it will be for you as well."},{"Title":"Pictorial Archive of Lace Designs: 325 Historic Examples (Dover Pictorial Archive)","review":"While this book shows incredible detail in the images of lacework, it does not provide a single word on the sources or dates of the lace pieces.

The African-American Migration Narrative (Race and American Culture)","review":"Farah Jasmine Griffin's invaluable book brings together a wide variety of sources -- from novels and poetry to photography and music lyrics -- to illustrate how migration has impacted African-American life and art. The writing is smooth and concise, but I particularly enjoyed the way Griffin creates a new vocabulary for discussing urban/rural cultural representations. She also looks at the way gender impacts migration narratives, which I found helpful. This work would be extremely helpful to anyone studying African-American literature, particularly Richard Wright, Toni Morrison, or Gloria Naylor as well as blues singers and the artist, Jacob Lawrence."},{"Title":"Maternal-Infant Nursing Care, 3e","review":"This book is very well written.

They range from highly salted to soy based to vinegar based to rice bran based - many we would consider simple marinated vegetables. Eggplant, burdock, cabbage, ginger, turnips, rape flower, garlic, plums, daikon, pineapple, kumquats, ... a wide variety of ingredients serve as the base for these pickles. The book shows step by step how to pickle and serve these foods in glorious style.As an added bonus for the adventuresome, several of these vegetable pickles can also substitute nicely for South Asian pickled vegetables. The \\"Pickled Seven Vegetables\\" can be used as a chutney or salsa. \\"Asparagus in Mustard Soy Sauce\\" and \\"Grilled and Poached Peppers\\" can serve as side dishes.

I also think it's a great value for the price; as large as the hardback is (more than 140 pages), it's only $24.95.The atlas starts with a contents page, which lists countries and regions by continent. (This page can be viewed on Amazon). If this isn't sufficient, there's also an eighty-page index in the back that contains more than 45,000 entries. They're in alphabetical order, of course, with the map references and page numbers accompanying them. Combining the contents page and index, and considering the maps are in alphabetical order within their continent groupings, I don't see how organization in this atlas is a problem.Following the contents page are a couple pages explaining how to read maps and atlases, and how this particular atlas works. There's then an introductory section dedicating a page to each continent. Each page has colorful photographs and text describing the continent's people, wildlife, landscapes, and history. Accompanying the text are fact boxes with such statistics as land area, population, most populous city, and longest river.Next comes a page featuring pie graphs showing how Earth's land, energy, population, and population growth is divided among the continents. The page opposite it serves as an index map and legend for the entire atlas. A political and physical world map are the last pages before the maps begin.Though people may differ in their opinion, Rand McNally boasts its maps are \\"very user-friendly, with a clean, uncluttered look, easy-to-read type, and attractive colors.\\" Supplementing the maps are \\"hypsometric and bathymetric color tints illustrating land elevations and water depths; shaded relief depicting mountains, valleys, and other landforms; and a locator map showing regional context.\\"Perhaps what makes this atlas most unique are its individual maps of the fifty U.S. states and ten Canadian provinces. They include inset maps of major cities, county boundaries, shaded relief to show landforms, and more.I do wish it had some astronomical information like the Oxford New Concise World Atlas does...this would be the only area in which I see it lacking.Maybe some users feel there are better atlases out there, but there's certainly nothing wrong with this one! It's a good value and pleasant to look at, and has everything a world--and state and province--atlas should, and even a little bit more."},{"Title":"Rand McNally world atlas","review":"My daughter needed a world atlas for 5th grade. This is a very detailed atlas, but it was not organized in a way that was easy for my daughter to do her homework, which was much more basic. For example, she needed to know the capital of Missouri. The page for the state of Missouri showed pretty much every single city in that state. The capital city had no indicator, and the text was smaller than other city names, to indicate the size of the city. I'd recommend this atlas for an older student, not elementary or middle school."},{"Title":"Rand McNally world atlas","review":"This isn't the most complete and authoritative atlas around, but it's a lot better than our old completely out of date one, and it's manageable, both pricewise and sizewise."},{"Title":"Rand McNally world atlas","review":"I teach Adult Education and nothing works better than visual aids.

What this gives me, is a mechanistic approach to how things are done. But what I am wondering is if this is how certain spiritual things which are beyond our comprehension are brought into comprehension for Bruce. What I am saying here is that these spiritual &quot;functions&quot; may not be as they appeared to Bruce, but in order for Bruce to understand what he was experiencing, it was made to appear as he experienced it...thus, if it were you or me experiencing these things...would we experience them just as Bruce did? Just because our experience is &quot;different&quot; does not lessen the value of how Bruce perceived these things. What is important, is that they DO exist, however they are truely carried out in whatever reality they really exist in.God continuously makes for us what is incomprehensible, comprehensible to the extent that we may perceive in some fashion, at our own level of spiritual development, what IS. Therefore, I do not doubt what Bruce experienced, I only wonder if a different individual would perceive the same functionalities differently, depending upon level of understanding and level of spiritual development in context of soul development.What I did find very tedious was the jumping exercizes with White Bear, which gave me little relevance and sort of bored me to death. Bruce could have shortened his extensive discourse on this, and gotten down to the facts a little bit quicker.What I found most strange, was The Earth Core Crystal thing, and the necessity to boomerange one's soul into a higher focus level (readers who are unfamiliar, read book 1!). This was so that Bruce and others could contact the aliens who didn't know what emotion was. I found this part to be incredulous, considering that I believe God creates everything as a reflection of God, including aliens...though I cannot say for sure that God has not experimented with creating alternate beings NOT of God's personal image and likeness who may not possess the essential qualities of emotion. I am one of those people who believe God in God's Absolute Condition is Pure Unconditional Love. Therefore, its very hard for me to imagine God creating beings who lack any concept whatsoever of emotion and need to learn it from us earthbound souls.The alien races were here to witness a massive deathkill of humanity...so we are lead to believe, but instead, came away stunned with first contact with the experience of LOVE! Bruce calls this, the GroupGathering...a group of alien races gathered here to witness the massive deathkill (so they think) or massive reduction of the human race. I cannot say that this will not happen in my reality of experience here as the future is yet to unfold, and obviously, our world is headed for serious ecological turmoil as portended by the Climatologists.I am a little doubtful that its necessary to boomerang ourselves to get to higher spiritual levels. TM in purest form of &quot;I&quot; allows for migration to the higher spiritual planes. I am thinking that the entire Monroe Method is designed to investigate the low and medium level astral planes immediately adjacent to Earth...while not being able to explore the higher relms of purer, lighter spirit.I knew all along that Bruce was going to discover that the other lady was merely his feminine self expressed...what took so long Bruce for you to realize that Spirit can express as either male of female? There was no mention of reincarnation in this series...once again, a serious lack of interpretation in regard to the Divine and the purpose of the development of the Soul. While I consider these three books to be highly valuable in terms of their contribution to the enlightenment of who we are, I find the lack of context to the Divine and to the Soul to be a drawback. Bruce, you need to get into these areas to fully explain what its really all about that you are doing and experiencing! In Spirit, there is no room for agnosticism.I look forward to Book 4, I hope it leaves out the tedious exercizes of jumping and other such things, and gets more into what is actually SEEN.My grade is A- for this book, A+ for effort"},{"Title":"Voyages into the Afterlife (Exploring the Afterlife)","review":"Voyages Into the Afterlife, by Bruce Moen, is the third book in his Exploring the Afterlife series. The series is a continuing account of his exploration into non-physical realms, which he began in 1992.Moen, who studies with the Monroe Institute in Virginia, first learned \\"retrieval,\\" which is helping people who have recently died and need assistance with moving fully into the Afterlife. Once he learned the basics, he began serious exploration, the fascinating details of which he describes in this book.In his out-of-body, or non-physical form, Moen travels to the center of the Earth, where he enters the \\"earth-core crystal,\\" as well to the far reaches of the Universe. He also meets with other non-physical beings, some from outer space and some from Earth. Some beings are previously deceased humans, while others are the out-of-body manifestations of still-living humans.Wherever he travels, and whomever he contacts, one message is emphasized again and again to Moen: that \\"pure, unconditional love\\" is the center of all existence. He speculates that the upcoming \\"Earth Changes\\" will initiate an unimaginably powerful infusion of pure, unconditional love that could change humankind forever.Moen says that his explorations have shown that the Afterlife provides an \\"opportunity to live in complete freedom\\" after we die. He also says that you don't have to take his word for it, that \\"you can explore There yourself and learn from your own direct experience. There you might discover not just hope, but also knowledge\\" which can erase the fear of death.Voyages Into the Afterlife, along with the first two volumes in the series, belong on the shelves of every reader curious about what exists beyond the physical world."},{"Title":"Voyages into the Afterlife (Exploring the Afterlife)","review":"This is the third book in an evolving story of afterlife adventures with Bruce Moen. Skillfully explained without interpretive fluff. He tells it like it is and explains the structure of the Afterlife like no one else. The first two books explain how he came about his abilities to percieve the afterlife and are well worth the read. This third one is where the fun begins! Keep a look out for his fourth book where he gets an extensive look within the Afterlife with tour guide the late Robert A. Monroe."},{"Title":"Voyages into the Afterlife (Exploring the Afterlife)","review":"Bruce Moen deserves to be better known and this is why I want to write this short comment. Mind opener is an understatement; this book describes such a wider reality to the human condition that it truly causes one to rethink our being on earth and beyond. While at times the stuff seems incredible, Bruce still manages to remain the level headed person that we expect from a trained engineer. The concepts are exciting and they are often corroborated by others who have shared his experiences, thus validating much of it. I truly recommend it."},{"Title":"Voyages into the Afterlife (Exploring the Afterlife)","review":"This book three in the \\"Exploring the Afterlife\\" series of Bruce Moen is an excellent continuation of his unfolding journey into awareness.

I highly recommend this series if you are interested in afterlife exploration. Fascinating!"},{"Title":"Voyages into the Afterlife (Exploring the Afterlife)","review":"Moen's book recounts an intriguing series of personal journeys undertaken during classes at the Monroe Institute (TMI). The classes there build on experiences by its founder Robert Monroe detailed a series of books written over a span of many years. In a sense the Moen chronicle (this is vol 3) picks up where Monroe leaves off using the same kind of annoying jargon. Fortunately there is a glossary to guide the reader. Many other authors have tried to capture the goings-on at Monroe, but Moen seems to have turned it into a career. If you are a current or prospective TMI student, these writings could be the ultimate guide (or puff-piece) to bring a new level of understanding. However, if you are the average reader thinking from the title that you are going to learn something more about the afterlife as depicted by books in the spiritualist tradition, forget it. Science fiction fans would probably find great enjoyment with the work. Moen is an effective writer who maintains a fast-paced description of his experiences, but the jargon-laden pages are a bit much to attract attention from a general audience. His fun-filled episodes with their never-ending sexual overtones are more reminiscent of a teen-ager at Disneyland than a metaphysical explorer pushing to new levels of understanding. The volume is a testament to Moen's amazing astral abilities and his mentoring of TMI students. If you would like a description that is an order of magnitude more useful try the \\"Life in the world Unseen\\" series from Anthony Borgia or free afterlife ebooks at spiritwritings.com"},{"Title":"AutoLISP: Programming for Productivity","review":"It seems very intuitive and provides a serious look at productivity."},{"Title":"Don't Sweat the Small Stuff for Women : Simple and Practical Ways to Do What Matters Most and Find Time for You","review":"How do women become so wise and resilient? And why do we sweat the small stuff so much? Is there some balance, some moment when you realize that most of it is all small stuff?Kristine Carlson is married to Richard Carlson and together they show great insight into the everyday life. Their books can seriously start to change your life if you use the principles they present in these easy-to-read compact books. I especially like their \\"Don't Sweat the Small Stuff in Love\\" book and I think it helped me improve my own relationship considerably by making me realize that one of the most important needs humans have is to be listened to. I had never really thought about what the other person needed in conversation, always so busy jabbering on. Wow, that was quite a revelation to me and it changed my entire view of conversation.Expect real revelations from these books. They are more than enlightening. Sometimes a simple awareness of an issue can trigger an entire thinking pattern that will help you make changes.

Have you noticed that if you pick up the house in the morning, the entire day is more enjoyable? Kristine gives herself an hour each morning to clear the path of her day. She spends time each morning organizing her life. I loved her thought about laundry. A gentleman she met makes folding clothes a Zen meditation.

It is very freeing and you do just what occurs to you. I write the most reviews on these types of days. They might include reading a great book, watching a movie, sitting outside with the cats, making dinner, writing in a journal, exercising. On other days, you might feel like just leaving the house for most of the day and forgetting about that load of laundry, those dishes, etc. Just escaping can be most freeing.Walk Through Open Doors - A positive attitude shows you more open doors.Let Go of \\"Perfect\\" Plans - have a sense of humor when things don't work instead of crying your eyes out.

The book comes with a CD that contains a trial copy of Visual Interdev that drops dead after 90 days. Rather than teaching ASP, the author shows how to construct Active Server Pages using Visual Interdev. He does show and discuss screen shots of the ASP that is created. The screen shots however are displayed in a faint blue text that is hard to read. This could be a helpful book for anyone who intends to create Active Server Pages in Visual Interdev, everyone else would be better served by purchasing something like &quot;Beginning ASP Databases&quot; by John Kauffman."},{"Title":"ASP 3 Fast & Easy Web Development W/CD","review":"A nice addition to the fast+easy collection. I like this book because like the other F+E books it dives right into creating ASP apps for the web, which is what we all want to do with ASP, right? I'm glad I started out with this book because I knew very little about ASP and it lead me through the most important concepts such as mySQL, ADO, COM, transactions and even some VB code examples. This book tends to lean on Visual Interdev a lot. It is a nice and helpful dev environment but you may spoil yourself after using it for too long, I am using the demo but have no plans on throwing my life savings at microsoft, like most readers. It would have been nice if they had pushed UltraEdit or a some development environment a little more reasonable for the average user.I like this book a lot and think it is worth a spot on your bookshelf if you need to get into ASP quickly. I am giving it 3 stars not because of the content but because of the damn broken CD. You can download a fix but I hope you have a T1 or DSL because its 29megs! This sort of thing just plain ticks me off. And what's with the lame blue text and the horrible graphics - felt like I was watching Oregon's 12. I had hoped they would learn from the first book."},{"Title":"ASP 3 Fast & Easy Web Development W/CD","review":"I have been using this book as required in a class on ASP. Even the teacher doesn't refer much to the content of the text. The examples are so difficult to read because a screen print of a full size page has been reduced to no more than a 2 1/2&quot; x 3 1/2&quot; size display in the book. Making it nearly impossible to read what is on the display. The author also fails on most every example to give the name of the file that is being displayed on the page. You have to squint to see the file name in the title or address bar. The author also has an annoying habit referring to something without a definition or saying it will be covered in later chapters. There is no glossary in the back to find a definition for a word or acronym. The author fails to provide a background for the technology used. ODBC, OLEDB, ADO are never really defined and to what purpose they were created. SQL is referenced, but never really defined. I would definitely recommend other text before this book.

This book aims to get you up and running with ASP quickly and I believe it does just that. If you don't want to wade your way through mounds of unnecessary information this is the book for you. I've been programming in ASP for a few years now and I still learned some useful information from this book."},{"Title":"ASP 3 Fast & Easy Web Development W/CD","review":"This is a solid beginning ASP book.

It is written in astill much like theirs with a plot that wasnot too far out-there for the time when itwas written. Or even for now for that matter."},{"Title":"African Names : The Ancient Egyptian Keys to Unlocking Your Power and Destiny","review":"African Names by Hehi Metu Ra Enkamit is much more than a book of African/Kamitic names, it is a powerful spiritual tool and guide to unlocking your destiny. The book introduces the reader to the significance of your name (your &quot;Ren&quot; in the Kamitic tradition), and the role it plays in empowering you to fulfill your destiny. Hehi Metu Ra Enkamit has earned the title &quot;Paramount King&quot; within the Ausar/Auset Society (an organization dedicated to the resurrection of the Ancient Egyptian Spiritual tradition, due to the role he has played in guiding individuals towards their spirituality. His book is evidence of his commitment and his understanding of the role of a &quot;guide&quot;. A name describes the character of a thing... it's form and function. As a child of the One Most High, your name should describe your essential nature. This book provides you with an understanding of the importance of choosing a name that serves this function, as well as the tools and methods used to choose your name/Ren for yourself. I strongly urge anyone who is interested in choosing a name that will energize their &quot;being&quot;, by it's mere pronounciation, to read this book and strive to embody it's message. Anytime someone has asked me how to choose a spiritual name,I personally recommend this book. I chose my name through this book, as well as the name of my wife, and our daughter. This book is a guide that you will probably put to use immediately, and continue to use, for the naming of anything/everything that may effect the fulfillment of your destiny."},{"Title":"Singer of Souls","review":"Adam Stemple has created an interesting and engaging story which crosses from our world to faery. From the very beginning, the books pulls you in. The story is well told and the language flows perfectly. You won't find yourself stumbling over clumsy style or grammatical errors. Most notable he establishes a fascinating relationship between music and magic.The characters are full and often dark. Watch out for Father Croser...Whoa!We could do with out the one sex scene, which is boring and obviously plays to the fantasy of male readers with little experience. Of course you might laugh too since it's so incredibly over the top cheesy.The pace near the ending of the book changes suddenly. It took me by surprise anyway, and unpleasantly so. Days later I'm still digesting and can't quite get it out of my head. But upon reflection, it all makes sense. The main character stumbles into a world where his only talent becomes his greatest power. Sympathies, loyalties and positions change, dramatically.If you need a feel good, fuzzy, happy ending this story is NOT for you! Personally I can't wait for the sequel."},{"Title":"Singer of Souls","review":"An addict trying to quit, guitarist Douglas knows he must leave Minneapolis and the temptation of his friends. He is estranged from his siblings and parents, so to dry out he heads to his Grandma McLaren in Edinburgh. While awaiting a passport he cuts a deal with Twin Town Guitar owner Zack Johannson.A few weeks later, his grandma welcomes Douglas, but sets three conditions that if he does any he is out. Douglas makes money with his guitar and a gift for rhyme. When the city hosts the annual Edinburgh International Festival and the Fringe Festival, Douglas performs and does quite well until he meets Aine. She gives him a vial promising him he will see the world from a different light. He resists at first but finally takes the drug. Douglas questions his mind as he see fey folks walking the streets of the city; worse they see him with each wanting to either recruit him to their cause or kill him as Douglas learns how dangerous the war between the fey is even as humans thinks he tripped out one time too many.SINGER OF SOULS is a wild urban fantasy starring a likable expatriate American struggling with controlling his addiction while wondering if he finally went over the edge as the only human who sees the Fey and more terrifying they see him. The story line starts off as a character study as the audience sees Douglas trying to kick the habit, but once he takes that step he feels like Alice through the looking glass. Fans will enjoy Adam Stemple's zany joy ride in the streets of Edinburgh from a distinctly weird perspective.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Singer of Souls","review":"A quick scan of the review indicates that there are two main camps here - those who find the ending edgy and those who see it as vandalism, as pointless as painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa. I have to agree with the vandalism people. If the author had foreshadowed it, I would not have cared for the effect, but it would have been acceptable. However, sprung jack-in-the-box-like as it was, one can only wonder what the author's point was.\\"Life is senseless, so books can be, too\\"?\\"Junkies are junkies and no matter how much they seem to have changed, they are really still cold, self-centered jerks and shame on you for being fooled by them\\"?\\"It's my book, I owe the reader nothing, and I can do what I want\\"?I really don't know nor do I, at this point, care. And it's too bad, too, because the author has the potential."},{"Title":"Singer of Souls","review":"The two most important things to know about this book:1. It is a faery tale.2. It is *not* a disney faery tale.Adam's first solo novel is still running through my head and in the end, I'm not entirely sure I liked it; Singer of Souls will stay in my library, but it may be a while before I can re-read it. I sure didn't know what I was getting into. It is 'good' from the perspective that while I did not see most of the big turns coming, retrospectively, they made sense.It's also worth noting that Singer of Souls, while somewhat reminiscent of some of the faceted-darkness works of Charles DeLint, perhaps owes more to the deeply incestuous music/literary scene of the twin cities. This interconnected group of serious local musicians has involved, off-hand, emma bull, will shetterly, neil gaiman, and steven brust. Heck, a former band, Cats Laughing, now has 3 published authors as alumni, in Emma Bull, Steven Brust, and Adam Stemple. As a former observer of this musical/literary scene, I can't believe no one has done a PhD dissertation on it yet.In conclusion, read the book, but don't say you weren't warned."},{"Title":"Singer of Souls","review":"If you are serious about fantasy, this is a good book. If you are serious about happy endings, this is a bad book.Adam Stemple has a wonderfully readable and likable voice as an author. He hooked me from page 1 and I didn't want to put the book down. That is why the ending is so devastating. Was it a lack of maturity on his part? Was it a desire to startle the reader? Was it an intentional statement trying to separate his identity from that of his mother (Jane Yolen)?The only way I'll ever know is if he writes the sequel that this story is screaming for."},{"Title":"Singer of Souls","review":"I read through some of the other reviews and a lot of people seem to have been put off by the ending. It was foreshadowed though when the author mentioned that Scottish fairy tales do not end well.I planned on reading this book over spring break, but it only lasted a day. I couldn't put it down. It even made music theory interesting.Now I have to add the Fringe Festival to my bucket list."},{"Title":"Singer of Souls","review":"Because yeah this is a polarising story. I will admit that I picked this book up because it was written by the last lead singer for Boiled in Lead. I was a little apprehensive, reading the back cover. Oh hey, busker goes to Scotland and discovers fairies. Kind of like every other urban fantasy I've read. (Except usually the go-to country is Ireland.)But it's a little different, and he's got a good voice. He occasionally overgeeks on the musical terminology, but he knows what he's talking about. And he writes about addiction in a way that feels real to me. Of course, my experience with heroin is pretty minimal, outside of watching Trainspotting. This story was interesting, and stayed interesting. The characters have lives of their own when they're not on the page, they have depth.The ending... seriously jumps off the tracks, and goes somewhere dark and unexpected. I don't think I like it, but the man's got balls to take it there."},{"Title":"Singer of Souls","review":"I'm not a big reader of fantasy so when I say this book is unique, perhaps it's more just unique to me. I read Singer of Souls several years ago but it is one of those books that sticks with you. Besides unique the story is haunting and lately it was haunting me to read again. I don't read books more than once often. But of course I couldn't remember the title or author. After about an hour of searching google with terms the combo of busking, faeries and festival found the book and now that I found it I'm going to go read it again. I also noticed that a sequel has come out since Steward of Songs- BONUS!"},{"Title":"Singer of Souls","review":"There are a lot of well thought out and explained reviews already, so I am not going to elaborate very much. I agree with most of the reviewers regarding Stemple's engaging and authentic voice. I think he has tremendous potential as an author. I similarly agree that the ending was botched. Where I disagree with many reviewers is that the book's failure at the end deserved an overall rating of one or two stars. I do still recommend this book to any lovers of dark fantasy. You can put it down as the plot begins spiraling toward oblivion and it will have been worth the read. Stemple's engaging voice is rare enough that he's worth a few hours of your time to just enjoy his prose and the promising plot that he's laid out, even if he doesn't fully deliver in the end."},{"Title":"Singer of Souls","review":"As the blurb on the book states, this is a wonderful first effort from the author. I admire his way with words. I never knew music could be so interesting - he casts a spell using musical terminology.As other reviewers acknowledge the book goes to some unexpected places. His is not a faeryland of sweetness and light. I suspect that the story actualy got out of control and the author did not know how to rein it in. When I look back at the character he created though I do think the end of the tale was what it had to be. No one was a hero, every one lived the life they had set out on. As I neared the end of the book I wondered how he could possibly end it. I am pleased that he didn't go for the trite happily ever after. But it does beg the question of whether the main character is capable of redemption.Maybe not, that's life. You could say that the faeryland of his imagination got what it deserved.That's not to say it was long enough. I think the end was rushed, as too many promising books are. (Here I could digress to say sometimes one book is too short when it's a really good story while more experienced authors can drag things out for 3 or more books without adding to the story.)I'm sorry I can't do justice to this author in a review - read it for yourself. I will read whatever he writes next."},{"Title":"Singer of Souls","review":"There are books that stick in your head long after you have read them, an undigested lump. You worry over them, like a dog trying to get the last bit of meat off a bone. Books that do that are either very bad books, or very good books. \\"Singer of Souls\\" is not a very bad book. In the end, I don't quite know what to make of it, other than to say that it is a very good book which is stuck in my head.Douglas \\"Doc\\" Stewart is a junkie. He's been clean for 20 days. How do you kick the habit? What do you need to do to actually get off the junk and stay off? If you stay where all your friends are junkies, it's just a matter of time, really. Looking the at the sharp point of the needle, Doc finally decides to implement his \\"emergency\\" plan: leave Minneapolis, fly to Edinburgh, and ask his Grandmother McLaren to take him in for a little bit.He does, and she does, and Doc settles down to earn some money the way that he knows best: as a street musician. Turns out Edinburgh is a great town for busking. It's not even illegal.Doc has the gift of rhyme. He can come up with unique couplets instantaneously and continue to reel them off for hours. For a dollar, he'll make up a song about you on the spot. If you like it, he'll record it on a cassette and sell it to you for five. He makes good money, as good as if he was working a steady job -- in fact, busking is a steady job, really. He gets up early, and plays until the sun goes down It's not an office, but it is work. It's a good life, until he sings a song for a beautiful woman, who turns out to be a faeiry. Suddenly, he's enmeshed in another world, with lives at stake, including his own.The Faeiry aren't good, but they aren't precisely evil, either. Sensible people have always tried to avoid drawing their notice. The Faeiry are supernatural and dangerous, sometimes beautiful and sometimes ugly. They are bound by a set of moral rules that are unlike humans'. The humans, in turn, are bound by our own common morality; murder and stealing and hurting other people are bad, kindness and love are good. This intersection of values is opens an opportunity for one race to manipulate the other.Stemple doesn't bother with a careful taxonomy of Faeiry. There's no discussion of the Seelie and the Unseelie court, a detailed history of the conflict between them, nor any long tellling of legends about their powers and their past. If the reader knows a lot of folk lore, then what they know fits into what they are reading. and If the reader isn't a mythology buff, everything they need to know is there in the book, without obscure references or long explanations.It allows the author to cause mystical edges and vistas to form for all of his readers, not just readers who know much, or little, about this cluster of myths. It also neatly gets Stemple out of the problem of resolving conflicting stories, which would require explanation rather than experience. The story is immediate, you feel it in your skin, instead of looking down to watch it from a great height.\\"Singer of Souls\\" rarely goes where you expect it to. The sudden turns, while jarring, are also consistent with the characters, their history, and their motivations. There is nothing gratuitous about the abrupt corners \\"Singer of Souls\\" takes. It all follows logically from an illogical world.There is almost nothing sweet in this novel, though there is kindness and strength. There is even heroism. It is cold and uncompromising, which is as it should be. Humans rarely come off with the better end of a bargain with Faeiry, and all who encounter the Queen of Faeiry are profoundly changed by the experience."},{"Title":"Singer of Souls","review":"This book had such wonderful potential. Like others who reviewed this book I don't always expect a happy ending, but the vindictive torture and maiming here was so unnecessary. What marvelous character development there is in the first nine tenths of the story. It was a joy to read and I was completely hooked. Everytime I had to put it down I couldn't wait to have even 10 minutes to read some more. Then, it's as if the author let some evil child with a poison pen (or one of his nasty-minded wee folk) write the ending. There should have been a couple hundred more pages in this book. I would love to see this book republished with an ending that is worthy of the rest of the story. My recommendation? Don't bother reading this unless you love to feel disappointed and thrive on let downs."},{"Title":"Singer of Souls","review":"Adam Stemple has the makings of a good writer. He has a fertile imagination and a quirky sense of humor. His descriptions of people, places and events have a feeling of authenticity. At times he's capable of working some real magic with language. However, like many fledgling writers, he has trouble distinuishing the voices of his muse and his inner demons. As the story progresses, the demons get the upper hand, and a novel that begins as a charming mystery degenerates into a neausating bloodletting. Mr. Stemple seems to have chosen the worst possible ending for this unfortunate book, resolving all conflict with an ugly adolescent power fantasy.Adam, you can do better than this. Don't let your demons write the ending of your next book. Let them have their say, then put their pages through the shredder and give your muse some breathing room."},{"Title":"Singer of Souls","review":"The running comments here seem to focus on how harsh the ending is. Ignore them, honestly. Yes, the ending is a surprise, and not what one would call happy. But, this is a beautiful book, a very fast read, and I would highly recommend it to anyone. Douglas Stewart is a very believable and surprisingly sympathetic character, and given his background, everything he does makes perfect sense in the context of the novel.BTW, Adam Stemple's website indicates that the first draft of the sequel, \\"Steward of Song,\\" has been turned in to his editor, and I will absolutely pick it up the day its' released."},{"Title":"Singer of Souls","review":"I gotta tell you, this book started out well. Nice pacing, nice character development, nice dialog. It was impressive, and I read quite a bit. I metion that because it's important to note that I rarely come accross a book that grabs me, that I think about when I'm doing other stuff. This one did. For the first hundred and fifty pages or so.Then...Adam got the bright idea of letting his retarded twelve year old brother write the ending. While on crack. And watching animated porn.I really don't know what happened. There was obviously some serious failure on the writer's part, and even more failure on the part of his agent, his editor, and his publisher. This was not a subtle problem here. And while it was bloody, that was not what made it bad. And while there was a really bad sex scene, THAT was not made it bad.What really made the ending so sub par was the lack of a grasp of the story's previous tempo, (I think there's about twenty thousand words missing,) the lack of a flowering of any real relationships, the lack of a cause for the reader to believe in, the lack of conflict, and I think more than that, growth, for the main character, as well as an absence of a price paid for influence, and the incredible narrowing of the scope of the author's world at the end of the book.You'd probably have to reead it to get what I'm saying, and there are definately worse things you could be reading, this will only take you a few hours.don't get me wroong though, I'm not writing this becasue I like to slam on people. (Although it can be fun.) I'm writing this because the guy had great potential. If I had to take a guess, I'd say he wrote the first hundred and fifty pages for NaNoWriMo and once he hit the end of November he just wrapped it up in a funky fifteen page masturbatory fantasy.But hey, at least it has an end, right? That alone makes it better than ninety percent of the fantasy out there."},{"Title":"Singer of Souls","review":"I bought this book shortly after visiting Edinburg during the Festival, and found it did a good job of capturing the feel of the Edinburg Festival and the Fringe. The main character is interesting and we get caught up in his attempt to keep himself clean from drugs.However, as others have pointed out, something happened. Unbelievable characters, such as the priest, appear. The worst sin of all is his contemptuous screwing of the reader. We are given characters that we are mean't to like, and then senseless death ensues. And the main character, our point of view character that we are to identify with, suddenly changes his personality 180 with no justification or development. It's like, \\"Oh, time to end the book, let's piss on the reader now.\\"Books don't have to always have happy endings, manipulation of the reader can work with proper setup and justification, but this callous, clumsy ending is an insult.

After reading the presentation, however, one must also note with sobriety that equally important is what Rome has apparently not said. Of course, a variety of conclusions can certainly be based on this curious state of affairs. The same is also true of search results in the vast official Vatican.va site, where an inquiry for \\"Medjugorje\\" will surprisingly yield -- absolutely nothing. Contrast this with the abundant references to Fatima and Lourdes on Vatican.va, and it is difficult to avoid wondering how an earnest pilgrim, ostensibly dedicated to the imitation of Christ and faithful to the Magisterium, could allow the never ending river of messages from Medjugorje to become life's central preoccupation.

God's love and power is always written into the final line of each story, things as reassuring to children as a parent's goodnight kiss. (&quot;God had saved his people again!&quot; &quot;Mary loved Him, Joseph loved Him, and God loved Him.&quot;)The New Testament portion emphasizes Jesus' parables and miracles, and tells Christianity's most moving stories (Judas' betrayal, the Revelation) with tact few religious writers would attempt. You'll find no better, more contextual explanation to a child of why Christ died than the &quot;Sadness&quot; chapter in this book.Overall, &quot;The Beginners' Bible&quot; is the best attempt yet to bring Jesus' love to His most youngest, most treasured ones, and is a book to read or be read to. HIGHLY recommended for families with young children."},{"Title":"The Beginner's Bible","review":"I highly highly recommend this book. I have been using it for close to 2 years now. I have no children of my own, but the children in the neighborhood all think they live here ! LOL -- how cute. They range in ages from 6 to 17. The older kids like to have the chance to interact with the younger ones. Reading these stories does just that. Its easy, so easy to understand. The beginning of each story sites the place in the Bible where the scripture can be found. This is excellent for people who want to make the transition with older children to their own Bibles. They can see where in the Bible their favorite stories are found. The kids in this neighborhood love it. They have me read it to them every time they are over. Its easy to understand, and is very colorful. I highly recommend this book. Its a must have !"},{"Title":"The Beginner's Bible","review":"This has 'cute' illustrations that children love to look at and toddler-level wording that they can really understand. This has been the favorite children's book for my 2 year old for quite some time. Every bedtime it's 'I want Bible dory!!!' Worth every penny!"},{"Title":"The Beginner's Bible","review":"I have been reading this to my six year old for about two years now, one easy-to-read chapter each night. We've been through it now about 7 times and he still really enjoys the stories and pictures. I think Karyn and Dennas have done a great job in simplifying the Bible and making it kid-friendly. I like the simple interpretations,too!"},{"Title":"The Beginner's Bible","review":"This is a great way to introduce your children to the Bible. The Chapter and verse is listed with each story so you can look up stories that you wish to share with your children. The subjects are presented in a short enough length so as not to lose the attention span of your child. They also make great bedtime stories because you can choose how much to read each night.I especially liked the way that this book handled diffucult topics like the crucifixion of Jesus. It does not shy away from these topics, but presents them in an understandable format.I give this book to friends for infant Baptisms or baby shower gifts."},{"Title":"The Beginner's Bible","review":"I got this Bible when I was 2 years old. I loved looking at the pictures- and they are very bright and colorful. This Bible first gave me the idea that there was a book about God. When I was a little bit older, It told me that Bible stories were interesting, and not boring and glum like I thought it would be after I looked at my dad's Bible with a black cover. After all, you can't judge a book by it's cover! Now I am 10 years old, and although I have a full text NIV Bible, I still love to look at this bible. I actually have 2 copies of it, because when I was 4 I begged my Mom to get me another copy of this Bible. I am extremely fond of reading, and I still remember the day I read it all by myself, When I was 5. Wasn't I proud! It's very understandable and in clear, big, print. I still treasure it very much, and I absolutely recommend this Bible to you."},{"Title":"The Beginner's Bible","review":"I have been using this book every other day since 1995 during the 20 minutes worship sessions with my group of preschoolers. They understand the stories, and remember them too! From time to time, I would show them the pictures and they are able to tell me the title of the stories.It's one of their favorites at reading time when they select books and &quot;read&quot; for themselves. Because I realize the impact of the stories, I usually give children who are leaving their very own copy. For some, it's their first introduction to Jesus."},{"Title":"The Beginner's Bible","review":"I bought this book after several attempts to get my children interested in the Bible. I always look for metaphysical interpretations for children, but am not sure they exist. And I have bought a handful of children's Bible literature so when I read a review for this book I thought, great! When the book arrived my heart fell. I told myself, &quot;another flop!&quot; and was ready to send it back. But my little boy (8) saw it and asked me to read it. And he just loves it!! He asks for more, always more... even though he has tons of other books on his shelves. And I am thrilled. The stories are very simply put and illustrated, exactly like a child needs. Sometimes I shudder at the interpretations (at times a bit too classical for me), but an adult can always explain the stories. This book has an amazing calming effect on kids, and it seems to fill a need they have. Amazing! I think it is a perfect first approach to the Bible."},{"Title":"The Beginner's Bible","review":"Introducing young children to God is simple.

However, I feel like it lacks the detail and inventiveness that made me dig Bible stories so much when I was little. I'm no holy roller, but I love Bible stories because of the humanity of the characters and the interesting twists and ironies of the stories. This book gleans over a lot of that for me. For example, the little detail of Eve coming from one of Adam's ribs, or that Samson was able to knock down the Phillistines castle because they were partying it up too much to notice that his hair was growing back, or how much of a prick Jonah sort of was and how long it took him to realize from the bowels of that whale. Those kinds of details gave the characters and the stories parallels to the flawed, human world my little butt was growing up in, and spurred my interest in storytelling in general. This book is too abbreviated in that sense. It's cute, it covers the entire Bible, the drawings are great (though I never envisioned Mary with a mullet), but I consider my search for a cool book of bible stories for my kids still on."},{"Title":"The Beginner's Bible","review":"I am using this book which contains Bible based stories from both the Old and New Testament in a children's program that I teach at my church.

I look at several different bibles for children and was not satisfied with the quality (biblical accuracy) of the stories and the amount of the stories within a given bible. I managed to find a used version of this from when I was a child and am completely happy. You have to be careful however because the company that produced this bible produced a newer version with the same title by a different author that just falls short with its stories and detail. That version actually looks almost identical to this one, so if you do some research you will have a wonderful bible to read to your children and have them read to you at this amazing time in their developmental lives."},{"Title":"The Beginner's Bible","review":"Key stories from Genesis to Revelation are included: 46 Old Testament, 49 New Testament.

I had a couple of copies of this book for my boys when they were young. We /they read and read them at the pre-school ages, and when they were early readers they read from it as well. Several of the stories from The Beginner's Bible were even used in some of their lessons in the Learning Language Arts Through Literature curriculum at the 2nd grade level!

Not only did I want to see what book could have stood up against such a masterpiece, but since it was out of print for so long, I had to wait years to finally read it. The book title had been renamed, which also didn't help me in the process of tracking down a copy. The original title was&quot;...and call me Conrad&quot;.Anywise, although I still like &quot;Dune&quot; better, this book was a good read.The Earth has been destroyed in a nuclear war. Several parts are uninhabitable, and most humans have left the planet to go live on distant moons such as Titan. What's left of the Earth has been turned into a great big Museum.Aliens exist on another world, and use the Earth as a tourist site. (They are blue and are called &quot;Vegans&quot; which was very confusing at first since I kept thinking they were referring to a person who doesn't eat meat or meat products.)Conrad Nomikos is the curator of the Earth Museum. He also used to be known as Konstantin Karaghiosis Korones Nomikos who supposedly was a demigod in Greek Mythology. (I really wish I knew more Greek Mythology before reading this book since there are several references to it which might have had more meaning to me if I was more familiar with the history.) Supposedly he has just been living for centuries but nobody noticed this until now, since he kept changing his name.The nuclear fall out has caused mutations and brought many of the legends to life. There are now centaurs, and sea serpents, and even a vampire roaming about the Earth. And then there are other things such as Conrad's &quot;hell hound&quot; named Bortan which supposedly had just been around for centuries also without anyone taking notice until now.Myshtigo is an alien who hires Conrad to take him on a tour of the Earth, supposedly so that he can write a book. Several Earth groups which favor &quot;Returnism&quot; and want all Humans to return to Earth, want Myshtigo killed since they believe he is just conducting a survey of the Earth to buy it and make vacation resorts out of the whole thing. One of these groups is called the &quot;Radpol&quot;. Conrad used to be the founder of this group, and he needs to decide whether to allow these people to kill the alien, or whether based on a hunch, that he should protect him instead. The future of the Earth may depend on his decision. Due to his telepathic powers (yes, he has some of these to), he already knows that the Alien isn't really writing a book, but his telepathic powers don't work well enough to tell him everything, so there is still a mystery to solve.There is a lot of comparisons between the Earth on a larger scale and Greece, Rome, Egypt (you might even be able through France into this mix, but they are not mentioned). These cities in our life time seem to have died. These were once great and powerful nations who ruled the Earth. Now tourists come to their land and expect them to act as second class citizens and servants who act as tour guides. It seems that if they had a choice, that most who live in these nations would rather tear down all these old monuments which symbolize death to them and use the material to build a new and active living city, and be great once more. It seems the only way they can become great again is to let go of the past. Zelazny does this on a major scale by turning the Earth into a giant museum, then starting to tear down the major monument that remain in it. This was a very powerful message it seemed for a while in this book, but then Zelazny chickens out in the end by not following through on it completely and compromises some of his ideas in the end. He loses points with me here, but at least he gave me a new perspective on the subject.P.S. just a side note for Tolkien fans. There is also a cyborg fighting mechanism in this book named &quot;golem&quot;."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"Frankly, I cannot remember much about this book. I read it more than a decade ago. It was my first Zelazny book. It made me go on to read more or less the entire Zelazny collection. So, I reckon that &quot;This Immortal&quot; had to be a superb novel."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"This immortal received the Hugo of 1966, but for the contemporary reader it's hard to figure out why. If it has had it's charm, it's been lost somewhere in these past decades. The plot is shallow and there is no real action (apart from a couple of man-to-man fights which hardly qualifies). The story is full of unused people (calling them characters whould be to much praise) who don't have a real purpose being there. And there are a lot of 'accidental' occurences just when they come in handy (f.i. as a last rescue, or to warn the hero) For as far as there is a plot it lacks cohesion, speed, and direction.As for the possitive side: Zelazny probably should enter history as the first to mention self-darkening sunglasses."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"I didn't like this book very much. Nor did I feel any sympathy for the protagonists. An artificial alien presence, an unclear and indefinite purpose, a contrived plot. That novel seems to have been hastily written indeed."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"As one reviewer here said, this book hasn't weathered the decades well since it first came out. However, I still think it's a good book. The sheer imagination that's apparent here overrides most of the problems with coincidental happenings and with undeveloped characters and events. I loved this book in my youth, and I still like it today. It's worth reading."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"How the hell did this tie with Dune for the best novel of 1966. If you want to read Zelazny read Lord of Light or the Amber series."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"If I were to pick a single science fiction author who was the essence of speculative fiction in the 1960's it would be Roger Zelazny. And while he continued to produce quality work, it was this period when both his quality and his intensity were at a peak that few authors ever reach. This Immortal (AKA Call Me Conrad) is his first novel (closely tied with The Dream Master). It remains a masterpiece four decades after winning a Hugo award and in many ways it defined the themes that haunted Zelazny's writing for years to come.Zelazny is fascinated with a certain form of divinity - not the kind that 'is and has always been,' but with intelligent creatures that somehow 'graduate' from a more normal, mundane state. In this novel the hero is Conrad Nimikos, a Greek, born on Christmas Eve, one leg shorter than the other, and altogether too much hair. In Greek terms, he was one of the kallikanzaroi, mischievous satyrs who exist to irritate both the human and the divine. Zelazny never tells us how old Nimikos is, but he has lived long enough to have had several names and seen the Earth suffer a nuclear war and start to pick up the pieces.We were saved by the intervention of the Vegans who helped relocate the remnants of Earth's population throughout space and saw to the survival of those who chose to remain. This was a mixed blessing, since the Vegans seems to want to turn Earth into a resort. Nimikos fought that eventuality (under another name) but has merged into the current social framework as the caretaker of the world's antiquities and treasures. Recently married, he is called from semi-retirement to be the guide for a Vegan journalist who might be writing a book, or looking for better places to put a resort, or something equally nefarious. This will be an ill-starred journey, with many wishing Cort Myshtigo (the Vegan) a quick and unpleasant end, as they travel over a world both barren and beautiful, where danger can take epic proportions.And that's the trick of this particular book. Nimikos no sooner leaves his beloved Cassandra when we realize that this is an Odyssey we have been invited on, and everywhere we look Greek legends will appear just in time to cause unexpected torments and provide opportunities for Herculean efforts. Even though this is a story told in wry fashion, Zelazny manages to use it to explore the meaning of grief. Sorrow for lost friends, loved ones, and an abiding sense of loss for an Earth that at the time of its writing was only showing faint glimmerings of it's future challenges. This is a poignant book where Zelazny manages an exquisite balance between attitude and affection.Small wonder that the book has been in print since its writing. Or that a host of other writers will confess to having been influenced by it. The layering of action, myth, and symbol that became a Zelazny hallmark began with this story. And it is hardly an insult to say while many of his books are as good there are none that are clearly better (well, I do have a soft spot for Isle of the Dead)."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"Humans have reason to hate themselves even more than they hate the Vegans. The Vegans are basically tourists, lingering among the ruins of the last non-radioactive territories on Earth. The historical Three Days of War occurred between human and human, or rather between dirty bomb and dirty bomb. The back cover of &quot;This Immortal&quot; ironically states &quot;Welcome to Earth (Pop. 60,000).&quot; (Later in the text, we learn that Earth's population is more like four million).&quot;This Immortal&quot; (1966) was Zelazny's first SF novel, and it shared the Hugo Award for Best Science Fiction Novel of the Year with Frank Herbert's &quot;Dune,&quot; so it is no lightweight post-Apocalypse adventure story. In fact, I think the best way to understand &quot;This Immortal&quot; is to read Lawrence Durrell's chronicles of the Greek Isles, most especially &quot;Prospero's Cell&quot; and &quot;Reflections on a Marine Venus&quot;---or better yet, read Percy Shelley's &quot;Prometheus Unbound,&quot; which is referred to more than once in this novel.Like Shelley's Prometheus, Zelazny's hero, Conrad Nimikos is mankind's potential savior. Like Prometheus, he suffers and almost self-destructs in trying to save his chosen people (the humans who remained on Earth). Instead of stealing fire from the gods, he sets out to steal back Earth from the Vegans.At an earlier stage in his career (nobody knows quite how old he might be), Nimikos was a terrorist. Now he has lost some of his destructive impulse (his hubris), and sets out to protect the Vegan, Cort Myshtigo in order to discover the alien's true purpose in touring Earth's remaining monuments.The real mystery of &quot;This Immortal&quot; is not so much the Vegans' intentions toward Earth as it is the true identity of Conrad Nomikos. His mistress, Cassandra playfully refers to him as a 'kallikanzaros' (this is where I had to refer to my Durrell), which a Greek term for a little cloven-hooved satyr, who causes mischief of every kind. Conrad is a huge man, superhumanly strong, but he is also incredibly ugly and walks with a limp.Did he at one time have a cloven hoof?Like the kallikanzaros, Conrad is a trickster, and deceives Vegans and humans alike into thinking his previous incarnation, the terrorist leader 'Karaghiosis,' has died in a boating accident.Once more turning to Durrell, we learn that 'Karaghiosis' is a stock character in Greek drama--in fact, &quot;the embodiment of Greek character...based on the idea of the impoverished and downtrodden little man getting the better of the world around him by sheer cunning. Add to this the salt of a self-deprecating humour and you have the immortal Greek.&quot;So Nomikos-Karaghiosis-Prometheus is the embodiment of 'the immortal Greek,' who might or might not be--according to a hint at novel's end, plus references to the kallikanzaros--the Great God, Pan.Conrad himself refers to &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; as &quot;Percy B's dud epic,&quot; but then, all of Zelazny's heroes tend to be self-deprecating.Zelazny has succeeded in capturing the spirit of a people and place in &quot;This Immortal.&quot; I think his Hugo was well-deserved."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"This Immortal is a novel set on post-apocalyptic Earth sometime well into the future. The Earth's total population is around 4 million souls-an apt term as a sizable portion of those left are \\"mutants\\" of on sort or another. Conrad Nomikos, the protagonist of the novel has a particularly interesting mutation-he's several hundred years old and, insofar as he can tell, an immortal.The bulk of the population wasn't killed off in the war-they've emigrated to other planets. What few choice locations are left on earth are owned by an alien race-the Vegans-much despised by those left on the planet.Nomikos \\"leads\\" a movement called the Returnist's-folks who want people to move back so that earthlings can reclaim their planet from the Vegans. \\"Leads\\" is in quotes as Conrad would rather be sailing and, while he actually sympathizes with Returnist goals in general, he nevertheless has very ambivalent feeling about the Vegans in general.Pressed into service as a guide for a very influential Vegan touring the planet, Conrad is buffeted by several forces pulling at him in different directions. Not sure what's going on, he set's out to try to keep the Vegan alive while he tries to get at what he's up to. Needless to say, from here on out the stuff is pretty much always hitting the fan, so to speak.This was Zelazny's first major novel. It is a truly great concept and the overall execution is well done-but it is a first effort. The characterizations are uneven. The story rambles a bit in places, the ending's a bit weak. Nevertheless, the genius that would later dominate the sci-fi world is clearly in evidence here, and my opinion is that to truly appreciate Zelazny's place in sci-fi history, you absolutely need to start here. It wont be his best work you'll read, but it is an essential work. And, on the whole, it's still a classic and a very good story."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"I guess I should post a spoiler warning here for those people who haven't read these books yet-though I don't think a Zelazny book can be \\"spoiled.\\" I recently reread This Immortal. I was really impressed. Especially considering this is Roger's first novel. It is in a first person narrative-which seemed strange since so many of his books are all written in third person. But anyway, the book itself is incredible. I can see why it garnered so many awards. The post-apocalyptic themes are mixed with alien culture, futuristic politics, Greek mythology, derring-do and even a mystery to solve.It is a great blend of fantasy and science fiction. The main character, Conrad Nimokos, Karagee, etc., etc., etc., is an immortal who may or may not be Pan, Dionysus, or some other figure from mythology (with the shortened leg I kept expecting Hephastus). The supporting characters are all quiet good, and it is interesting given the length of this short novel how much I came to care for these characters and their welfare. Hassan is the noble eastern assassin. Much like Yama in Lord of Light you come to respect and admire him as much as the main character. The two have a long history and are both formidable warriors. Their inevitable duel with slings is a great bit of writing. I love how Hassan insists on calling Conrad, \\"Karagee.\\" Some characters I was initially suspicious of-the Vegan Myshtigo, and the poet Philip Graver, end up as heroic figures.I had a huge lump in my throat, and bits of tears in my eyes, as I read Phil's final words to Conrad. Phil is a particularly interesting study. As a man of \\"half-talent,\\" and more acclaim than skill as a writer, one wonders if Zelazny was doing some soul searching here. There is plenty of that, as Zelazny's pattern of musing over philosophy, religion, politics and art is well established here.As far as the action goes, there is the above mentioned duel, a battle royale between Conrad and a combat robot, a fight between Hassan and The Deadman-- which is cleverly won, and an escape from tribal half-men. Throw in a voodoo ceremony and you begin to wonder how Roger fit it in to 190 pages. But he did, and it reads like a good symphony plays.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"Humans have reason to hate themselves even more than they hate the Vegans. The Vegans are basically tourists, lingering among the ruins of the last non-radioactive territories on Earth. The historical Three Days of War occurred between human and human, or rather between dirty bomb and dirty bomb. The back cover of \\"This Immortal\\" ironically states \\"Welcome to Earth (Pop. 60,000).\\" (Later in the text, we learn that Earth's population is more like four million).\\"This Immortal\\" (1966) was Zelazny's first SF novel, and it shared the Hugo Award for Best Science Fiction Novel of the Year with Frank Herbert's \\"Dune,\\" so it is no lightweight post-Apocalypse adventure story. In fact, I think the best way to understand \\"This Immortal\\" is to read Lawrence Durrell's semi-autobiographical novels on the Greek Isles: most especially \\"Prospero's Cell\\" and \\"Reflections on a Marine Venus\\"---or better yet, read Percy Shelley's \\"Prometheus Unbound,\\" which is referred to more than once in this novel.Like Shelley's Prometheus, Zelazny's hero, Conrad Nimikos is mankind's potential savior. Like Prometheus, he suffers and almost self-destructs in trying to save his chosen people (the humans who remained on Earth). Instead of stealing fire from the gods, he sets out to steal back Earth from the Vegans.At an earlier stage in his career (nobody knows quite how old he might be), Nimikos was a terrorist. Now he has lost some of his destructive impulse (his hubris), and sets out to protect the Vegan, Cort Myshtigo in order to discover the alien's true purpose in touring Earth's remaining monuments.The real mystery of \\"This Immortal\\" is not so much the Vegan's intentions toward Earth as it is the true identity of Conrad Nomikos. His mistress, Cassandra playfully refers to him as a 'kallikanzaros' (this is where I had to refer to my Durrell), which is a Greek term for a little cloven-hooved satyr, who causes mischief of every kind. Conrad is a huge man, superhumanly strong, but he is also incredibly ugly and walks with a limp.Did he at one time have a cloven hoof?Like the kallikanzaros, Conrad is a trickster, and deceives Vegans and humans alike into thinking his previous incarnation, the terrorist leader 'Karaghiosis,' has died in a boating accident.Once more turning to Durrell, we learn that 'Karaghiosis' is a stock character in Greek drama--in fact, \\"the embodiment of Greek character...based on the idea of the impoverished and downtrodden little man getting the better of the world around him by sheer cunning. Add to this the salt of a self-deprecating humour and you have the immortal Greek.\\"So Nomikos-Karaghiosis-Prometheus is the embodiment of 'the immortal Greek,' who might or might not be---according to a hint at novel's end, plus references to the kallikanzaros---the Great God, Pan.Conrad himself refers to \\"Prometheus Unbound\\" as \\"Percy B's dud epic,\\" but then, all of Zelazny's heroes tend to be self-deprecating.Zelazny has succeeded in capturing the spirit of a people and place in \\"This Immortal.\\" I think his Hugo was well-deserved."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"This was one of Zelazny's first full-length novels, and it already shows him as a confident author in complete control of his materials, and with many of the themes that were to inform his novels during the rest of his very productive career. Zelazny went on to write 50 books, including novels, collections of short stories, and even several collections of poetry, but many of the elements he became so well known for are present here.The protagonist is more than human in many ways--he doesn't age--but with a self-effacing, wise-cracking, self-deprecating sort of humor, a character type that was to become his favorite. The \\"Methuselah\\" trait added a surrealistic quality to an otherwise somewhat cynical, quite reality-grounded, character. Zelazny had the ability to paint quick, incisive but also subtle protraits of his characters in a few telling lines, but also devotes entire paragraphs to describing their psychology and appearance too. And his interest in myth, legends, and ancient history is shown in the many references to ancient Greece, the protagonist being Greek too.That having been said, I had one minor quip, which is that except for the characters of Hasan the assassin and Conrad, most of the other main characters weren't really drawn that well. You didn't really get to know them and they remained obscure all through the book. I found this odd considering Zelazy is usually pretty good with characterization.Similar to his book, Damnation Alley, Earth is a post-nuclear wasteland, a formerly vibrant but now devastated civilization, which the more advanced and peaceful Venusians find fascinating as a case study in primitive intelligence and culture gone wrong. Some of them even want to turn the earth into sort of a freakish post-Apocalyptic resort, such as the visiting Venusian or Vegan scholar in the story.In addition to the above elements, add in a few more imaginative characters, such as a deadly Arabic hired assassin who prides himself on his professionalism and still has his scruples; robot \\"golems\\" that are used as martial arts training partners; mutated, 40-foot long, half-snake, half-crocodile creatures; giant bats; massive earthquakes that sink several islands in the Aegean; and a couple of secret terrorist plots and political intrigues, and you have a pretty good idea of the story. Obviously, Zelazny had fun creating and thinking up all these ideas for the book and it shows, as this early novel still remains one of his finest works, and it was certainly deserving of the Hugo that it won."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"This Immortal is a good read, with plenty of Zelaznyesque brio. I wouldn't say it's not as good as his other Hugo winning novel, Lord of Light: indeed, by comparison, it seems a bit slight. For instance, I found the ending a distinct anti-climax. It's still a book you ought to read, mind you. It did win a Hugo, in a tie with Frank Herbert's Dune.The storyline concerns Conrad Nomikos, one of about 4 million people still living on Earth centuries in the future, after a Nuclear war, and after the bulk of the population has gone to the stars to work for the advanced, civilized, Vegans. Conrad and some of his friends had years before been involved in the &quot;Returnist&quot; movement, urging people to return to Earth, and resisting the Vegans' moves to buy up the best Earth real estate. Nowadays, the situation is a stalemate, with Earth's exile population preferring not to return, but with the Vegans' not buying any more of Earth either. But Cort Mishtigo, a high status Vegan, has come to Earth to tour some of the ancient sites. Conrad, who seems to have some mysterious past identities that go back a long way, is recruited to guide Mishtigo, and to protect him from assassins. He is in danger because the more radical Returnists believe that his &quot;tour&quot; is a pretext for evaluating more real estate, in advance of a renewed Vegan buying campaign. Conrad is unsure of Cort's motives, and anyway unhappy with the idea of murder. The novel consists, then, of Cort's tour, and a number of well-done battles between Conrad and a variety of monsters and mutants. The fight scenes, and the descriptions of the mutants (based on Greek mythology), are really good. It's only the eventual revelation of the Vegan motives that's a bit pat and anti-climatic.Lest I be seen to damn with faint praise, I should reiterate that this is great fun to read, and very skilled and clever. Conrad is a fairly standard Zelazny hero, wisecracking and self-deprecating. The dialog crackles throughout, and the other characters are nicely limned. Conrad's dilemma is believable: the conflict between his professional desire to protect his client (along with his personal distaste for murder) and his loyalties to Earth and the Returnists against the Vegan domination of Earth is well handled. And the various set-pieces and fight scenes are exciting and original. And the ultimate message of the book, about proper stewardship of our planet, and who deserves to be stewards, is clearly seen, and resolved with irony and honesty."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"I've yet to be disappointed by Zelazny--after a bit of work, I managed to stumble upon the Amber series in a local used bookstore, and have picked up several of the iBooks(?) reprints.This Immortal is not the exception to the rule; I found myself deeply engaged by the story, I had a hard time putting it down--and yet, I always felt that I was missing something, that the story was operating on several levels, and I was fully aware only of one, while the others I caught mere glimpses of as I read. It is possible, as another reader has mentioned, that it might help to be familiar with certain Greek source material; I can't recall if the Homeric epics were mentioned, but given the comparisons between This Immortal and The Odyssey, I imagine it couldn't hurt.I sense that I'll be returning to this book in the future; as you might imagine, I feel that there is quite a bit more to be found in it than I discovered on my first read. However, if you're looking for an introduction to Zelazny, I would recommend you steer clear and look instead for the Amber novels, or perhaps The Dream Master. Once you're well-hooked, you might consider this."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"This novel tied for best science fiction novel of the year (1966), splitting the Hugo with Dune. Dune is impressive and expansive. This novel is not on the same scale, but it is very good. Far better than the vast majority of Hugo and Nebula award winners that I have read, in fact.The story follows that of Conrad, an immortal previously known by many other names, one of which was an infamous terrorist. Hence, alternate title &quot;... And Call Me Conrad&quot;. On first glance, it appears to be a standard post-apocalyptic tale of the Earth with a small population (in the low millions) and numerous radioactive areas and mutants running around. A prosperous and highly advanced alien race has taken in any humans that want to leave (turning them into 2nd class citizens hired for menial labour), and they are buying up all the choice land on Earth itself as vacation spots.Those are the nuts and bolts of the story, but they aren't really important. Zelazny has the ability to write intellegent science fiction/fantasy without making the average reader feel stupid, or making himself sound pretentious/arrogant (unlike, for instance, Samual Delany). It is a little confusing at first, but everything sorts itself out by the end - there are Earth factions squabbling, an alien travelogue-writer whose true intentions are unknown, and some Greek mythology thrown in for good measure (because Conrad is Greek, it doesn't come out of the blue). In a lesser book, the profusion of stories would be overwhelming (especially at 240 pages or so), but Zelazny balances them all in a thoroughly enjoyable manner.The end does suffer a bit from some Deus ex Machina plot twists, which robs this book of its 5th star. They are not really that bad, but they aren't very satisfying in what is otherwise a well thought out and interesting tale."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"The Earth has been mostly depopulated as humans have discovered more sophisticated and comfortable cultures elsewhere in the universe. Much of its infrastructure was destroyed during \\"The Three Days,\\" and most of the mainland areas are still \\"hot.\\" Genetic mutations have caused the birth of creatures previously thought to be only myth. Now Earth is a strange and dangerous place, fit only as a tourist attraction and a vacation spot for the Vegans.But some people still love Earth, including long-lived Conrad Nomikos, Commissioner for the Arts. Conrad hates the Vegans, so he isn't happy that he's been assigned to be the tour guide for Cort Mishtigo, a rich Vegan who may be planning to buy up more of Earth. But even more interesting than Mishtigo's plans for Earth is the nature of Conrad himself. Who is he?This Immortal is a gorgeous novel and Conrad Nomikos makes a great hero, similar to Corwin from Zelazny's later Amber Chronicles. Conrad's love of Earth and, particularly, for his Greek heritage is full of beauty and passion:You will pass, but the hills of Greece will remain, will be unchanged, with the smell of goat thigh bones burning, with a mingling of blood and wine, a taste of sweetened almonds, a cold wind by night, and skies as blue-bright as the eyes of a God by day. Touch them, if you dare... That is why I am refreshed whenever I return, because now that I am a man with many years behind me, I feel this way about the entire Earth. That is why I fought, and why I killed and bombed...I listened to This Immortal on audio (Brilliance Audio) and fell in love with narrator Victor Bevine whose deeply resonant voice captured perfectly the strength and depth of Conrad, the tenderness of Conrad's wife Cassandra, the alienness of the Vegan, the gentle deadliness of Hasan the Assassin, and even the zealous geekiness of George, the scientist whose curiosity and ambition makes him willing to experiment on his own friends, pets, and unborn child.The end of This Immortal wraps up a bit too quickly -- I wanted to stay longer with Conrad on our devastated planet. I hope everything turns out okay..."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"I don't really like Zelazny's writing style (I am apparently immune to his vaunted wit, and at times I feel like he is just trying to show off his literary education), and 1966 Hugo winner \\"This Immortal,\\" AKA \\"Call Me Conrad,\\" is a little slow to get going. The book is also a bit pretentious, ceaselessly bombarding the reader with references to Ancient Greek culture and Romantic poetry, and trying to say something about imperialism, terrorism, and religion. And the characters all seem like jerks.However, the core plot of the novel is good, a violent detective/adventure story, and about 70 pages into its 175 pages it gets pretty interesting and exciting. It is not for everybody, but it is easy to see why its fans are so fond of it. People who think SF can be serious literature, and those who like an adventure story but would like something a little more challenging than the usual thing should certainly give \\"This Immortal\\" a shot."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"This isn't Zelazny's best and it still surprises me, on rereading, that it gained the Hugo Award for best novel. What this book does, however, is break the ground for his better work which was yet to come.

It's one of the great landmarks of the genre, but it has its flaws. Zelazny's novel is written in a sardonic, but not too cynical voice, is filled with action, and the characters are, in my arbitary opinion, more interesting. Zelazny was one of the great stylist of the genre, Herbert wasn't. Mind you Dune's plot was more complex.

He's a man with a mysterious past that one has to piece together as the book goes along. He is also very symbolic and metaphorical, something that you don't see done often, or well, in scifi/fantasy. Half saint, half destoryer, this immortal is the narrator of a tale of a time when Earth is in dire need... though the &quot;alien invaders&quot; of this novel, the Vegans, come with checkbooks, not guns. My only complaint with this novel is that the other characters aren't as fully developed as Conrad. If this book is never made into a movie, I'll right the bloody screen play myself! What are you waiting for? Order it!"},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"I'm basing this on memories of the paperback I purchased some 20+ years ago, and the refresh from other reviewers.A confusing book, in a way -- but then, all the better Zelazny works have that same confusion factor. One has almost to reread his works so that information learned later can be applied to actions the characters take earlier -- Zelazny does not pander to the reader with lots of explanatory exposition and background, it has to be absorbed as it happens. (The closest is probably the first book of Amber, where amnesiac Corwyn is bluffing information out of the relatives.)However, the above comments should not scare one off from reading this book. It does deserve all the praise it has been granted through the ages.The &quot;correction&quot;: Lest anyone be mislead by another reviewer's mention of J.R.R. Tolkien... LoTR's &quot;Gollum&quot; has absolutely no relationship to the &quot;golem&quot; mentioned in &quot;This Immortal&quot;. In a break from the Greek mythology, so heavy in the book, &quot;golem&quot; comes from Jewish mysticism -- a clay figure of a man, animated by the insertion of mystical hebrew writing (the name of God?) inserted into the clay (I'm not clear on inserted into the forehead, or held in the mouth). The golem being created as a near indestructible, defensive, fighter -- wherefore the link to the cybernetic fighter of Zelazny's book."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"I recently re-read this after a 20 year hiatus. Good book. I've always found Roger Zelazny's stuff a bit chaotic and somewhat confusing, especially in the early chapters when you don't know what's going on. Now don't get me wrong, I think he's one of the greatest SF writers of all time (especially the amazing Lord of Light and the early Amber books) and his writing style works brilliantly in the context of his other novels. This book, however, is a bit different from those other novels. I was struck by how straight-forward this story was, indeed, how &quot;tight&quot; it seemed. There wasn't a wasted word or phrase. I found it quite refreshing after reading today's bloated epics.My only quibble with the book was that I found the ideas a bit un-original (although they may have been quite unique at the time they were written). Nevertheless, the pacing was perfect, the action was good, it kept my attention and most of all - I wish today's writers would take a lesson from him!"},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"Without having read Prometheus Unbound or knowing as much Greek mythology as Zelazny, this book largely flew over my head.Often miracles would happen to get the characters out of trouble (on at least two occasions I remember off the top of my head). To make matters worse, a lot of the dialog is like machine guns firing, where one person says a single word, the other character replies with one word, and then the first person says another single word. Dialog will go on for pages without any dialog tags. Besides the protagonist, the characters are largely superficial. The love story was not impressive by any means.The only thing I found somewhat satisfying was when I learned what the Vegan's really wanted.So, if you are a master of greek mythology, I heartily recommend this book. Or, if you want to learn more, pick it up. Otherwise, the book probably isn't for you."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"This novel takes place in a future Earth where mankind had nearly annihilated the planet in a three day nuclear war. The remaining human population is mostly scattered across other planets under control of the Vegans. Earth's remaining human population lives mostly on islands, as the larger land masses are still too radioactive to live on. This is certainly a promising premise for a science fiction novel, but I really was not able to get into this one. I could not identify well with the characters, and the plot seemed to meander from one point to another with little apparent end in sight. This book somehow tied withDunefor the Hugo Award, but I'm frankly not sure what the voters saw in it. In my opinion the two books are not even in the same league."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"From ISawLightningFall.comSo you're cruising Genreville, looking for something unique. You dismiss Best Seller Highway, Bodice Ripper Boulevard and Thriller Trail out of hand as too commercial. You pull through SF Junction and Western Way, Fantasy Circle and Horror Lane, but don't find anything to your liking. You drive and drive and drive until you find yourself in a section of town you aren't familiar with. The asphalt is full of potholes, the surrounding blocks underdeveloped. You stop and consult your map. Ahead is the intersection of Post Apocalyptic Drive, Space Opera Street and Mythic Parkway. You look up, and there, turning cartwheels on the corner, is Roger Zelazny's This Immortal.You can tell Zelazny's first novel is going to be something different as soon as you're introduced to its protagonist, Conrad Nomikos. Conrad is Commissioner of the Department of Arts, Monuments and Archives for a future Earth still reeling from the ravages of nuclear war. Not only does he catalogue the planet's few remaining wonders, such as the pyramids and the Sphinx, he also gives tours of them. But he's picked up a client he'd rather not have, an extraterrestrial of the galaxy-spanning Vegan race named Cort Myshtigo. After Earth immolated itself, the Vegans took over, treating it as a vacation destination for the planet-hopping set, part day spa, part radioactive Outward Bound adventure. Myshtigo wants to pen a memoir of his travels, but a band of resistance fighters think he's up to no good and want him dead. Conrad, though, won't let a client perish, even one he doesn't like. He's had plenty of time to practice bodyguarding, having been alive for hundreds of years due to a freak mutation. In fact, he may be more than merely human.This Immortal has the all elements of a genre gem, but its disparate parts never quite come together. One page has you reading about interplanetary travel, the next about the consequences of nuclear devastation and the next about satyrs listening to Conrad play a shepherd's pipe. The chatty dialogue proves equally disconcerting. Tossing out one-liners about a bestial mob's preferred method of cooking human flesh spoils the mood. Ditto for quips about chewing gum and chipmunks during a voodoo ceremony or discussions of cultural anthropology before a duel. You can't fault Zelazny for his breadth of vision, though, or for his fight scenes, which are cracking good. Still, readers who think this Genreville locale sounds enticing might find Alfred Bester's The Stars My Destination a more satisfying read."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"This is one of Zelazny's best books, and one of the best works of science fiction I've read. It shares some elements with his other variations on world mythology, but there are differences, too.

His descriptive nature tart and fast-- Zelazny can describe in one sentence what Stephen King takes to describe in two or three pages. A fast and fun rollercoaster ride, this book remains a classic and anyone who reads this book can see why it tied Dune for the Hugo Award.

He'll even make a deal with the hated invaders--the Vegans--if it will help him. Not that Earth is any great shakes. After the Vegan invasion and Conrad's nuclear terrorism, radioactivity, poverty, and mutation make this an early distopian vision. Zelazny is an awesome writer. Although his Amber novels are currently more popular, and although LORD OF LIGHT may have appealed more to the 1970s crowd, THIS IMMORTAL has to be ranked as one of his best, and as one of the best of Science Fiction from the 60s.

While many of the hints are toward a satyr, him being called a \\"forger\\" by the Vegan he chooses to protect and due to a few other comments, is he not possibly Vulcan of Roman Mythology (Hepaestus in Greek Mythology).... He was the god of fire and volcanoes, and the manufacturer of art, arms, iron, and armor for gods and heroes. He was born weak (later fairly strong) and crippled and was considered quite ugly...... Just a thought."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"One of the early Hugo winners, I wasn't sure why it won at first. The style is very different, almost rambling. Conrad is an immortal who's had a bunch of different names over the years but basically really enjoys living, unlike immortals in other books. Earth has messed itself up and a bunch of aliens have bought it as real estate and Conrad is taking one of them around and showing him the sights to help him with a book he's writing. There's not much in the way of plot, which is what turned me off when I started reading it. Not much happens, true. But Zelanzy has a gift for description and Conrad is one of the fully rounded and complex characters ever. There's a definite sense of humor in the book which is definitely welcome considering the surroundings. The situations they tend to blunder into but the plot is more episodic than anything else, and most of the conflicts are fairly interesting. Mostly it's just the way he describes things, by the time you finish you feel you know Conrad, or whatever he wants to call himself. His world is very detailed and the echoes of the Greek myths are there, sort of like lurking in the shadows behind the rest of the plot but it colors the actions of the characters. All in all, a quick read and worth your time if you can find it used. Probably not as well known as his Amber books but something to look into if you want something that's the same and different. Or something."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"I just found out that \\"Zelazny\\" is considered a spelling mistake in Microsoft's Word and the program prompts me to choose between \\"Delaney\\", \\"Zelman\\" or \\"Zeeland\\". This little discovery shows on the one hand (somehow sadly) the degree of Zelazny's recognition outside SF, but on the other makes him something of an elitist writer, one perhaps able to deliver in a very personal writing style.Boy, how he delivers.\\"Crossing a room can be a time - consuming business: if it's full of people, if the people all know you, if the people are all holding glasses, if you have even a slight tendency to limb.It was, they did, they were, and I do\\".A 170 pages long torrent of this writing style, will give you the extremely rare sensation of your intellect being tickled by the writer's pen while you are reading the novel. I would think of it as something like the Heinleinian tickle X 2.And what about the heroes one might ask?Well, it is the first time I have read a SF novel with a hero so lethal and so human. Consider Halo (the video game) meets James Joyce. Honestly, don't read any further in this review if you don't believe it, go and check for yourselves.And what about the plot?It's a well thought post-apocalyptic Earth, interesting Vega aliens and a captivating storyline spanning three continents.Being Greek myself, I could complain about a couple of oddities (for example, a dinner with kokkineli, Metaxa and Ouzo would rather demand a stomach of titanium), but, you know, that's more like complaining for the sake of complaining.It is strange that This Immortal has not been transferred to cinema, theater, TV mini series, videogames, HOPA games and bobblehead dolls.

This is the main idea of Gingerbread Baby by Jan Brett. This story is about a boy named Matti in Switzerland. This is a great children's book. I strongly recommend the book.A boy named Matti decides it's a perfect day for gingerbread. But, when his mother tells him not to peek, he does anyways. Then out pops ... not the Gingerbread Man but ... The Gingerbread Baby! The Ginger bread Baby runs away and everyone chases him. It's very funny.I think that the Gingerbread Baby is the best character. He's the best character because he is my favorite character. The main characters are, Matti, The Gingerbread Baby, and the animals. The writing style is great. The story is very easy to read. It's a great book.I really like the illustrations. They really tell the story. Some of the pictures are funny. The Gingerbread Baby even has his own little saying like the Gingerbread Man.

This little boy named Matti is making a gingerbread man with his mom. The instructions say not to peak into the oven while it is cooking. Matti starts getting excited and he looks into the oven only halfway through its cooking. A little gingerbread baby pops out and says, \\"I am the Gingerbread Baby, Fresh from the pan. If you want me, Catch me if you can.\\" After that it runs around the whole village saying that phrase and running away from everyone and everything that tries to catch it. It is running free until Matti makes a gingerbread house for it to live in. I think this story would be very easily likable for children to listen to and read."},{"Title":"Gingerbread Baby","review":"I use this book in a Jan Brett author/illustrator unit with my Kindergartener, third and fifth graders. The children love the sassy little gingerbread baby. They especially love the flap-book ending.

I want only to add, that I found Jan Brett's web page (www.janbrett.com), and she has made a Gingerbread Baby board game, character masks, and Gingerbread Baby recipes that are all free and can be printed up off the website to be used as additional activities with this story."},{"Title":"Gingerbread Baby","review":"This is a great book. It's the same idea as the Gingerbread Man but the little guy doesn't get eaten in the end. When Matti opens the oven door too soon, the ornery little critter hops out and runs all over town trying to get everyone and everything breathing to catch him. Well, Matti, not to be outwitted by a walking piece of molasses and flour, instead of chasing the fellow, spends the time in the kitchen making a gingerbread house. When the baby eventually is chased back to Matti's home, he \\"smells something familiar\\" and there in the snow, is Matti's gingerbread house. Of course the baby runs into his new house and Matti then takes him inside. All of the baby's \\"pursuers\\" only see some crumbs and a remaining piece of peppermint and subsequently think the gingerbread baby has been eaten. Only Matti knows that the Gingerbread baby is safe in his new house, laughing and giggling about how he outsmarted them all but the smartest one of all. Very, very cute book and especially so for the holidays. Great illustrations - they reminded me of Susan Winget's. Highly recommend this one, especially since the ending is a whole lot nicer!"},{"Title":"Gingerbread Baby","review":"Matti waits for gingerbread to be made while he thumbs through a cookbook. A gingerbread baby, much like the classic childhood tale, pops out the oven, and scampers across the room. Household havoc soon follows as Matti's family tries to catch the escaped snack.The gingerbread baby leads everyone outside and down the road, creating a mess along the way. The entire town is up in arms, tempted by the gingerbread baby's poetic taunts:\\"I'm the Gingerbread Baby.Catch me if you can!\\"How will the gingerbread baby be caught? Can Matti save the day?Beautiful colored drawings fill each page, with many two-page spreads. There is winter atmosphere, from the fire-filled hearth, to snow flowing over mountaintops, to the sugar-crusted gingerbread house. Creative and active, the pictures meet well with the story.The pictures sometimes overtake the type. Although set in Breughel (like Times New Roman) in what appears to be 14 pt., the contrast is occasional weak, making the story difficult to read in a few places.I fully recommend \\"Gingerbread Baby\\" by Jan Brett. It is one of the good ones.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"Gingerbread Baby","review":"Gingerbread Baby is a twist on the traditional story of \\"The Gingerbread Boy.\\" Matti and his mother follow the recipe to bake a gingerbread boy, but when Matti opens the oven too early a gingerbread baby jumps out instead. As the gingerbread boy does in the original story, the gingerbread baby runs away and is chased through the town by the townspeople and animals. However, in this version, instead of the Gingerbread Baby being eaten by a fox, Matti stays home baking a gingerbread house for the Gingerbread Baby to run into. Children will enjoy lifting the flap on the last page and seeing the Gingerbread Baby inside his house. This book would be appropriate for children ages 5 through 8. Children in this age group enjoy hearing make-believe stories involving talking animals or toys or, in this case, talking cookies! I think young children especially will be happy that in this version the Gingerbread Baby does not get eaten by the fox in the end. I recommend sharing this story with children for enjoyment at Christmastime. Jan Brett's illustrations are beautiful and cover every inch of the page. The authenticity of the drawings of the Swiss village and the townspeople is stunning. Each image is drawn with exquisite detail. The illustrated borders on each page, which give the appearance of being made out of cookie dough and icing, picture additional scenes related to the events unfolding in the story inside Gingerbread Baby shaped cutouts. The eye-catching endpapers round out the beauty of the book as a whole."},{"Title":"Gingerbread Baby","review":"Fantastic!

The illustration of the gingerbread baby tying the two girls braids together is rather comical.The gingerbread being isn't eaten by anything this time, but takes up residence in a gingerbread house in the boy's yard. This end is odder than the logical original one where the gingerbread man is eaten. Is it the case that a cookie being eaten by a fox is now considered too grotesque?;) Maybe instead of playhouses, kids will be asking for cookie houses for their pet cookies from now on."},{"Title":"Gingerbread Baby","review":"As a mother, a home educator and a former public school teacher, I have always loved having Jan Brett's books around. They're lively, they inspire children to look for detail and they entertain in a wholesome manner. When we saw this book at the library, I immediately had to come home and order one for us.

Her gorgeous full page full color illustrations transport you on a wonderful winter journey. The story begins with Matti and her mother baking a gingerbread man. Unfortunately Matti opens the oven before the suggested baking time and instead of a Gingerbread man, out pops a Gingerbread baby. The obnoxious Gingerbread baby taunts, \\"I am the Gingerbread Baby, Fresh from the pan, If you want me, Catch me if you can.\\" Readers follow the Gingerbread baby as he alludes many of the townspeople and animals on a wondous chase through the Swiss town on a wonderful winter adventure.

Awesome version of an old classic!"},{"Title":"Gingerbread Baby","review":"Lovely story for the holiday season. It is a bit of a longer, wordier story so it would be better for a preschooler than a 2 year old. It is a twist on the classic runaway gingerbread boy story, with a wonderful refrain as the gingerbread boy runs away.Jan Brett's illustrations have their own style and add a reassuring, cozy touch. This would be a great addition to any home library for the winter season! The illustrations are fairly detailed so this book might also be better for children in the larger, hardback version than in the board book version.The ending with the cut out gingerbread house, that flips up on the page to reveal gingerbread baby inside, will delight and surprise any child! It is a wonderful ending with a lot of winter charm!

But my favorite is the ending...it is a wonderful, surprising ending that ends so much better than the old story ever did! We LOVE it!I'd recommend it to every family with young children and any teacher who needs a wonderful story to read to their young readers!"},{"Title":"Gingerbread Baby","review":"This book has beautiful illustrations with inserted illustrations telling a separate story on the side. Younger children love this version of the Gingerbread Boy because it has a happy ending which makes sense to them. It is a story teller's dream."},{"Title":"Gingerbread Baby","review":"I'm listening to this story even as I type inside a 1st grade where just new to English mostly immigrant kids are listening having NEVER ever tasted or heard of gingerbread men, gingerbread babies or anything like that. And you know what? They are delighted by Jan Brett's elaborate drawing and story structure to make her illustrated world view of a Gingerbread baby that struts into the world with the familial bragging rights in the fun of the chase and the hot from the oven bravado we so love to eat right up at the end of their momentary escape from our clutches.Ha Ha.She, Brett, is without a doubt the visual equivalent of Eudora Welty. Almost like the breath of peony and rosewater that overtakes you in the fetid spring....Brett has sparkled and bejeweled her new version with the twists and turns of infinite pattern. One of my students has arrived at the stage where he asks, What's a gingerbread baby?/ What's a village?/ What's a villager?/What's a fox?/What's bragging? It's rather darling to listen to as my daughter teaches the story so I can film their listening to analyze as they retell this story to me later and I look at four months of instruction in English and where we are now. Lots of fun using this kind of piece of myth.The question is what lessons are here? And let me tell you there are side stories in the pictures and lots of elaborations to generate very interesting answers including do not tell a village to catch you because they might do it! I like that answer as I listen to her apprehension questions to them as they predict their way through. He is \\"brash\\" they decide. Do you know a brash cookie? I do.This bought along withRobeez Infant/Toddler Gingerbread Man Slip-Onat this price is a fantastic present for a baby/toddler near you.

Her detailed, distinctive style is immediately recognizable to those who admire her work. The Gingerbread Baby is a new twist on an old tale. The naughty baby runs away with a host of people and animals chasing him. The pattern of the story makes it a joy for children to read and act out. Jan adds her own special ending which will be a delight to children and adults alike."},{"Title":"Gingerbread Baby","review":"I work as a TA with kindergartners. Jan Brett's books have long been favorites of mine. She may have outdone herself on this one! There's always the exquisite artwork, the detailed borders that foreshadow the story, and the kind and gentle retelling of tales that are classics. This is a delightful take on \\"The Gingerbread Boy,\\" the same story we grew up with, with a magical ending. \\"The Gingerbread Baby\\" does not get eaten this time. How this comes about just really captures the childrens' imagination-they cheer, clap, and smile from ear to ear. We read all the versions of \\"The Gingerbread Boy\\" that our school library has, and the kids vote on their favorite version. Every year, \\"The Gingerbread Baby\\" wins, by huge amounts. That's all you need to know, really, about this book. Five, six, and seven year-old just LOVE it. And the adult reading it will enjoy the story and marvel at the beautiful art work, which Jan Brett does herself. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Gingerbread Baby","review":"We thought this story was very funny. We really liked when the gingerbread baby was running away from all the people. We also thought making a gingerbread house for the baby was a great idea. The pictures were very colorful and neat to look at. In our opinion this is a perfect book! We recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Gingerbread Baby","review":"There's one thing to definitely be said about Jan Brett. She knows what she's good at and she doesn't stray from her particular brand of storytelling. If you've ever read a Jan Brett story then you're already familiar with her style. Each tale usually exists in a snow covered land, where vaguely European peasant-like people go about their daily lives. You're not going to read a Jan Brett that's set in the grimy suburbs of southern Philadelphia or the desert-like atmosphere of Bahrain. And that's fine. Here, with \\"The Gingerbread Baby\\", Brett has taken a classic fairy tale and given it a twist of an ending. The result is an effective retelling that should please even the most die-hard traditionalists.First of all, the book explains EXACTLY why the Gingerbread Baby appears in the first place. In the original tale, a woman cooking the gingerbread merely opens the oven door and out pops the cocky cookie. In this story, however, a boy (Matti) and his mother are following the recipe found in a worn-looking cookbook. Though the recipe instructs to bake a gingerbread boy for a full eight minutes, \\"No more. No less. DO NOT peek\\", Matti cannot resist taking just a little glance at the yummy pastry man. Too late he realizes his mistake and the Gingerbread Baby (it's still too young to be a gingerbread boy, you see) leaps out to its freedom. The next few pages show the various modes of escape the creature uses to keep from being eaten by everyone from Matti's parents to dogs, goats, pigs, peasants, and a crafty fox. In the traditional story, the fox is the clever party that devours the Gingerbread Boy. Not so here. In an interesting twist, Matti bakes a gingerbread house for the naughty baby, and rescues his creation from the villagers by simply luring the Gingerbread creature into its home. The final panel shows the delighted Gingerbread Baby dancing about its little home safe and sound while Matti looks on.Personally, I was rooting for the fox. But this ending will certainly please any parent who's child has seen \\"Shrek\\" fifty plus times over and cannot contemplate such a dire fate for the partying pastry. So while I feel the original tale had more kick and verve, I don't have any serious problems with this tale. Brett gives the Gingerbread Baby enough of a sense of humor to tie the braids of his female pursuers together as well as leaping onto an ice floe when danger comes ever nearer. Brett's illustrations are the real stars of the show, however. Very very few illustrators pay half as much detail to their entire books as Brett does to a single square inch of any page. Her pictures are as adept at displaying blue porcelain mixing bowls and copper pans and teapots as they are at flesh tones, fur, and wicker. When you see a person with braids you can almost count the hairs on their head, they're so individualized. Brett also excels at knitted objects. This is an illustrator who understands the nature of knitting. You can actually count the stitches on Matti's red sweater in this book. And look at the minute details in the clothing each character wears. Or the intricate scrollwork of their furniture. Or the different borders surrounding every page, or the tiles, or the oven, or.... It just goes on and on. There's no other illustrator like her. If you've a penchant for the kinds of kids books you can read over and over to the little ones that contains tiny details in every crack and corner, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Gingerbread Baby","review":"I purchased the board book edition of this delightful story for my littlest readers and only later had occasion to hear the whole story at a library story hour.

Otherwise, you and your child will miss out on a great thing!"},{"Title":"Gingerbread Baby","review":"Matti is making a gingerbread man but he opens the oven too soon and out pops a gingerbread baby. Out the door he runs where he is chased by an ever growing group of people and animals. Our friend Matti has the perfect plan to catch the little guy and sets out to build the perfect trap. It WORKS!!! Only Matti knows what becomes of the gingerbread baby (and the readers).

But as the whole town gradually joins in the chase, young Matti, who did the baking and opened the oven too soon, stays quietly at home and consults the cook book for a solution. So, as the townspeople think they have chased the gingerbread baby to its doom, young Matti knows differently.Another beautiful book from a talented children's author. As with most of Jan's books, you should pay attention to the decorative borders for more insight into the story."},{"Title":"Gingerbread Baby","review":"Jan Brett has created another lovely story. The illustrations, as in all of her books, capture the interests and imaginations of children. The story, a spin-off of other stories about gingerbread characters, has its own original twists and a quite different and surprising ending. The gingerbread baby is just as peppy and proud as past gingerbread characters, as he runs away from Matti, Mother, Father, the cat, the dog, the goats, Martha and Madeline, the pig, the fox, the milk and cheese man, and finally all of the villagers. Children will love this new version of the antics of a gingerbread baby!Note to teachers: This story would be great to use with Christmas Around the World, or a study of Switzerland. Be sure to let your children make gingerbread people and houses.

Many of these marvelous creatures vanished less than 10,000 years ago, a heartbeat in geological time. You will be particularly struck by the superb, in-full-color computer graphics and photography in the book. The two arts are combined to give astonishing looks at what these animals looked like in their native habitats. If the book contained little more, it would be worth it on this basis alone. But there is much more to recommend the bookAfter a good introduction, this book examines life during the recent glaciation, and into today, by region. Six regions are encompassed. The first is never-glaciated Beringia, consisting of Alaska and the Bering Sea land bridge. Then, in turn, come the northwestern United States coast, the Great Plains, the Colorado Plateau and Great Basin, Florida, and the Eastern forest. The differences, and similairties, between the Ice Age climates and fauna are carefully explored for each area. Certain key animals in each region are analyzed by in-chapter profiles.These descriptions are completely up-to-date, and are accompanied by the excellent graphics previously discussed. Animals reviewed in this manner include two varieties of mammoth, the mastodon, the saber-toothed and scimitar cats, the giant. armadillo-like glyptodont, the giant short-faced bear, which was bigger than a Kodiak bear, and several varieties of ground sloth. You will also learn that quite a few animals survived the extinctions, including the moose, musk ox, grizzly bear, bison, elk, as well as many animals that lived on in Eurasia, but not here, such as the horse, the saiga antelope, cheetah, lion, camel, zebra, and the wisent, or European bison.In the closing chepter, the authors examine the possible reasons for the sudden extinctions of so many large, dominant animals within the span of a few thousand years. These include overkill by man, climatic change, and several other reason. The discussion is timely, thorough and apt.This book will provide many days of enjoyable, provocative reading. Given ongoing changes in weather, loss of wildlife habitat, and the like, are we continuing, and even accelerating these extinctions? This book offers excellent food for thought on such matters, but I will leave the ultimate decision to the reader, upon reflection.Very, very highly recommended to anyone with a high school or greater background, including graduate students and academics. Enjoy, and ponder."},{"Title":"Prehistoric America: A Journey through the Ice Age and Beyond","review":"This book was a waste of money and will be donated to the Goodwill soon. The book is unorganized, jumps all over the place, repeats its self too much, spends way too much time on how things look today, is written in a way that is uninteresting and confusing and the computer graphics are horrible! When I say horrible I mean they are an embarrassment to the publisher. It's sad when the old Prehistoric books from the 60's and 70's put the new stuff to shame. What ever happened books illustrated with real paint rather than is computer looking plastic crap laid down upon present day scenery rather than how things actually looked 10,000 years ago?"},{"Title":"Essential Tomb of Dracula, Vol. 4 (Marvel Essentials)","review":"I was surprised there was a Volume 4 of the \\"Essential Tomb of Dracula\\" because once they got to the end of the run of the Marvel comic book mostly written by Marv Wolfman and drawn by Gene Colan, I figured that was it. But there were some black & white magazines being put out at the same time and it is largely the Dracula stories from those titles that are collected here. However, there is also the original pencil art for the pages that Wolfman and Colan had to excise from \\"Tomb of Dracula\\" #70 when the finale was finally decided to be a double-issue. Half the pages have dialogue and there is an issue break, so you can have some fun figuring where these pages would have gone. But at least fans of the comic book get a little something new here even if they are familiar with all of the reprints.What we have in Volume are stories from issues #2-6 of \\"Tomb of Dracula\\" magazine, \\"Dracula Lives\\" #1-13, and \\"Frankenstein Monster\\" #7-9. However, the neat thing about this collection is that the stories are, for the most part, arranged \\"chronologically\\" according to the \\"life\\" of Dracula. After an article on \\"Bloodline: A Probable Outline of the Career of Count Vlad Dracula\\" compiled by Peter Gillis we go back to 1452 with the Marvel origin of the character in \\"That Dracula May Live Again\\" by Marv Wolfman and Neal Adams. There are six stories from the 15th century, another dozen before Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" in 1890, a three-part encounter with the Frankenstein Monster in 1898 (already reprinted in the \\"Essential Monster of Frankenstein\\"), and then 20th century stories from 1903, 1926, and 1944 (the Nazis meet Dracula) before we get to \\"Today\\" and the final eleven stories.This is an uneven collection of stories, which is to be expected with other Marvel writers and artists getting into the act in telling Dracula stories. The best of the bunch are \\"Sanctuary\\" by Roger McKenzie and Colon, the Adams drawn story mentioned above, \\"Suffer Not a Witch\\" by Roy Thomas with art by Alan Weiss and Dick Giordano, the Civil War tale \\"A House Divided\\" by James Shooter and Colan (okay, any time Colan draws a Dracula story it just looks so much better than, say, Frank Robbins), the short \\"Bounty for a Vampire\\" by Tony Isabell and Tony DeZeuniga,\\" and \\"A Night in the Unlife\\" by Gerry Conway and Alfredo Alcala.\\" But \\"This Blood Is Mine,\\" a story that has Dracula meeting up with the Countess Elizabeth Bathory, is particularly disappointing as do most of the attempts to introduce the Count into a particular time and place (e.g., the Fascist Rome of 1926 passing for gangland Chicago).This has to be the last volume in the collection and it certainly qualifies as complete from my perspective. I appreciate having \\"The Tomb of Dracula\\" completed, but if they would just get further along with the \\"Essential Fantastic Four,\\" \\"Essential Thor,\\" and \\"Essential Daredevil\\" I could be even happier."},{"Title":"Essential Tomb of Dracula, Vol. 4 (Marvel Essentials)","review":"The end of the Tomb of Dracula series is contained in this volume. There are other things like Dracula magazines and other bits and pieces put in to fill it out.Note that it has been discovered that the excellent original artwork has been altered and censored in some cases. That sort of prudishness in very disappointing in something that was always aimed at adults."},{"Title":"Essential Tomb of Dracula, Vol. 4 (Marvel Essentials)","review":"This volume could be suspected of being solely for completists, since it reprints little-known short stories from Marvel's many horror mags. In fact, before reading it, I feared it might feel like a lot of inventory material. I was quite happy to be proven wrong.Editorial care was taken to present these stories in chronological order, giving them a biographical flavor (we follow Dracula from the late XVth century to the present). The artwork is unequal, but we're treated to some good work by Neal Adams, John Buscema and Alan Lee Weis, by many Filipino artists whose art never looks so good as in black and white, by a young Paul Gulacy and by Dracula's best illustrator ever, Gene Colan.This final Essential Dracula tome can not compete with the previous three, since they presented the brilliant run of the main Dracula title by Wolfman and Colan; however, it certainly makes a welcome companion. And as ever, at the price, it's a bargain."},{"Title":"Essential Tomb of Dracula, Vol. 4 (Marvel Essentials)","review":"In the 1970s, Marvel had a reasonably long-running comic book called Tomb of Dracula that benefited from having a single writer and artist for most of the run. This allowed consistency and the ability to have nice, long story arcs in the story of Dracula and the people out to stop him. The series concluded in its 70th issue, and is covered in its entirety in the first three volumes of The Essential Tomb of Dracula. Volume Four is a collection of stories that take place both before and after the principal storyline.Despite the title, only a few of the comics that this collection features actually were named Tomb of Dracula, and these were actually Tomb of Dracula Magazine, not the original comic. In addition, there are stories from Dracula Lives and Frankenstein Monster (the latter of which can also be found in the Essential Monster of Frankenstein.The bulk of the stories take place in the past, starting with Dracula's origin and his assumption of the role of Lord of the Undead. Other stories take place at various times between the 1500s and modern day, typically featuring people trying to take advantage of the vampire and usually coming out the worst for it. On rare occasion, Dracula is killed, but when you're undead, death is a merely temporary condition.Just as the original comic was a quality product due to consistency, this volume suffers as it is a mishmash of different writers and artists. Also, outside of Dracula, there are no other regular characters, which I find detrimental: the best comics usually have a good supporting cast. Fortunately, there are few bad stories and a decent amount of good ones, but compared to other Essential collections, this merits only a high three stars. After the first three volumes of Essential Tomb of Dracula, this one is interesting but still a letdown."},{"Title":"Antoni Gaudi : Visionary Architect of the Sacred and the Profane","review":"The biggest problem here is layout and design. 17 of the 80 pages are text, the rest photos; the text itself about Gaudi is average, being \\"spiced up\\" by using a variety of color background paper, and the insertion of large oddball font quotes about Gaudi, supposing to be avant-garde in presentation, but annoying and hard to read. The bulk of the book is photographs, which suffer from 3 major problems. First, the paper used is matte paper, not glossy, so even the photos taken in bright sunlight have a dull appearance (some of the photos are taken in shadows, as if the photographer did not want to come back later to get a good shot). Secondly, the photos do not support the text: With 17 pages of text and 60 or so of photos, you would think that when the text is describing Gaudi's invention and use of the parabolic arch there would be some photos near by to show what they are talking about. Thirdly, a poor choice of photos which are not labeled as to what they are, you have to look all the way in the back to find out what the photo is of (there is a full two page photo of Casa Mila, and the entire photo is out of focus. Unexcusable.)Basically, average text with photos thrown in without thought to the whole, disguised as being hip with colored paper and hard to read quotations. If you are very interested in Gaudi, the best analysis of him I have found yet is the last 90 pages or so of Robert Hughes' book Barcelona, learned and insightful."},{"Title":"The Concise Dictionary of Linguistics (Oxford Paperback Reference)","review":"This is a good book for linguistics majors, especially if you intend to go to grad school. The book has definitions of just about every word I've needed to look up, but sometimes the definitions aren't very clear and are worded in the same difficult jargon that makes you need to look these words up in the first place. Longer definitions would be helpful. But in cases where words learned in class need clarifying, it does offer another explanation.

On the other hand, Matthews' dictionary, unlike Crystal's, has brief entries on individual linguists (Panini, Halliday) and specific languages (Etruscan, Pashto).

In spite of the considerable difference in size and price, I have found that Matthews' work has more of the terms I want to look up, and his explanations are often more to the point. I don't use it much for phonetic terminology, so any deficiency in this regard vis a vis Crystal has not been an issue for me.I appreciate seeing the names of at least a few of the most outstanding linguists in history listed. New students in the field should find these references to the luminaries helpful. Their names show up in the literature with some regularity, and it is nice to have some place to turn for a quick summary of their contributions.For students of linguistics, I recommend that you get Matthews' dictionary first, if you can't afford both at once, and then get Crystal's dictionary later.

It is, however, unfortunate that she even dignifies this quasi-racist notion by entertaining it. After all, it was the Germans, not the Poles, who murdered 5-6 million Jews. And, with the possible exception of Haman's Persia, no other nation, at any time or place in history, had ever attempted to destroy the Jews as a whole. Despite this, no one suggests that Germans are innately or especially anti-Semitic or evil. Go figure.As for Poles sometimes betraying fugitive Jews, Gabert understands the fact that this must be put in the context of the Poles themselves being a nation of victims of the Germans: \\"Doubtless many Poles who denounced Jews did so out of personal conviction, but the broader context of fear and poverty suggests many did not.\\" (p. 209).Lehman's book, having refrained from demonizing the Poles as a nation of anti-Semites, has earned the displeasure of arch-Polonophobe Jan T. Gross. Gabert mentions the fact (p. 213) that Gross has written an unfavorable review of it in the AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW (February 2003, p. 288). I checked it. Gross' review is very superficial."},{"Title":"Kabloona: Among the Inuit","review":"I looked up at the bookshelf over my computer and spotted the battered 1941 edition of Kabloona that has been in my family for 40 years since I first read it in the village of Coppermine (now Kugluktuk) when I was a 12 year old boy in 1961. I decided to do an AMAZON.com search to see if anyone else knew of this marvel that had so enchanted me as a child, and found the site you are now visiting.We were much more civilized in the Coppermine of 1961 than the same village the author had visited 20 years earlier. We had electricity, and communication with the outside world by a Morse code key at the Department of Transport office, plus we had a scheduled visit by a single-engine Otter every two weeks. It was a magical time for me (adults found it a difficult time, but they simply did not understand things)The book Kabloona gave me insight into the minds of the people around me. We were a community of 200 Inuit (Eskimos) and 35 whites. The whites had as many of the amenities of civilization as they could garner, but the Inuit lived much as described in De Poncin's book.I was enthralled by the awesome hunters with their dog sleds and their magnificent huskies, not show dogs or racing dogs, but working dogs that made the difference between life and death. The men would bring back the carcasses of seal and caribou, and the furs they had trapped. The women sewed the furs into beautiful garments that kept man, woman and child warm in intolerably hard winters. It was also the women's job to butcher the carcasses, which they did with incredible speed and skill using only the ulu, or woman's knife. I regularly witnessed the activities of this way of life. De Poncin described all this in his book, but he also gave me insight into the underlying culture I was immersed in.You can't live the life I led 40 years ago as a boy in the high Canadian arctic, but you can vicariously journey there to an even more primitive time, and enter into the incredible peace and stillness of an arctic winter night in an igloo, or the warmth and safety of a house made of snow as an unbelievable storm rages outside around you.I recently spoke by satellite telephone to a man in Coppermine from my home in Missouri where I now live, and found that the village I once knew is now a very different place. But you can go back to an earlier era with De Poncin. I assure you, you won't regret your wonderful voyage with him.I don't know if I'm permitted to speak of it here, but I have described my life in those years in the Arctic in a book, The Boy Who Fell To Earth. It is available at Amazon.com for those would like to buy a hard copy, or can be read for free on my warmbooks.com web site."},{"Title":"Kabloona: Among the Inuit","review":"My good friend and I were talking a while back after I had watched the movie The Fast Runner, which he had recommended. Talk got around to my deciding to send him my old childhood copy (out of print, I believe) of Peter Freuchen's Book of the Eskimos, and his deciding to send me his old childhood copy of Kabloona. Neither of us had ever heard of the other's book. I must say, as much as I've always liked Freuchen, I got the better of the deal!What a wonderful book. So well written, such nice storytelling, so enjoyable, refreshingly honest, and unexpectedly insightful. It is haunting. It really is in a class by itself, although I have trouble putting my finger on exactly why this is so. All I know is that I did not want it to end, as I'm sure the author did not want his time in the North to end. And, like him, I don't think it will be the same if I go back and try it again. And I know I also had a strange feeling throughout which only later I identified as a form of envy, envy for the experiences this man had and for his ability to experience them so deeply. I've seldom felt envy mixed with awe and admiration like this before.Of all the book, I was most deeply moved by his account of the priest out in the middle of nowhere who had survived and kept warm in incredible cold merely through the power of faith and prayer. Humbling.A man comes out of nowhere, lives these experiences, writes this incredible book, and disappears back into nowhere. Amazing. Read it."},{"Title":"Kabloona: Among the Inuit","review":"Gontran de Poncins's \\"Kabloona\\" is a classic of Arctic adventure, to be ranked alongside Farley Mowat's \\"People of the Deer,\\" Harold Horwood's \\"White Eskimo\\" and parts of Peter Freuchen's \\"Vagrant Viking.\\" A French aristocrat with a genuine yearning for adventure, de Poncins made his way to North America just prior to the last war. By stages, he managed to go right up into latter day Nunavut, some of the highest inhabited Arctic territory in Canada's north. Yet he didn't stop there. Putting himself into the hands of an Eskimo hunter who happened to be heading off onto the sea ice, he underwent an extraordinary odyssey lasting the winter through, in which he camped with the Eskimos in their winter igloos.de Poncins takes us into the very private, very communal world of these northern people. Private because, for Europeans, entering this strangely illuminated landscape was even then almost an impossibility. de Poncins admits that his initial impression was overshadowed by the nausea which sprang immediately into being as he tried to deal with the strange mixture of smells in the igloos. Most Europeans would not pass that first test and many an estimate of Eskimo culture has been biased by just such an affront to a sensitive olfactory centre. Yet once he had passed this initial barrier, a process which he says took some time, he found himself in a world unlike any other he had experienced or imagined. It is into this ageless community that he takes us for a very privileged glimpse of the last of the true ice-dwellers.Although a French national, de Poncins chose to remain in North America and he wrote his text about the Inuit in English, in collaboration with a friend. Not much is known about the author's life thereafter, as he did not publish much other work, but like G. B. Edwards's solitary yet wonderful book about life on Guernsey, \\"The Book of Ebenezer Le Page,\\" this one book by de Poncins is a major accomplishment."},{"Title":"Kabloona: Among the Inuit","review":"It's been years since I read &quot;Kabloona&quot; by gontran de poncins. I don't remember the specifics of the book (I'm going to read it again, soon). What I do remember is the lingering humanity of the people. The hard life they lived. The culture shock between my life and theirs. I remember the mirror they held before me, forcing me to question our idea of &quot;progress,&quot; &quot;civility,&quot; and &quot;modern man&quot;. Books such as &quot;Kabloona&quot; and &quot;Black Elk Speaks&quot; by John G. Neihardt and &quot;Mutant Message&quot; by Marlo Morgan tells us more about our roots as a species than many of the great thinkers and philosphers who speak in the abstract and grandeur of modern man.

For one thing, the narrator is marvelous in recreating both the 1930's world of France and Frozen Canada. I can't think of any other book or audio that so successfully transported me into an alien culture. Considering that there are quite a few films and books about Eskimos, why buy this one written 70 years ago? Answer: the literary quality of this work surpasses the prose of the last quarter century. When you listen to the narrator weave his tale, it mirrors the experience of hearing a tobacco chewing explorer slowly recounting his adventures in the wild. The story dives deep into the interior life of the author as much as it details an ethnographic examination of (primitive) Inuit life. The myths and values of the Eskimos contrast sharply with the borgeouis morals of a gentleman of Paris. For example, in Eskimo culture, there is little concept of private property...that's why an Eskimo man will let you borrow his wife or a snow knife. Language in the arctic is far more concrete. A polar bear is HE WHO HAS NO SHADOW. Far away, in the cold Arctic, author Grontran De Poncins learns what it means to be human, a man preeminently. This is a romance, a classic reminiscent of Robinson Crusoe. If you buy the audio CD, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Kabloona: Among the Inuit","review":"Whenever I am asked the pitifully unfair question, &quot;What is your favorite book?&quot;, I still seem to spew the title Kabloona year after year. I don't honestly know why the book has touched me so, and why I keep comparing Gontran de Poncins to all others pretending to find themselves. Maybe that is why the book means so much to me, that Gontran is not perfect, that he needs to find that piece of him which is vital, and would go to the top of the world to see if it was there. I am still thanking him for thinking to put it all down on paper."},{"Title":"Kabloona: Among the Inuit","review":"This book is many things. For me it was an important and interesting study in human ecology. The organism in question is the well-adapted Eskimo. The book is also an object and abject study in how the white man (Kabloona) fails to adapt to the Arctic environment, frequently displaying aberrant and bizarre behaviour. De Poncins doesn't spare himself in this anthropological study. Beyond De Poncins actual words lies a haunting memory of a world that has now ceased to exist. I will never understand how Barry Lopez, in &quot;Arctic Dreams&quot;, implies (by neglect) that this primary source doesn't exist.

It was wonderful to find that it was back in print, as we no longer have to worry that if a copy we lend does not come back, it will be lost forever. It is a completely engrossing and delightful book."},{"Title":"Kabloona: Among the Inuit","review":"After I finished this fantastic audio book, I looked it up on Amazon to buy a used hard copy. I was little chagrined to discover the original printing date. Wow, this contemporary, quirky book -- that I just fell in love with -- was written 70 years ago. What a fun twist in time travel! Of course, three things aided the modern day allusion; first, it was read to me (on my ipod) by a modern audio book legend, Grover Gardner; Second, the setting is timeless, the remote wild's of the Canadian Arctic, and finally; I assumed the charming French-to-English translation was to blame for forcing just a hint of formality. Regardless, this classic adventure will stick to your ribs long after you have finished it. It is incredibly well written. It reads very fast for a book from the 40's. The story begins with Panches leaving Paris to live and study among the most remote tribal people on earth, the Canadian Arctic Inuits. For 15 months he moved among three remote Arctic tribes, living as they do, from day to day, absorbing their primitive, almost prehistoric, way of life. Their nomadic life was driven by hunger and thrashed about by the harsh laws of nature's violent forces. In this barren sub zero land, the Inuit face the daily threat of starvation and exposure with great indifference. Past physically freezing to death, Panches biggest mental challenge turned out to be isolation. In addition, he had to reinvent his composure, severely modifying his natural inclinations with every Inuit interaction (several, life threatening). Panches describes his cunning effort in breaking through the cultural barrier; interpreting, in his words, \\"a truly primitive mind.\\" The book barks of some prejudice, but this was a man's fair conclusion after keenly studying the unique Inuit mind and method (...in 1940). Light a fire, and read this adventure book during a cold snap. How cold? Cold enough to yank a 30 lb. fish out of the water and have it flash freeze before it skids across the ice. That's cold baby!"},{"Title":"Kabloona: Among the Inuit","review":"I read Kabloona about 12 years ago, and it remains one of the very best books I've ever read. An amazing story that gives tremendous insight into the remarkable Inuit culture. It's fabulous. I'm on the site now because I'm purchasing a newer copy to read it again!"},{"Title":"Kabloona: Among the Inuit","review":"Whether owing to the time when it was written or just because de Poncins--a wealthy man with too much time on his hands--was blessed with a reporter's eye and a poet's soul, this account of life among the eskimos is refreshingly human. There is no mushy anthropology going on here, no p.c. sentimentalizing about noble savages or any of that rot, just a beautifully written rendition of life within the barren cold. The characters in de Poncins' account are thoughtfully drawn, as if they were players in a novel--from a hermit priest to white traders to the eskimoes themselves.And the writing truly is special--for example, fierce winter winds are described as a wild old man stomping around upstairs, and the ecstasy of the newborn spring is experienced with such clarity that a reader will (almost!) experience the same libidinous exhilaration shared by the eskimoes.This book is a delight. For those who crave adventure/exploration stories it's a must (especially those interested in the Great White North but uninterested in below zero temperatures), but it is equally important for those who simply like a good read."},{"Title":"Kabloona: Among the Inuit","review":"This is an incredible story about a young man who is tired of the endless monotony and seemingly emptiness of life. He travels to the Central Artic and lives with the Canadian Eskimos. He lives the next year or so as an Eskimo, not just with the Eskimo. Hunting and eating raw seal meat, making and living in an igloo, the extreme cold and the love for one another and the acceptance of the white man, the \\"Kabloona\\". You have got to read this story. The story sucks you in and spits you out at the end as if you were actually there."},{"Title":"Kabloona: Among the Inuit","review":"This fascinating, albeit racist ethnographic study, is extremelywell read by Grover Gardner. One has to take into considerationthe historical period in which this book was written, hence, theEurocentric orientation and unflattering descriptions of Eskimopractices. Even with these derogatory descriptions, however,this story is fascinating and important."},{"Title":"Kabloona: Among the Inuit","review":"I read this book and thought, yes this Frenchman makes many derogatory and embarassingly insensitive remarks about the Inuit. However, contrary to what one reviewer said below in \\"Good descriptions, bad insights, July 27, 2005\\", the author slowly develops a great respect for the intelligence, culture and abilities of these people so much so that he begins to emulate them. It is a subtle conversion story wrapped in a fabulous adventure; thoroughly enjoyable and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Kabloona: Among the Inuit","review":"I came upon this book PURELY by accident, and I now consider it one of the most fortuitous moments of my life! This is a fascinating and INCREDIBLY well-written account of a Frenchman's experiences living amidst the Inuit at the turn of the century--he is honest, hilarious, philosophical, and makes you feel like you're bumping along behind him on the sled across the tundra. I think it should be required reading of every single high school anthropology and sociology class. It is EXCELLENT!"},{"Title":"Kabloona: Among the Inuit","review":"What can I add to the other reviews? This book is special, unique, it should never, never be out of print.

I just got it off the shelf to re-read it for the fourth or fifth time, and thought I would check to see if it had come back to life in print. This is a truly marvelous book that provides a window on another world that no longer exists: snow-bound Inuit who have never seen a white man. The scenes, experiences, characters and insights are unforgettable--and all real. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Kabloona: Among the Inuit","review":"I read this book many, many years ago and have forgotten many of the details. I remember one, however. When the old one couldn't travel, they put her out on the ice and drove off. That is so relevant to our contemporary society and the discussions of social security and the elderly, caring for the disabled, etc. We can't leave the disadvantaged on the ice and drive off but must find some way to care for them."},{"Title":"The Greek view of life","review":"Textbooks on the history of philosophy tend to be remotely dry. They just summarize the text in arid words, and then skip to the next philosopher in the chronicle order. Writers of those textbook seem to think that we should rever the philopophers, do not understand them. Reading through them only gives us the superficial impression and worse, the knowledge we&iexcl;ve got is likely to be evaporated to the oblivion. We can&iexcl;t imagine that those philosophers lived their own life and breathed the air just like us. But the texts they left to us have what to say. And it&iexcl;s closely related to its own time. To understand those texts, we need to know their worlds, for the text says about the world it&iexcl;s written. Greek philosophy and literature also should be apprehended with such background knowledge. For example, there were no professional philosophers isolated from the rest of the society in Archaic Greek world, like professors of philosophy we could see in our Universities. Greek philosophers told about their worldly affairs. So Aristotle was mastered that much various fields from political sciences, ethics, aesthetics, cosmology to botany. In other word, we should know their life to figure out what they say at all. Greek philosophy was not isolated from the society unlike contemporary philosophy. This book should be definitely helpful to know their time. As the title of the book implies, this deals with how the Greek saw their world. Each chapter describes the way they see elements of their world from the religion, the state, the individual, to the art. With closing the last page of the book, I bet you could illustrate what was the life of the Greek in your mind."},{"Title":"The Greek view of life","review":"I read this book prior to beginning a course on Greek mythology, and I'm finding its insights into ancient Greek culture helpful as I follow my lessons."},{"Title":"The Greek view of life","review":"The quarrel of the philosophers with the myths is not that they are not true, but that they are not edifying. The opposition between science and religion was developed early in ancient Greece. Plato, the deepest thinker, was also the farthest from popular faith. The Greek religion involved a belief in a number of deities who were personifications of the powers of nature and were founders and sustainers of civil society. The harmony which was the essence of Greek civilization was a temporary compromise.In the Greek conception the citizen was an aristocrat. In the majority of the Greek states slaves were a greater part of the population. The states Crete and Sparta were practically military garrisons. The majority of the Greek states were in a constant state of flux. The Peloponnesian War represented a contest between democratic and oligarchic states. Plato based his REPUBLIC chiefly on Sparta. The constitution of Athens was political equality imposed on social inequality. The Greek states were not well-organized.The fusian of the idea of the beautiful and the good is the control point in the Greek theory of art. Primarily, Greek sculpture was an expression of the national religion. Music was the center of Greek education. Music is a union of melody and rhythm and poetry. Poetry was viewed as a storehouse of practical wisdom. To represent suffering as the punishment of sin is the constant bent of Aeschylus. To justify the law of God against the presumption of man is the central idea of Sophocles. In Greek tragedy the general point of view predominates. The Greeks sought to create and maintain essential harmony."},{"Title":"Evaluating Your Collection: The 14 Points of Connoisseurship (Winterthur Decorative Arts Series)","review":"I still use this book when writing a formal analysis of a decorative arts piece.

I say 'seemingly absurdist' because, like Catch-22, one suspects there is more than a little truth in Voinovich's portrayal of bureaucratic tomfoolery. Chonkin himself calls to mind George Macdonald Fraser's McAuslan (McAuslan in the Rough), the bumbling private in a Scottish Highland regiment. Others have likened it theThe Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Penguin Classics), which I have not yet read.The background of Stalinist terror gives Voinovich's work a darker cast. Army bureaucrats endeavor at all costs to keep a low profile to avoid attracting the attention of the higher ups. Such attention is too often accompanied in their minds with imprisonment, exile, or death.A favorite bit occurs late in the book when a regiment has surrounded the village in order to take Chonkin into custody. Chonkin has taken seven members of the secret police captive and the regiment has come to the rescue. (In the meantime, Chonkin has turned this group of seven into such efficient farm workers that word soon reaches the newspapers and even Comrade Stalin. The local chairman feels certain doom is sure to follow such success.) The captain of the secret police escapes, but falls into the hands of army, which he mistakenly thinks is the German army. Much hilarity ensues.Although the book is somewhat an artifact of the Stalinist era and is almost certainly even better if one can read it in the original Russian (alas, I cannot), the book still rates five stars and my highest recommendation in part for the rare look it provides into life in the wartime Soviet Union and in part for its timeless portrayal of army bureaucracy, and the universal slacker, Ivan Chonkin."},{"Title":"The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin","review":"Funny, good-natured look at a bumbling Soviet private sent to guard an airplane which is stuck out in the sticks just prior to the German invasion in 1941. Satirizes all manner of things Soviet, most especially bureaucracy and the pomposity of its upper echelons. Somewhat similar to The Good Soldier Svejk in this respect, but at a much more manageable size and pace. Some really funny bits about Comrade Stalin. Especially recommended for Russian literature devotees, but should be enjoyable to most. There is a sequel called Pretender to the Throne."},{"Title":"The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin","review":"For those who may think that Russian literature is unrelieved doom and gloom, crime and punishment, endless Slavic heaviness about the meaning of life from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok, Vladimir Voinovich's The life and extraordinary adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin is a masterpiece of comic writing that you will not want to miss. Chonkin is the not quite as bright younger brother of Jaroslav Hasek's Good Soldier Svejk, with this exception: Hasek's hero wears the mask of naivet&eacute;, but after a while we can tell that it is just that, a mask, and that Josef Svejk is a lot more clever than he is letting on. Ivan Chonkin, on the other hand, really is as nave as he seems. He is trying to do his best by Stalin, the Red Army, and the Soviet Union; it's just that the people running the Soviet Union are dangerous idiots who can't quite comprehend just how dangerously stupid they really are.Voinovich published the novel in France in 1975, for reasons that are clear just as soon as you start reading; no Soviet censor could allow its publication inside Russia, given the subject matter-in his time Stalin had writers imprisoned and executed for less trenchant criticism of him and his rule. The targets of Voinovich's hilarious satire is Soviet society itself and all of its institutions, beginning with Stalin himself and the Communist party, the Soviet military and its officer corps, the secret police, collectivized agriculture and the crackpot genetic theories of Lysenko, party propaganda, political officers, and World War II. There is little in Soviet life that does not take a hit as the patriotic and conscientious Private Chonkin, who is not the greatest soldier in the world but is doing the best that he can, tries to do his duty and creates mayhem in the process. Read it and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin","review":"Voinovich was expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union, because of his poignant satire. The guardians of the communist order could not stand his free, humorous exposition of the follies of the Soviet society. &quot;Private Chonkin&quot; is his masterpiece. Voinovich shows much that plagued the Soviet society: pervasive alchoholism, bureaucratic intransingence, sychophantic officials, horrific abuse of power, and the spread of pseudo-science (much fun is made in the book of Lysenko's approach to evolution.)Voinovich is not bitter or angry. He finds a place for good-natured humor, even amid the appalling conditions of Russian's brutal rural communism. This book is invaluable to all those who want to be acquainted with the character and spirit of communist despotism in Russia in the twentieth century. But in the end, one does not put down this book feeling discouraged and sad. Orwellian gloom does not prevail here. And why is that? Because people retain the ability to laugh at themselves and at the life around them, not taking too seriously grave doctrines and events. Chonkin survives the advent of terror, and his simplicity and good nature prove superior to dogma and repression, suggesting, at least to me, that a single human being is generally more valuable than all utopian doctrines and insane plans for implementing them."},{"Title":"The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin","review":"A previous reviewer compared Chonkin to the WWI story of a Czech soldier named \\"Good Soldier Svejk\\" which is a classic of military bumbling. This is more of a statement of problems of the Soviet System as it existed just before WW2. Chonkin is a 'so-so' soldier (a misfit) who is sent to a small collective farm (a kolkhov) to guard a damaged airplane. Though he is to be there for only a week, with the German Barbarossa attack he is forgotten about. So he goes about his orders as expected.Some one (a neighbor) reports him to the authorities, who order that Chonkin is to be arrested as a deserter. All of the rest of the story hinges on the propensity of the Soviet system never letting the right hand know what the left is doing, nor why, nor how, nor when. There are constant digs about the clumsyness and inefficiency of the system and how people go about trying to be invisible.Keeping in mind that the book was written in the middle sixties, it is a true attack on the time of Brezhnev and his inability to be the \\"Stalin\\" that he wanted to, as the system ground slowly to oblivion. This story wasn't printed in Russia until after the fall of communism, but was widely circulated as a 'samizdat' (which is an underground printing) and famous for its' attack on the system."},{"Title":"The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin","review":"I wasn't expecting this book to be as accessable as I found it. I know next to nothing about life in Russia during the outbreak of WWII, and I knew going in that this was a novel about a man in the Russian army. I figured there'd be numerous names and references to people, places, and policies I'd have to gloss over, and just hope I'd get an idea of the book. I was wrong.I was also wrong in thinking that it wouldn't be that funny. I found it amusing and entertaining to see slapstick in a &quot;European Classic&quot;. But, it wasn't stupid humor. It seems as though Voinovich had a lot of thought behind it, twisting it around so it not only made the reader laugh, but also tied into the plot.The only thing I thought it may have lacked was character development. It is a short novel, but I felt as if I didn't really get to know Gladishev, Chonkin, or Nyura. Perhaps given a few more pages, I could have identified with these characters a bit more. But, since they are from a culture so foreign to myself, perhaps it would have taken a lot more for me to identify with the characters. Perhaps it's my own sheltered way of life that inhibited a stronger connection with this novel.If anything, this book is a fabulous introduction into Russian culture at the beginning of WWII. Being that it is a fiction/comedy however, there may not be a lot of accuracy in its content, but it at least leaves one with a sense of lifestyle to which these characters live."},{"Title":"The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin","review":"I am a native Russian speaker and have read this is the book in its original form. I was just having a friendly argument with someone and in the process found this. I had no idea some poor SOB translated it into English (I really don't envy him).Now I have no idea how good the translation is and to me it's practically impossible to translate Russian into English well, especially when it's something funny. However, if it's even half as funny in English as it is in Russian it'll be the funniest book you'll ever read.While reading the book I found myself dying laughing 85% of the time to the point where I'd have to stop reading for one or more of the following reasons. I'd get terrible stomach cramps, couldn't see anymore due to the fact that I was completely teary eyed, or go into unending fits of coughing. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin","review":"This was the selection of my book club. I was a little leery, because unless it's EXTREMELY well done, satire doesn't work for me - it's an all-or-nothing proposition. Anything less than Mark-Twain-level and I can't be bothered.Well, &quot;Private Chonkin&quot; was a pleasant surprise. I had the feeling that the writer and/or translator had a lot of fun with this one - I kept hearing a giggle off the page as I read. As is always the case with satire, it helps to be somewhat familiar with the reality that's being skewed, but in this case, it's not a requirement for enjoying the book.The premise is pretty good, and ripe for satire - hapless nudnik of a soldier is assigned to guard a downed plane in a remote village in the Soviet Union just before the beginning of WW II. His superiors forget about him as he settles into the life of the village, and when they finally remember him, all hell breaks loose as he proves to be a lot smarter than any of them. The author skewers everyone and everything, but none as savagely as the Party and the Army.The depictions of life in remote areas can be hair-raising; the villages, the people, and their lives are pretty primitive. I had the sense that this part of the world hadn't changed in centuries. And I also had the feeling that these were accurate descriptions, rooted in some pretty harsh realities. The only parts that I felt bordered on tedium were the lengthy descriptions of Private Chonkin's dreams; they played a role in the overall satire but otherwise didn't move the story forward.With translations, it's hard to tell what you're really appreciating: the art of the writer or that of the translator. Obviously, the translator has to have something to work with, but the nuances could be credited to either. That said, I found this book well-written and highly amusing, and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates this kind of writing."},{"Title":"The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin","review":"This book served as my introduction to Vladimir Voinovich. It has to be one of greatest Soviet satires ever written.If you are going to read this book you MUST also read \\"Pretender to the Throne The Further Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin\\". \\"Pretender to the Throne\\" is essentially part II of this book and, in my opinion, even better than part I. Voinovich masterfully unfolds the chaos of the Soviet Union through the simple life of Ivan Chonkin, a common Russian soldier. This book will leave you laughing outloud.I highly recommend this and other works by Voinovich.

As a fan of Ms. Van Wormer since Riverside Drive, I thought the Times' stamp of her status as &quot;master of romantic suspense&quot; for The Last Lover came way overdue.Sally Harington of Expose is back, but now the reporter's starchy New England values meet the casual sociopathy of Hollywood players. With her usual ability to light up characters in a few vivid strokes, Van Wormer paints one as physically off-putting for &quot;the air of heavy handed money, the promise of, if all else fails, I'll pay you&quot;. Let's just say that nothing Sally learned at Castleford High prepared her for the viciousness of her welcome to the big leagues.But what I've long admired in this author reflects what she doesn't do. While delivering her patented wall-to wall suspenseful tour through the world of bicoastal superachievers, she resists the cheap shot and instead puts real flesh and blood on even the most driven and sometimes despicable.Van Wormer writes about the celebrity slice of society as a more forgiving Tom Wolfe, taking care to illuminate the motives of those who constantly measure the distance to perfection. That's why putting yourself in her capable hands never fails to satisfy.PS - if you have a chance to see Ms Van Wormer read/speak in person, as I have, drop other plans to do it. In the warmest, one-on-one way, she will give you the lowdown on the world she writes about with tingling insight."},{"Title":"The Last Lover","review":"Connecticut reporter Sally Harrington accompanies her lover Spencer Hawes across the continent to attend a Hollywood party where they meet rising movie superstar Lilliana Martin.

Sally ends her relationship with Spencer and flies home the next day.Not too long after that Lilliana's boy friend, union president Cliff Yorlin arrives demanding to know where his beloved is. Sally has no idea, but believes she is probably with Spencer who allegedly is in Hawaii. However, Cliff quickly returns to the West Coast where someone kills him. With Lilliana and Spencer still missing and now Cliff dead, law enforcement officials turn their attention to the last known person to see the trio alive, Sally, as the prime suspect.THE LAST LOVER is an exciting romantic suspense novel that takes the audience on a coast to coast ride that looks inside the glitz and garish glamour of today's media. The story line is fast-paced, but truly belongs to the strong cast of characters. In a return engagement (see EXPOSE), Sally remains a great protagonist seeking to find love even as her needs and desires confuse her. The support ensemble augment the tale with vigor and a two-coastal insight that shows Laura Van Wormer is a wonderful author who makes reading fun.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Last Lover","review":"the last we see of Sally Harrington.I really enjoy these books.Fast and furious dialog.

A plethora of wonderful characters with diverse backgrounds.This story takes us from Conneticut to NYC to LA and back again.The mystery works well, I think. You never know who the good guys and bad guys are. Not entirely, anyway, until the denouement.Throw in the mafia, actors, producers, the feds and primetime news. Stir in one explicit sex scene, which isn't gratuitous in the plotting of the story and you have an engaging read.Sally's love life is a plot in itself.

Randi presents in an immediately accessible style the powerful lessons we can learn from tapping into our emotions and using them intelligently. The book is peppered with examples from her many clients, illustrating the successful transformations that we can achieve in our work and lives when we make this deep lying shift. The clarity of style in which the book is written belies the force of its message. Randi cautions that the choice to understand what our emotions are telling us can lead us to places of personal pain. Yet to ignore our emotions will perpetuate the issues and challenges that are currently causing us problems. The end of the book contains some useful guiding exercises and I found the exercise in the text on page 30 to be deeply moving for me personally. Randi exposes her own journey and how she has overcome the difficulties that she has faced. It takes courage to express such vulnerability to an unknown readership and this, perhaps, is the underlying acknowledgement of tapping ones own emotional intelligence - the courage to confront our own vulnerability.

She succeeds in conveying the highly complex topic of emotional intelligence in a simple way without banalising the art of managing yourself. Emotional intelligence is often presented in an academic way which means those in need to understand this topic often miss out. Therefore \\"The art of leading yourself\\" has the potential to capture a wide audience thence enabling more people to take an active role in developing and improving their situation and becoming managers of their own lives. Randi's book and seminars have definitely contributed to my personal development. I have found the strength to confront myself and as a result I have become a more complete person, both private and professional.

I found myself deeply involved in every story, waking up emotions and feelings and urges that apparently had tucked themselves away for a long time!!!

It gets to the core of how we relate to other people and what blocks that communication. And, since we understand other people only to the extent we understand ourselves, this book explains how we can better understand ourselves and how to remove the blocks that prevent us from being everything we want to be. The author conveys this message from direct personal experience and with many examples from her workshops. Her style is authentic, direct and personable. It is clear that she is not selling a new &quot;power tool&quot; to use in your interpersonal relationships but she is genuinely interested in helping you reach your own fullest human potential.

This book does not provide thorough examinations drawn from successful and/or unsuccessful examples, nor does it give the reader critical analyses to back up the writer&iexcl;s own point of view. What we get from this book is a set of rules, reminders, and assumptions which is not practical enough in my opinion, and perhaps only good enough for those who first come to the newly developed internet industry.The idea to link biological Darwinism with industrial Darwinism to explain how the fittest survives in highly competitive business environment is not a new thing. People who have had a certain degree of understanding about it will be disappointed as the writer goes all the way to explain what they have already known. People who have been close enough to the development of the internet industry will find this book uncreative. People who have already been in this business for some time will not be inspired by this book, but most likely be bored by its dragging explanation of how &iexcl;the fittest survives&iexcl;&iexcl;Xa concept these people probably have already known.Although this book only provides a set of generalized ideas, &iexcl;7 Breakthrough Business Strategies for Surviving in the Cutthroat Web Economy&iexcl; as its subtitle describes, it can be seen as quite a handy book. At the end of every chapter is a brief reminder of how certain problems can be solved. This may be a streak of help when the manager is buried by overloaded work and forgets where he stands. This book is helpful, too, for those who newly come into contact with the industrial side of the internet."},{"Title":"Digital Darwinism","review":"The catchy title is just a title, and it drew me in to a fun and fantastic read. A bright spot is the examples of entrepreneurs (the real E in e-commerce) finding the Web as an ally in contrast to examples of subsided businesses that relied solely on the Web and Web hype (those with a hammer always seeking a nail; those with a computer seeing business as data). Includes keen admonishments toward certain companies that tout the Web yet deny Web-users access to their products or services (initials are B&amp;N, CompUSA). The lesson delivered is not in the list that frothed to the top but the personalities behind the steps, along with some vernacular mixed in with good narrative. (Dell newbies attentive to low badge numbers; Seven Cycle chapter alone could inspire someone to just start a business; REI chapter makes me want to try out their store.) Nowadays companies with Web sites scream customer-service-this, customer-service-that.... The brightest spot in this book is the back-to-the-future (back to the past?) notion of customers driving business, people service, craft, artisan and manufacturing jobs instead of automation--people can do this kind of thing since the Web allows efficiency (customized products) so companies aren't concerned so much about stocking warehouses as entrepreneurship. Nowadays companies with Web sites tout &quot;customer- service-this, customer-service-that.&quot; This book will show why that phrase appears on some companies as a glossy add-on, and why on others it stands for delivering to the customer."},{"Title":"Digital Darwinism","review":"With a title like Digital Darwinism: etc. etc. one is set with the expectation that this book is a kind of silver bullet. But the question is for whom? Throughout the book I had a constant feeling of a big so what? Who is the audience here? Certainly not me and I am not a player in the web economy. Yet. I certainly neither absorbed nor abstracted anything more that I have from the examples that proliferate through reading profiles in quality business journals or talking to business colleagues. Perhaps maybe an artsie-but non-techno-literate-I-wanna-know person would find it appealing?Aside from this, the book is written in a style that is supposed to engage through permitting the reader to abstract it's key messages from storylines. I felt that it uses a set the scene, stream of consciouness, I am going to tell you a story style that makes Europeans sometimes nauseous and feeling &quot;just get to the point please, the book is small enough!&quot;.Go for a book that's not hyped-up from the start and delivers a simple structure for your mind to frame concepts, remember points for further reference and doesn't state the obvious."},{"Title":"Digital Darwinism","review":"If you follow the web and the industry closely, this book is NOT for you. Does a good job of reporting on existing industry players (as of 1999) but presents few original ideas, and in 2000, looks a bit dated (perhaps another testimonial of how fast this industry is moving?) If you have NOT been following the developments and strategies on the web, this might provide a good primer, but clearly should be a beginnning of your research, not the end."},{"Title":"Digital Darwinism","review":"I picked up Digital Darwnism from a library to get an understanding of what the e-strategies are and how some internet businesses successfully implemented them. This was one of the books recommended by my professor at MBA school to read as part of an eCommerce class.This is really a great book on e-strategies whether one is a novice with respect to internet businesses or an avid entrepreneur who's waiting to strike it big. The seven strategies - solution branding, dynamic pricing, affiliate marketing, value bundling, selling custom-made products online first before manufacturing them, cybermediation and integration of digital eCommerce with absolutely everything- that Schwartz presented are very interesting and truly practical.He has a narrative approach throughout the book. He compares and contrasts many companies, for e.g., AOL, Priceline, Yahoo, eBay etc who have or have not implemented the seven strategies and expands upon the success stories. It's like reading a story book. He also presents opinions of some of the highly successful entrepreneurs like Tim Koogle, Mark Andressen, Jim Barksdale etc which can give a good insight to the reader on the past, present and the future state of eCommerce.The main drawback that I found in the book is it's a little outdated when it comes to the implementation details of some of the companies. This is because the book was written couple of years back and there have been humungus changes in the internet infrastructure, software, hardware and a variety of paraphernalia which may prove costly factors if one wants to follow what has been presented in the book. It can be a good reference book for early stage internet business strategies. I haven't read too many books of such kind but I do like reading stuff off the internet as it's more up to date and current compared to Digital Darwinism.The concepts in the book can give a head start to any new internet business. But ultimately what matters for the business to be successful is great business model, state of the art implementation and highly regarded customer service"},{"Title":"Digital Darwinism","review":"Excellent.

The objective is really not survival; rather, to achieve and then sustain a position of dominance or at least primacy. In business, obviously, there is an on-going process of \\"natural selection\\" which determines which companies are sufficiently fit and which are not. Schwartz is dead-on when suggesting that it is a \\"logical\\" process: \\"Fear naturally gave way to experimentation....Successful experimentation soon led to confidence....Confidence inspired trust....Trust led to faith...Faith led to mass acceptance.\\"Schwartz devotes a separate chapter to each of the seven \\"breakthrough strategies\\":Build a Brand that Stands for Solving ProblemsAllow Your Prices to Fluctuate Freely with Supply and DemandLet Affiliate Partners Do Your Marketing for YouCreate Valuable Bundles of Information and ServicesSell Custom-Made Products Online, Then [italics] Manufacture ThemAdd New Value to Transactions Between Buyers and SellersIntegrate Digital Commerce with Absolutely EverythingObviously, with all due respect to Schwartz's excellent insights and suggestions, it remains for you to determine (1) which of these (and other) strategies are most relevant to the specific needs of your own organization, and (2), the nature and extent of resources which can be allocated to their implementation. Also, obviously, as needs change (and they will), the combination of strategies must be modified to accommodate them. One final point: Whatever the initiatives may be, it is imperative to have \\"buy in\\" throughout your organization by everyone involved, from top to bottom. Otherwise, your organization will be eliminated by a \\"natural selection\\" process measured in years and even weeks, not centuries or even years."},{"Title":"Digital Darwinism","review":"Schwartz has clearly written an enticing and incredibly insightful piece which is a must read for anyone and everyone looking at the future of e-commerce.

In Digital Darwinism, we are presented with &quot;7 breakthrough business strategies for surviving in the cutthroat web economy.&quot; They are:1. Build a grand that stands for solving problems 2. Allow your prices to fluctuate freely with supply and demand. 3. Let affiliate partners do your marketing for you. 4. Create valuable bundles of information and services. 5. Sell custom-made products online, then manufacture them. 6. Add new value to transactions between buyers and sellers. 7. Integrate digital commerce with absolutely everything.From a technical point of view, I found little new in these strategies, but perhaps that is because I work in a technology field. For those who are trying to bring a &quot;old economy&quot; business into the &quot;new economy,&quot; this book will be a valuable source of ideas for the inevitable culture shock.The writing style is clean and concise, and the ideas are clearly presented, illustrated with examples, and brought to us in a believable story form. Even the typeface and page layout make this book easy to read. At the end of each chapter appears a short summary of the key points which can easily serve as a quick refresher when thinking through the implementation of new strategies.In the end, one must remember that the very lessons of the author will also render his book short lived.

Schwartz examines competition in the world of Web commerce, today's most rapidly changing business environment. He compares this competitive struggle to the battle between species that occurs in the natural environment. He concludes that the companies that succeed must be better to survive, much like the survival of the fittest in nature. Whatever market niche they select, they have to be \\"smarter, faster, more innovative, and more adaptable\\" than ever, so that they do better than their competitors. After examining the successes and failures of many different e-commerce competitors, the author identifies seven key strategies to survive and thrive on the Web. Digital Darwinism uses detailed case studies and examples to show how different companies have employed the stated principles successfully. Each chapter concludes with a brief summary of the major points to apply, based on these examples of success. It is a kind of example of \\"digital Darwinism\\" itself, in that the author applies the value-added principles he advocates to create an easy-to-read book.

Schwartz shows how these hard-earned systems don't necessarily apply to the new online markets. He shows how the internet has evolved with attention to what hasn't worked and what has. He differentiates the business plan of a conventional corporation with that of an online presence and shows how the two could work together synergistically.

Marketing, branding, value added product and services components are described as they specifically relate to the web. It describes and explains through proven or failed examples specific take-aways for the web.

His work is worth the time to read and the addition to a technology / web / Internet library is worthwhile."},{"Title":"Digital Darwinism","review":"I have noticed two broad manners in which books about e-business are generally written. One is very academic - they are actually written by academics, the other is very casual - usually this is the case of books written by journalists, or business consultants. Both styles have their virtues. However, the academic style is sometimes too theoretical, with too much webonomics and too little business strategy. On the other hand, the casual style is sometimes too obvious - the proposed strategies are common sense, making it the kind of book that you can easily read while on the beach, or while riding the bus. Mr. Schwartz's merit is that he successfully combines the two approaches - theoretical and strategic. He talks about branding, dynamic pricing and value bundling (quoting a study by Erik Brynjolfsson, a distinguished MIT professor), but he also tells us how some of the most successful Web companies have actually made it. &quot;Digital Darwinism&quot; is therefore authoritative, and at the same time entertaining. I also think that such an endeavour justifies a second edition of the book, in which I would expect Mr. Schwartz to expand on the concepts that he has introduced, and add more success stories (since he has written an article about the Web initiatives that have proven to be the biggest blunders in e-commerce, he could tell us more about failure, as well)."},{"Title":"Digital Darwinism","review":"I have a long list of books I would read before even considering Digital Darwinism.

She describes in wonderful detail the incredible joys and the terrible losses that she experienced during the early years of the DeWildt Cheetah Research Centre.As a partial accounting of her work, Ann talks about the 'discovery' of the king cheetah, the breeding requirements of cheetahs in captivity, and the heavy toll that people extract from cheetahs, both in the wild and in captivity.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in cheetahs. The story is true, but this is no dry documentary. This story will make you feel.&lt;P"},{"Title":"Breeds of Cattle, Old & Rare","review":"This book was a HUGE disappointment.

An auto accident midway through the season changes everything, although not right away. Of the latter four Tunis book in the Brooklyn series, this one is perhaps the best. The opening description of Braves Field in Boston is exceptional, right down to the smoke rising above the Charles River beyond the outfield fence. The reader gets to watch Highpockets grow up chapter by chapter, although he has a tougher time of it than Roy Tucker did in the first two books in the series. A good story, and a good read. Tunis mainstains an amazing consistency throughout his Dodgers series, from the clack-clack-clackety-clack of the players' spikes to the dialogue between the players. Expect nothing less here."},{"Title":"Highpockets","review":"This is a story of a selfish man altered by his love for an injured boy. Cecil (Highpockets) McCade is a rookie outfielder for the Brooklyn Dodgers whose primary thoughts are his batting average and other on-field accomplishments. He is not a bad person, he is a farm boy from North Carolina who wants to pay off the mortgage and help his younger siblings get an education. However, his constant thoughts only of himself turn off his teammates, coaches, fans and the sports writers.However, while he is in a frustrated, self-absorbed mood, a boy runs into the side of his car. The boy is severely injured and although Highpockets was not responsible, he befriends the boy and helps him with his stamp collection. They become friends and this changes Highpockets into a team player. At the end, there is the predictable big game for the pennant where Highpockets makes the play that wins the game.This book also features most of the same people that appear in the other Tunis books involving his mythical Brooklyn Dodgers. Spike and Bob Russell, Chiselbeak the clubhouse man, Roy Tucker, Razzle Nugent and Fat Stuff Foster are some of the characters that appear. Like the other Tunis books, this is a sports story filled with a deep lesson for life. No man is an island and the accolades of your teammates should matter more than personal achievement. I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"Highpockets","review":"Highpockets was a amazing story.

I saw the book was available for Kindle and read it again after almost 50 years! I enjoyed it as much as I did all those years ago!It's a good story, well written, and teaches \\"lessons\\" that never go out of style... tell the truth, think of others before yourself, don't be selfish, etc.Back when I was a kid, I never knew that Tunis' books were about a fictional Brooklyn Dodgers team. The Dodgers were already in LA for 9 years when I read the book for the first time and I had never really heard of the Brooklyn Dodgers. This book started a life long interest in baseball fiction and non-fiction. I discovered that there were other books by Tunis that followed the story of other mythical Dodger players and I will probably read them. Starting with \\"The Kid from Tompkinsville!\\""},{"Title":"Highpockets","review":"Highpockets is a baseball novel by John R. Tunis, and one of a series of books about the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1940s and 50s, which some people call \\"The Golden Age of Baseball.\\" The protagonist is Cecil McDade, a rookie outfielder/slugger from North Carolina who's in it just for the money and the personal glory. He even hates Brooklyn! Predictably, he learns his lesson. Not much different than a million sports books for kids? Sure, but Tunis raises the story out of the ordinary with a more realistic take on the life of ballplayers, as well as details that mark him as someone who knows the game inside and out. What results is almost a fable, simple, yet profound.Baseball is about character: it couldn't be about anything else and last so long, and Tunis skillfully weaves together the fate of the team with the development of \\"Highpockets\\" McDade as a man and a player. One scene, in which the now unselfish Highpockets decides to play in a crucial game in spite of the risk of permanent injury, steals the show, as the fans rise as one to let him know what they think of him.Uncharacteristically of the genre, Tunis' books often address social issues - racism, prejudice, alcoholism, and readjustment to civilian life after fighting in a war. His books are idealistic, but not preachy; edifying but not at the cost of a good story. Tunis said he based this book on some aspects of the career of the great Ted Williams, but Highpockets can stand by itself as one of the very best juvenile baseball books ever. It's too bad that Tunis is relatively unknown these days. He is a real example of what excellence in juvenile literature reads like."},{"Title":"Self-Defense for Girls: A Secondary School and College Manual","review":"I would advise all parents to get the book Self Defense for Girls, I also have one of the same book for boys too.

Then he's accused of a crime he didn't commit. With circumstantial evidence against him and no money to hire a decent lawyer, John may be looking at a short drop and a sudden stop.With one word Evelyn Langham could prove John's innocence, but that would be revealing that she had been spending time with a man NOT her husband.Gambler Andy Gilmore knows more about the case than he's telling the authorities, but he sees this as an opportunity to blackmail his way into polite society.Lawyer Marshall Langham used to be John's friend, but when he learns about John and Evelyn's secret, he manipulates the situation to exact revenge.Drunkard Joe Montgomery owes a lot to his cousin, Andy Gilmore. With what he knows about the murder, Montgomery thinks this is the way to pay Gilmore back, by lying on the witness stand. But will enough whisky loosen Joe's tongue at the wrong place and time?Judge Langham knows that North is innocent, but when the crime hits too close to his own home, the judge betrays the very law he's sworn to uphold.This is a very good book. I read it in two days. More people need to know about this book. It's a real page-turner that will keep your interest all the way through. (Fans of CSI will cringe in horror, though, as multitudes off the street trample around the crime scene and get their fingerprints all over the murder weapon. Ah, the days before forensic evidence.) Seriously, though, read the book."},{"Title":"The just and the unjust,","review":"In 1912, the number seven book on the bestseller's list was Vaughan Kester's The Just and the Unjust. Since few have heard of either the book or author nowadays, it is an indication of the fleeting nature of popularity. Will people in 2112 be wondering who John Grisham or James Patterson were?In fact, all the top ten authors of 1912 are practically unknown nowadays, which led me on a minor quest to read these books and get a feel for what was popular a century ago. Of course, popularity does not equal quality. The Just and the Unjust was the third of these bestsellers I read, and easily the best of the three.The story is centered on John North, a young man who has gambled away his inherited money and has decided to leave his small town of Mount Hope, Ohio to seek his fortune and be able to marry the woman he loves (and who loves him). Meanwhile, his friend, the drunken lawyer, Marshall Langham is facing ruin at the hands of the shady gambler, Andy Gilmore. To get out of debt, Langham will kill and rob the town's wealthiest man.Circumstances and acts of deceit will leave North accused of the crime. Gilmore knows better, but he doesn't like North and likes controlling Langham. Soon, North will face a trial and hanging if found guilty. His alibi involves Langham's wife, but North doesn't want to potentially dishonor her, so he relies on his faith that an innocent man would never be convicted. Gilmore, however, will do whatever's necessary to make sure the frame sticks.Like many works of this period, the narrative and dialogue are sometimes a little over-the-top, but overall, this book has strong writing. This is a story of good and evil (or, to use the title, just and unjust), but there are shades of gray that are not always found in books of this time. Even Langham is not wholly bad; in fact, the true villain is actually Gilmore. And the supposed good guys have flaws of their own that make them more solid characters.Kester lived a relatively short life, dying when he was just forty-one in 1911. Sadly, this was right when his career was really taking off: both this book and the 1911 book The Prodigal Judge were bestsellers. Is this book a classic worthy of the immortality that description should bestow? No, but this is a good crime novel with a nice level of suspense."},{"Title":"Mobile Suit Gundam Wing Comic #1 (Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, 1)","review":"For Gundam Wing fans, this comic is like a larger version of the first Gundam Wing manga.

Jay, the story's narrator, has decided to leave his partner of 10 years,Susan, with whom he has two sons. The story begins on the night before Jay's planned departure. Flashbacks recount the relationship's slow crumble and how Jay made the decision to leave. Jay has concluded that he and Susan don't make each other happy anymore. They are a somewhat privileged pair. She works at a successful publishing firm. He's a screenwriter once nominated for an Academy Award. (Kureishi himself was nominated for his screenplay for &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette.&quot;) The kids are wonderful, as are the couple's friends. They have a great house in a cool section of London. A stash of good drugs awaits them in the fridge. But the two have their share of problems, including infidelity. Jay is smitten with young Nina, who represents the love and passion that has drained from his relationship. &quot;Intimacy&quot; is neither an angry rant nor a pursuit of forgiveness. It is the story of a modern, middle-aged man who no longer loves the person he's shared his life with. The book is brief - only 120 pages - and both brutally honest and gentle. It almost feels like a conversation with a good friend who's trying to explain why he's changing his life. Fortunately, Kureishi can be a humorous writer, as seen in his novel &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia.&quot; &quot;Intimacy&quot; is a sad story with lighter moments. In one scene, Jay facilitates an act of self-satisfaction with anti-wrinkle cream."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"Expect to be shocked and moved because nothing is more disturbing than the truth.INTIMACY is the account of one man's thoughts the night before he leaves his partner and the mother of his children.

And you will sympathize.Hanif Kureishi is a brilliant writer.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"I spend a lot of time searching out books just like this one; short, vibrant, challenging and with beautiful language. Intimacy is a compelling book that is startling in its bold use of language and the stark honesty of the main character, a man on the brink of leaving his wife and two kids in pursuit of sex with a woman he had an affair with, who may, or may not, take him back.As other reviewers have mentioned, the narrator, Jay, is completely unlikeable. Despite being middle-aged he acts like a selfish and self-pitying child. Jay complains and whines about everything and has led a life of self-indulgent excesses. He disliked his children when they were younger and admits to having pushed one roughly when it was a baby so that it hit his head. He also keeps drugs in the fridge and has had endless affairs while married. His wife, Susan, is also quite unlikeable, as are the majority of his friends. What redeems the book is its short, snappy style. I would not have wanted to read a thick, deeply involving book about these characters, but a short novel was just right.I thought the book was a perfect portrayal of the particular type of modern person that believes in nothing, and therefore has nothing to believe in! Without belief in anything such as lasting love, himself, God or something other than pleasure and sex, Jay is on the pathway of destruction. Jay is actually a coward, as instead of telling his wife face to face that he is going to leave her and their children, he sneaks out of the house while she is at work and leaves a note on the table explaining all. In contrast to some of the other reviews, I do not think that this is a book that sums up the whole of the male species. Jay is a disturbed guy - hence the cocaine and the ecstasy and the mindless f*cking and goodness knows what else! There is more to life than that.Read this book if you like short, thought-provoking fiction that dwells on the seedier aspects of the male psyche. Skip this one if you want to read about likeable characters.JoAnne"},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"Hanif Kureishi's Intimacy is a book I have been waiting for in years to help me speak the indecipherable feelings inside my heart. This novella contains a very simple plot - a man who has decided to leave his wife in the next morning because he does not love her anymore. Just because he does not love her anymore? There are times for each of us, as a lover and reader, to break up with someone for some reasons, or no reasons. But the feelings cannot be simply described. Despite this, we can all find it all inside the book. Intimacy is about the internal thinking of the departing husband. It is a page turner with brilliantly-written lines. How many of us need to &quot;defer the deferral&quot; to break up? When we are dumped, we decide to remain in solitude - &quot;if one can live with loneliness, we don't need friends anymore&quot;. Intimacy is a must-read for those who are (going to be) out of love."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"This slim volume is likely one of the best books I've ever read, on par with Philip Roth's \\"The Dying Animal,\\" Camus' \\"The Stranger,\\" and reflective and insightful not unlike some of Paul Auster's work, most notably his early essay, \\"The Invention of Solitude.\\" Kureishi was attacked by outraged feminists at the time of it's original publication, but it's as honest an account of masculinity as I have ever read. Even my wife -- normally a fan of genre fiction -- read \\"Intimacy\\" and loved it. Throughout most of Kureishi's writing, there is a blue melancholy and a wry, self-deprecating wit. There is much of that here, but there is also anger. .....If you saw the film \\"Intimacy,\\" which was based on this book, just know the two are very different. The film actually took from a several of his short stories....Lastly, if you're a Kureishi fan and are travelling to Europe any time soon, check out the bookstores there.

The gap between promise and fulfillment has never been so large in my reading experience. The central character, who unfortunately is also the narrarator, is a whining, mawkish, hyper-sensitive narcissist who should have reflected and learned from his wife's criticisms, instead of ruminating about leaving her.

And the reason im giving this 0 stars for concept is NOT cause i got scared or because i got upset of the REALITY of this book.I thought the book was VERY well written and the character was very nicely drown out and very real and as i was reading this book i was SURE that most men would identify themselves with it.The thing that irritated me the most is that the writter was trying to make me feel bad about this 'struggle' of a man that isnt sattisfied anymore with HIS decision to get married to a woman he NOW realises he's maybe never been inlove with at the first place! And decides to leave 'like a COMPLETE coward' without telling his wife or kids (which is the LEAST he can possibly do, if he's going to leave he should leave like a man, have some BA**S and face the music). This is a man who cant face the concequences of his action (to get married AND have kids and decides to leave them all) and then, cant face the conceqences of his action to leave (and leaves without telling anyone).What? Dont women ever find themselves in this situation? Especually women who most men say are never sattisfied with sex alone (while this guy at some point catches himself thinking that if she has sex with him at that specific time, he wont leave). If a woman was in this situation would that be worth writting a book about? Probably not because a woman would probably take the kids with her and not ababdon them as well.I liked reading this book but after it was over i just felt i just waisted my time reading about the most selfish and egocentric 'little' man who wants everything and cares about nobody but himself. His 'struggle' to leave? Boo- hoo! He does what he wants at the end right? Whether he's happy or not it was his decision to get married and his decision to leave, so he always does what he wants. At least he gets to leave with the concequences his OWN decisions.

Kureishi is not just being very sincere but also dealing with side of somehow tabu question about leaving family and two children in order being with another person. Story of his courage taking a decision which will not deterine just his and his spouses life, but as well will much determine his children is a sublime emotional voyage on this last night. Kureishi is sending us a message that taking one side is not just leaving the other behind. As story is sometimes really painfull to stick to it, so is the described siutation. This book is recommendet to those people who are stock in their lives with partners, not admiting there can be life 'afterwards', that they would live that kind o a life, beacuse it's hard to admit that they made a wrong decission in past life. Having children is making it worse, and leaving someone with this 'burden' is almost impossible. But, as Kureishi pointed it out, leaving in a milieu of constant fighting is no good for anyone, specially not for chidlren."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"Intimacy is the first book I have read three times and I still find new and interesting thoughts. For a newly-married, young female reading it for the first time, it was horrifyingly truthful. But on repeated readings, I am grateful to Mr. Kureishi for putting such direct and simple words to otherwise complex feelings."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"Hardly qualifying for a novel at a mere 118 pages-- although it still may be too long-- INTIMACY is the account of the end of a relationship as seen through the eyes of Jay, who is about to leave his lover Susan of six years-- they are not married-- and their two sons. \\"It is the saddest night, for I am leaving and not coming back.\\" So begins Jay's ruminations of what has gone wrong and why he is leaving. There is precious little to like about him. Well educated and a successful writer-- he has been nominated for an Oscar although he never tells the reader exactly what he did to get the recognition-- he likes recreational drugs from time to time, currently has another lover Nina, who in his eyes, has provided assurance that he would stay as long with Susan as he has. She is not as pretty as she was when they first got together. If he should see her in a bar now, he opines that he would look at her two times but not three. He's a real prince of a fellow. As he is packing a few things to leave, he makes sure he has a signed framed picture of John Lennon before he gets photographs of his children. And he does not have the courage to confront his lover but rather leaves her a note after she has gone off to work. He does attempt, however, to be honest about himself, saying that \\"Perhaps, all this time she [Susan] has been making a heroic effort to get along with a morose, over-sensitive, self-absorbed fool.\\" And he obviously loves his sons dearly, hoping that as he changes the three-year-old's \\"nappy,\\" that his son in the future will return the favor. Jay is well aware that his deceased father would not approve of his leaving Susan and their children. Kureishi contrasts Jay with his friend Asif, who exhorts him to be responsible and says in tender, beautiful language: \\"'I can just about see why someone would leave their spouse, but I can't understand how someone could leave their children. To me just going to work feels like SOPHIE's CHOICE.'\\"When I finished this book-- that you will want to read in one sitting-- I wondered where this character will be in ten years, perhaps like the character in Kureishi's compellintg short story \\"Nightlight,\\" who after escaping from his wife and children in much the same way as Jay does, sees a woman every Wednesday for sex but does not know her name. On the other hand, he may be closer to the character of Jamal-- we can hope-- in Kureishi's latest novel SOMETHING TO TELL YOU who still believes in and keeps looking for love. I suspected that many men will see themselves, at least in part, in Jay's character-- in the U. S. approximately one in three marriages ends in divorce I believe-- and finally was glad that my father never left my mother, my brother and me.You may not like this character but you will certainly be much taken with Kureishi's honest depiction of him as well as the author's fine prose."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"When Hanif Kureishi's Intimacy was published last year in Britain, it ignited a firestorm in both Kureishi's family and in the press, with one of its many critics denouncing it as \\"this short, odious book.\\" And it's true that Intimacy's narrator, Jay (a scriptwriter) is wilful, childish, narcissistic and wild. And, yes, odious too; he even does the occasional parent-teacher interview in his \\"latest favourite suit, on acid\\" and keeps--even though he's the father of very young children--ecstasy, LSD, and an old bottle of amyl nitrate in the fridge. But he's also a man who is tender, introspective, witty, and exuberantly honest. Herein lies the book's reckless charm and elating momentum.Intimacy also joins a long line of 20th-century novels that tell the story of men leaving home, beginning with the husband in John Updike's Too Far to Go, a man who--before leaving his wife and children--repairs hinges and latches: \\"a Houdini making things snug before his escape...\\" In novels by Richard Stern and Bernard Malamud and any number of other writers on the theme of men who are also ambivalently on the run, the women being left behind are (like the wives in Updike's fiction) dark-haired, enduring, and sexually withholding, while the mistresses are fair-haired, adoring, and quick to offer sexual comfort. The blondes also travel with a vast array of cosmetic and herbal supplies; in the case of Jay's Nina--a shrewdly wistful phantom forever kept off-stage in her pale, hippie clothes--it's a bag stocked with nipple cream, tapes of the sound of the sea, postcards of cats, packets of camomile tea, and other bits of the equipment so vital to \\"mobile girls.\\"\\"Soon we will be like strangers,\\" Jay tells us, speaking of Susan, the mother of his children. But no, they can never be that. \\"Hurting someone is an act of reluctant intimacy. We will be dangerous acquaintances with a history.\\" Jay also fears dying--he's invited to more funerals than dinner parties--and so has little use for women who are also too quickly growing older, as he jauntily makes clear when he ironically asks what's wrong with maturity. \\"Think of the conversations I could have--about literature and bitterness--with a forty-year-old!\\"Susan belongs in this age range, but in spite of his making her his muse by turning her (via metaphor) into a blank page--she's at the bottom of the stairs in her white T-shirt and white slippers, looking \\"so white I could write on her\\"--his evocations of her can also convey his love for her, as in the following scene when he's moved by her enthusiasm as she kisses their children: \\"When we really talk, it is about them, something they have said or done, as if they are a passion no one else can share or understand.\\"During his last night with his family, Jay experiences the outside world as both ominous and alluring. But mostly ominous: \\"Outside, the dark leaves on the trees flap in the wind like hundreds of long green tongues, the branches knocking at me.\\" He dreads leaving his sons, two \\"fierce and ebullient\\" little boys who are never named--this is one of Kureishi's brilliant strokes--two wild boys who careen through the novel, adding to both its anguish and its comedy. Jay says of the three-year-old, \\"I wonder when I will sleep beside him again, if ever. He has a vicious kick and a tendency, at unexpected moments, to vomit in my hair. But he can pat and stroke my face like a lover. His affectionate words and little voice are God's breath to me.\\" This has a parent's narcissism in it, true, but it's also incredibly tender. And yet in the skilfully abridged version of Intimacy that appeared last summer in The New Yorker, a few lines down from this adoring tribute Jay is on the threshold of his front door, the fresh wind sweeping through him as one of the more compelling of his inner voices commands, \\"Go. You must go.\\"This is where the novel should have ended, on page 92. It would have been a novella then, but it would have been the right thing to keep it emotionally and lyrically dynamic. Instead it goes on for another twenty-six pages, and the line that follows the powerful \\"Go. You must go,\\" is almost criminally banal: \\"I am kicking over the traces.\\" Along with a few other lacklustre passages, this is one of the relatively few disappointments in what is otherwise a vivid and fearless novel. The good bits in the final pages could also have been spliced in earlier. At times it's also as if the war between Jay's id and his superego has triggered a war in the syntax, which is sometimes formal and Victorian, sometimes the Kiplingesque English of Jay's father, sometimes London street slang.But whatever its deficiencies, Intimacy is an important and weirdly thrilling book, reminding us (as we occasionally do need reminding) how honourable that other war is: the war between what's most \\"worthy\\" and what's most alive.*******************************************************************This review first appeared in The Globe and Mail"},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"Not exactly the happiest book I've ever read but certainly one of the best examples of dealing with separation. The chronicle of the slow demise of Jay's love for his lover cuts deeply into the heart strings because anyone who has been in a long term relationship can recognise and understand exactly what he is thinking. Torn between the nedd to find personal fulfillment or duty he opts for the personal fulfillment whilst many of us though wanting that, spend our lives on the duty side because we cannot bear the emotional strength it would take to leave He loves his sons dearly and is a good father but cannot stay because he can no longer bear to be shackled to a relationship with his partner in which he feels there is no longer even tolerance let alone love. It is a situation which he feels is robbing him of his very self and he opts to leave without a warning. The slow realisation that he maybe never loved her and never felt passion for her has left him exhausted and with an unbearable guilt and sadness that so much time has been wasted. Despite this he still manages to throw a selfish streak into it by admitting his passion for other women etc which does at least make you see him as not completely without fault. All in all it is an overwhelming book which pulls on your very emotional core just because it is so bitingly real. A must read for anyone who has gone through a break up without really understanding the reason why their partner left."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"I could not put the book down. When I finished it I started lending it to my friends,especially female ones, thinking that it would help all of us to understand male psychology-well, at least some of it. Honesty and self-respect: us women have to learn from Jay."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"This book is a wonderful exploration of the male mind, as that mind weighs the pros and cons of staying with one woman. The book is well-written, with ocassional lapses into triteness, but overall, a very good read. Ladies, don't do what I did and hope to find &quot;answers&quot; here -- the book is really just a trip through the miasma of indecision and conflict that plague every man (hell, every person!)."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"I was blown away by the pinpoint accuracy of this succinctly written novel. Hanif Kureishi manages to lace each page with necessary truths that will resonate with anyone who has been in a long time marriage or live-in relationship.He writes: &quot;I know love is dark work; you have to get your hands dirty. If you hold back, nothing interesting happens. At the same time, you have to find the right distance between two people. Too close, and they overwhenlm you; too far and they abandon you. How to hold them in the right relation?&quot;Sometimes marriages don't make space for both partners to live. When expectations give way to reality the intimacy erodes. And so it goes.&quot;An unhappy relationship can't be a sealed compartment. It seeps into everything else, like a punctured oil can.&quot;Too often, the demise of a relationship is seen solely from the woman's point of view. Kureishi's examination is riveting and instructional. There are signs: &quot;Once it is over, there is no comfort in the present;&quot; and there are solutions: &quot;What is it I require? A kind indifference and some interesting underwear&quot;.Having shared this book with several married couples, I wonder if marriage is one of the illusions in which we have invested far too much belief in : &quot;How disturbing it is that our illusions are often our most important beliefs.&quot;A must read, a re-read!"},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"The honesty and clear-eyed sensitivity of this book and of its narrator make it impossible to categorize it (or him) in a simple, judgemental fashion. Kureishi gives voice, tersely and unapologetically, to emotions, hopes and desires that anyone, male or female, has experienced when thinking about intimacy. The protagonist certainly seems to be representative of his time, negotiating all the beliefs and expectations of how to live life and find love in the 1990s, and yet the novel has a timeless feel to it; the narrator's struggles are similar to those of Newland Archer in Wharton's Age of Innocence. The only fault of this novel is that it occasionally slips into '90s platitudes, and the protagonist fits too exactly into the mould of New Labour."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"Once again I was amazed with Kureishi's writing - in this case the breakup of a significant relationship. His examination of the relationship at its end spares no consequence. Really, a fantastic breakdown of a breakup. I too question the autobiographical aspect of the book."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"I can still so clearly remember the afternoon I first read the Hanif Kureishi story that became INTIMACY---in the New Yorker in 1997 or 1998---and how I was so elated by it that I phoned an editor friend in another city who, like me, was a single mother whose children were officially grown up (but still trying to grow up) just as we were two women who were officially grown up (but still trying to grow up) and although we both belonged to a category of readers who should despise this book (women who've sometimes had a rough time in their relationships with sexually charismatic men) we just couldn't stop talking about it and singing its praises. But we didn't have to want a man like this in our lives (not any more, we didn't) to value that kind of man's incarnation as a character in an extraordinary novel.It's true that when INTIMACY was first published in Britain, it ignited a firestorm in both Kureishi's family and in the press, with one of its many critics denouncing it as \\"this short, odious book.\\" And it's also true that INTIMACY'S narrator, Jay (a scriptwriter) is wilful, childish, narcissistic and wild. And, yes, odious too; he even does the occasional parent-teacher interview in his \\"latest favourite suit, on acid\\" and even though he's the father of very young children he keeps Ecstasy, LSD, and an old bottle of amyl nitrate in the fridge. But he's also a man who is tender, introspective, witty, and exuberantly honest. Herein lies the book's reckless charm and elating momentum.INTIMACY also joins a long line of 20th-century novels that tell the story of men leaving home, beginning with the husband in John Updike's Too Far to Go, a man who, before leaving his wife and children, repairs hinges and latches: \\"a Houdini making things snug before his escape...\\"In novels by Richard Stern and Bernard Malamud and any number of other male writers on the theme of men who are also ambivalently on the run, the women being left behind are dark-haired, enduring, and sexually withholding, while the mistresses are fair-haired, adoring, and quick to offer sexual comfort. These blondes travel with a vast array of cosmetic and herbal supplies; in the case of Jay's mistress Nina--a shrewdly wistful phantom forever kept off-stage in her pale, hippie clothes--it's a bag stocked with nipple cream, tapes of the sound of the sea, postcards of cats, packets of camomile tea, and other bits of the equipment so vital to \\"mobile girls.\\"\\"Soon we will be like strangers,\\" Jay tells us, speaking of Susan, the mother of his children. But no, they can never be that. \\"Hurting someone is an act of reluctant intimacy. We will be dangerous acquaintances with a history.\\" Jay also fears dying--he's invited to more funerals than dinner parties--and so has little use for women who are also too quickly growing older, as he makes clear when he ironically asks what's wrong with maturity. \\"Think of the conversations I could have--about literature and bitterness--with a forty-year-old!\\"Susan belongs in this age range, but in spite of his making her his muse by turning her (via metaphor) into a blank page--she's at the bottom of the stairs in her white T-shirt and white slippers, looking \\"so white I could write on her\\"--his evocations of her can also convey his love for her, as in the following scene when he's moved by her enthusiasm as she kisses their children: \\"When we really talk, it is about them, something they have said or done, as if they are a passion no one else can share or understand.\\"During his last night with his family, Jay experiences the outside world as both ominous and alluring. But mostly ominous: \\"Outside, the dark leaves on the trees flap in the wind like hundreds of long green tongues, the branches knocking at me.\\" He dreads leaving his sons, two \\"fierce and ebullient\\" little boys who are never named--this is one of Kureishi's many brilliant strokes--two wild boys who careen through the novel, adding to both its anguish and its comedy.Jay says of the three-year-old, \\"I wonder when I will sleep beside him again, if ever. He has a vicious kick and a tendency, at unexpected moments, to vomit in my hair. But he can pat and stroke my face like a lover. His affectionate words and little voice are God's breath to me.\\" This has a parent's narcissism in it, true, but it's also incredibly tender. And yet in the incredibly skilfully abridged version of INTIMACY that appeared in The New Yorker, a few lines down from this adoring tribute Jay is on the threshold of his front door, the fresh wind sweeping through him as one of the more compelling of his inner voices commands, \\"Go.

What everyone should realize is that human nature forever desires what it cannot have, and no person who lets his/her mind run amok like this will ever truly find &quot;ideal&quot; happiness. A person's life is not made up entirely of long stretches of happiness; in times of boredom and listlessness, one should realize and value what he/she possesses and be content with it. A good marriage is not defined by love alone; there is trust, responsibility and all those other un-exciting descriptions that must be there for two people to co-exist peacefully. We all desire to be loved and understood, but in the end, every man dies alone. Happiness is internal and understanding yourself is the hardest thing of all!"},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"Hanif Kureishi is one of the best playwrites/novelists writing in English today, and &quot;Itimacy&quot; is one of his finest works. It is the kind of novel that you cannot put down, not because the plot is so exciting, but because he offers such insight. Warning: this book is--for some unknown reason--deeply upsetting. You seem to travel so deep into the mind of the narrator, who seems a lot like Kureishi himself, that escape is futile. This book will control your emotions for days after you've finished it."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"Not exactly the happiest book I've ever read but certainly one of the best examples of dealing with separation.

A must read for anyone who has gone through a break up without really understanding the reason why their partner left."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"Kureishi writes with greater openness and depth about the real nature of intimacy than anything I read in 38 years of marriage. His novel describes the midlife crisis of a successful but restless intellectual who lives with the bright and efficient working mother of their two young sons. The enigmatically ending story is dramatically framed as the narrator's reflections, ruminations, and events during the last night before his hypothetical escape from this relationship. With keen sensibility and deeply penetrating awareness, Kureishi illuminates the seemingly meager joys and strangling frustrations of family life. He writes unabashedly about: the erratic sex life of friends and lovers; joint therapist visits; his prostate worries; hope for affection; ageing masturbation response; the sullen domestic atmosphere; love as a precondition of human flourishing; his parents' mutual loyalty; modern free-market Thatcherism of the soul; love and women's bodies as the male center of everything; et cetera. Other than an elaboration of his exact financial condition, nothing is missing. Since this brief 30,000-word account is so fascinatingly true at its core and only slightly exaggerated in its particulars, I highlighted, underlined, annotated, and reread it several times. With often hilarious detail, Kureishi's genius provides in passing more profound insights into the endless struggle for love than any of the PhD-written manuals of theoretical marriage advice."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"\\"Intimacy\\" is rightly valued for its dispassionate presentation of the duplicity and selfishness of men in love. Intimacy is both the goal and destroyer of monogamy, Kureishi seems to being saying, and he certainly pulls no punches when it comes to explaining why. Men always want someone else. Blame nature, blame nurture, blame contemporary social demands incompatible with six hundred millennia of evolutionary development. Whatever the case, we seem to be programmed to break women's hearts and to ruin our own happiness in the process. Kureishi gives an agonizingly candid insight into the machinations of male ego and self-justification. My problem with it is that many happily married men would probably say, \\"Speak for yourself, Hanif.\\" And rightly so. What of the men who live perfectly happy lives devoted to their wives and children? It doesn't mean they aren't attracted to other women, it doesn't mean they don't ever think of straying. It just means they don't go through with it. Are they all repressed? Are they all kidding themselves? Do they secretly hate their wives and resent their children? Or have they learned that the infantile fantasy of endlessly variable sexual experience is precisely that, and therefore not worth pursuing? Kureishi doesn't seem to allow that such men might exist. He tells only half the story on men, and so this tragi-comic articulation of male infidelity comes very close to celebrating it as natural, inevitable and therefore of little consequence. I'm not taking the moral high ground here. I'm just acknowledging what Kureishi refuses to: that some men aren't cheating dogs. My only other quibble is that this novel is too long, even at 120 pages. It wouldn't seem that way if I hadn't previously read an exquisitely edited extract, published as a short story in The New Yorker, which said everything the novel says, but better. It was less totalizing, less cockily assured of its own position - and therefore closer to the truth. (It's still available in \\"The Art Of The Story\\", edited by Daniel Halpern - a collection well worth a look.)"},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"Kureishi calls this &quot;Intimacy, A Novel&quot; but it is really hard to believe that you aren't reading his most personal thoughts. The narrator is a writer, living in London, who has been nominated for an Academy Award. Kureishi too is all this. He tells of his decision to leave his wife and family for a variety of reasons, but which really all end up with his inability to accept the limitations of a permanent relationship and a family. Most of the time you want to grab him by the lapels and tell him to grow up...but part of the time you know exactly what is going through his mind. Kureishi doesn't pull any punches here, and he reveals more than enough warts on his character for us to dismiss him as nothing more than a selfish lout. But few selfish louts have the skill and courage to bare their souls so completely."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"At first impression this story may appear banal and self-centered, however it is really a rich network of ideas interwoven with self-betrayal, passion, exile and abject realism. Kureishi manages to swirl you around with images from your own life so much that you may find it difficult to stop reading this passionate tale of dark inner truths. You will feel for the main protagonist, be able to relate to his insecurities, be shocked by his behaviour and resent him, sometimes all in one go. This is one of my favourite Kureishi books. I would encourage you to read it if you've ever been in love, ever been fed up with your life circumstances, ever not wanted to go to work or ever dreamt of living on a beach and escaping it all."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"&quot;Without love, most of life remains concealed. Nothing is as fascinating as love, unfortunately.&quot;There is a bitter irony in the choice of &quot;intimacy&quot; as the title of this short novel. Intimacy is what love inevitably brings about, and intimacy is what ultimately stifles love for Jay, the narrator of Kureishi's third novel. It has been called a hate letter to the author's former partner and mother of twins, and drew fierce criticism for its self-centered brooding and lack of self-awareness. True, it is not a work which grows from the kind of wisdom that looks for the golden mean. But it is a very entertaining and, despite its serious subject, surprisingly funny book about the one human passion that defies all common sense: romantic love. In Jay's definition, love is nourished by beauty, mystery, pleasure, novelty - in one word: impermanence. Jay defends his idea of the ideal love against the morality of the majority, and it takes a sense of humor and some tolerance on the part of the reader to enjoy his way of thinking. In his very own peculiar way, Jay is in pursuit of happiness. He wants to live life to the fullest, but always remains on the verge of failure because his ideal of love is so elusive."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"For those who have read all of H.Kureishi's work &quot;Intimacy&quot; has almost nothing to do with his previous books.There are 5 characters and no more than 200 pages.And there is also little action. Right from the first page to the very last one ( which is capital to the novel) the narrator shares his life and most of all, his lies. Who does the narrator really love ? What are his real motivations? Hanif Kureishi &quot;hurts&quot; the right chord right till the end where the book takes another color, another story. To writers &quot;Intimacy&quot; is one of the best example available on the craft of writing. To all this book is an experience not to miss."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"I read this book while undergoing my own separation from my husband, so perhaps I am unable to review it dispassionately. The book is powerful, beautifully written yet represents the self-absorbed musing of Jay (a thinly disguised version of the author I hear) on the night he is about to leave his partner of ten years and their two young children. I can only feel pity for Jay. He is callous and cruel, without a shred of morality . He justifies his leaving behind his two young children to pursue what he believes to be 'intimacy and love'. Yet what he defines as intimacy is anything but, for poor, deluded Jay has no idea what true intimacy means. Jay is a liar and a cheat carrying on an affair with another woman, Nina, while living with Susan and their small children. Indeed he even engages in infidelity while Susan is in the hospital,after giving birth to their son. The author juxtaposes Jay's two friends - Victor, a similiarly callous and selfish man who has left his wife and family after pursuading his wife the night before he intended to leave her, to engage in sexual acts she found distasteful, and Asif a contented family man, who loves his wife and family. Asif tells Jay, &quot;All of us yearn for more. We are never satisified. Wisdom is to know the value of what we have&quot;. Too bad Jay cannot hear what Asif is trying to tell him, and follows the hedonistic, self-righteous path of Victor. Men will read this book to justify their similiarly selfish acts of betrayal. Women will read it and remember the pain inflicted upon them by these callous, shallow fellows."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"I loved Kureishi's &quot;Buddha of Suburbia&quot; and enjoyed &quot;the Black Album&quot; but &quot;Intimacy&quot; failed to leave any lasting impression on this reader. Other readers praise the book as offering some great insight into the male psyche, yet, as a male I found it hard to relate to the novel's self-indulgent narrator. I want to state, for the record, that not all men feel they'd drown their wives and children for the sake of great sex. &quot;Intimacy&quot; is however a somewhat compelling book and Kureishi is definitely a wordsmith. Read &quot;Buddha&quot; way before you go for &quot;Intimacy&quot;."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"I read this book three times. Kureishi has a unique voice that I have always appreciated but this is by far his best book in my opinion. Although it's billed as fiction, I've heard it's an account of the breakup of his own marriage. It's Kureishi's honesty about himself that takes my breath away. He's able to pick apart those difficult, inexpressible feelings that drive us to leave people we thought we loved."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"INTIMACY is a very fun book about the agonies of a man who can't quite bring himself to leave, though he's persuaded himself this is exactly what he wants. Not a terribly deep book but a good, light read with brains."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"The trees: The prose is clumsy, careless, tasteless, often ungrammatical. Its diction is inconsistent. Yet the prose has literary pretensions (it oozes pretension): much of its awkwardness is deliberate, perverse, ostentatious--abusive.The forest: In place of a plot we have the protagonist--a dim-witted, shallow, narcissistic fellow--droning on about himself and the deadly dull circumstances of his life. This protagonist prides himself on &quot;the depth of his thought&quot;. Dramatic irony? No such luck."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"Having read 'The Buddha of Suburbia' prior to this, I was a bit disappointed. The plot was a bit scatchy and ridiculous. If one's opinion about the male psychology was based on this book, they would only come to one conclusion about men - arrogant, cocky, shallow, and selfish. I really couldn't get into this book as much as I would have like to.This novel should have been a bit longer as well, in order to establish the plot and the characters more clearly.I hope Kureishi can do a better job next time."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"This book is a masterpiece of self-indulgence and egotistical hope for a perfect love. Kureishi relates Jay's tale of despair with language so transparent and maudlin that reading _Intimacy_ seems almost as painful as ending a relationship. The novel paints a frightening picture of the futility of love, and of Jay's selfish, obsessive disregard for that futility. A must-read for all self-pitying would-be dead-beat dads."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"Le&iacute; en una de las rese&ntilde;as escritras en la p&aacute;gina, que era un poco absurdo el nombre, dado que la intimidad se daba como consecuencia del amor.

La intimidad en este caso es su intimidad, tal cual, intima e intransferible. Es &eacute;l quien durante todo el libro habla sobre su relaci&oacute;n con su mujer, sus hijos, lo desencantado que est&aacute; con todo, con la vida, con el amor...Intimidad es la historia de una pareja (ella una s&uacute;per ejecutiva y &eacute;l un escritor y guionista) que tienen todo lo que las parejas actuales buscan: reconocimiento, fama, dinero etc... pero que llegan a un punto de saturaci&oacute;n y aburrimiento que nada llena. Ni siquiera los hijos. Este libro es la reflexi&oacute;n de un hombre de cuarenta y pocos a&ntilde;os que est&aacute; completamente saturado.

Cada cual sacar&aacute; sus propias conclusiones."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"I found this book to be appalingly shallow and, taken as a whole, rather dull. There is no thought-provoking content introduced here; just the sad, silly ramblings of a typical self-absorbed post-modernist urban male trying to recapture the youthful zeal of a past rememberd but never lived. Not only did I fail to sympathize with the narrator, I did not care what he was saying or why.I did not have a problem with the novel's content - infidelity has been the topic of novels, films and plays too numerous to mention, many of which I've enjoyed. The successful ones broach the subject with a clear eye or fresh voice (or both), and shed light on what is generally overlooked or ignored. INTIMACY does none of those things."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"I have just read the novel \\"Intimacy\\" and the \\"Midnight All Day\\" stories by Kureishi. Kureishi follows the \\"write about what you know\\" addige too literally. Every monotonous story is virtually identical; about a neurotic artist who's either separated, divorced or cheating. The only thing I got from this work is a more clear impression of the strange Kureishi himself.If you like reading depressing stories with no climax that go absolutely nowhere and leave you wondering if you've bent the cover too much to return the book...you'll love Kureishi's work."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"Never having read Kureishi before, I picked up this slim volume on a &quot;new&quot; library shelf and was completely blown away. Its a quick read at only 118 pages but packs an emotional punch on page after page. Pain and despair define Jay's relationship to Susan. His resolution to leave her and their children is examined, disected and re-examined again and again. Anyone who has ever left a long term relationship will feel, and remember, how devastating it can be."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"Hanif Kureishi has managed to pack more honesty, pain, and intimacy into this small, 120 page novel than any author I have read. It's brutally honest as well as heartbreaking, and captures the feelings of many people who are in relationships and struggling to stay together in our modern times. Hanif vividly describes the fears, desires and challenges a man must face when he decides one night to leave his wife and two children, as he feels there is no more passion left in their relationship. Is he making the right decision? How will it effect his wife and children? The fears and challenges the whole family faces, and how it all turns out, is surely an emotional read, and a lesson for anyone going through similar problems in a relationship.This is a great follow-up story from the author who wrote \\"MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE\\" and \\"THE BUDDHA OF SUBURBIA\\", and should not be missed. Although I found myself reading way past the midnight hour, it was worth it. This is a book I will always remember.Joe Hanssen"},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"... two stars for story. Dull and irritating. I felt as if I spent an evening with a self-absorbed, whiny, even a bit cruel, middle-aged adolescent. But Kureishi is a wonderful wordsmith and certainly makes this character real."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"Popular culture would like us to believe that men who feel inclined to leave their families are monsters.This book presents a broader picture. How the motivation of a man is almost entirely the same as a woman that leaves a husband: the search for love, the search for passion, the search for meaning.I really thought I would end up loathing this main character but instead I felt a measure of sympathy and humanity towards him.I will be less judgmental about marriage and divorce after this book.Stylistically this book is beautiful. Not only is short and hard-hitting but its so clean. I think the contradiction between the cleanliness of the writing and the pain that is on display is one of the best things about this novel.Well done Mr Kureishi."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"In this short novel, the author is almost entirely concerned with exploring the distress and doubt that a man can feel upon reaching his final day with his wife and family before he almost certainly will carry out a plan to leave them the next morning, with no warning, just a note - the book's first line: \\"It is the saddest night, for I am leaving and not coming back.\\" The book consists of scattered, very sharp observations on marriage, women, desire, life, etc as the narrator looks back across his life in random fashion, focusing on relationships. The book does not necessarily promote a continual search for a perfect relationship, but it is a critical look at the trade-offs and realities, often unexamined, of marriage.Both the narrator and his wife Susan are smart, capable people - he being a screenwriter and she working in book publishing. Their facility with words hardly extends to their marriage, as it is beset with misunderstandings, pettiness, carping, detachment, and the like. On the surface, they have a comfortable existence, his wife being the epitome of efficiency, even strength; however, despite that \\"at home I don't feel at home ... there is desperation in her activity.\\"Though this move has been contemplated for months, the narrator turns philosophical, reviewing his reasoning, reconfirming his justifications for leaving. For him women represent a chance to \\"start afresh,\\" but a new relationship is not a casual endeavor. To touch another's body, \\"to put your mouth against another's - what a commitment that is!\\" How can one disavow such possibilities? He asks, \\"Is it too much to want a tender and complete intimacy? Is it too much to want to sleep in someone's willing arms?\\"He recognizes the radical, unsettling implications of desire: \\"How unsettling is desire! That devil never sleeps or keeps still.\\" Once desire takes over one's life, where does it end? \\"Surely you can't constantly be replacing people who don't provide what you need\\" Even his latest fling with much-younger, punker Nina, who caused a \\"violent jolt\\" whenever they met, has ended. \\"What makes me think I should have what I want?But can one really ignore fundamental incompatibilities? He knows that \\"Susan and I cannot make one another happy.\\" He doesn't want to openly admit that he actually does not want to love Susan, even reluctantly going to a marital counselor with her to avoid devastating them both. Despite the unhappiness, even on his last night he looks for some sign from Susan that he can remain with her and the boys, a tender gesture, something.This book could be dismissed rather easily. The narrator's obsessions and weaknesses are scarcely worthy of concern. Many marriages survive in similar circumstances, although at what costs? On the other hand, the book may be regarded as a sharp, even painful, look at contemporary marriage, perhaps the human condition, and the dilemmas that it can present."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"Due to this book, Kureishi has become one of my favorite authors. It's short, sweet, and precise."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"I almost felt like this book was a memoir rather than a novel, so fully did the author draw me into the world of the protagonist. Although I know that this recital of marital woe is not the viewpoint of all men, it seems typical of several men I have known who have chosen to end relationships, and it seems to me to be a comment on the question of whether a traditional marriage can square with the appetites and desires created within modern Western society."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"How, what, where, how, how could anyone write something so great! Every second sentence is a bull's-eye-shattering exactitude, every second paragraph unzips the heart, every second page leaves you gasping with disbelief. This mini-novel needs to be read, re-read, outlined, underlined, learnt and then quoted...over and over and over.This has got to be the second most under-rated book after Rohinton Mistry's 'A Fine Balance.' Read it."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"When I bought this book I expected the male view of a relationship on it's death bed with no responsibility taken by the main character at all. Instead, I was treated to a very, honest and accurate account of a dying love affair. As a woman, I recognize the many tell-tale signs that I personally have experienced as well as witnessed in other relationships that have hit rock bottom. Like many people, I feel the main character was not really interested in fixing what was wrong and had just given up long before he decided to leave. What turned me off a little, was the that majority of the book was spent with him sort of dragging his feet about whether or not he was going to leave. It was obvious from the beginning that the union was over as far as he was concerned and that he wanted to be with his new love, Nina.Even though, I respected him for worrying about how all this would effect his sons, I didn't respect the way he just crept away when no one was home. I think he should have at least confronted Susan instead cowardly leaving a note."},{"Title":"Intimacy Pb","review":"My copy has a yellow cover - do americans perceive colours differently? This seems to fit so well into his new london play 'why i sleep with women' and his short story in the last issue of Granta ('London'), that i wonder (again: paul theroux at work here) whether this isnt entirely non-fiction.Great read - Kureishi comes out on top again, and women, if you really want to know what goes through mens minds at the end of a relationship, here is your chance. Men, if you want to know how it will feel, dont say no one told you...."},{"Title":"Gaia","review":"If you're familiar with the Gaia Theory, this book offers little new information; however, if you are just beginning your investigation into this theory of growing popularity, I would highly recommend this work. It is plalinly laid out, and lovingly expounded upon. Lovelock didn't break any records with this literary publication, but he created a lovely springboard work for anyone who is interested in the idea of Earth as a Living Planet."},{"Title":"Gaia","review":"The book is quite good and made me aware of planetary processes that I did not know of such as the sulphur cycle with the role of DMS, and in a clear and beautiful way. However, there are some points that I do not agree with him.The most important point that I do not agree is the part on Oxygen, on which the author said the limit of the oxygen concentration in the atmosphere is set at 21% because of fires. He also said that if the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere is above 25% then \\"combustion is instant and awesome fires would rage, destroying all forests\\". Is there any convincing evidence of this claim? I don't see any mentioned in the book except for a brief statement that \\"An increase of oxygen of more than 1% to 22% (in a submarine), however, cannot be allowed because of the greatly increased risk of fire it would bring\\". Sorry, but I am not convinced of this, especially from the author.Actually, what was said in the book \\"Oxygen -- The molecule that made the world\\" by Nick Lane was quite different. In that book the author claimed that oxygen levels of more than 30% (may be as high as 35%) existed in the Carboniferous period, about 300 million years ago, and he provided detailed arguments and evidence why this might be so. The author also pointed out problems in the \\"experiments\\" done by Lovelock and his students to \\"prove\\" Lovelock's claim that at no point in the history of the Earth was the oxygen level in the atmosphere higher than 25%.I find Nick Lane's arguments much more convincing, and I am sure Lovelock should have been aware of this work. I would really want to see a reaction from Lovelock to Nick Lane's arguments but unfortunately there is none. He just repeated what he said in his earlier books written during the 1970's. I consider this a flaw.Also, on P.133, he said \\"the Sun has increased its heat output by 25% from 3.8 billion years ago\\" while elsewhere he said \\"the Sun was about 25% less luminous than now 3.8 billion years ago\\". I am sure everyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of mathematics knows that these two statements are not the same. The first statement means that the Sun's heat output was 1/1.25 = 80% of present 3.8 billion years ago, while the second statement means that the Sun's heat output was 75% of the present 3.8 billion years ago. Quite a huge difference, I would say. Which is true? Another flaw, albeit a minor one in the context of the book.Overall, the book is good and beautifully illustrated. But I cannot give it 5 stars because I believe that some of the arguements were not based on sound evidence, like the oxygen problem."},{"Title":"Gaia","review":"The book of Gaia is a very interesting theory and if theory holds true the human race may survive afterall."},{"Title":"In the Spotlight (Silver Blades)","review":"Although this is not my favorite silverblades book and Danielle Panati is not my favourite silverblades mamber I have to say this book had its moments.At some points it drifted away from scating.... but on a whole it is a very pleasant read ... i cant wait to read the rest of the series...

By the time I had finished reading it,it was in multiple sections,it does not qualify as a book."},{"Title":"Practical Guide with Readings, 5e","review":"The book is so good that I wonder why anyone bothered to write another book on writing. Stubbs and Barnet are the only writers who practice what they preach in writing: the book is short, to the point, and a joy to read. Why can't the other authors of writing books fathom this simple concept?Leave it to two educators to explain not only the method of good writing but also the reason for it. They have a 4-step method for revising:1. Conciseness -- use fewer words and avoid verbiage,2. Clarity -- use the perfect word for your idea and avoid the vague and misleading wording,3. Coherence -- arrange your ideas in a logical order and avoid the muddle,4. Emphasis -- ensure that the important ideas stand out without resorting to such childish gimmicks as _underlining_, exclamation points!, ALL CAPITALS, and more.These should be standard topics in any freshman composition course. With any luck they will be.The book's only shortcoming is that it covers only covers essays -- expository and persuasive essays to be precise.

What can I say? He was floored. He's never seen such a coplete collection of Rodrigue's work, and the history included in the book for George and his life and work is great.This is a book that you need to have if you are a true fan, and if you're never heard of him, you should get it for the tremendous artwork the book holds."},{"Title":"Art of George Rodrigue Signed","review":"As an owner of an original oil painting (one of my prize possessions) of a blue dog, it is always great to find companion items.

Illustrations are of a good quality, which, in my opinion, is very, very important for an art book. Forward by Michael Lewis is entertaining. The book will serve as a unique reference source and idea spark plug for other artists. It is helpful to see in the book a broad range of Rodrigue's works over the years so we can appreciate the Blue Dog creations but also get a sense for the the Artist's many other contributions in the broader sense of his entire career to date.

The man who led the Dolphins to this pinnacle? Don Shula, who was coach of the year numerous times in his seven year stint as Baltimore Colts' coach. This book is a personal look, as only an autobiography can be, of a coach who only desire was to be the best. Along the way there were hurdles--his mother's adamance against Shula playing football; heartaches--retirement as a player at age 27, the loss to the Jets in Super Bowl III and to the Cowboys in Super Bowl VI, the souring of his relationship with then-Colt owner Carroll Rosenbloom; and the highlights--making Paul Brown's Cleveland Brown squad as a rookie after Cleveland's World Championship season and the 1972 season. This book is a must read to learn about the coach who was the first to lead a team to the Super Bowl three straight seasons, the first to take two franchises to the Super Bowl, the only coach to appear in the Super Bowl in three different decades, has the most Super Bowl appearances of any coach, is the all-time winningest coach in professional football history, and the only coach who can say he coached a team during an undefeated season."},{"Title":"The Winning Edge","review":"This book by Don Shula was written back in 1973, and is easily missed by today's generation who now more than ever need to read truly great coaching books. It is not in any stores and is only really available online. I have never seen this in any library(a shame), and have never seen any modern day printings of it(even more of a shame). This is one coaching manuscript that really NEEDS to be read by wannabe-coaches or football fans in general. Thank GOD I found it here!!!!! I would give it SIX stars if it was possible. It is very well written and put together by a man who understood the game of football and, more importantly, people, so very well. Shula talks about his life and some of his strategies on football and leadership that will leave any reader very satisfied......If you are looking to devour some outstanding grid-iron reading in 2005, then this is a can't miss book!!!!"},{"Title":"The Winning Edge","review":"DON SHULA GIVES US A GOOD LOOK AT HIS LIFE, PLAYING CAREER, COACHING CAREER, AND THE FANTASTIC 1972 DOLPHIN SEASON. HE IS VERY HONEST, INTELLIGENT, DETAILED AND VERY DEDICATED. I ENJOYED READING ABOUT HIS PLAYING DAYS ESPECIALLY SINCE HE WAS A CLEVELAND BROWN FOR A FEW YEARS. HE DEFINATELY IS ONE OF THE GREATEST COACHES OF ALL TIME AND A LEGEND. A MUST READ FOR ALL FOOTBALL FANS. WELL WORTH IT."},{"Title":"The Winning Edge","review":"Believe it or not, I actually wrote a book report on The Winning Edge when I was in the 4th grade some twenty years ago. At the time I worshipped the Dolphins and Shula who, during my youth, was still the head coach in Miami. I have very fond memories of this book. Written soon after the Dolphins' famous 17-0 season, Shula describes his childhood (how the spelling of his surname changed because a teacher kept mispronouncing it), his football playing years during which he was part of one of the biggest trades of the day (first hearing about it while reading the newspaper), his coaching days in Baltimore where he was criticized by owner Rosenbloom for not being able to win &quot;the big one,&quot; his rapidly growing family, and his early, yet already legendary, career with the Miami Dolphins. One humorous story I remember is when he and his eldest son David (who would be one of the ongoing string of unsuccessful head coaches in Cincinnati) had to hitchhike home after a big playoff win because their car wouldn't start. The book includes a middle section of glossy black and white photos. From the Longest Game, to the undefeated season, to the Super Bowl victory, this book definitely represents the best time it was to be a Dolphin fan."},{"Title":"Turnabout","review":"I discovered this book decades ago in an old steamer trunk that belonged to my wife's late aunt. I was surprised to find it so hilarious since I had never heard of Thorne Smith. When I later found out he had authored \\"Topper\\", I understood. I could hardly put it down because it kept me wondering what disaster would next befall Tim - or should I say Sally? Read it! You will understand.Also, to Catherine: Turnabout was made into a movie in 1940. I've yet to see it, but I've read some good reviews about it."},{"Title":"Turnabout","review":"I first found this book when I was fifteen and have read it now at least fifty times. The characters and events still bring tears of laughter to my eyes. I've wished for a very long time that this could be made into a movie so more people could share Thorne Smith's vision. It is an intelligent read and a wonderful look at urban life in the late 20's. Block out some time and prepare to laugh out loud."},{"Title":"Turnabout","review":"Turnabout by Thorne Smith is a wonderful combination that celebrates the raucus hedonism of the 1920's and derides the hypocrasy of puritanical prohibition. It is the love story of a couple not in love that rediscover their love again once they trade places (literally and hilariously!). Through the devises of the mysterious &quot;Mr. Ram&quot; and local neighbors they set about creating a riot throughout their small town. It is a book I highly recommend. Anyone interested in humor, sex, and challenging authority should check it out."},{"Title":"Turnabout","review":"The 1920's through the eyes of a husband and wife who switch bodies with each other. While some of the gags are a bit dated, it was interesting to view male/female attitudes of that era. What would you do if you swapped bodies with someone of the opposite gender here in 1999? I know what I would do."},{"Title":"Turnabout","review":"Read this fantasy on several levels. Mr. Smith is a wordsmith able to delight while commenting on the human condition. It is especially refreshing to draw comparisons with the 20's and today."},{"Title":"Turnabout","review":"Humor is often misused, but in a master's hand, it can be the best tool to push a point. Here Thorne Smith helps us see marriage in a different light.In Turnabout, Sally and Tim Willows revolt against the constrictions of their marriage. Sally wants romance and a job; Tim wants to be in the nude and wiggle his toes. It takes the intervention of an annoyed statue, Mr. Ram, who switches their bodies, to resolve these 'irreconciable differences'.The novel is a brisk read, magnetically holding the attention to the last page. The hopelessness of the first chapter is conveyed colorfully, introducing us to the hilarious plot. Smith pours out wry double entendres, \\"one does not play with fire here, one actually uses it,\\" and dry quips, \\"...then proceeded to give a loquacious dissertation on the virtues of brevity.\\"There are some lessons to be learned here, mind you, like getting to be in a person's shoe to feel his pain, but even without them, Turnabout can be read for its sheer fun with words. This is my first Thorne Smith read; it will be definitely not be my last."},{"Title":"Voice in the Night","review":"A Great MysteryI bet you haven't read a book as mysterious and confusing as this. This book is great because of all the suspense in the book. Imagine one of your loved ones has died and one night you get a mysterious phone call and you figure it is your thought to be dead loved one.The conflict of my story is that a man named Neil was thought to be dead when he fell in some rapids, but one night his wife was sleeping until the phone rings. She picks it up and a voice says, \\"Come back to me, Carla you and Melissa both. Everything will be different from now on. I swear it, darling.\\" Then he hangs up. She gets another call from Neil that asks her to come to Arizona, and when she gets there she finally finds her long lost husband. When she finally has enough courage she asks him if he called for her to come back to Arizona, but he says he never called her once and never thought of her for four years. She then realizes that someone else is making those calls, but whom? To find out what happens in all the confusion, suspense, and mystery read Voice in the Night.I think this book is best suited for people who like mysteries, but young adults and adults would also enjoy reading this book. I also think that pre-teens would enjoy this book because of all the suspense.

Laurie Kenyon was kidnapped at the age of 4. Two years later, her kidnappers left her on the steps of a school building. When she was returned to her parents, she acted shy and afraid of everything, unlike what she used to be. What they didn't know is that she developed Multiple Personality Disorder(MPD). After the death of her parents, Laurie, now a college student, falls in love with Proffesor Allan Grant (or,at least, one of her personalities does). When Allan Grant is murdered, Laurie becomes the main suspect. Lauries sister, Sarah, switches sides of the courtroom and becomes Laurie's defendant attorney. Sarah convinces Laurie to see Justin Donelley, a phyciatrist specializing in MPD patients, to help her. As Laurie unveils all of her personalities and discovers what happens the night Allan Grant was stabbed to death, her kidnappers are closing in on her. And this time they mean murder....

I also liked the way the mystery was planed out. I really enjoyed one of the character that had multi-pesonalitys.

All Around the Town has a lot of unsuspected twists and turns so enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"This book is amazing. I love reading all Mary Higgins Clark books but this one completely stole my heart. I honestly couldn't put it down after I picked it up and started reading it the first time. There are so many twists to the plot and it keeps you guessing throughout the whole book. I definately recommend this book to everyone (even if you are the time that doesn't like to waste time reading novels). The way in which Mary Higgins Clark writes captures you and helps you identify with every single character you read about. If you are looking for a amazing book that you will completely fall in love with, this one is for you. Not only will it leave you breathless, it will touch your heart in many ways."},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"If you like MH Clark's books then I think you will find this to be an awesome read! It's full of suspense and tension, mystery and fear, and shows how much Laurie's family (especially her sister) cares for her and how much they sacrifice to cope with Laurie's needs. Also the emotional turmoil fills the pages with nervous tension and feelings.Laurie Kenyon was kidnapped at the age of four, right outside her house. Her parents couldn't believe it, couldn't believe their little girl had been kidnapped. Laurie's older sister (Sarah) was guilt-filled and blamed herself for Laurie's disappearance. When hope began to diminish ... A spark of light flared at the end of an ever dark tunnel. A sighting of Laurie had been made in a restaurant. The kidnappers feared they would be caught and dropped Laurie off at a school. When Laurie was returned home her parents were filled with joy, Sarah was elated. But they found that Laurie was not who she used to be ...Later they discover that Laurie has developed multiple personalites. But Laurie herself is not aware of it. The personalites know each other but Laurie doesn't know that she has different parts of herself that have seperated completely. She goes back to college and one of her personalites fall in a crazed love obsession with one of her professors, Allan Grant.She secretly visits Allan Grant's home and when he's home she watches him. But afterwards she doesn't remember ... any of it. That is because her other personalites had taken over. She sees people that are suppose to help her (shrinks, therapists) but instead of helping the tension in her just keeps building ...When Allan Grant is found dead ... it's worse than death. It's murder and the police are on the trail of the murderer. Signs point to Laurie ...Laurie's sister, Sarah swore she wouldn't ever defend the people who had comitted the crime ... innocent or not. But when Laurie is accused all of her promises were forgotten and she rushs to her little sister's aid- Laurie's attorney.Meanwhile the kidnappers hear about Laurie's trial and fearful that she might remember something they give her reminders anonomously that frighten her. One of the kidnappers has an obsession with her ... enough of an obession he risks getting caught to find what she remembers and just to see her again ...Enters Justin Donnelly, a psychiatrist to help with Laurie's memories and he also offers support to Sarah. He is interested in Laurie's case and strives to bring back Laurie's memories but time is running short ...Who will get to Laurie first? Her desperate kidnappers, the police or her caring sister? Will she spend a long part of her life (if not all of it) behind bars, regarded with suspicion or will she be freed to discover her true self?Will distruction for Sarah and Laurie be their destiny or will romance spark to life? Fate plays its hands and if they don't like the result then that will be too bad ... or too late to change the future.What about the murderer of Allan Grant? All signs point to her but there may other clues that everyone has overlooked ... if they don't find out who the murderer was the person may walk free ... But if it's not Laurie then who is it?The end has several twists that leave you speechless (at least they did in my case!) and I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did!"},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"A girl, kidnapped at a young age, is haunted years later by her kidnapper in a Suburban town.

I am hooked on her. This book, 'All Around The Town' has done it to me again. I really felt that I was sitting in the doctor's office with Laurie and Sarah. You can feel the love and devotion between the sister's. The characters in this book put me through many emotions. As a parent I felt terrified at how easy Bic and Opal snatched a child and how bittersweet the return was. As a sister I felt the desire to nurture and protect a sibling thru the losses they experienced. As a citizen I felt the frame job and was the climax ever a twist! The ending was as it should be and I strongly suggest the reading of this book.

This is the story of Laurie, who was abducted at the tender age of 4, and who's life was altered forever even after making her way back home.

When the main character, Laurie Kenyon, was a young girl, she was abducted by stangers. Those two years of Laurie's life were so horrible that she forced herself to forget them when she returned home. Throughout the novel, different events happened to Laurie that affected her greatly. She develops a new personality for every significant happening. This book is an excellent thriller that is full of suspense and twists. It's descriptive vocabulary makes the reader feel as if they are part of the story."},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"This book was great. It had several short chapters that all ended in suspense. I am normally a person who takes time reading books, but this one kept me on the edge of my seat, and I finished it rather quickly.

I would read more MHC books in the future! GREAT BOOK!"},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"I think that Mary Higgins Clark did an awesome job on this story. And even though it is a little disturbing it was a great book and keeps you glued to the pages. If you love a mystery and love the suspense that goes with it than this book is totally what you want to read. For a little info on the book: one of the main characters (Laurie) was kidnapped at age 4 and returned two years but never fully recovered from the abduction. 17 years later she has been diagnosed with multiple personality disorder and is accused of murder, however Laurie has no memory of this but all the signs point to her. The kidnappers come back in her life and try to ruin it but Laurie's sister Sarah is helping her through the whole process and.... well I guess you just have to read it to figure out what happens hope you like it."},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"i liked it. easy to read and fun. Not much of a brain buster but entertaining. A little forgettable, however..."},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"If you've read Clark and have enjoyed her work previously, then you will most likely find yourself enjoying this book as well.Clark is a very fast paced writer, she doesn't bother with any characterisms or back stories that are unrelated to her specific theme, which is always an event, usually a murder.Her characters are always extremely sympathetic and that is what brings Clarks readers back to her again and again, she writes about people that you can sympathize with, or that you can feel sympathy for.In this book, who could not feel for a four year old child who is abducted and abused and continues to suffer from her experiences into adulthood? The songs and hymns that are replayed in her memories are extremely frightening and have a creepy effect.I think MPD (multiple personality disorder)is also represented quite well here on a very general basis ofcourse. It's never quite so easy, but it does show cause and effect.There were two things I found rather mediocre...and that is her choice to make the abductor an evangelist. I found this rather uninspired and felt she could have done far better in that estimation and something that I have found rather annoying (but for Clark and her characters it is something convenient) is the fact that Clark's \\"killers\\" are always clever enough to pull off the act of murder, and show traits of antisocial disorder and psychopathy, so inevitably they are able to keep their secret safe until they are confronted by law enforcement or investigators with what is always circumstantial evidence and they always confess. They offer little resistence and just tell all! So simple, so convenient and completely unrealistic. That part of Clark's writing is recurrent and annoying for me. I am sure detectives would love for crimes to work out the way they do in Clark's novels. They wouldn't have to do much if they did.Other than those few annoyances, I enjoy her stories and appreciate her pace and the fact that she writes about characters you grow to care for."},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"This book has two mysteries in it. The first mystery is who kidnapped Laurie and will they be caught. The second mystery was if Laurie was a murderer.Mary Higgins Clark did a really good job of developing the characters of Laurie and Sarah. I really liked the way Clark showed us how the different personalities of Laurie took over and how they protected her. Laurie was oblivious of what her different personalities did while they controlled her. What really made the story come to life for me is that even Laurie didn't know if she was guilty and wanted answers herself.I didn't really care for how the kidnappers, Bic and Opal, were able to come back 15 years later and every little plan they had to frighten Laurie was unrealistically productive. I guess it added to the story line but I admit to rolling my eyes when everything went the way Bic and Opal needed it to.All in all there were great twists and great characters."},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"I love this book.

The is unforgiving and disturbing because it involves the kidnap, rape, and ongoing years of entrapment of a young girl. She was really just a baby when abducted.

Read the book, because it's a good book; hug your kids whether you read it or not.The lack of great detail about Laurie's sexual abuse is an unexpected blessing - everyone knows, and no one really needs to read the details. Alluding to it was enough to give the reader the idea without specifics.Abducted and abused by a pair of Bible-thumping ex-hippies, four year old Laurie Kenyon coped the best way she could - she let someone else do it for her. They were her closest friends, literally. After two years, Laurie was released and brought home to a family who loved her. Her sister, Sarah, thought she was different when she came home and swore she'd look after her forever. Her parents, just happy to have their baby back, didn't seek answers to what had happened to Laurie over those years.Fifteen years later, Laurie's parents died in an accident and her behavior changed. The people who loved her thought it was because of the loss of her parents, but her closest friends knew that it was because she had heard that voice, rising above the others, at the church. They had heard it, too. And they were back, to protect her again.How close can a friend really be? How about living in your head, sharing your body, blocking your memories? Laurie's got MPD (aka DID) and that's the good news. The bad news? She's accused of murdering one of her professors AND she's being stalked by her former abductors. Just as one answer becomes clear, another problem seems to appear, leaving everyone around her - and inside her - doing a constant dance to get all the right answers before it's too late.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"I love this book. this was the first MHC book i read and the best so far. this book kept me on the \\"edge of my seat\\" i could not put it down.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book!"},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"Maybe I'm a sissy. A &quot;wimp&quot; Kate would have called it (read the book for the meaning of that statement).Mary Higgins Clark is a wonderful writer and I am in no way meaning to bash her. But this book was so scary to me that I will never read another of hers again. I read it in one sitting of 8 hours. Since you don't know me, your &quot;scary scale&quot; may or may not match mine, and therefore my advice is unreliable.If you liked the movie Don't Say A Word, you should read this book, though I don't think they are based one on another."},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"What can I honestly say about an experience like Mary Higgins Clark's, \\"All Around the Town\\"? Let me begin by acknowledging that I have never read a single of Clark's books prior to this, so I am not really familiar with her form of writing and the techniques she uses. A friend highly recommended this book and author to me (thanks T. G.), so naturally, I decided to check it out, largely because I am a big fan of Psychological Thrillers and I haven't read a decent mystery in ages. I've decided to approach this review from more of a \\"Commentary\\" stand point, so I really won't take the time to explain the plot or characters in great detail. I expected the usual dead corpse, clear the convict of charges, make large revelations, and everyone has a \\"happily ever after\\" type ending format to this mystery. To a certain extent, this was true, but there were multiple plot twists, a sophisticated aura to the story and it's details, and character development that rivals that of classics like \\"Gone with the Wind\\" and \\"Little Women\\". This was an unexpected surprise to me. I thoroughly enjoyed the relationships that formed between the central characters and their general respect for each other and the parts they play in this mystery/Psychological development story. The one of the central characters, Laurie (aka. Leona, Kate, Lee, and Debbie), is forced to come to the facts that she was not responsible for her parent's tragic death or her being kidnapped and molested at the innocent age of 4. We later learn in the story that to help her get through the \\"tough\\" times in her life, for lack of a better word, she has developed a case known as Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) in which her mind embraces four other personalities aside from her central personality (Laurie). Among these are Debbie, a constantly crying four year old; Lee, a personality which I will not discuss for fear that I may spoil too much of the story; Kate, an older, more mature protector which resembles Laurie's sister in character; and Leona, a sexy, feminine woman who is not afraid to let it all out. Laurie doesn't realize she has these other personalities in her mind until she talks to her psychiatrist and together they identify the personalities. Laurie's older sister, Sara, is very protective over Laurie but not in an imposing way. I believe she felt guilty because she was not there to prevent Laurie's kidnapping. She is a very conservative and mature woman who quits her job as an assistant prosecutor to defend her sister in court when she is charged with the murder of her College Professor Allan Grant. Laurie has always admired and loved Professor Grant but her alter personality, Leona, has taken this to when she sneaks into his house at night, watches him sleep, and writes very provocative and explicit love letters to him signing as Leona (Allan Grant is unaware of Laurie's MPD case). Found stabbed to death on his bed, Laurie is the only suspect in his murder. I prefer to not reveal anymore of the story because you can read more about it in the other reviews below and above mine and I'd much rather give my impressions on the story and not waste time talking about something I need not to. Anyway, as I was saying, the plot twists and later revelations are worth reading and it gives you a good feeling towards the story once you finish the 117 chapter story (Don't worry, most chapters are less then a page in length, at least in the hard bound version). Early insignificant details in the beginning of the story and after Grant is killed are later brought out in the forms of great revelations which progress the story further and add to the total experience. Hint: Pay special attention to details that don't seem very important or are not really worth remembering when you first come across them. I highly recommend this novel to all fans of Psychological thrillers, mystery, or character progression and revelations. I'd like to thank T. G. once again for recommending this book and for reopening my mind to the world of intellectual mysteries that stimulate the mind and leave you feeing a sense of accomplishment. Kudos and God Bless..."},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"The first dozen or so pages of this book are so crucial to setting the scene for what happens later in the life of Laurie Kenyon, but they were difficult pages to get through. The reader has to watch in horror as a cute little girl suffers through terrible mental and physical abuse. When she eventually gets back to her family, those awful memories are lost and buried deep. When Laurie is at college, tragedy strikes again, and her past comes back to fiercely haunt her. There's a lot of tough issues and depth with this one besides a good murder mystery: abuse, mental anguish, lost memories, deception, grief and multiple-personality disorder. This is a well written book, and you find yourself really pulling for this poor girl. Very good cast of characters around the main character as well. Maybe not the book to read if you want something light-hearted, but definitely worth your time if you want a good thriller: there's suspense just dripping off almost every page. My only complaint is that the main bad guy, who is pretty evil and sick, is also \\"devoutly religious\\".

Leaving aside the sheer improbability of the plot, the stilted dialogue and dead giveaway clues to the &quot;mystery&quot; of who killed the professor, this book portrays multiple personalities with a cavalier disregard for the reality of a very painful and difficult condition. To say that I was disappointed would be a gross understatement: I was enraged with Ms. Higgins Clark's inability to show the inner life of a multiple with anything approaching accuracy. Now, I'm all for willing suspension of disbelief, but the characters in this book evoked so little sympathy from me that frankly, it was all I could do to finish reading it. However, I struggled valiantly through to the end, if only to be able to say I had actually read one of Ms. Higgins Clark's works. Okay, I've done my duty. Now, can I read something a little less trite?"},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"Laurie Kenyon was kidnapped at the age of four.

Many things happened while with these people, and for every bad event happened she created different personalities to help her tuck it away inside, never to remember those times. But when she starts to see psychiatrist she starts to remember things. The more she finds out the more scared she becomes that her abducters will find her and kill her like they said. As the story continues you the reader become more and more envolved in this book. You won't want to put it down. I really enjoyed this book. It got to the point where i took it everywhere I went just to be able to finish it. Mary Higgins Clark does a great job of making you the reader feel like you are in the book. It is almost like you are the main character. I would definitly recomend this book to a person who really enjoys suspensefull books, because once you finish a chapter you want to keep going to find out what happens to that person. The end is suprising, but almost expected. Except for the parts leading up to the climax, you really have to guess what will happen. The middle is a little slow moving, just because you want to see what will happen at the end. I enjoyed this book very much and I hope that the people that read it will enjoy it just a much as I did."},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"This book is set in NJ in the 1990's. Mary Higgins Clark's novel, All Around the Town, is about a woman with multiple personalities due to many painfully memorable events.

For every event she creates a diffent personality. You the reader are entwined in this thriller and suspenseful novel."},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"This book was excellent! This is one of the reasons why I can't stop reading Mary Higgins Clark. The characterization of the multiple personalities was extremely realistic. All of the characters were so vivid it felt like you really knew them. Laurie was the main character who was the one that was actually suffering from MPD and her change from personality to personality made the story all the more interesting. The kidnappers were depicted as such cunning and scheming psychopaths until you were begging for their demise. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to be suspended on the edge of their seats."},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"It was wonderful!

Only MHC can write about bloody knives and chicken heads and make is classy. MHC addresses child abuse head on: she speaks to the fact that there are many parents who would be so glad to get their kid back, they wouldn't ask questions! They would attribute strange behavior to ANYTHING but abuse, even though the kid was kidnapped and gone for many months. This story addresses what abuse can do if left un-counseled.

It was an incredible read"},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"This book was definately one I would recommomend to my friends.

One day she sees a line of cars slowly driving by and, thinking it's a carnival, she goes outside to check and is abducted. Two years later a cashier in a caf&eacute; happens to see her and a couple hours later she's left by the side of the road and returned to her family.However her abductors have told her what will happen to her if she ever tells, and for a little girl who has spent the last two years trapped with cruel and perverse people who had been abusing her, that wasn't a warning to be taken lightly.Fifteen years later Bic and Opal Hawkins, the couple that had abducted little Laurie, are televangelists, making a slick buck doing God's work. However, though they may have their evil eyes on heaven, they have them on Laurie too, who is now a senior in college.Laurie is going through a tramatic period. Her parents have been killed in a bus crash. Her sister is overly protective. She's left her boyfriend and doesn't seem to know why. she's apparently obsessing over one of her professors and begins writing him erotic letters. Then the prof is murdered and Laure is suspect number one.Did she do it? Can her lawyer sister help her? Two good questions and before they can be answered, it's discovered that Laurie is suffereing from MPD, multiple personality disorder. It seems there is more than one person in Lauire's head, a result of when she was living with the evil abuductors. When her abuse got so bad she couldn't stand it anymore, she'd hide in her head, go to a safe place. Is she still doing it? Did one of her personalities kill the prof without letting Laurie in on it?Of course, the God fearing, child rapers are keeping an eye out to see if Laurie remembers and that's what really makes this book a thriller. However, I must admit, I had a hard time thinking about the child abuse. The book did, though, open my eyes to MPD. Over all, I'd have to say this was a story well worth reading."},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"The first couple chapters about a 4 yr. old being kidnapped and sexually/physically abused made me so sick that I could not continue on with the story."},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"This Book Is Very DISTRUBING! The book is written well as far as MHC's deatails, maybe a bit too good. Yet the subject matter is very distrubing and the ending is preposterous. The main character Laurie, would need many years of agressive therapy, and most likely hospitalization. MHC's, ending of Lauries Super quick recovery is absurd. The two villains are just down right evil, and there is no real conclusion as to what happened to the disgusting opal."},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"I read All Around the Town a while ago and was thoroughly disappointed. The plot was improbable, the characters unrealistic, and the book (in my opinion) had little suspense. MHC writes books that are more suited to preteens.

I started it first period during the school day (8:00 am), and didn't put it down until I got home (3:30 pm). I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.

She is by far one of today's most exciting writers; not one of her books is dull or boaring; she holds you on your seat or keeps you up till all hours of the morning unable to put the book down until you find out who the villian is. subject matter very well reshearched in all of her books;as i say she is trully an amazing and gifted writter whom i enjoy and look forward to reading her books."},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"Mary Higgins Clark wrote a book that was great!

I reccomend it."},{"Title":"All Around the Town - Large Type","review":"Giving this book any rating below a ten would be an absolute sin. Once again MHC succedes in weaving an intricate web of terror and delight which soon entagles the reader and refuses to let go until the last page is finished.

Multiple personalities come into play as Laurie discovers that her greatest alies lie within her own mind. Only by reliving her horrible past and by assuming the different roles that she herself created can she hope to unlock the secrets of her past and destroy the very real force that seeks to destroy her future. Simply put, one of the best books I have every read. I'f you've never read it,READ IT! I'f you have read it,READ IT AGAIN!

She does a great job of presenting muliple personality disorder (now called disassociative disorder. When reading this book, I could not put it down. First thing in the morning I went to finish it up. I love Mary's mysteries, but this is one of my favorites. It is a toss up between this one and A Cry in the Night. The plots are very unique.

The people that abducted her, while pretending to be Christians, are anything but and you find yourself wishing you could have just five minutes with them, preferably with a gun in your hand!

Being in the animal care field (I work at a non-profit, privately funded shelter) not only do I collect books on animals, of course, I see a lot of sad situations everyday in my field. When this book arrived from Amazon (prompt as usual), after a hard day at the shelter, I was immediately overjoyed by the beauty of it and it helped me realize \\"Yes, this is why I do what I do, because people care\\"! The photography is excellent, sort of a photojournalistic point of view and the style of printing is in a soft, sepia tone. The captions for each photograph are right on target.

How thrilled the guardians of these cats must feel to have these gorgeous portraits of their cat companions.I work for a publishing company so the typesetting did not escape my notice, either. Called &quot;CatLover&quot; it was designed by the author as per the cip page, and is so hip and quirky and appropriate. Impressive.The format of the book is a photograph or photographs of a cat, it's name which falls into alphabetical order like Webster's on a much smaller scale, and then captioned by three definitions of the accompanied cat.

It wasn't too long ago that I read, \\"Jambo Means Hello\\", the Swahili alphabet book by Muriel Feelings that was published in 1974. That book was okay, but I was disappointed that it didn't distinguish between tribes or acknowledge the advance of technology in Africa in the 1970s. Then I picked up this 1976 Caldecott winning book and upon reading it I was stunned. This book is everything that \\"Jambo Mean Hello\\" SHOULD have been. With meticulously researched information, delicate details, and stunning illustrations this book deserves to be read to every single child in elementary school for as long as there are either children or schools.The book goes through the alphabet by naming a different tribe for each letter. First of all, I was surprised that there actually was an African tribe for every letter in the alphabet. Shows what I know. As we view each tribe we get a stunning illustration of their clothing, towns or villages, and activities. Author Margaret Musgrove describes their life, picking out the most interesting details for each. Through this method we learn that in Baule legend the crocodiles aided them when they were at war with the Ashanti. Or we find out that in the Tuareg tribe the men are veiled and the women do most of the talking, storytelling, and poetry. From A to Z we see a wide spectrum of African inhabitants, ending with a map of Africa that shows where each tribe resides.But it doesn't stop there. Feelings explains in her Author's Note in the front that modern technology is changing the face of African life, though she contends that the traditions pictured in this book are still being passed on from generation to generation. She points out that some customs mentioned here are unique and relate only to that particular tribe while other values and philosophies are shared by all. She is even so careful as to point out that many (not all) African language prefixes are added to denote the plural. She, however, has used the root words throughout the book for simplicity's sake. Should you have any doubts about the background of this author, you can read in a tiny note on the publication page that she lived and studied in Ghana for years and a list of publications consulted is included. And if you've any doubts about the illustrations, don't. As noted, even the interwoven designs at the corners of the pages are based on Kano Knots. Every article of clothing, every animal, every home depicted here is accurate and beautiful.I don't mean to pooh-pooh \\"Jambo Means Hello\\", but that book hasn't got anything on the amazing \\"Ashanti to Zulu\\". It's stunning."},{"Title":"Ashanti to Zulu: African traditions","review":"\\"Ashanti to Zulu\\" presents 26 African tribes, from A to Z, and lets children learn something about the culture and customs of each one. Aside from being a learning experience, the book is visually eye-popping; the illustrations are so gorgeous you'll want to blow them up and frame them. The book won a well-deserved Caldecott Medal for the best illustrated children's book of 1977. It's a great book for helping children to learn about some of the peoples of our least-known populated continent, and the pictures will hold the kids mesmerized. It's a volume that belongs on every youngsters bookshelf."},{"Title":"Ashanti to Zulu: African traditions","review":"An A-to-Z alphabet book for children in which the examples for the letters are twenty-six different tribes in Africa, exhibiting some of their varied traditions and customs. Hence, children learn of other peoples. It was illustrated by Leo and Diane Dillon and it won the 1977 Caldecott Medal for best illustration in a book for children."},{"Title":"Ashanti to Zulu: African traditions","review":"This is a book that describes different African tribes from each letter of the alphabet. This is a great way to teach children about African tribes, and the book also pronounces each tribe so it is easier to read. The illustrations are wonderful and full of detail. This would be a great lesson in the classroom to learn about Africa. It would also be great to use each page as a poster or transparency."},{"Title":"Ashanti to Zulu: African traditions","review":"This is an amazing book, practically one of a kind! The information, illustions, and luster of the indigenous African cultures is beautiful to behold. I recommed introducing young children to cultures and peoples as varied as the come to fully portray to them the true beauty of this creation, life. There is nothing so intricate, so inveloping and powerful as life in this form. Pronounciation is given for the tribes names to bring ease of reading, which is, in fact, very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Ashanti to Zulu: African traditions","review":"Musgrove uses the alphabet book concept to showcase 26 traditional African cultures. For each one, she explains a custom about that culture in one paragraph. Each entry emphasize the variety in the cultures she has chosen. There is no particular rhythm to the prose, she does not use rhyme or repetition, and for that reason it is not an exciting book to read aloud.For each culture represented, the Dillons illustrated a detailed, realistic family or community scene. Each scene is framed with the same knot design, and each contains a male, female, and child of that particular people, as well a depiction of their home and fauna native to their part of Africa. Despite this planned similarity, each scene is unique. The Dillons depict each tribe with varying skin tones and facial features, use a wide variety of colors and patterns and apparently did extensive research to make each scene accurate. Though they have attempted to be realistic, their style is also traditional, reminiscent of a fairy tale book, with soft lines, gentle shading and muted colors. In addition, the perspective is somewhat stylized, adding a folk art feel. Their illustrations combine well with Musgrove's writing, as they both work together to bring out the beauty and mystique of a culture foreign to most readers.It is intended for the standard picture book age*, and may not be appropriate. Preschoolers may not be mature enough to understand or be interested in other cultures yet, though these illustrations could be enticing enough to make them want the book read aloud. Many of the terms will be too advanced for early readers, making this one that will need to be read with an adult for the majority of those in the intended age range.*note: I have since found out that Amazon has this rated for the wrong age group; according to the Children's Literature Comprehensive Database it is intended for grades 4-5."},{"Title":"Ashanti to Zulu: African traditions","review":"If you dig into the children's books in any public or school library, even those of modest means, you will encounter dozens; at times hundreds, of alphabet books. These books come in all sizes, shapes, themes, and difficulty levels. Some are quite good, some are so-so, and some are absolutely horrid,and to he honest, pathetic.I have a special category for some of these alphabet books though. They are the ones that go beyond the mere \\"quite good\\" category and hold a special place. I am please to report that Ashanti to Zulu, African Traditions, by Margaret Musgrove and illustrated by Leo and Diane Dillon make the cut and in fact is in a rare realm of works that simply do not get better! I was actually shocked, amazed and absolutely delighted when I stumbled across this one. Now let me make one point clear here; this is indeed an alphabet book, but it is also a book that any adult with one ounce of curiosity and appreciation for quality can also enjoy.Now that being said....This work covers the alphabet, A through Z using African Tribes. The author starts with Ashanti then proceeds to Baule, Chagga, Dogon, Ewe, Fanti, Ga and so on, until the book ends with Zulu. Each tribe has its own page which is beautifully illustrated (more about that later) and a tremendous amount of information packed into one short paragraph. The writing style can best be illustrated through a direct quote from one of the pages (selected at complete random), such as the page devoted to \\"S\\" or to the Sotho:\\"S/When a Sotho (soo'-too) girl marries; she does not carry a bouquet of flowers. She holds a magic beaded doll. The doll has no arms or legs, but it does have earrings. Its body is a bright beaded cone. It is Sotho custom for the bride to name the doll. Later, when she has her first baby, she gives this same name to her child\\"Nice facts about each group are delightfully presented in a manner that the young can well understand, yet gives both the young reader and the adult fascinating information.The author has done an extensive amount of research (many years of work has gone into this one) and the two artists have furthered and enhanced that research in so many ways.As to the art work: This is truly as valuable, and in many ways more so, than the text. Each picture has been done in watercolors, acrylics and pastels. The artists have tried in each case to represent male, female and child in their traditional dress. The work here is extremely detailed and authentic. Clothing, jewelry, and d&eacute;cor have all been addressed in loving detail. The settings of each plate include village s life, local flora and wildlife in addition to tools and household items. Leo and Diane Dillon are two of the best in the business and with this offering they have outdone even themselves.Note: The author has assured us that in spite of the modern technology that is changing he direction of African life, that the old ways linger and that the traditions of the passed are being passed down and are being respected and practiced. It is my own feelings that the author is being overly optimistic in this area and has underestimated the lure of \\"progress.\\" I fear that other than museums, old photographs and works such as this, we will soon not see the like as we are shown here. This work was published in 1976 and in the short span of only 30 or so years already so much has been lost that will never be recovered; forgotten and will never be seen again.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Ashanti to Zulu: African traditions","review":"The text is informative and succinct. But it's the illustrations that \\"make\\" this book. They are gorgeous and somewhat haunting."},{"Title":"Ashanti to Zulu: African traditions","review":"This book is as beautifully illustrated by Diane & Leo Dillon as it is well written by Margaret Musgrove, and the Caldecott Award committee only did what it had to: acknowledge a hands-down winner, a book for the ages. Westerners particularly will find their eyes opened, even today, to the range and depth of Africa - a great and beautiful aid in helping children appreciate - and adults to remember - the array of cultural diversity in a poorly understood continent. The alphabet is presented in order, of course, but this is way more than your rote A-B-C primer... get it in hardcover if you can, or paperback if you can't, but get it!

It's a great way to introduce African culture to not only African American children, but all children who yearn to learn about other cultures."},{"Title":"Ashanti to Zulu: African traditions","review":"Ashanti to Zulu: African Traditions is one of the most beautiful children's books ever published. It is a unique ABC book in which every letter represents an African tribe. The traditions of each tribe are described in clear text and illustrated with a picture that shows the people, clothing, crafts, type of house, animals and vegetation of the particular tribe. But nothing about this book is pedantic or boring. The text is well researched and each illustration is a unique design. No wonder it won the Caldecott medal for distinguished illustration in 1977 and is still a favorite around the world. So what's my beef? The Picture Puffin edition is cheap and ugly. The cover picture is a ghastly red blur and the inside illustrations are equally distorted in color. It's an insult to the creators. Puffin press should be embarrassed! I was shocked when I saw it and promptly returned it. Do yourself a favor and buy the original 1976 edition (also available on Amazon). It's just a few bucks more and well worth every penny. It's cocktail-table worthy and will be enjoyed by adults perhaps even more than by children."},{"Title":"Ashanti to Zulu: African traditions","review":"This is a wonderful book, both as an entertaining view into African culture and traditions that any child or adult will enjoy, but also as an illustrated masterpiece of art!

This book covers a wide range of people from all corners of Africa, while remaining non-stereotypical. I read this book as a child, and the pictures were so beautiful, I kept re-reading it. This is definitely worthy of the Caldecott medal it recieved in 1974!"},{"Title":"Ashanti to Zulu: African traditions","review":"As you might read from other reviewers, it is a great alphabet book. However, the illustrations teach children misconceptions about Africans that are not necessarily true. For instance, why aren't any of them wearing glasses? Or wearing camouflage?

Only by recovering our troops could we hope to regroup, rearm and then rejoin the fight. Off Normandy, an armada of small boats did an amazing job of work ferrying as many troops as possible safely home to England. Further away, off St. Nazaire a few large ships were also working to that same common cause.Then, on 17 June 1940, more people died - as one particular troopship was bombed, sunk and then strafed, than on the more famous losses of the Titanic and Lusitania combined. Sadly, apart from the survivors, the relatives of those who perished plus a few divers who visit the wreck, few people have ever heard the name of that ship.She was the Cunard passenger liner \\"Lancastria\\" and in this book the author brings her back to life in a most vivid and poignant fashion.Nowadays, more and more people are asking questions about what \\"really\\" did happen with regard to specific incidents during both world wars - and quite right too. Furthermore, divers have begun to ask all the right questions about the shipwrecks they are visiting. It is accounts, such as this that go a long way towards answering those questions and filling in the gaps created by the historical events which followed the sinking of this once great ship.Altogether, this is more than just a book about a ship that was lost in dreadful circumstances. With the skills of a consummate wordsmith, author Jonathan Fenby has carefully brought this tragedy back to back to life because people had forgotten it had happened. In so doing, he has created an historical document of great importance - a document which is of great interest to divers and historians alike.If you really want to know how the Lancastria met her end, this book is possibly the only document you will ever need.NM"},{"Title":"Rescue Your Life from Mediocrity: Grow an Exceptional Life Personally, Relationally & Spiritually.","review":"This book is amazingly written from an open-minded perspective touching on real life issues that many of us bury or ignore.

If we're enjoying such a wonderful economy, why are so many people losing their jobs? The author, Mitchell Baldwin, offers advice for people who have been recently downsized, and even those who are still waiting for the ax to fall. His financial advice is practical, easy to understand, and it works. I have put into place all of his suggestions and my financial picture is greatly improved. He also offers suggestions about what to do next, how to retrain yourself, where to look for a job, and even how to go about starting your own business, as he did. Baldwin addresses the depression and anxiety one may feel when leaving a job, as well as the guilt that is often felt by the survivors. And, all of his suggestions and advice is presented from a Christian perspective, which meant a lot to me. I advise anyone who has lost a job, or thinks they may be in danger of losing a job, to get this book for their own personal library.

In addition, he gives the basics of how you can put your life back together.

With this introduction, Russell discusses some problems: the physical world, man from without (environment), man from within (consciousness, emotions, ethics etc) and so on. An outline is clearly limited, and Russell does not include many branches of philosophical enquiry such as metaphysical inquiry and some aspects of authority and state.

I had also prepared in other ways, but this book was part of my studying."},{"Title":"30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary","review":"a must have for high school students, it was a requirement for our student, but he learned a lot from it!"},{"Title":"30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary","review":"While you can certainly finish the book in 30 days, you'll most likely forget the vocabularies in at least half of the chapters by the time you are done. The quiz in each chapter is useful. The diagnostic test at the beginning of the book can crush your self-esteem - which is to be redeemed after reading the book. &quot;30 days&quot; in the title is misleading, because readers probably need to go through the chapters again and again to make sure they truly remember the words. So make it &quot;45-50 days to a more powerful vocabulary&quot;!Furthermore, believe it or not: it is not a bad cram book if you have less than 3 months to study for SAT or GRE! I find vocabulary builders (such as this title) much better study tools for SAT or GRE than conventional exam preparation guides like Princeton Review or Barron's - at least for the verbal section."},{"Title":"30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary","review":"On the back cover there is the promise that the book will &quot;make words your slaves&quot;. Well, not quite but with perseverance, you are destined to achieve at least 50% of the intended result. You need 30 days of persistent study and more days for reinforcement. A bonus is that by the end of the book you would probably be inspired to acquire a lifetime habit of increasing your vocabulary.Those who find this book useful should also consider the brilliant &quot;Word Power Made Easy&quot; by Norman Lewis, one of the co-authors of this book."},{"Title":"30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary","review":"This book is excellent. I worked through this book in less than 30 days, because I found it difficult to stop after just one exercise. I improved my SAT verbal by 90 points thanks to this book, and it began in me a love of words that continues siepaternally. This is the best vocabulary builder I have come across."},{"Title":"30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary","review":"While this book is very helpful in building a more powerful vocabulary, a more appropriate title would be &quot;45 days to a more powerful vocabulary in just 60 minutes a day!&quot; Some lessons must be repeated if you want to really know some of the words. There are no really ground breaking vocabulary memorization techniques in this book either. However, it does a great job of organizing certain vocabulary terms. If you can spare an hour a day for 45 days, this books can be a great help!"},{"Title":"30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary","review":"My brother-in-law recommended this book--he used it before he took his GRE tests, and found it really helpful. I also found it to be a helpful vocabulary book.Each \`day' introduces 10-20 words based on a specific theme or idea-sometimes, it is a group of words with similar roots (monologue, monogamy, etc.), sometimes it has words with opposite meanings, words are grouped by parts of speech.The chapters/days then spend a few pages reviewing those new words through various methods--the author's theory is that by forcing you to write down and select the words within a number of contexts, you will learn the words faster.Reviewers are correct that some words are used less often than they were in 1942, and one individual did not like the old practice of referring to generically to a doctor as \\"he\\" (by the way, all generic occupations/identifications were referred to as \\"he,\\" including negative connotations such as thief, prisoner, and used-car salesperson).This book is not a miracle--cure--don't toss out your high school GED just yet. Although you will learn a few scores of new words know how one goes about incorporating more, there is a long way to go. Just think of this book as a good start."},{"Title":"30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary","review":"Ahh...the pleasure of words, how could a man deny himself this Empyrean delight! Asceticism, at least in the realm of vocabulary, is a mortal sin that a true logophile should not hesitate to denounce.The organization of the book is worth heaping praises upon. Chapters, each of which should be finished in a day, are ordered thematically (eg Power Verbs and Foreign Words), that I personally found myself actually reading the book at whichever interesting chapter depending upon my particular inclination for that day. However, my advice should be taken with caution as the authors seemingly intended the book to be read in a particular order of progress. Well, tastes and aptitude may vary.The book begins with an initial assessment of vocabulary and general language skills already possessed. Subsequent chapters are also supplemented with exercises (which are accompanied by helpful hints themselves), and the book ends with a final assessment of success.At times the authors seem to be sermonizing on the values of the \\"American\\" language (as the authors call it), at times to be touting the importance of national linguistic pride, at times busily engaged in an exercise in Oprahesque you-can-do-it ad nauseam. As some reviewer(s) noted, the book has not been expurgated of the prejudices particularly prevalent at the time it was first written.Despite the flaws which all books are guilty of in some degree or another, Dr Wilfred Funk and Norman Lewis have shown the path towards a greater experience of this esoteric enteprise. A path that is delightfully fun, rewarding and entertaining; it is definitely worth every penny!"},{"Title":"30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary","review":"My 7th grade English teacher used this book as a vocabulary builder when I was in school. I enjoyed the way the book was set up in categories, and, although it is not a &quot;modern&quot; self-help book with lots of learning tricks, its content and form were very usable. I now have a 9th grade daughter who is interested in improving her vocabulary and this book was one of my choices for her."},{"Title":"30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary","review":"I was assigned this book as a college freshman. The more I used it, the more I loved it. Now, I'm using it to teach vocabulary.Chapters are have brain-friendly titles. Definitions are worded clearly and simply.Visually, though, it needs updating. This book was first published before computerized typesetting and desperately needs visual modernization. If you're a confident reader, it's no big deal, but as a reluctant student of English, you might find the text-dense pages a bit mucky."},{"Title":"30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary","review":"Of all of the resources I have used to improve my vocabulary for the GRE, 30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary is by far my favorite. The language is presented naturally and the exercises are expertly created. It is not a simple alphabetical list, but presents words in similar-use groups with varying exercises.My guess on wordcount is that there are about 500 higher-level words in Funk & Lewis's book. Some of them are not presented directly, but used in the chapter openings and closings, so expect to have a dictionary handy. You will also need a pen and paper - this is not a passive read. The authors state that you should expect to spend 15 minutes a day. Personally, I couldn't put it down and did two chapters a day for the first 15 chapters. After that, the content became significantly more challenging and I spent about 30 minutes a day, taking it one chapter a day.Although many useful words are presented in 30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary, its greatest asset is changing the way you think about words. Not only do you become more cognizant of specific words, but you learn how to analyze words and gain confidence in using new words. My spelling has improved significantly through this program as well. I will certainly revisit this book in another month and make sure I've integrated the words and techniques I've learned into my life.A quick note about the concerns of \\"misogynistic\\" material: you do yourself a disservice if you censor your own reading. This is a valuable resource. Truthfully as well, I think the authors aren't just anachronistic, but trying to dramatize the words, so that they'll stick better. (And I consider myself a fairly hard-core feminist!)I heartily agree with the reviewer who described this book as \\"a good start.\\" Certainly you won't get far if you read it and forget it, but it will guide and inspire you to make language study an integral facet of your life. I'm looking forward to reading more from these authors."},{"Title":"30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary","review":"Despite advertising hype - 30 Days To -, no ONE book will double your vocabulary, but reading several vocabulary-building books can double your vocabulary. Different vocabulary-building books have different words and different explanations. If you don't learn a word from one book, you can learn it from another book.Any vocabulary-building book will have many words, a fourth to half the book, that you already understand. You can always skip or skim the easy-to-you words.Varied, incomplete word selection is another reason for using several books. Some books just take words used on past-standardized tests, neglecting other words. Other books, limit their words to words based on word roots, neglecting others. Often authors have thrown in personal favorite words, even if others rarely use the words. If you see a word in two or three books, it's generally a need-to-know word.The main weakness of 30 Days To A More Powerful Vocabulary, and no book is perfect, is the word selection. As one other reviwer noted: some of the definitions are dated. But the price is right and if you read several vocabulary-building books, you will not have a problem identifying the few dated words.Other Books: Cartoon/Mnemonic vocabulary books have their fans who like the mnemonic memory aids, which are useful before tests. But with only one word and one cartoon per page, these books may only have a few hundred words and are expensive on a per word learned basis. Audio vocabulary books such as Elite Word Power, let you hearing each word pronounced correctly, helpful for improving speaking vocabulary."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart and His Poems","review":"EVERYONE who admires Jimmy Stewart should have this audio book. Hearing his voice and the emotion he felt about his dog, a camera, and the &quot;step&quot; is what makes these poems remarkable. You find yourself feeling sad and happy about his dogs, feeling sorry for a camera, and intriqued about the &quot;step.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart and His Poems","review":"Probably the best way to read &quot;Jimmy Stewart and His Poems&quot; is to imagine the beloved actor reading them aloud, with his distinctive voice breathing life into each piece. The poems are illustrated by Cheryl Gross.The book contains four poems, each of which is preceded by a short essay explaining how Stewart came to write it. Each poem is drawn from Stewart's real life experiences. The poems are as follows: &quot;The Top Step in the Hotel in Junin,&quot; about a safety hazard at a hotel in Argentina; &quot;The Aberdares!&quot;, about an African mountain range; &quot;I'm a Movie Camera,&quot; about a camera he bought so that his daughters could film a family trip to Africa; and &quot;Beau,&quot; about a beloved dog.The poems are not particularly deep or impressive from a literary standpoint, but they have a certain folksy charm. Some sample lines from &quot;The Aberdares!&quot;: &quot;The North Pole's rather chilly, / Those who've been there all will tell. / There's lots of snow and lots of ice / And lots of wind as well.&quot; &quot;Beau&quot; is sentimental and funny, and, I must admit, reminded me of a particular dog who was part of my family. At 32 pages long, this is not a very substantial volume. Recommended for fans of Stewart."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart and His Poems","review":"There's a reason why Jimmy Stewart became a famous actor and not a famous poet. In fact, this book shows that reason in striking and graphic detail. But good poets are difficult to find nowadays anyway. Good story-telling is also hard to find nowadays. And yet Jimmy Stewart does some wonderful stroytelling in his little book of poetry. If you can read these poems and hear his voice in your head at the same time, then they're a lot easier to read. Many a college student today will read assigned poetry by Byron, Frost, Shakespeare, or Tennyson and come away with nothing. But even the most unpoetic reader will come away from this book with a smile on his or her face.Although it appears to be out of print, as of my typing this, Amazon currently has over 300 used copies available - at least 10 of which are selling for under $6.00. I think I paid less than a dollar for mine. And with a mere 32 pages anyway consisting of only about five or six poems, there's no reason to pay much more than that.So, the book is available. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart and His Poems","review":"I purchase the book/tape for my 16 year old son, who is a fan of Jimmy Stewart. I enjoyed it so much, I then bought my own copy. I listen to it many times on my way to work and home. It is funny, sad, and enthralling...the very essence of Jimmy Stewart.
