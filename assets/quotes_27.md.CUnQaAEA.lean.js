I have never and, God-willing, will never encounter people with such horrific apathy to their fellow human beings. I cannot honestly review this book because the subject matter is beyond my comprehension. The telling is in Mr. Wiesel's own words and cannot be criticized for he and only he can express what is in his heart and what is sadly in his memory. What I can say is that this book should be required reading for EVERYONE so that this history is never again repeated. I finished this book on a plane and had to sit quietly the remainder of the flight, staring silently at Mr. Wiesel's photograph on the back cover. Thought-provoking doesn't do this book justice. I have no words to describe that which has no place in humanity but which Mr. Wiesel and so many MANY others somehow endured.

This account of Eli Wiesel's experience in the concentration and death camps of Nazi Germany is horrifying and tears at the heart. The reader easily understands his questions of guilt and anger, and yet, it is also a story of triumph, ultimately.

He is a very intelligent man. To have lived through what he did and to be yet so confused by it all is so unknown to me. He must, after all these years, still question every day of his existence, \\"why me\\", why was I to live. The book itself is written to be just enough information to open your eyes, but make you want to learn more about the beginnings of many more of the people who were either survivors or not. He writes the book to help himself, but yet I can see where it will help many others to be more compassionate.

NIGHT is the terrifying record of Elie Wiesel's memories of the death of his family, the death of his own innocence, and his despair as a deeply observant Jew confronting the absolute evil of man. this new translation by his wife and most frequent translator, Marion Wiesel, corrects inmprtant details and presents the most accurate rendering in English of Elie Wiesel's testimony to what happened in the camps and of his unforgettable message that this horror must never be allowed to happen again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"It is difficult to approach Elie Wiesel's night with a critique. As memoir, it is unassailable. At best, we can take it as a piece of literature and then base our analysis on that. Night is, after all, marketed as a novel.I think the literary key to the novel is in the very beginning, where the young narrator studies Kabbalah with the mysterious Moshe the Beadle. Moshe is a simple man, and hides great learning and mystical erudition. The young narrator, who cries during prayer, gains the attention of Moshe, and at the tender age of 14, begins to study Jewish mysticism (traditionally, one should only begin such studies at 40).Night becomes, in a sense, a commentary on how close we can get to God, when the world is so inherently (or seemingly) godless. When Moshe is deported to the camps, only to arrive back after escaping, the Jews of Sighet will not believe his stories of atrocities. The Jews of this corner of Hungary refuse to believe that their destruction is immanent. God's knowledge of human fate is revealed only to be concealed.The Kabbalah, with its promise of closeness to God, and the destruction of a people, are bizarrely wedded in Night. Are we supposed to view this story as a punishment for trying to gain knowledge of God that no one should gain? Is the story of Night a Kabbalistic allegory on the fate of human beings when they overstep their reach? It is hard to reach a firm conclusion. Weisel just leaves us with nagging questions.Ultimately no one listens to Moshe the Beadle and pay with death. But Night makes us all listen, and we are privy to great secrets of life."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I've been on a WWII kick lately and I decided to give this book another chance. This is the third time I've read it. The first was in high school and I disliked it, the second was a few years ago when I started to read for pleasure and I while I thought it was better, I still didn't like it much. Now on my third time to read it, I finally like it. I think placing it in the context of WWII helps. Also now that I'm older and have experienced death of people close to me, I can better understand losing loved ones, although I'll never be able to comprehend the magnitude he went though. Finally, the first time I read it, I didn't like the fact that he seemed to lose his faith, now days I think that anyone could lose their faith suffering through this."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book in a few hours.

There have been several of these types of books released in the past few years, but I believe this is one of the better ones.

This is a very sad and informative book that I would recommend to any teenage student to read in order to understand actual events that occured in history. The interview with Oprah Winfrey shows actual footage of the record events that took place in his book. The videos on YouTube even have Elie reading passages from his book to get a better understanding of what he survived. Elie Wiesel memoir can hopefully bring awareness and help to prevent people from repeating history.In the beginning of his story Eliezer is unaware of the slow take over by the Nazi Party and the turn of events that would occur. The Jewish population were still in the dark about the menacing things the Nazi's had in store for them. Moishe the Beadle is the first to warn the people and his story was ignored. Everyone thought he was crazy because the brutal tale he told was unthinkable to them. The people of Sighet, Transylvania could not take in the insanity that was slowly surrounding them. When Elie and his family were transported to Auschwitz there was yet a second warning to the people about the evils that were about to occur. As the people are squished and left with barely any food a woman on the train notices the fire. When she screams to the people to warn them once again the warning is ignored. Elie Wiesel clearly describes the brutal attack on the woman to shut her up. Eliezer and his family are immediately separated as they enter the Auschwitz camp. A man warns Eliezer and his father to lie about their ages in an attempt to save their lives. However, he describes in detail how the harsh reality of the extermination of the Jewish people barely kept anyone alive. The Jewish people were prisoners whose lives were taken away at any given time by the Nazi police. Towards the end of the memoir it was difficult to read Eliezer watching his father get beaten and not being able to do anything about it. Elie Wiesel was so honest about his feelings about things that happened between him and his father. His memories will keep the story of the Holocaust alive."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is an excellent book that I would recommend to anybody that is looking for a nonfiction book. I read this book my sophomore year in high school and really do not think I got the full picture of it until I just read it recently for a writing class. This book really opens the reader's eye and shows how horrific these events actually were. I believe it is a very good thing that Ellie wrote this book so that everyone can see what happened in the past in order to try to prevent something like this happening ever again. The only thing that I wish he would have added to the end of the book was how it affected his life after he was out, but otherwise it was a fantastic book that I would recommend everyone to read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I know this story because my mother, Janka Festinger, was from Sighet and went to Auschwitz along with Wiesel and all the other Jews from Transylvania and she told us (my brother and I) about Auschwitz as we were growing up. We were horrified and confused...how does this happen? Well it did and we've lived with the knowledge of the Holocaust, as told by our mother, all those years growing up and as adults and then we find out, 5 years after our mother died (1994), that she had written, in 1945, a 60-page letter, 4 months after she was liberated. Yes, she told us her stories, but the letter blew us away with its unbelievable pain, raw emotion and immediacy. It was like someone talking to us from beyond the grave about the unspeakable horrors that happened just a few months before! I urge everyone to read Night, but I implore you to read, as a companion book to Night, Janka Festinger's Moments of Happiness (Amazon). As powerful as Night is, Janka's story is haunting in its raw power, an eyewitness account of those tragic times. If you read Night, you must read Janka Festinger's Moments of Happiness.

The interviewer asked Wiesel many poignant questions, including why he hadn't sought revenge for the horrors he experienced during the Holocaust. Wiesel answered: &#34;My response to the tragedy was my books.&#34; If you only read one book by this author, make it this autobiographical story of a teen-age boy who survived horrific abuse in the Nazi death camps. Although I&#8217;ve read other books by the author since then, this is the most powerful. Night is short, but it&#8217;s more engaging than books four times as long.

We did have some good discussions and my granddaughter had a good grasp for her assignments around the book. I remember all too well what went on in Nazi Germany; not personally, but because I was born in 1945 and, therefore, studied this topic when I was in school.

I think that this \\"break\\" from his hardships helped Elie to better prepare to inform his audience of his experience.Beginning his journey at age fifteen, Elie was forced from the comfort of his home to go live in the ghettos. Then, Elie traveled from the ghettos to the cold, harsh concentration camps. Throughout his time at the concentration camps, Elie and his father fortunately escape death in selection and the crematories. However, Elie's father was not able to escape death in the end. He dies of dysentery just days before the liberation of the camp.Throughout Night, certain images stay in Elie's mind. The woman on the train to the camp who yelled \\"fire!\\", the boy with the \\"face of an angel\\" who was hung, the young man who played his violin, and his father's death all impacted Elie deeply. Also, many of the important events in Night were a result of foreshadowing. When Elie's father said that \\"wearing the yellow star would not kill anybody\\", Elie journals \\"Poor father! Of what then did you die?\\". The woman on the train also foreshadows scenes of the horrific crematories when she claims that she sees fire and complains of the smell of burning flesh. Throughout Night, Elie captures his emotional and spiritual changes. So much has been taken away from him and after enduring so much, his spirit is broken. Elie stops believing in God after seeing all the pain and hurt undergone in the holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book gave me the chills and brought me to tears with its very personal and terrifying account of the unthinkable horrors of the Holocaust.

The way Mr. Wiesel re-tells his experience, I could picture everything, but I also knew that wasn't the half of it. Even though this is a short read, at times I found it diffcult to get through because my mind did not want to know anymore. However, I did finish reading it, and I plan to read 'Night' with my teen daughters over the summer."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Mr. Wiesel overcame so much for someone so young.

I found Elie Wiesel's true account of his terrifying experiences as a young teenage Jew to be all too revealing about how man can stoop to the depth's of depravity in his treatment of his fellow man. I, as well as so many Jew's wonder how such a thing can happen while the world sits and does little or nothing. I found it interesting that so many Jew's allowed themselves to be fooled that they were just being relocated or it could not happen to them. They allowed themselves to be led like lambs to the slaughter.Elie Wiesel and his father found themselves tightly dependent on one another right to the end and the end was horrible. I found that I would cry for this young boy... he was the age of my oldest brother who was in the US Navy at that time. Interestingly I, even at the age of nine at the time, I knew somewhat of what was happening at the time and wondered why nobody did anything including the Jews themselves.I have read many things that Elie Wiesel has written and I find that this is a most graphic and telling account. If there is a Hell then what happened to Elie must have taken place in Hell where the devil incarnate reigned supreme.I say to all, do not pass this account by. It is a must read if we are to say this must never happen again.

It is exhilarating and powerful writing that makes this book more enjoyable.The story's information is beautifully displayed. It is amazingly interesting rich with liveliness! Wiesel's experience in the camps is horrific and in such great detail. I like the way the information just mesmerizes you and you can't put the book down for a moment. You can learn about the death camps and it shows how we can learn about what not to do again in the future.I learned a lot from this book! If you like historical novels then you would love this! It is pulchritudinous! This memoir is a must read!!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's autobiographical account of the dark days spent in Nazi concentration camps are as vivid as they are horrific. Although many survivors of the holocaust have written their accounts of those atrocious events, none have so moved readers so intensely as Wiesel's 'Night'. Wiesel does more than just describe what happenned, he brings the reader along into the world of suffering and misery that he and his Jewish brethren were subjected to at the hands of the Nazis, may they be cursed for all eternity.This book may be small, but it tells all that Wiesel felt neccessary to be told from his experiences, from his unique point of view. In his exceptional writing style, Wiesel recounts the days of his youth, growing up a religious Jew in Transylvania, the deportation, the death camps, the crematoriom, the death marches, the conversations between Jews in those trying times and his last moments with his father.Wiesel is not out to describe in excruciating detail the unspeakable atrocities performed by the Nazis, as Primo Levi and others have done so well. Rather, his story is a personal one. A story told through the eyes of the teenaged Wiesel, struggling with his physical survival, but perhaps more importantly, struggling with his spiritual survival. He asks: How can man do this to his fellow man? Where is God in all of this? Does God even exist, and if he does, how can one glorify a God who allows such uncoscionable horrors to take place?Wiesel has grappled with these questions his entire life, and it is not his intent to answer these questions in this book. Perhaps questions such as these can never be satisfactorily answered. But there must be an awareness. An awareness of what happenned, how it happenned, and the precautions we must take so that it will never happen again.As the generation of holocaust survivors gradually pass away, this book becomes extremely relevant and crucial for all future generations to read and to never forget.Recently Oprah had a segment on her show in which she travels together with Elie Wiesel to the concentration camps, and after seeing and hearing about all the horrors, she asks 'How can you have gone through all that and still remain sane?' To which Elie responded (paraphrasing) 'Perhaps I didn't remain sane. To have gone through all that and still believe in humanity'...The messages that Wiesel conveys in this book are powerful, and although it can be excruciatingly depressing, we should all take a page out of Elie's book and still believe in humanity, despite it all."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The subject matter is so extremely sad it is hard to rate the book, because you just feel raw after reading it and I believe that indicates that it is a well written book. The book is heavy and dark, everyone should read it to know that we as people are never far from a tradegy of that magnitude happening again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel tells the autobiographical story of his painful and unimaginable survival of the Holocaust. Wiesel weaves an interesting, thought-provoking piece, which ultimately focuses on the personal responsibility - and guilt - that many were probably confronted with as a result of surviving a horror that so many others succumbed to. As a twelve year old boy, Elie's life is filled with his desire to learn more about his faith and his history. Elie's lessons on Jewish history and the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem foreshadow the pending Nazi invasion of his hometown of Romania. On hearing the news of Jews being sent to ghettos and concentration camps, Elie tries to convince his father to move, but, for Elie's family and community, the war is a distant drop in the water. However, like any drop, it's not long before the ripples begin to affect them and the Germans arrive to round them up, effectively planting the troubling seeds of guilt and doubt in Elie.As the story continues, we witness the terrifying events that happen in young Elie's life. Wiesel's glaring description magnifies every horrible detail, making it impossible for the reader to escape the words on the page without being emotionally disturbed by its content. Contrastingly, the story is told in a more informative and serious tone, rather than the irrational, emotional tone that one would expect. The tone works beautifully to help convey the horrible experiences. Faced with the horrors, it seems that Elie had no energy left to spare to being overemotional. His spirit - and faith - rapidly diminishes as he struggles to not only keep himself alive but also to help his father present the necessary image to stay alive, and later, to simply physically remain with his father.In writing this book, Elie shares a very personal and vulnerable part of himself that perhaps many survivors experienced but could not properly express. His physical pain and inner conflicts are confounded by his loss in his faith and in humanity. His anger at God and his guilt at himself for surviving when his father and so many others died cause him to inevitably question his faith and the strength of a God who could allow such horrible things to happen. One of the most powerful images is at the end when he does not recognize himself. This seems to be a common occurrence for survivors; the war has caused them to age mentally, physically and psychologically and Elie does not escape it. In the same way, he seems unable to escape his quiet burden of survival. Survival seems to be a natural human desire, yet when survival is accomplished, how can one move on if one has been ripped of everything - family, faith, even one's mere reflection? The underlying and unanswerable questions reinforce the power of Wiesel's message. The Holocaust was an experience that robbed humans on both sides of their humanity, and for that reason alone, should always be remembered so it can never be repeated."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a book that truly makes you think and feel. What happened to the Jewish people is devastatingly awful.My mom homeschools my siblings and they chose to listen to Night on audio tape. Everyone was enraptured in Elie's story wanting to know what happened to him. I think everyone should read Elie's story or hear it at some point in your life, because it makes you grateful for your own life and because everyone should know what the Germans did to the Jews. That time in history should never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I want to point out that George Guidall did a remarkable job narrating the book Night. I homeschool, and chose to do Night as one of our books for this year. My kids were horrified with what one human could do to another. It struck all of our hearts on a daily basis when we would turn on the next CD. This book is a must read. The horrific injustice the Jewish people undertook will never be forgotten and shouldn't be by anyone."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Should be required reading for . . . for everyone who can read. Puts a face, a voice, a mind, a spirit to something that is so hard to comprehend that it often can feel more like an idea than a reality. A truly moving book. Also, I would recommend the PBS documentary made about Wiesel that was produced, written and edited by David Grossbach and Rob Gardner."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Man's inhumanity to man from one who survived it.As Mr. Wiesel notes in the introduction of his book, words can not--do not--describe what it was like--must have been like--to endure man's inhumanity to man. We in this day and time can't imagine, can't begin to fathom, what Mr. Wiesel's words try to describe.The Holocaust, combined with the Russian Army's treatment of German women and with Japanese treatment of the Chinese surely must mark one of the darkest, most despicable times of man upon the earth.Where, in deed, was God?Yet, because we are still here--the Director did not come on stage and stop the play to use C.S. Lewis' imagery--there is still hope. God has not yet given up on man, but sometimes we wonder--at times like Mr. Wiesel describes--why He hasn't. He must see something, some possibility in man that we don't always see ourselves--and sometimes try very hard to hide and overcome.Mr. Wiesel's Nobel Prize acceptance, coming as it does, at the end of the book, is one of the most powerful statements ever made about man's responsibility--about our individual responsibility--to stand up for those who need our help and support.Abraham Lincoln may have said it best in his Gettysburg Address, \\"...That these dead have not died in vain....\\"Mr. Wiesel's work speaks powerfully toward that end."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This novel to me portrays the absolute depravity and madness that humanity can fall into. The beginning superbly portrays the false hope that many people had that this situation would just blow over until it was too late despite the warnings from many people that it was just beginning. The language is so heart-rending and drips with rhetoric and deep meaning that sears the soul. The authors portrayal of his loss of faith and soul is so beautiful and yet so devastating in it's simple clarity that I felt I was there with him losing my mind. The deaths of those around him and the way he explains it makes me feel like their deaths weren't in vain and are left unsullied by his beautiful words. There is only one thing I would wish for this novel and that would be for it to be longer...I was left wanting to hear more about what happened."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel is not only one of the definitve works on Holocaust literature, it is one of the most definitve works on humanity.This is a factual record of Wiesel's experiences from 1941, when the author was 12 years old, dedicated to learning Talmud and thirsting to learn Kaballah, to his experiences after Jews were forced into ghettoes and then transported to the death camps.Written in Yiddish in 1958 and translated into English in 1960.It is a record of Wiesel's childhood in the death camps of Auschwitz and Birkenau. It is dedicated to the memory of Wiesel's parents and his little sister Tzipora who were cruelly murdered in the Nazi inferno.The book is stark in it's record of everything seen by the author and asks many questions for which answers are difficult to find.It tells of the vow of Wiesel and a friend in the camp to emigrate to the Land of Israel if they survived, a dream shared by millions who died in and lived through the Shoah.Perhaps the most horrifying and moving account in the book is when the author reveals how during the first night in Auschwitz, he and his father wait in line to be thrown into a firepit. He watches a lorry draw up beside the pit and deliver its load of children into the fire. While his father recites the Kaddish, the prayer for the dead.\\" Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky.Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever.Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never\\".Elie Wiesel has been a voice of conscience in the world ever since this book became known.He has penned various other bestsellers. His Elie Wiesel Foundation For Human Rights has done valuable work in this field for many years.In a plea for the plight of his own people today, especially the youth and children of Israel today targeted by terror and forces of genocide (such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Ahmadinejad regime- as well as all who are sympathetic to these anti-Jewish elements) he penned an open letter to President Bush stating: \\"Please remember that the maps on Arafat's uniform and in Palestinian children's textbooks show a Palestine encompassing not only all of the West Bank but all of Israel, while Palestinian leaders loudly proclaim that 'Palestine extends from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, from Rosh Hanikra (in the North) to Rafah (in Gaza). Please remember Danielle Shefi, a little girl in Israel. Danielle was five. When the murderers came, she hid under her bed. Palestinian gunmen found and killed her anyway. Think of all the other victims of terror in the Holy Land. With rare exceptions, the targets were young people, children and families. Please remember that Israel--having lost too many sons and daughters, mothers and fathers--desperately wants peace. It has learned to trust its enemies' threats more than the empty promises of 'neutral' governments\\".Elie Wiesel is atrue voice of truth and conscience."},{"Title":"Night","review":"A must read so we will not forget that the civilized world swore we would not allow this to happen again. To our shame our country turned a blind eye to Rwanda and Darfur because we have forgotten.This book is a quick read, but has a long lasting impact."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel is a 120-page, first-hand account of a boy who lived through Auschwitz and Buchenwald concentration camps during the Holocaust. Wiesel published his story in Yiddish in 1958 and in English in 1960. The genre is World War II and/or a Holocaust autobiography and the reading level is 8.7.Night begins in 1941, when Elie is twelve years old. He is a studious and devout boy from Sighet, Transylvania. Despite that they were warned of the approaching German Army, the townspeople of Sighet--including Elie's family--denied that they were in reach of the Germans and years of naivety passed by.By 1944, the Germans established ghettos for the Jews in Sighet and soon after began to deport the Jews to the concentration camp in Auschwitz. In his story, Wiesel depicts how the Germans forced the Jews into cattle wagons like animals.When the train arrives at Birkenau, Elie and his mother and sisters are separated. To stay together, Elie and his father lie about their age. They are shaved, showered, given work clothes, and branded with numbers. Quickly thereafter, Elie and his father are moved to Buna, a new camp at which they both are beaten severely by the management.As a result of their experiences, the overworked and malnourished prisoners lose their faith in God. Even Elie, who was once deeply religious, after witnessing the hanging of a young boy, questions God's existence. Fortunately, Elie and his father manage to survive through the German's selection process and avoid the crematorium, a destination for prisoners unfit to work.When the Germans decide to move the prisoners away from the advancing Russian army, they begin a march during winter that claims many lives but Elie and his father manage to survive. By the end of the winter march to Buchenwald, only a dozen prisoners survive of the original one hundred, including Elie and his father.Following the trip, Elie witnesses his father's failing health and eventual death. At Buchenweld, the Germans try to exterminate all the Jews but before they can carry out their plan there is an uprising in the camp by the resistance. On April 11, 1945, American tanks liberate Elie and the others--mere corpses of what they once were before their experiences in the concentration camps.Night is a candid portrayal of the horrors of the Holocaust, short but poignant. The narrator allows the reader to see his darkest thoughts and to understand the range of emotions he felt from losing his faith to losing his family. Elie even admits his feelings of resentment toward his father when his father's health began to fail. The drive for survival provoked many to behave without compassion and Elie recognized the similarity in his own feelings toward the end of his stay at the camps. Night is a must-read story for all students/adults/parents/etc. to understand the depths of the brutality of the Holocaust and how it robbed the narrator of his family and faith. One negative aspect of Wiesel's book is the abrupt ending that leaves the reader longing for a greater sense of closure. Wiesel later found out that his elder sisters also survived the concentration camps. However, he makes not mention of this in his book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I recently read this book, Night by Elie Weise. This is a touching story that takes place back in the hard times of the holocaust. It's a true story of a young Jewish, German boy as he is taken from his home and away from his family and how this main event in history effected his life, as well as the triumphs that he went through to survive. My point of view on this book is that it's a great book that can make the toughest readers change their view or opinion on racial supremecy and or history of the holocaust itself. The emotions that i felt while reading Night are unexplainable. I felt that what was done in the past is ridicoulas and that all humans were created equally, people that have a problem with tha statement are insecure with themselves and I learned that through reading this book. The setting takes place in multiple concentration camps throughout Germany. The jewish family in which case this book follows were transported multiple times in order to stay alive. The plot of Night is that of the German family's story that has been documented throughout their hard times during the halacoust. The theme of Night is that hard times do come and you have to push your way through them. The main character in the book,(a young boy) explains to his father, the only one left living of his family that they can't allow the German nazi's to get the best of them, for thats what they want to see and hear. That's the news that they are all waiting upon hearing. Over all Night, by Elie Weisel was a great book that any kind or reader would enjoy."},{"Title":"Night","review":"For me this book was a horrifying read filled with images of destruction of life and the human soul. Wiesel's record of his experience in Auschwitz and Buchenwald caused me to question the depth of humanity's depravity towards one another. Also, you have to admire Wiesel's honesty in admitting his thoughts and the conflict he faced when dealing with his father. Most of us probably couldn't imagine doing such a thing towards our parents but when human existence has been whittled down to just surviving another day, I wonder how far we would go in Weisel's shoes.I read this book because it was referred to in an earlier book I read i.e. The Freedom Writer's Diary and I am not sorry that I read it. I recommend everyone to read it so that it might increase our awareness of what went on during the Holocaust and help us prevent similar events from happening."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I know my thinking was reshaped during middle school when I read the Diary of Anne Frank and began to read what I could about that period in history.

I read this, reliving every moment, feeling every pain that he felt.I could not put the book down and tried to get my 16 year old to read it and enter Oprah's contest in time.

I felt all the same fears, and sadness of all of those in this rich telling of Elie Wiesel's memories.

Just as (I hear) a frog placed in a beaker of water doesn't realize until too late that the temperature of the water it sits in is slowly rising to the boiling point, the Jews were slowly drawn more and more deeply into their situation. At each level, these civilized human beings could not fathom that life would get worse, and chose not to believe human beings could treat other human beings in ways it seemed they were about to be treated. They forgave their torturers even as the torture continued, and they assumed it was a mistake that would quickly be exposed and reversed. We all know now, sickeningly, they were much too kind in their opinion of their captors, until it was much too late.

This book received such glowing reviews, and here I am sayind I did not like it.First: I'm not allowd to say I even have a tiny bit scrap of an idea about what the writer (or people in the same situation) went through. Hell on Earth. A nightmare that lasts for whole months (and memories that will haunt for the rest of your days). The natural lost of faith in God (at least in the God people say that has the final saying in everything we do!). Insanity threatening to take over at every corner.But all the ordeal the writer went through does not necessarily makes him a godd writer, at least in this first book. Like \\"The Pianist\\", all the horrorful ordeal thrwon upon him by the Germans was not portrayed vividly enough here.Don't get me wrong. I was terrified while reading the book. But I just think things are not explained properly. It even seems that, \\"OK the Germans were sadistic killers of Jews. But as long as you were fit for something you were alright!\\" It's absurd, I know, and it's NOT what is written in the book and it was NOT how it was. But, somehow, that's somekind of IDEA that went through my mind while reading the book!Certainly, when you have such \\"experience\\" (hell is not an experience.... it's HELL!) you'll not loose time trying to memory all the names, dates and situtatios.

Because a 'holocaust' is a burnt offering that satisfies God. Who, it is asked, can think that the extermination of European Jewry served *any* purpose, let alone the pacification of an angry deity?Elie Wiesel, survivor of the Shoah, is known as a Nazi hunter. It would be more accurate to call him a Rememberer. Hunting down Nazis and bringing them in from cushy retirement in the four corners of the world is best understood as a subset of Wiesel's conviction that silence in the face of such barbarity - practical denial of its destructive malevolence in space and time - is the greatest sin.Night is not silence. It is dark, eloquent, hateful memory. It is sophisticated proclamation that measureless horror took place, even if we can neither mark its precise shape nor comprehend how a cultivated continent could welcome, nurture, and implement evil's Endl&ouml;sung.Night is the dark story of a young Rumanian Jewish boy's loss of nearly everything save his capacity to remember as human beings do. Wiesel was that young boy. In adulthood, he will not allow his readers to sidestep the savagery that took his family and so many of his people from him.Night falls darkly on those who remember. It blots out the tepid dusk of forgetfulness. It is more terrible than amnesia's cold comforts.Yet hope resides, barely visible, within it.Choose to read this tale of the Night."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Upon completion of this book, my mind is as numb as if I had experienced this suffering myself. So much pain and suffering are thrown at you from the pages that one cannot comprehend it all in the right perspective. One can only move forward as the victims in this book did. Step by step, page by page. Initially, numbness is the only way to deal with such anguish. Otherwise one becomes quickly overwhelmed by the images that evoke questions that cannot be answered. And yet, I read this book from the comfort of a warm home and a full stomach. Imagine the impact if it were otherwise. Imagine being forced from your home to live in barracks, living off soup and bread, forced to go outside in the winter without a jacket, and perform manual labor from dawn to dusk with the smell of a creamatorium in your backyard. How many of us could endure this for just one day, let alone, for years? What would this do to us physically and more important, what would this do to us mentally? Yet, we witness in this book the miracle of the prisoner's survival. The strength and raw endurance of the human spirit. We must be reminded of this this glorious strength, but also reminded that it was the weakness of the human spirit that inflicted these crimes on others. Humanity has the capability of extreme strength, but also of extreme weakness (which often hides under the guise of self-righteousness and need for power over others). This book is necessary in order to remind us of this. These things must not be forgotten. Read this book even if you think you have read enough of the Holocaust and of pain and suffering. Every book that I have read about the Holocaust offers something new including this one. Read it as a memorial and a tribute. Read it as a reminder of how fortunate we are to have a free society and how we must preserve this freedom at all costs. There are those who would like to take it away. Fascism is alive and well. The Post-911 world is a very important time to renew this book and am grateful to Oprah for her initiative."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The tendency, when reviewing a work such as \\"Night\\", is to heap praise upon it.

From Auschwitz to Birkenau, the central character's faith in God and his relationship with his father is tested again and again as he fought to survive. The prose is simple and yet evocative, and the author's portrayl of his relationship with his father is definitely the most moving part of the book. The problem, however, is that there is nothing here that the readers have not read about a hundred times before in other books and other forms of media. That is not the author's fault, really, as this book as published back in the fifties. But in an age where an average person is constantly inundated with a barrage of information in different forms of media, and where portrayals of violence and crime have become par for the course, this book offers no additional insights and I may have become too desensitized to be as affected by this book as I should have been.So ultimately, this book left me wanting more..."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book for a Spirituality & Literature class several years ago.

This book showed me how completely dehumanizing Nazi concentration camps were. It's one thing to learn about the showers and the ovens and the firing squads in a history book; it's quite another to know a man on his way to the ovens asked his fellow prisoners to say Kaddish for him but was completely forgotten when given extra food was given that evening.If you are interested in the past, the present, and, most importantly, the future, it's vital you read this book.

There are countless survivors of millions of different struggles. Mine has been a congenital heart disease. Many of us have a story to tell. But the underlining message here is how one man hung on to something special and dear in his heart, something more powerful that all the cruelty that was delt him could not penetrate and taint his sheild; ...\\"where god was\\". Many, obviously, did not survive the holocaust. Not because they didn't believe that god is love. And not because they didn't believe in themselves. But because a design beyond our control has a plan. Elie Wiesel knew god was with him the entire time, as with us all, always.

As you read \`Night', you find yourself cringing, eyes wide with horror, and it gives you a sick feeling in the pit of your stomach to know that innocent human beings were subjected to physical and emotional pain beyond belief. It is not graphic in the sense that there is too much information, it tells, in its simplicity, the truth of what one person experienced at one time, on this earth. Sixty years later, we believe what history has shown us of these atrocities, yet do we understand? In \`Night', Elie Wiesel attempts to make us understand. He talks about Death with a capital \\"D\\" and \\"The Selection\\" of people for slaughter. His sadness and despair during his incarceration, as well as his alarming indifference to certain things in the name of survival, permeate each page. Finally, we realize that this book is written as a tribute to his father and his father's beliefs that \\"Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented\\" and keep the memory alive, \\"Because if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices\\". So Elie Wiesel will not stay silent, and we must never forget."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I started reading \\"Night\\" a couple months ago and it was so heavy, I had to put it down and take a break before continuing. Life went on as it has a habit of doing, and today I picked the book back up without any intention beyond reading a breath at a time.I think because of the backdrop of my own life-experience as of late, I was pretty numb during the reading, but what I noticed were silent tears leaking out of my eyes. A recent phenomenon for me, when there is so much emotion yet almost placid emotion. Hard to put into words.The writing is so precise, so clear it makes the story that much more accessible for the reader. There are no histrionics there is simply \\"this happened\\" with explanation and vivid descriptions for us to become a part of the atrocities that occurred themselves.It is almost like a book-length poem.I want to read it again. Maybe I will wait seven days and read it again. Its shortness would make it about an hour read if I just sat and read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is a page turner in that this mans journey through hell and back is just unfathomable. God bless him! This gentle soul, is just an amazing writer in which he can take his readers along a virtual life path in order to relive his life from when he was a young boy until the end of World War II. The deception that hid in plain sight was what really took me back. Who could ever have even imagined that mankind be so evil. Hell on earth doesn't come close to describing what this yound boy went through. It makes one think. Mr. Elie Weisel has that special gift and quality as a writer in describing his inner most thoughts and feelings as he somehow some way survives it all. What an amazing book. Thank you."},{"Title":"Night","review":"For some reason - as a man - I am always reluctant to read or recommend books from Oprah's Book Club.However this is a title that I feel no shame or stigma in doing so.\\"Night\\" is the perfect memoir. - It has an incredible story to tell and the way its told is lean, direct and fast paced.In reading it I gained a much better understanding of the holocaust experience, and a better appreciation for the Jewish faith.I would recommend this title to anyone. Everyone."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is not a commentary on the holocaust or politics. I realize that giving a book like this a poor review may offend many people but I am merely evaluating it as a book.There are have been numerous accounts of the holocaust and exceptionally detailed footage of the Nazis' atrocities (many footage was filmed by the Nazis themselves) over the past 60 years or so. I decided to give \\"Night\\" a try given its popularity. Unfortunately, it was mostly a disappointing read. The writing is dry and merely chronicles the events that the author experienced in 1944-45 during the Nazi occupation of Eastern Europe. It is a short book that covers an important year in Nazi concentration camps. The events, of course, are gruesome but the author's writing has no soul. The book reads almost like a series of events like dot points in a presentation. He recounts the events in a robotic manner.In order to evoke human emotions , the author needed to develop his humanity and those around him first. There are some parts where he is more reflective and analytical which I enjoyed more. For example, he examines hi s desire to abandon his father and is instantly ashamed by the thought. He also briefly touches on his discomfort when years later tourists dropped coins in the water so that poor natives could dive for it. Similarly, people would throw pieces of bread towards the prisoners and watch them fight for the crumbs. He touches on the times when self preservation and survival trump morality even in the most ethical people. These were the more interesting and reflective parts of the book which I wished he had discussed more deeply."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I cried the first time I read this autobiographical novel. My reaction was the same this time around. Elie Wiesel was only 14 years old when he was sent to a concentration camp. His poignant account details how his world was marginalized, bit by bit. First, he and his family were sent to live in the large ghetto, followed by a move to the small ghetto. Then, he and his father were separated from his mother and his sisters as he was sent from one increasingly bad concentration camp to another, culminating in his eventual rescue. Wiesel details how he and the other Jews were dehumanized until they reached the point that each was only concerned about his own survival and even family ties were no longer important. This was a horrid period in history that is brought into vivid life in this short but powerful book. This should be recommended reading for all as it is an eloquent portrayal of man's inhumanity against man and should be a reminder to all of what has already happened and unfortunately could occur again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Because Elie Wiesel was 15 years old when he entered a concentration camp with his family, his account offers us a view that is unique and free of adult presumptions. Before the arrest and transport of Elie's family (father, mother, 3 sisters and Elie), Wiesel was maturing and finding his place in an observant Jewish community. He was idealistic and hopeful.As a result, his memory of the year that he spent in concentration camps before liberation by the Allies is described without distortion of a political, or otherwise jaded, lense. He tells about the daily experiences without superimposing motivations when he did not know them. He does not analyze or provide subjective explanations. He simply lays out the horror and his reactions.Thus, he believably gives readers the opportunity to see for themselves this - most hideous - part of the world's history. He asks questions that we can contemplate, but he does not provide answers that cannot be known. Where is God in the midst of suffering? What are the limits of faith and selflessness? When can we do nothing but strive for self-preservation?This is a seemingly objective and well-written account of life in a very important place and time. A must read for anyone who wants to put some historical and psychological perspective into their world view.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I decided to buy the book and it opened my eyes to the horrors that afflicted so many during the Holocaust. My understanding of the human spirit is all the greater for having read this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is an unforgettable work in which Elie Wiesel shares his horrific experiences of the Holocaust. What can one even say about these beyond dreadful experiences that Elie Wiesel endured? As you read this, you will to some extent share in his agony. If you aren't too familiar with what the Holocaust was like, this will surely give you a feel for it -- a terrible feel. Night is one book that you will remember for a long time. This book will touch you deeply. It's more of an experience than a \\"read.\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel was removed from his home as a mere teenager when German soldiers took his Jewish family away from Transylvania and into the night. Elie, who was separated from his mother and sister at the dreaded concentration camp of Auschwitz, was forced to survive on his own in this new, terrifying world. Throughout Night, Elie Wiesel demonstrated the strength of his book and influenced you to enjoy the powerful writing of his book.Night is a true account of Elie Wiesel's life and how the German Nazis metamorphosed the Jewish people into objects and property with no hope of surviving. On just the first night of their arrival at Auschwitz, his mother, sister, and all of the other women and children were thrown into a fire and burned alive. The men, who watched this terrible procedure, were kept alive and forced to pull heavy slabs of stone on small carts while only getting fed a small ration of bread and water once a day. As I was reading this book, I could feel the Jews hopelessness and severe sadness running through me because I could tell that the Jews hope of surviving was the chance of me pulling a needle out of a haystack.Night was a terrifying story of the horror that the Germans made the Jews undergo after deliberately taking them from their homes and changing them from humans into objects with no feelings or hope. Although Night was an extremely sad book, I liked it because it was so powerful, and Elie Wiesel made the reader realize and understand what really happened during the horrifying years of the holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book hit the bottom of my stomach like a brick. It is a very short book but VERY powerful. It is on my best list. It is an easy read but I will never forget it. I would like for everyone to read this at some point in time. It gives you a feeling of appreciation for what you have no matter how litlle it is. Worth your time and recommendations to others. Please read!!!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"What to say about \\"Night\\" that has not already been said? For many of us, this book will move us more powerfully than anything else we ever read. I was most touched, and not in a pleasant way, by a passage early on that depicts father and son walking into Auschwitz for the first time, believing that they are about to be burned alive. Wiesel describes how the mind doubles back on itself in times of incomprehensible horror, refusing to believe what it sees, yet unable to look away.This book frustrates what I believe is a particularly American urge to snatch some glimmer of hope from even the jaws of profound misery. It's extremely difficult, for me at least, to acknowledge that for most of us, our courage, our dignity, our kindness, everything that makes us human, can be stripped away until there is nothing left but the animal will to survive. It's almost impossible for me to acknowledge that people can, have, and will continue to suffer beyond all reason, only to be tossed like garbage into unmarked graves. There is still a desire to close off and protect ourselves from the unvarnished despair of some survivors' stories. \\"Night\\" challenges us to listen without speaking. To bear silent witness. And finally, when evil visits us again, to be brave enough to not stand idly by. I'll end with an old refrain:Question: \\"Where was God in Auschwitz?\\"Answer: \\"Where was Man?\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"These tragically pitiful words summon the inordinate power of this small book NIGHT by Elie Wiesel. Everyone knows the story of the Nazi concentration camps: No one knows the story of the Nazi concentration camps. Novels, films, photographs, poems, speeches, tours of sites all try to give some idea of the gripping tragedy of the genocide and the deplorable conditions that befell the victims of the camps, but nothing does it as well as this deeply moving account by Wiesel.The reasons are many. Not only does Wiesel tell his story in the simplest of language without cluttering the facts with gory details: the facts themselves are atrocious enough and when told through the words of a 16-year old boy who entered the camps from his life as a spiritually devout Jew in Sighet, Transylvania that gradually metamorphosed into a challenged believer who felt God and mankind had deserted both his ailing father and him, the impact is overwhelming.Wiesel's writing is at once eloquent and harrowing and his descriptions of survival through the camps at Auschwitz, Buna, Birkenau, and Buchenwald searingly become imprinted on our minds. Every reader may think these facts are redundant but they can never be retold often enough. Even as we read this book there are occurrences in various places throughout the globe TODAY that resurrect the atrocities herein described. And in reading the Nobel Peace Prize statement by Elie Wiesel that closes this book we are bound to fight against the hate that allows such exploding carbuncles.This is a book that should be read by everyone, globally. In it lies our only hope that history will not continue repeating itself. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Grady Harp, July 06"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night, by Elie Wiesel, is a story based on a Jewish boy's experience in several concentration camps during the Holocaust. Elie is brought to the camps with his family and is eventually separated from his mother and two sisters. He will have to spend the rest of his survival with his father. At such a young age, Elie is faced with life-threatening obstacles, tragedies and maturity in order to keep himself alive and make it through this ghastly journey and face the grim conditions of the winter that lay ahead.After going hungry and sitting through harsh torture during a cold winter, a conspicuous lesson is easily learned through reading this literary memoir: do not give up hope even during the hardest of times. Although Elizer struggles with his faith in humanity and in God, he is able to keep his head held as high as possible in order to withstand this bitter part of his life.I especially enjoyed this book because I was able to connect with the background of the story, being that I am Jewish. I find the study of the Holocaust and stories from survivors about their involvement in the concentration camps to be fascinating, yet horrifying to think about. To know that humans were treated the way Elie Wiesel describes them to be is shocking and chilling. I'd like to commend Elie Wiesel for having enough courage in order to write and share this alluring piece of literature with the world because to look back and regain memory of such a crestfallen moment in time is a difficult task to process. He looked back and realized how distraught all these innocent Jews were and was amongst the millions who were captured and is so blessed to be apart of the few thousand who survive. Being in that position, you can only help but feel bad and guilty that you made it to the finish line and so many loved ones did not."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Great insight into a horrible time in our history! Saw him on Opra. I will try to pick up his other books."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a brilliantly written, tightly woven narrative of unconscionable evil. My reaction to the book was, How could we, as a global community, ever have allowed this to happen to another human being? Nevertheless, I am grateful that Elie Wiesel survived to tell his story. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Amazing book, even though it is sad to learn all the devil like human beings can become, it also amazes me how man kind can endure such cruelty and torture. Made me appreciate what we are, were we live and what we have. We must not forget what happened."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Wonderful.

I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE BUT SMALL CHILDREN."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is full of heart break and sadness. Perhaps it's more saddening because these are real accounts of the holocaust. However, though this book is at some points very saddening, it's at tremendous read. And I recommend this book to anyone especially if they are seeking to read a holocaust book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Incredible true story! The suffering the Jews went through and some survived is a testament to mankind and what we can go through and come out stronger."},{"Title":"Night","review":"It's difficult to say a piece of this anguish and depth was beautiful, but it was. It was written almost poetically, poetically in the sense that the truest poems cause one to cry, to labor, to desire to fix what is broken in the world. How Mr. Weisel demonstrates kindness in any form supersedes my understanding. While he questions his God, I wonder if it is only his God who could have sustained him after a series of such torment. Our children need to read it. They need to feel compassion for those who have suffered the inhumanity of a brutal world."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Good book if you have never read any first person account of the Holocaust, however, many of the experiences in \\"Night\\" are not very detailed and It may be because the writer was 15 during his time in the camp. Whe I say detailed, it's not meant in the graphic nature of what happened, but rather the thoughts and feelings that accompanied the experiences. True, there are \\"descriptions\\" of how he felt in losing family members, but with the exception of a few instances, many accounts are related very matter of factly. Also, the lack of description makes this feel like a \\"just the facts\\" of what happened book. For instance, when getting new clothing, he gets a striped outfit. It other books I've read, namely \\"Rena's Promise\\" (which was EXCELLENT and a far superior read), she describes what it was like to get old, used, clothing and was that a moth hole....no...it was a bullet hole. And...You get the point. It's much more descriptiove than just saying 'clothes'.I'm not discounting this book. There are several experiences in there that will stay with you and each person's story on what personally happened to them will be different.I do want to comment about reviewer alluding that this may be a work of fiction because of extreme coincidences. (Meeting a former prisoner years later on the streets of Paris and remembering a very brief encounter in the camp.) While there's no doubt that the author was in the camp, I feel that again, it is the lack of details in this book that fail to tie loose ends. For example, calling a prisoner a faceless one because he didn't see him, yet at the same time getting upset with him and \\"looking\\" right at him. But after looking at him, he still calls him faceless. Why? Was that the name that stuck? Was he in the infirmary bandaged up? Unfortunately, there is no answer.While I do believe that every experience is worth telling and worth reading, if you are going to read just one book on the subject, by all means make it \\"Rena's Promise\\". It is VERY well researched, well documented, and unlike \\"Night\\", when the book is over, you get to read what happened to some of the individuals after the war was over."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Have forwarded to members of family.Everyone should read and heed!

In fact, I find myself more moved every time I read it.I've read many accounts of the Holocaust, but Wiesel's is by far one of the most moving.I'd love to explain what it is that moves me so much, but it's hard to place a finger on it.Perhaps its the eloquent way of telling such horrific events. Maybe its the tragic events themselves... I really can't tell you for certain. But regardless, this is a must read not only because it has been accepted almost as a classic non fiction work, not only because of the difficult subject matter that we must study in order to not repeat the mistakes of the past, but because it is an account of the human spirit's ability to survive tragedy and horror."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is very moving; having just traveled to Auschwitz and Auschwitz Birkenau where I learned of Elie Wiesel.

Very powerful."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I wanted to know more about atrocities on Jews, so I picked up this book. The story is narrated by a young Jew boy, who along with his family is taken to German concentration camps. The story gives insight of the concentration camps in which Jews were kept. Jews were not even given adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical attention. Several Jews died because they did not have adequate clothing to protect themselves from severe cold. Physically weak such as babies, old and sick were burned alive, because they could not contribute in the camps harsh physical work. It is unbelievable that all this inhumanity occurred in the twentieth century. I was touched by the writer's message at the end of the book:\\"We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented\\".Overall \\"Night\\" is a quick read.

One of the most striking points was how pleasant and polite the Germans are when they first arrive at the small town of Sighet, followed by the escalation that goes from curfew for the Jews, obligatory wearing the yellow star, through to the corralling into ghettos before being transported to the camps. When Wiesel arrives at Birkenau, one of the first scenes is dead children being thrown into flames to dispose of their bodies. Another poignant point is that, whereas you might have expected him to be on his own in the camps, his father is never far away until towards the end. It somehow makes all the suffering appear that much worse."},{"Title":"Night","review":"What would you do if you saw your friends and neighbors die before your own eyes?

The theme of the loss of God -- or, to use Nietzsche's terminology, which Wiesel invokes as well, the death of God -- runs throughout this book. This is a story -- THE story -- of the dark night of the human soul that modern man has taken upon itself. God is dead -- but, as the author of the introduction eloquently tells us: there is a Resurrection."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read the book and then read it again.

The events of this story are well known, but to read them as told in Night, was like watching a horrific accident that you just can't turn away from. I found myself gasping at his telling of events, and questioning myself, \\"would I do the same in that positon?\\". I could form the images in my mind and they stayed with me well after finishing the book. This is a wonderful book, very sad, but very worth the read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Other reviewers have described the content of this book. My ability to discuss these events is very limited b/c I wasn't there. The only way I can approach something this enormous is to write about the process of destruction, as in this poem:Fire and Ice by Robert FrostSome say the world will end in fire,Some say in ice.From what I've tasted of desireI hold with those who favor fire.But if it had to perish twice,I think I know enough of hateTo say that for destruction iceIs also greatAnd would suffice.I personally believe the Holocaust epitomized destruction in both fire and ice at the same time. It took hatred to the extremes in both directions, both of violent passion and of indifference. That is a virtually unsurvivable combination. It is also possible to have more than one cycle of destruction in fire.However, the term \\"Holocaust\\" denotes destruction in fire, and the poem describes sequential destruction, first in fire and then in ice. At this point, the historical reality of the Holocaust can't be changed by anyone. A tragic reality is that this book and others like it are still needed. No matter what people have gone through, individually or as part of a group/people, they may still face the \\"ice\\" of indifference. Like enforced drowning in freezing water, the effects of indifference can be fatal:We have lingered in the chambers of the seaBy sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brownTill human voices wake us, and we drown."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I first read this book because it was an assignment in high school. I adored the way it was written...it sounded raw and real and although it is about 100 pages...it spoke volumes.I came away from the book changed...seeing history in a different light and writing a paper on Juliek(who touched my heart).So this month I started reading the book again and was just as amazed. I think that it seemed shorter this time...but the depth comes from themes of family,friends, relationship to God. Things that sound simplistic yet take on a deeper meaning in the face of tragedy.The father son relationship is very notable. Elie can't bear to be seperated from his father and is pained we he can't help save his life... I won't say much more about it.Three paragraphs is not enough to talk about this book.

Yet, I absolutely love the author, Elie Wiesel.I want to pronounce his name correctly and I've listened to his speech and read his speech called 'The Perils of Indifference' many times.

The selection. The march toward the chimneys looming in the distance under an indifferent sky. The infants thrown into fiery ditches...I did not say that they WERE ALIVE, but that was what I thought.

The story is told by the son, years after the end of World War II. The boy, Eliezer, has a lot of respect for his father who is a leader in the Jewish Community. Eliezer is very religious and finds a teacher who teaches him a lot about God.His teacher is taken away with many other Jews. After awhile the teacher comes back. He tries to tell everyone what happened to him. Nobody believed him and they thought that he was crazy. They thought that the things he said were too terrible to be true. Even Eliezer didn't believe him.Eliezer and his family were taken to the camp. He tries to stay with his father. After everything he sees he starts to change. Things like his beliefs and the way he sees things. He sees things that he doesn't ever want to do. Then, later he ends up doing them. He sees people that used to be very close. Then, they end up being separated because they don't want to look out for each other. They wanted to take care of themselves. Eliezer didn't want that to happen to himself and his father. He didn't want to be alone.One thing that stuck out to me was when they reached the camp. Families were being split apart. They were being separated, men turn one way and women turn the other. Eliezer went with his father. His mother and sisters went the other way. It took only an instant but it changed their lives.At the time, Eliezer was still just a kid. He saw things differently than the way he saw them later. There are things that he did at the time without thinking about them. Later, he thinks about what he did and since he is older he has a different point of view. Some of the things he saw and did will change him. There are things that he will remember for the rest of his life."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Do you know how hard it was for Elie Wiesel to survive devastating, life changing events? The book Night shows you the way of life for a Jewish young man during World War II. In 1944 Wiesel was captured by the Germans and taken to the concentration camp at Auschwitz. Auschwitz was one of the most brutal concentration camps ever maintained. In Night you will learn first hand what happened to people in the German concentration camps.Wiesel's story made me feel sorry for the people that had to go though Auschwitz, many of whom never made it out. The people in the camps were on the brink of starvation, with food rations consisting of only small portions of soup and occasionally some bread. I gained a whole new and difficult perspective on what happened to the Jews during World War II and many other people during Adoft Hitler's reign.Prior to reading Night, I did not think about the people who lost their families and lives. Families were ripped apart, often loosing contact with loved ones forever through death. Reading this book will cause one to be more grateful for the family that he has, realizing that often family is taken for granted. Elie Wiesel's case, he was separated from his mother and sisters, and his only family contact remaining was with his dad, who was eventually killed.Wiesel's account of his experiences shows us what really happened in the mid 1940s during World War II. Throughout this book you will discover a part of world history that is dark, sad, and full of cold blooded murder. I would highly recommend that reading this book to gain perspective on history and the tragedy of Hitler's reign."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Mohammad A.The book Night is the story of a fifteen year old boy named Elie Wiesel, and his experience through the horrible and painful times he went through in the Holocaust. In the beginning of the story, life for him was ok and had no problems, although as the war goes, it also affects his life too. As he gets older he gets interested in learning about the law and wants to get closer to God. He starts to learn from a teacher, Moshe the Beadle. Every day he goes to Moshe to talk about the law and ask hard heading questions. One day Moshe ends up being deported for being an emigrant. In a couple weeks Moshe comes back and warns the people of what lies ahead of them and what trouble is coming. The people of the town think he is a lunatic and is just saying stuff, so no one believes him.In a couple of weeks some trucks come by and pick up all the Jewish people that live in their neighborhood and separate them from boys and girls. Most of them were separated from their families. So as Elie is taken, he and his dad are on their way to the concentration camps. On their way, no one knows what is going on, most of them think they're going on a vacation when all of a sudden a women starts to scream and yell about the fires and the burning flesh that she sees. No one else can see it so they beat her to shut her up.As they arrive at the concentration camp, they see that it is something no one had ever expected. They end up seeing the horrible and tragic deaths of many people. They are either being hanged or burned in the pits. During the concentration camps they also have another threat besides the Nazis. In the camps if you want to stay alive, then you would have to sleep with one eye open. In the end Elie and makes it out, but does he see his family again?"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Have you ever read a book that gives you a first hand look at the Holocaust? This book does, it is a great true story about a teenage boy named Elie Wiesel who goes through many difficult trials during the Holocaust. He explains in great detail what happens to him over days, months, and years during which he is in a concentration camp. Through out the whole entire story you can actually imagine in a way see everything that is going on! Elie Wiesel does a great job describing everything he saw. I actually felt that I was actually there, because of all the description he puts into the story.Night had a huge impact in me because it lets you know everything that happened in the Holocaust. It made me very sad during most of the story but in the end he comes out alive and is rescued by Russian soldiers. I thought it was a great story for older kids because there are some gruesome parts in the story like when the people get shot or when they get beat up. One part of the story that impacted me the most was when he wrote how the Nazis used Jewish babies as targets for machine guns.In the beginning of the story Elie introduces us to his family. He talks about how normal it was before he and his family were taken to a concentration camp. As soon as they get near the concentration camp his family is torn apart, his mom and sister go one way and he and his dad go to another. In the story Elie talks about how the people were killed- gas chambers, shootings and dying from just plain starvation and being overworked. He explains how his dad, other Jews and himself passed every day in the concentration camp. He and his dad survive a lot of selections (when they pick the people they will gas or in other words kill). We KNOW Elie survives the Holocaust but does his dad? His mom? His sister? To find out read this book!!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"No wonder Ellie Wiesel got a Nobel Peace Prize for \\"Night\\", a riveting memoir of his childhood nightmare! Ellie Wiesel is a survivor of the horrific acts that were committed against the Jews in the Holocaust. The Holocaust started in 1933 when a man named Adolf Hitler took power and lead a group called the Nazis into Germany. They did awful things to Jews, handicaps, and prisoners of war. Ellie takes us through every experience he had and what he had to go through to survive.It's disgusting to think that the human race could be so sick as to the way they treat these normal, innocent people. The story begins when Ellie and his family are forced to move into the ghettos. They don't get much time until they have to move in to the terrible camp called Auschwitz. Ellie gives us very descriptive words to help us imagine what it was actually like sitting in the cattle car on the long journey to the camp.Although readers expect a happy ending, they soon realize that their is not one good thing that happens to he and his dad. In fact, early on the book, Ellie and his father are separated from his mother and his three sisters.They were forced go through several harsh and intense selections. These selections were meant to organize the strong healthy prisoners from the weak helpless ones.It's very hard to realize that this young boy and his father had to see people being put on the gallows, being burned in fires, and hear that hundreds were killed in the gas chambers the night before. Unfortunately Eliezer's relationship with God is strained by the constant torture he is put through every day. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the Holocaust and what happened at the time.-Danika Craft"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Absolutely amazing!! That is exactly how I would explain the book Night. Right in the beginning, Elie is living his life like any ordinary person. Little did he know in a few months he was going to be heading to a concentration camp with his family battling between life and death. On the way to the concentration camp, he sees a frightening sight of babies being thrown into chambers. As he comes closer to the scene, he fears it is the end for him. Only one more step left until the start of his suffering. All of the sudden, he hears a fierce voice cry out an order to turn away from the chamber. A wave of relief calms him down, it eases him just enough to assure him that there is still hope of getting through the torture. Months into the time period, he is determined to leave this tormenting nightmare but he knows to himself that the chances are scarce of anything getting better. The first day was just a movie trailer; the film had yet to be started. As the months go by, the weaker Elie gets. He is transported from place to place in carts with hundreds of people in the same area. Towards the end, during the evacuation, everyone has to run out of Buna. Elie through great difficulty makes it through the devastating run by the support of his father surviving. They are lucky enough to rest for a little while but they have to get back up and continue running. Once they reach the camp, they find out they will be let free. Elie's mind is flooded with thoughts but his main focus is getting his father to survive. He sacrifices his small rations of bread he receives for his father. Elie's father doesn't have the appetite to eat that much food but Elie forces him to eat as much as he can. It's evident that Elie wants his father to live so he can see the world waiting for them outside. He wants him to live outside where there are no restrictions on what he's allowed to do, or how much he gets to eat. This book is full of suspense in all sorts of ways. The writing style just urges you to keep reading on. For someone who is not a big fan of reading to read this book with full interest and have to regret to have to put it down does show a lot of how good of a book this is. It also gives us a lesson of how wrong the events happening were. The book definitely gives us a heads up to not wait when something wrong, like what happened in the book, is happening and to put a stop to it right away. Just imagining the suffering is enough to catch our attention. Overall, this book is a great book and definitely recommended for reading."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Today we know of the horror of the Holocaust; there is even a museum honoring those who suffered through it. However, Night gives us an insight into what it would have been like to actually have been a Jew during that time period. Throughout this awe-inspiring book, Elie Wiesel labors to produce an accurate account of his emotions as he endured the tortures of the concentration camp Auschwitz.Night is a record of Wiesel's experiences at the hands of the Germans, but instead of focusing on the historical relevance, he intimately exposes his own changing character and that of those around him. Elie is a fifteen-year-old Jew, raised in his faith in a jewish community. As the book progresses, Elie's character hardens, his spirit becomes close to breaking, and his faith in God wavers, and then dissolves. The honesty and powerful language of the book make the book even more moving.In the beginning, we see the gradual imposition of Germans' rules in Wiesel's until it becomes a ghetto. The Jews are not afraid until they are transported to Auschwitz. Then the attitudes of the Jews change, becoming harder and angrier. An example of this was when they were being transported, and woman started screaming to look at a non-existent fire. The Jews struck her, bound her, and gagged her. Their fear made them behave very different from before the Germans abused them. After anger came hopelessness. We see through Wiesel's eyes the way the Jews begin to welcome death and struggle to have faith in God despite all the wickedness around them. Wiesel himself lost his faith and he rebels against God, yet, deep inside, feels empty without Him.This book is not a frivolous adventure story. It is a horrifyingly true account of the miseries experienced by Jews in concentration camps. Wiesel tells of Germans killing children, and how many people froze to death, and many other appalling offenses the Jews were subjected to. This book will cause readers to never look at the world around them the same again; they will feel grateful that they can live as free people and mourn the fact that humans are capable of such evilness.By: Jaclyn Warwick"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought it was a very good book and very hard sometimes to read because of the tough subject.

I finished reading the book with an even more understanding of how it felt to be tortured and a hero at the same time."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In this autobiographical tract, nobel prize winner, Elie Wiesel, now a much revered and admired figure in Western culture, tries to write down his memories in the form of a novel of the time he spent in hell. As is true of most survivors of the holocaust, Wiesel was puzzled by his own survival. However, he was not puzzled by what his survival meant: It meant that he had to \\"bear witness\\" to one of the most malevolent horrors in human history. And as is the case with any experiences too large for the human brain to get its mind completely around, Wiesel had to understand its cause; invent the language needed to describe his experiences; and had to warn against any future occurrences.This short book, in the form of a story about a teenage Jewish boy named Eliezer, gives the alphabet of the language and the paradigm of horrors of which the Nazi holocaust is the best and scariest example. It is about how this 17-year old teenager, along with his father, was transported from a small Transylvanian town to Auschwitz; and about the horrors they both experienced there. It is how, after arguing with God, Eliezer finally lost faith completely and how, thereafter, he was sustained only by his ability to care for his father. It is a poignant story that we have seen repeated many times by other holocaust survivors, but this one is different in that it is a poetic attempt to get at the general underlying causes and reasons for this and other holocausts.Part of the process of developing a language for understanding the meaning of the European holocaust lies in understanding the meaning of Nazism and Hitler's design for a \\"Juden-free\\" world. Behind Hitler's war, like what is behind the war today in contemporary American politics, was also a \\"war of cultures\\" -- one not directed against individual Jews per se, but against Jewish culture as a whole. Given that Hitler took many of his cues from the American led Eugenics program, as well as from the previous 1500 years of Christian wars waged against Jewish religion and culture; it is not only not fanciful or not too off-base, but would be remiss not to suggest that racism and Christianity go hand in hand; or to suggest further that along with America's self-described impulse towards cultural hegemony (which has the name of American Exceptionalism), that among nations of the Western World, the U.S. is probably the one most primed to repeat the Nazi experiment.And while it has not been the author's desire or intent to make such a connection between the U.S. and Nazi Germany, the implications linger heavily in the air and speak loudly and palpably in the subtext for themselves. Like Nazi Germany, the U.S. has become a brittle, frightful, race-based culture, that is afraid of its own contradictory self-image, afraid of future demographics, its declining place in the world and in its declining ability to affect world events. Domestically, the U.S. has a facade of being democratic, fair, just and open-minded, but not only do the social statistics and mean-spirited politics not bear this self-promoting self-image out, but also one only needs to scratch just beneath the surface to see all the other predicates of genocide extant in U.S. culture: a mean-spirited, racist, insecure cultural underbelly. And arguably, it is in the currents of this underbelly that the seeds are being sowed for another holocaust.And while it is unlikely that the American version of a racial holocaust will ever be repeated in exactly the same way as that which occurred in Nazi Germany, America is not a virgin when it comes to racial holocaust of its own making. The extermination of Native Americans occurred seamlessly in American history and still stands as stark testimony to the U.S. ability to turn racial theories into cruel and deadly racist practice.So if the author's messages and warnings mean anything at all, they mean that the paradigm embedded within American culture remains palpably present and active. Contemporary American politics, even with a mulatto president at its head, is a veritable cauldron of racist tensions and demagoguery, in which the scapegoating of racial minorities (such as is the case with recent Mexican immigrants) has become little more than a blood sport.Here, Wiesel teaches us (as well as does the history of Nazi Germany), that once the \\"targeted other\\" has been thoroughly dehumanized and collective societal inhibitions have been lowered sufficiently, then only a \\"trigger\\" is need to change previous highly cultured societies into predatory genocidal racist beasts. Given all of the things that single us out as being an \\"unstable racial democracy,\\" it would be foolish to ignore all the existing parallels between the U.S. and Post-Wiemar Germany? Five Stars"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is one of the most crucial books ever written for both the history of and the future of humanity.The experiences Elie Wiesel went through during the Holocaust so painfully detailed in this book evoke such strong heart wrenching emotion, they are at the very least, a call for humanity to make sure this NEVER happens again.His memories are so vivid of the tortures he witnessed, BABIES thrown up in the air by Nazi's and shot as target practice right in front of their parents. The savage living hell he experienced reaches the core of my being. How CAN human beings do this to other human beings?Elie Wiesel has won many medals of honor for his direly needed, tireless work to ensure that humanity remembers. I have read many books on the Holocaust, and have been to concentration camp Buchenwald, and have seen the ovens that burned people alive with my own eyes. This book is a living testament to what some people deny ever happening. \`Night' MUST be required reading in schools, so that the savage brutality brought upon innocent people, parents and their children lives in the minds of those who will one day rule nations.There is not another book I have read about the Holocaust that details with pure, raw, vivid images and memories as NIGHT does. This is not just a book. The very future of humanity depends on remembering Elie's eyewitness accounts and beyond inhumane experiences. I believe that because of this book, humanity will make sure this never happens again.PS: It would be nice if Reviewer:What can I say?, February 1, 2006Reviewer: Delmonico Brown (Los Angeles, CA)Didn't plagiarize my review almost verbatim."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This story just failed to really make me want to read until I was done with the story I would not suggest this to any of my friends it just failed on every level.It is not a great approach to the whole story line and I did not care for the book at all."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Years ago there was a lot of hoopla about this book. I never bothered to read the book at that time since the subject matter was not my cup of tea or the fact that Elie Wiesel doesn't impress me that much. Elie always came across to me as a self-pitying, whining, and perhaps even a little hypocritical kind of guy. Although lately I do give him credit for the influence he has had on preventing the Darfur crisis from getting worse.So what caused me to impulsively buy this book at the bookstore the other day? I noticed that book is only 120 pages long! I figured that for me that would be a manageable read considering the subject matter. So first I looked at the Preface and the Foreword. Since I too have recently got a book self-published that is a translated work, perhaps I could learn something new about translation.Well anyways, earlier today I finished reading the book and noticed that the book is flawless in that there are no typos or grammatical errors. That is nice. Elie uses some Jewish religious terms throughout that are not in my dictionary, but that is alright. There are also some German words that are not in my German-English dictionary, but that is ok. Perhaps they were just concentration camp words that don't need to be in a common dictionary.Perhaps his Nobel Peace Prize Acceptance Speech at the end of the book could have been left out. That seemed a little political. After all, there was a Cold War going on at the time and the West were the good guys. So he had to knock one against Chile? Why not North Korea too? Yes, it is a relief that South Africa today is no longer burdened with Apartheid but let's hope it doesn't end up like Rhodesia; or how about the 3,000 white farmers who have since been murdered simply due to jealousy or revenge? I hear that the whites there now have to contend with reverse racism via a variety of racial quotas in hiring, etc. I somehow had the impression that Elie thinks he can eliminate suffering and solve all of the world's problems; how unrealistic and immature. In the Preface he mentioned how infants were thrown live into the fiery ditches; now how is that so very different from today where partial-birth abortion or in China and India where infanticide is commonplace?The quality of the English in this book is superb. For that reason, perhaps I should give it 5 stars. But the subject matter is gruesome and I am not sure I would recommend it to someone under the age of 18. I don't think I will read the book a second time, once is enough. I still think that of the four Holocaust books I've read, Miep Gies's book \\"Anne Frank Remembered\\" is the best. I can't believe that book hasn't sold better than it has.There were some places in the book I almost cried and other places in the book I found myself snickering at Elie's depiction of particular scenes. I wonder if my snickering is ok relating to this subject matter and I also noticed that whenever I see Elie on T.V., he seems to be a humorless fellow. I find that a little disconcerting. Was it Elie's intention that some scenes in his book would be somewhat amusing? I've seen some Holocaust survivors on T.V. who have a great sense of humor despite everything they've experienced.I'm still impressed that Elie, Marion, and Jerome Lindon were able to condense all of this information into just 115 pages!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I purchased this book so I could follow along with the class that I work in, but the book was not exactly the same.

As it is with mercy, the width of the basket is greater than the width of the ball. The forgiveness we know occurs when a shot is less than perfect, but good enough to score a point. Mercy means that the shot need not be perfect, but that it only needs to be good enough. If the ball does not go through the hoop, then no point is scored. The score is restricted according to justice, remaining the same. Win or lose, the game revolves around how many times the ball goes through the net. Thus, it is such that where mercy abounds, so does lawlessness. Shots may be less than perfect, but as a team can win a baseball game despite having fewer hits than the opposing team, it is the same way with mercy.Gd gave us freewill. Thus, there is an element of chance in life, and this arises from Gd, that is, freewill is gift of mercy from Gd. Without mercy, the soul of a human is as that of a golem, an automaton. In freewill, Gd gave us both the ability to forgive each other, and to forsake. Consider the mercy of God when you read Night. Does this mercy cause you to lose faith in Gd or to gain faith Gd? It causes me to gain faith in Gd for I know that in the Torah, Gd gave me a blueprint of how I should act. If the mercy of Gd is so great that Night could be true, then, how much more should our fear of Gd be if we do not act according to His ways?"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was for my son's school assignment.

In the introduction he explained how he felt it was his duty to tell his story. He felt that it was one of the only ways he could contribute to prevent history from repeating itself. He told his story through the words of Night, although he said that he did not feel as if those words could tell the story of such events in full. At one point he even said it was impossible to understand, that there was no way to understand the slaughter of innocent men, women, and children. His story was brutally honest as he struggled to keep faith and hope alive not just for himself but for his father as well. He lived through so much to be able to write his story, his mother and the rest of his family were not even given a chance to make it, they were sent to the gas chambers directly upon arrival. He continually referenced back to the title and provided elaborate images behind the repetition of this crucial word in the novel. First his connection between the Holocaust and his experiences at Auschwitz to a nightmare, that he could only believe was a nightmare to be allowed any hope. Second was the connection with his spiritual life, feeling as if the light of God had gone, he went from being extremely religious to deprived of his ability to believe in a God that could allow all of that to happen. Then lastly was the connection between night and the ability to believe such things could happen, because more seems possible at night.

Even though Elie Wiesel's NIGHT is difficult and painful to read at times, this work's importance lies in its simple, pure power. It gives a reader an unprecedented understanding of the event it describes, and does so poignantly, vividly, perfectly. NIGHT is a must read for anyone who knows the story of the Holocaust, and more of a must read for anyone who THINKS they know the story. The Holocaust was more than a historical event; it was a human event and we must never forget it. We must never allow our children to forget it. I am a student-teacher and there is no doubt that when I have my own classroom, this book will be there for my middle school students to read and discuss, alongside THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK. This is one of only a few novels I have read in my lifetime that I believe truly changed me.

The subject matter is one that I find myself drawn to-I feel like I can never read enough survivor stories from the Holocaust. Elie Wiesel does not write to sell books-he writes this out of self-necessity, and the end result is stunning.Though Night is a quick read (I finished it in 2 nights, and only stopped to go to bed so I could work the next day), it delivers a powerful account of Wiesel's experiences at the hands of German soldiers.What surprises me most, though, is Wiesel's accounts of the mercies he received from some concentration camp workers during his oppression. I fought a number of emotions while reading Night, but mostly, I felt an ache at a young boy's fight to protect himself and still be loyal to his God, and to his father.I would definitely recommend Night to anyone. I feel more complete after having read it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"A enjoyed this book from begging to end.

Upon his arrival at Auschwitz he gets seperated from his sister and mother at the camp and never sees them again. He and his father are forced into slave labor, and slow starvation. In one scene Eliezer describes how a fellow inmate was chosen to place his own father's body in the ovens, and in another scene Eliezer tells about the cruel death of the Jewish babies.Later on Eliezer and his father are forced to run in the freezing snow to another location, then they are placed in cattle cars and driven to another camp. At this camp Eliezer's father dies, and Eliezer describes that night and how his father's last words effected him for the rest of his life.To me the most powerful part of the book was when the Americans came to the camp, and Eliezer was free. He was taken to a hospital and in the first time in months Eliezer looks at himself in the mirror and is shocked at the stranger looking back at him.Anyway, this is a very powerful book about human suffering, and what's scary is that this could happen again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"this is a short book but makes you feel for the charecters in such a short amount of time.

That right there is the true gift that Elie Wiesel has given to each of us.Don't read this book thinking you have to (maybe because Oprah told you to).

Wiesel's writing style is deceptively simple and he conveys feelings in many fewer words than other authors - and much more effectively than those who are verbose.I'm glad that Oprah chose it, thus bringing the book to many who would not have read it otherwise.There is a reason that many high schools have it on their curriculums now and it is important that it be read so that the holocaust is not forgotten and so that students (and others) can appreciate great writing."},{"Title":"Night","review":"However, I am glad that I overcame that urge. Maybe it was because I recognized that this man won the Nobel Peace Prize or maybe it was just the right time for me.Either way, the important lesson that I learned isa) Keep and open mind and dive into things that you are afraid of. Not just reading this book (because it is \\"uncomfortable\\"), but what is going on in your own life, in the lives of others and even in the world around us.b) The things that happened during WWII were because people didn't want to know what was going on (like walking the other way when someone is being mugged or is injured). Waiting for someone else to do it. What if I / you are that someone.c) It is our responsibility as humans to not turn a blind eye and just live for ourselves.These are just a few things that struck me.Finally, in the big scheme of things it boils down to whether or not you believe in God. If you do, then we hope to do the right thing and also hope that God pays back (good and bad) in the day of Judgment. If you do not believe in God, then you can still be involved even if there is no \\"judgment\\", at least you can live with yourself and sleep at night with a clear conscious."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book takes you right to the heart of the Holocaust. It's a memoir from his life but you feel like you are feeling it with everyone there. Very touching and very moving. Be prepared to possibly cry a little when reading this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is the story of a young Jewish boy's, Elie Wiesel, experiences in concentration camps. He and his family had to endure this horrible insanity that was forced upon them.I thank the author so much for writing this book. Words must be spoken and written so that the atrocities of the past will not be forgotten.I read this book straight-through-over the weekend.I am the author ofDreams in August: Life, Love, and Cerebellar Ataxia"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I don't know that I've ever read anything so powerful and chilling about The Holocaust. This book isn't very long, but it packs the force of something huge. It's one thing to read about The Holocaust, but it's another to read someone's vivid memories about their horrific survival. This book takes you all the way from exportation to repatriation, but what's in between will leave you speechless and sick. This is for someone who wants a very realistic look into the window of a Holocaust survivors soul. This book left me weeping and heartbroken, but also more grateful and aware."},{"Title":"Night","review":"There is no book that can compare to the passion, saddness and feeling with which this book is written. The book is not long but it will make you break down into tears while reading it and when thinking about it later."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Last week I was feeling a bit down, so I decided to read something that would allow me to stop being so hard on myself. I picked up Night because it's an excellent example of what happens to the human psyche under the most unbearable circumstances.First, Elie Wiesel tells how the Jews in his Transylvanian village were in denial of Hilter ever being able to invade their country. Despite all of the horror stories that they read in the paper or heard on the radio, they simply believed because of their location, Hilter would be defeated by the Allies before he could ever reach them. Later when the Gestapo invaded their town, they were not alarmed because the Germans were friendly...at first. Then of course came the Jewish ghettos, curfews, and deportation to concentration camps.I'm not going to go too much more into the book because you really need to read it for yourself. I will say however that after having read it in a few hours, it immensely changed they way I view my life. Some of the descriptions of what it's like to watch your parents get murdered before your own eyes and feel NO emotion, killing another person for a scrap of bread, or marching for sixteen hours in the snow with no shoes, really shook me up.Since reading the book, I realize that I actually have nothing to complain about because my life could be worse. I could be stuck in Auschwitz."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" by Elie Wiesel is one of the most intense and heart breaking books that I have ever read. This book seems to grab you by the throat, and will not let go. In \\"Night\\" Mr. Wiesel tells about his experiences in the Nazi Concentration Camps. Everything from his experiences in the ghettos, to life in the camp, to the torture everyone endured, and ultimately, to the liberation of the camps is told in a very frank, and straightforward fashion. This book is not entertaining, it is a gut wrenching story that will be so terrible, you will not be able to put it down.I enjoyed the writing style, I felt that it explained everything very well, and the syntax was very clear. Anybody who is interested in what the Jewish Holocaust was like, which should be every living person, should read this book. I highly recomend this wondeful, and intense, book to everyone. Be prepared, however, because this book will chew you up and spit you out again.If you do not learn history you are doomed to repeat it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a disturbingly dark and draining novel. There are no lights at the end of the tunnel, no rays of sunshine, no hint of humanity in the oppressors or sliver of hope for the suffering. It does all this with a purpose, to document the stories and the state of mind, and accomplishes its very ambitious goals.This is fiction, by definition. This bothered me at first, even if it was 'based on facts', since the events described are so disturbing. Allowing an author creative freedom in describing such atrocities just doesn't seem right. This prompted me to research the background and find that, with some relatively minor discrepancies, that can be expected with multiple witnesses, the events described have all been corroborated by other people who were in the same camps.This is a short read. This is a draining read. This is not a fun read. It comes recommended."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"The Holocaust was the most evil crime ever committed.\\" ~Stephen AmboseBoy, what a tough book to read. Night is Wiesel's account of being sent with his family at a young age to the German concentration camp at Auschwitz. His account is vivid and heartbreaking. It is difficult to believe that these atrocities happened in my grandparents' life times. What evil lurks in the hearts of men? Here's your answer.I have seen numerous movies on the Holocaust and there were a couple of things that I just couldn't wrap my head around. I couldn't understand why the Jews didn't flee when they had the chance before the Germans arrived and why so few of them fought back. Wiesel does a great job of explaning this. Most of them simply didn't believe the horrors that were described to them. Who could? Also, who could blame them for wanting to stay with their homes, their communities, and friends? Once it was too late to fight, their entire focus was on survival. It took all of their energy to survive day after day.Against all odds, Eliezer Wiesel did just that - survived. His will to live is the heart and soul of the book. You know going into the book, that it is an autobiography and that he does survive but you still find yourself holding your breath for the fate of Elie and his father. When the book finally finishes, you finally can come up for air.In the book's preface, Wiesel says, \\"Those who kept silent yesterday will remain silent tomorrow.\\" Wiesel was anything but silent. His slim memoir has been read by millions across the globe and continues to shout, \\"Don't let my past become your future.\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have read many stories about the Holocaust and none of them compare to this. Wiesel pulls you into the concentration camp with him and you feel like you are walking in his footsteps. Every cry, every whisper, every dying breath you watch with your own eyes. The abyss of hopelessness you are thrown into is almost unimaginable, but it is made into a reality through the writer's ability to reach into your heart and make his story your own. It is almost impossible to begin to describe this book and what Wiesel accomplished through it, but it is a landmark book in the history of the holocaust and in storytelling."},{"Title":"Night","review":"For anyone not familiar with Night, this is Elie Wiesel's memoir of his experiences in the Nazi death camps. Wiesel and his family were living in Transylvania when the Nazis came to power, and although they were Jews, they never thought they would be too affected by what was going on around them. Even when they were forced to live in the ghettos, the family kept a positive attitude. But when Wiesel was a teenager, in late 1944, everyone in his ghetto was rounded up and taken to Auschwitz. Immediately upon arriving, he was separated from everyone he knew except for his father. From then on, it was just him and his father, in a terrifying every day struggle just to survive.I had read Night in high school, and it has really stuck with me since even though I haven't reread it at all. With the WWII Challenge, I decided I should pick this one up again to remember why it had such a huge impact on me. And, wow, do I remember. The best single word that I could use to describe Night would be... haunting. More than any other book I've read in a long time, this book truly will haunt you after you finish it. The way Wiesel chose to write his story is in sparse prose, cutting straight to the point, being extremely factual in his word choices; and it is definitely an effective means of doing so. The reader is pulled right into the world he is describing, feeling terror, unbelievable exhaustion, and utter despair right along with him.Night is a difficult book to read, but a highly important one. We are not talking fiction here - this really happened, to millions of people, and not that long ago either. I had several friends when I was growing up whose grandparents survived the concentration camps - so when I read this book for the first time, it was VERY real to me and VERY eye-opening. Night is something I believe everyone should read - I feel very strongly that we need to be keenly aware of historical events and their significance, and this is one book that highlights that fact all too well. We have many dictatorships around the world right now, some more threatening than others, and as a world people we need to understand what can happen in these situations. So for me, this is a no-brainer: read Night, that's really all I can say on the subject. You should just read it if you haven't already."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The author. Eliezer Wiesel relates his ordeal from the time he was evicted from his home by the nazi Army, loaded in a freight train and sent to a concentration camp, until the time the camp where he is confined gets liberated by the Allied Forces during the Second World WarThis is a mandatory reading for all Jews so as not to forget how their ancestors awfully suffered at the time of the Holocaust, the worst atrocity committed during the whole history of mankind, ever. Particularly, the holocaust ought not to be forgotten in present times when voices are raised negating the truthfulness of this terrible event and attacking the existence of the State of Israel. Very suitable education material for Jewish teenagers."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This astonishing and very moving book is based on Elie Wiesel's youth in concentration camps during WW2. It begins with his childhood in Hungary, then his family's incarceration in a Jewish ghetto, then to Auschwitz (where he last sees his mother and sister) and later to Buchenwald. \\"Night\\" is made all the more haunting and powerful by the way that it is written so simply, in a matter of fact tone. Wiesel displays absolutely no self-pity as he describes the way that the Nazis wore them down and stripped them of their humanity, so that they were merely existing in a state of indifference to their fellow prisoners. The only thing that sustained him was being able (through both luck and determination) to remain with his father.Last year I read the novel \\"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\\" and while that is moving, it is Disney-lite in comparison to this.I have always wondered about some aspects of the Holocaust: why did more Jews not leave their countries when they had the opportunity do do so? Why didn't they heed warnings about what was happening elsewhere? Why did more not resist their oppressors? Wiesel explains this beautifully (within the parameters of his own experience).When we think of concentration camps so often it is the gas chambers that is foremost, but Wiesel captures so many other horrors: men so starved that they will kill one another for a few crumbs of bread, being force-marched many miles through the snow, the terror of making the wrong decision on the rare instances when they were given a choice in some aspect of their fate.This is a hauntingly sad, wonderful book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie WieselDid you ever stop to think about what happened in World War II? Why so many people lost their lives? Why families were separated? Why these camps were put up to demolish races? Elie Wiesel wrote Night for us to remember that this tragedy shouldn't happen again. He explains his life and the disasters of World War II.the horror of Nazi /fascist death camps and memories of evil are summarized in Night.Elie Wiesel writes about himself as a little boy in World War II. There was a group of men, from the village, that were removed by the Nazis. A rather smart, quiet man who was called Moshe the Beadle returned to the village with a bullet in his leg and a scar on his soul. He was one of the men taken from the village, but faked his death. He begged the village to believe him but they laughed and said he was crazy. No one wanted to believe Moshe even though the town was going through the steps of disengagement and disaster. Elie experienced Jewish ghetto and death camps. Nazis would search the corners constantly. He couldn't play or talk with the other kids. He and his family are taken to a concentration camp and he witnesses his family's death. He starts to disbelieve in God and starts questioning himself. He constantly repeats it in his mind that this may never happen again. That singling out people because of their religion, color, or disabilities is not right and shouldn't happen again.I have read many books about World War II but none of them gave me as much as information as Night. I've read The Upstairs Room, Coming Evil, and the Devils Arithmetic's, but I haven't got into as much as depth as in this book. These books are very similar because they are all about kids in World War II that are trying to capture freedom. The biggest strength of Night is description of the time and the place of the event. For example he says, \\"There was joy- yes joy. Perhaps they thought that God could have devised no torment in hell worse than that of sitting there among the bundles, in the middle of the road, beneath a blazing sun; that anything would be preferable to that.\\" He also describes the characters very well. How they walk and how they talk is like a picture in your head. I think Elie should be more specific on telling the reader how much time has past because sometimes I got lost at some points because Elie misinforms me of the time during some parts of Night. I think he did a very good job on titling the book but you will find out why when you read it.In conclusion, this book has something for all readers. I believe it is a complete book because it has good description, very nice wording, and is factual. I would read this book again and again. This book is noted in Oprah's favorite books read; this gives you more reason to read it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Why? As I was reading Night I kept asking myself....why, what makes man commit horrible crimes against humanity. The Holocaust is not the first time in history when a race of people were persecuted for their race or religion and unfortunately it was not the last time either. Night is a quick read about Ele Wiesel experience in Auschwitz and Buchenwald as a young boy and how he survived. In its simplicity of story telling it is most horrifying as it starts with the first rumblings of war and the appearance of a person in his town trying to warn the people about a massacre committed by the Nazis against innocent people that also included babies that he witness before his escape. You know what is coming as you read how the people in the town mocked and doubted the barer of bad news. And when the Nazis first arrive in the town you cry again as Ele describe how nice they were to the towns people as they moved into their homes and took them over. And the people still did not believe evil was amongst them. Next came the ghettos and then the trains to the death camps before finally they believe, but it is too late their descent into hell has just begun. How Ele survived and what happened to his family is mind blowing.There are tons of books out there that go into greater detail about this time in history, but what made this a powerful read for me was I felt that Ele was speaking directly to me as if he was telling me a part of his history over a cup of coffee. The pictures he painted of the atrocities he witness are unforgettable. A great companion piece to this book or any book about the Holocaust is a trip to the Holocaust museum in Washington, D.C. I visited the museum the first year it opened, I'm sure some things have changed but I remember the displays of the stacks of suitcases and shoes the people had to give up as they entered the death camps. There are piles of the dental work that was extracted from the prisoners mouths and replicas of life in a Jewish ghetto and the ovens where so many people lost their lives. But the most amazing thing was to walk inside an actual railcar that carried people to the death camps. There is so much more to see, it is a must see if you are in the D.C. area. I cried through out the entire tour, so if you go be prepared."},{"Title":"Night","review":"this is a tragic story, yet it offers hope. elie weisel alongside millions of others endured a hell that so many people, including myself, have never known. it tells the story of a child being cast into a world of terror and torture under the nazi regime, bearing winess to the demise of his family and community. in my opinon, it is so very important for everyone to read this book so history will not repeat itself."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I believe the headline says it all. This little book left me shaken and speechless. I am not Jewish, it is not about my personal heritage, and yet it moved me like no other book. From all points of view The Night is flawless, a burst of genius of outmost simplicity. Like someone else commented here, powerful it is an understatement."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book was a rewrite and it was obvious where some of the holes in the story were, but I still loved the book. If you are into the stories of holocaust survivors this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Every person should read this novel. Some very cruel and twisted things happen in this story. The worst part is that it is all true. The author survived life in the Nazi concentration camp. Everyone should listen to what he has to say. We as a society should learn from this. One thing the author stresses at the end of the book is the complacency of the Jews. They didn't believe it could happen to them. When it did, most of them did not resist. They were led like sheep to the slaughter. Complacency for any society is worse than a standing army against them. It baffles me how so many in the United States can be complacent about where our society is headed. We should all remember that Hitler was elected in a \\"democratic\\" Germany. It would prevail on all of us to realize we have to take an active part to prevent tyranny."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I remember first reading this in 9th grade over 10 yrs ago. I got this new edition and it is life changing. It really makes you think about your life. The little epilogue in the end was pretty powerful. even little things in the book that were not in the original such as what happened to another prisoner he met. I do not want to spoil it for anyone but it is definitely a book to read. I only have one criticism and this book is NOT a 9th grade level book. it is more of a 12th grade or even college level book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Written like a novel, Night, the true story of Elie Wiesel's experiences as a survivor of the holocaust. When he wrote his memoir Night wanted us to know what had happened, he wrote this so as to prevent history from repeating itself but he has achieved so much more. His use of figurative language allows the reader to feel, hear, see, taste, touch, and smell every thing he does. \\"Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp that turned my life into one long night seven times sealed\\" ( Page 34). These are Wiesel's words describing the beginning of the end of his innocence and childhood. \\"From the depths of the mirror, a corpse was contemplating me. The look in his eyes as he gazed at me has never left me.\\" (Page 115). The last words in Wiesel's book are terrifyingly powerful as they give us the image of a man of skin and bones his age sixteen, although you would not know that by looking at him. As a young boy Elie and the Jews of Shiget face a rude awakening when the Nazis take over their quiet town and ship them off to a series of concentration camps including the Auschwitz death camp, and a number of work camps. Elie and his father form a close dependence on each other as they travel from camp to camp. They make friends and loose friends as the memoir progresses in a series of events that force Elie into an early manhood. Although I do not usually find holocaust literature enjoyable this memoir is one I really enjoyed reading. There is not a thing I would change about how this memoir is written.I highly recommend this book to all those who are above the age of twelve."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel opens your eyes to the life of the millions of Jews in the mid-1900s. This memoir takes you on the journey that Elie went on himself. It shows you the ups (not there were a lot) and the downs. The tears and the very rare smiles. This memoir shares with you bits of the Jewish culture. Elie Wiesel wrote this book to try to touch our hearts. He wrote his memoir to open our eyes to their experiences. He did this flawlessly. My heart sunk when he described in vivid detail, the circumstances he had to deal with for years. Elie Wiesel described every scene using a piece of perfectly used figurative language. For example Elie said \\"At first my father crouched under blows, then he broke in two, like a dry tree struck by lightning, and collapsed\\"(Pg.52).This paints a picture image of what Elie's own father had to go through. I wouldn't change a single thing about this memoir. I think Elie Wiesel wrote it perfectly. It touched my heart and the people's around me. More than likely it opened every person who read this books heart. Even though this book didn't give me the warm and fuzzies, I still loved this book. I would rate this book a 9/10. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a little eye opener, to how good we really have it today."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night, an excellent tale of love and determination, carries us through a story of a boy and his father as they travel through different death camps. The two fight through times of separation and pain, constantly showing their love for one another and fight to survive.

I would recomment this book for any history buff, or anyone who loves a good read!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I recently finished this book for a class of mine and I loved it. It is a quick read but it is very powerful and disturbing. It is not overly graphic, but it is descriptive enough to put you in the shoes of the author. How he survived so many camps is amazing. This novel shows how human beings will begin to act when they are stripped down to the level of animals and must survive regardless. It also shows the consequence of the sickness of prejudice."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's vivid cautionary tale of human atrocity touches at the core of the experience of men and the nation state at war. I think the book has more relevance than ever considering the extremes of human privation we must endure when faced with acts of barbarism and senseless slaughter. 'Night' could have been written in the context of genocides in Yugoslavia, or Rwanda, or Somalia, or Eritrea and proves it has withstood the test of time as a tale of the human spirit enduring in spite of a world gone horribly mad. I would recommend 'Night' to any high school class. Required reading as a tale of caution to those who think that they have slipped the excesses of the darkest human predations through some historic accident. 'Night' is a vivid and gripping portrait of the evil that men are capable of, and the triumph of the human spirit in the face of the worst barbarism."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This was a really good book. It's about Elie Wiesel's experiences in various Polish concentration camps during the holocaust. Night is really a touching and sad memoir. The book is powerful, and I really liked it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I facilitate a Christian adult education study group at my church in Battle Creek, MI.In early July, our class began the study of evil using as a backdrop the Old Testament and the New Testament (The Gospels), as well as other historical and theological material.Of course, any discussion of evil at some point involves a review of the Nazi Holocaust. However, it appeared to me that discussing the horrible evil that is the Holocaust from a strictly Christian point of view was at best, shallow and at worst, ego-centric. Ergo, Elie Wiesel's \\"Night\\".His book has been tremendously enlightening for the class...Mr. Wiesel's powerful first person prose and vivd account of his struggle as a Holocaust victim and survivor not only concretely placed our class \\"there\\", it also brought numerous questions to light. Questions that in many cases have no answers. And, as much as some in the class harkened back to a \\"God-As-Good\\" theology, it was hard for us to reconcile many of our Christ-centered beliefs with the terrifying thought that God/Christ was absent for millions during the Holocaust years. More horrifying for some of us was the fact that many of these atrocities were carried out by \\"Christians\\"- individuals who had been baptized and raised at the epicenter of Christendom. Where were these Christians when it mattered? Where was God?Elie Wiesel makes us look into the mirror and see who is looking back...(In conjunction with \\"Night\\", I highly recommend you read, \\"The Holocaust is a Christian Issue\\", by Dr. Richard A. Cohen of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. The paper is a mind-bending, thought provoking look at post-Holocaust theology.)"},{"Title":"Night","review":"this book was amazing.

Elie Wiesel is a strong writer and deeply gets his point across!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's book, \\"Night\\" was one of the first books I had read on the Holocaust when I was in high school back in the mid 1970s. His painful and searing account of the unspeakable horror, known as the Holocaust is the single most defining event of the 20th century.The lessons of \\"Night\\" are as relevant today as they were when the Holocaust occurred and will be relevant as long as the world continues to exist. Within the hearts of mankind is both good and evil, love and hate and as long as hatred and evil can stir the hearts of men to commit such atrocities and engage in such barbaric tortures and mass murders then the lessons of \\"Night\\" will never be obsolete or outdated.It is incumbent on all those who have learned the lessons of \\"Night\\" to speak out against all injustices and hatred aimed at specific groups of people. I live amongst many Holocaust survivors, and the prevailing sentiment is that silence equals death. Had more people had the courage to actively oppose Hitler and pressure the free world to do so, perhaps the course of history would have been irrevocably changed.There are others who are devoutly observant Orthodox Jews, whose faith never dimmed during those nightmare years and credit their survival to the hand of G-d. Their view is that anti-semitism is a permanent part of and endemic to our society as it has been since time immemorial and no efforts towards stemming this insidious evil would have helped. There is no question that this view also has a great deal of validity and credibility as well in our times.This of course does not release us from the obligation to fight evil and hatred. For in the end, it is we who will suffer for not speaking out when we could and it is we who will suffer for not exhausting every effort to thwart movements predicated on mass extermination of any segment of our society.For those who believe in a Higher Power, we must believe that there will be an accounting and reckoning of our deeds and misdeeds on this earth and we will be asked by the Heavenly Court where we were and what we did to prevent the shedding of innocent blood. Their are sins of commission and sins of omission, to which we are held equally responsible. Apathy and fear and reluctance to act are not valid excuses. Let us not be guility of remaining silent and feigning ignorance when we have the ability to voice our outrage and indignation at those who would destroy our brothers and sisters."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read \\"Night\\" a few years ago and before I finished the book I swore to myself that I would visit Auschwitz to maybe get a glimpse into what Wiesel witnessed. This summer I was able to take a guided tour from Krakow in hopes of having some of my questions answered.That is what \\"Night\\" does to the reader, it leaves him/her with many questions. Most of these questions are not easy ones. They are questions about fear, human nature, obedience, and the power of propaganda.Reading \\"Night\\" and then seeing things firsthand really affected me. I have become more sensitive to others because of Wiesel's story.The most important idea that Wiesel imparts in his book is that \\"there is danger in indifference.\\" Many of us are everyday witnesses to the horrors of the world and do nothing; we say nothing.---Michael James D'Amato, author of \\"The Classroom\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"My son has been given this book as required reading for 10th grade English.

I'm not saying that you will not enjoy it, but it is a little difficult to read. My 8th grade literature class read it, and I have to admit that this book was greeted with sighs. Who wants to read just another book about the Holocaust? Well, I have to tell you, this book is much more tangible than anything I have read concerning the Holocaust. Through this book, you can see, hear, smell, and feel the atrocities that Wiesel was forced to endure. My class was pleasantly surprised by this book and so was I. I'm looking forward to reading the other two books of Wiesel's trilogy."},{"Title":"Night","review":"What can I say about this great book. I have read this several years ago, and I still remember it. There are few books that I can cry too, but this is one of them. I especially remember the moment when Wiesel's father died, and Elie was sleeping close to him. This was a very heartfelt moment. I doubt I will read many books in the future where I feel the same emotions. Despite all his sufferings, Wiesel emerges from his night of horror a stronger and better man. This book is his dedication to those who suffered the attrocities of World War II.I am glad Oprah decided to recognize this treasure of a book. I wish more books could touch the soul as this book touched mine."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's Night is a compelling story of a father and son's struggle to live through the holocaust. He begins his novel with the story of the character called Moishe, a Jew who witnessed the horrors of the concentration camps before anyone else in his town. He came back retelling stories, and everyone refused to believe him. They called him crazy and kept trying to convince themselves that the war would be over soon.No one headed Moishe's warnings, and because of that, they were in for a rude awakening when the SS officers ordered them all to leave and sent them to the ghettos, concentration camps, and gas chambers. As with everyone else's families, the narrator's family was separated. The narrator was sent away with his father, and together they tried to survive the horrors of the concentration camps. They almost made it until the very end, but then tragedy struck. The father became ill and too weak. One night, he was getting beaten because he was too sick and the narrator, his own son, refused to help him. The next morning, the father wasn't there - he died. The most heart-wrenching part of the novel is at the moment when the narrator discovers that his father is dead - instead of the son mourning the death of his father, he feels relieved that his father died - it was one less person to look over, one less burden. The son then goes on to be liberated, but it is already too late - though the son had physically survived, his person had long died.This book, though barely 100 pages, is an unbelievably real account of a father and son's struggle to survive, and the true feelings that develop during times of fear and stress. This is definitely an emotional and powerful read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Imagine yourself as a young kid violently torn from your home, friends, and family and thrown into one of the most tragic events in history; the Holocaust. Elie Wiesel depicts this exact situation in his powerful autobiography entitled \\"Night\\". This book is extremely well written, and is very important in a clearer understanding of the horrific events that occured during the Holocaust.Elie Wiesel's writing is extremely well done. He describes the many tortures and trials he endured in concentration camps. He is disturbingly homest, and never strays from the absolute truth. This however means that every gruesome act that Elie undergoes is described in dreadful detail.Many of us do not know to any slight degree the horrors of the Holocaust. That is why I believe \\"Night\\" is such an important book. It sheds light on the terrible events and clears any rumors that might circulate. With this however comes a few drawbacks. I believe everyone should read this book, however due to some of the graphic descriptions, I do suggest that the reader be mature enough to handle it. For anyome with children, I would suggest that you first read the book yourself, then decide whether you child is able to deal with the descriptions.I do believe that it is vitally important to understand various historical events. \\"Night\\" is a moving account of one of the most upsetting events in history. It very well deserves the utmost respect."},{"Title":"Night","review":"At the end of the CD version of this book, Wiesel offers an introduction to this new 2006 translation of his 1958 book from the original French by his wife Marion. Night was the first book he wrote, and Wiesel says that this book is the basis for all his other books. He says this book is his most important work, and before reading any of his other works you must read this one. The CD also includes his acceptance speech for the Noble Peace Prize, which is just as moving.After you've thought about the story for a while, you realize that the central theme is how this could this have happened. Not only how the killing was allowed to happen, but how could the Jewish victims themselves have been made by the end of their nightmare so dehumanized, so unfeeling, and so selfish. Wiesel, raised a deeply religious Jew, is deeply troubled by this realization throughout his experience. So am I.The writing and translation are excellent. It's not just the content that is first rate, but Wiesel is a fantastic writer, which may be overlooked given the overwhelming power of the subject. He reminds me very much of Dostoevsky.The narration by George Guidall is absolutely first rate. Even if you've read the book before, it is still worth while listening to Guidall perform it. In fact, I'd be interested in anything else Guidall reads. I already went through Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground that Guidall did and loved it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I was absolutely touched by this account.

This should be required reading."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Wiesel's book is a matter of fact accounting without literal embellishments of what non-Jewish Germans did to Jews during WWII based on his personal experiences. The book is written in the style of the Gospel of Mark - fast paced, always moving forward, lots of action and little in the way of descriptive embellishments from the author to help the reader gain a broader perspective. The author writes as if he's not looking back with any historical perspective, instead it reads as a narrative with the immediacy of being written soon after he was liberated rather than 15 years later.This book should be required reading for all 15 year olds in our public school system. It provides an example of how fascism differs from American ideals of equal protection and that each of us reserved their individual rights from the power of government. It is also an excellent essay on suffering. While its tough to teach the Book of Job in public schools, the definitive essay on suffering, this book accomplishes the same task by asking the same fundamental questions the author of Job does. Night provides students with a non-abstract example of one of the very large benefits of freedom paid with by the blood of their ancestors by telling the story of another 15 year old with a vastly different set of life experiences that was caused by a German culture that rewarded bigotry of \\"the Other\\".Night will break your heart. That humans are capable of such atrocities is known abstractly and universally, this is an example of a book that moves one beyond the merely knowing and into the realm of feeling it in a small way, though certainly not to the level of those victimized by the holocaust.My only disappointment with this book is that Wiesel does not provide more detail on the forced march when the Germans were fleeing the Soviets with their prisoners, including Wiesel and his father, in tow. 42 miles of running and hiking in the snow with a recently operated and shoe-less foot, and that was just the first night. A few more facts to help us better understand the three day journey to Buchenwald would have been appreciated even if it violated the framework of maintaining a narrowly focused immediacy prevalent in the rest of the book.However, if you are looking for a first person accounting what it's like to be the victim of hatred and religious bigotry with government leading the charge, this book wil make most readers' short list."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I enjoyed the book.

In this book; Night, written by Elie Wiesel, originally published in 1960 in English, Elie Wiesel shares with the reader his horrific experiences that he suffered and endured during the Nazi Holocaust while he was imprisoned at Buchenwald and Auschwitz; the German Concentration Camps. Elie Wiesel writes eloquently, but in simple and comprehensible terms his experiences along with his father.

But it is a vital read. In order to ensure that the evil perpetrated on the Jewish people by the Nazi regime never, ever happens to any other people group again, we must read what is not easy for us to read.This book is the heart-wrenching account of the atrocities committed by the Nazis during the Holocaust. But it's not simply a factual retelling of these horrendous events. Night takes you right into the utter despair felt by people who were completely dehumanized. People who were treated less humanely than animals. People who lived in the midst of pure Evil.Elie Wiesel tells his firsthand account as a teenage boy forcibly removed from his home, separated from his mother and sisters, stripped of his dignity, treated in despicable ways, struggled with his anger toward God, and watched his father die right before his eyes. No one should have had to endure such things.Elie Wiesel survived to tell his story, so that he could become the voice for the voiceless oppressed. What a great lesson for all of us to learn! We, too, should speak up for those who cannot. As Elie said in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech -\\"We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere. ...Human suffering anywhere concerns men and women everywhere. ...And action is the only remedy to indifference, the most insidious danger of all. ...One person of integrity can make a difference, a difference of life and death.\\"Please read this book, and then be one person of integrity who makes a difference."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I am homeschooling Mother of 4 girls,my oldest is going to be 14 this summer.As a homeschooler it is important to teach the children the highlights of our history, not just about the world Wars or who our presidents were & what they are most famous for ,but to get deeper into the inhuman portions of things and teach the details of our history that are more than indiscribable to put into words,at the top of that list is the Holucost...I pieced together a small amount of books and videos that I thaught would help her to understand the pains of what people had to go through the loss the triumphs and the constant battles with the will to survive.Night,as we are reading it has proven to be extremely sad, moving ,and truumphant in his lives story.I pray that more people will feel it an absolute must to teach our young children of these inconcievable things because History is constant and changes always as an educator you are forced to decide what is most important for our children to know of our history and the things we should ALWAYS be accountable for such as the terrible ordeals the Jewish went through and the heartless ways people find it so easy to live day to day.Slavery is another.Are the new histories important? yes! but we have no right to forget the past mistakes our nation(s) countries and states have made.Too learn of these past experiences from the people who lived them is a gift from God.Sadly one day there will not always be a person around that can speak of these things from a personal point of view.FOR WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH I PRAY FOR PEACE,FOR WHAT I AM ALLOWED TO TEACH MY CHILDREN BECAUSE OF THIER COURAGE TO SPEAK OUT I THANKTHEM A MILLION TIMES , I THANK YOU!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel is the story of young Elie's experience through the Holocaust. Elie Wiesel was captured in 1944 at the age of fifteen. The novel captures all of Wiesel's experiences throughout many Jewish camps. (Auschwitz, Buna, Birkenau, Gleiwitz, and Buchenwald) Elie Wiesel starts his novel off great by writing a wonderful opening about Moishe the Beadle that hooked millions of people who read his novel.Throughout the novel Wiesel uses figurative language to keep us hooked on his story. The figurative language makes us feel as if we are actually in 1944 with Elie by his side. Wiesel loves to especially use similes through the novel. My favorite simile comes in the beginning when Wiesel is describing by passers he knew. He says, \\"It was like a page torn from a book.\\"(pg.17) He explains this scene as if it was a page from a book off of a shelf you picked up to read.Wiesel's purpose for writing Night was to show readers how he never lost faith in God through all his experiences. Wiesel has touched the lives of many by writing his tale in Night. He has shown us how brave and determined you had to be to survive during the Holocaust and why many people did not survive. Wiesel's main message in Night was to make sure that something like the Holocaust never happens again.There is nothing I would change about Night. It was very well written and gets Wiesel's message across well. This was an amazing book that I would definitely read again. I recommend everyone of every age to read Night, to be touched by Wiesel's novel."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was haunting.

Almost half done with this addicting book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night (Oprah's Book Club)I bought this book for my husband, who absolutely loved it. He said it's the best book he ever read about the Holocaust. It goes into much detail that he hasn't seen in other books on the Holocaust. It's not an enjoyable book, nor was it meant to be. But it tells a lot about the terrible atrocities committed against the Jews in World War II in much detail. Once he started reading the book he couldn't put it down until he finished it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Few words can probably express or describe what a personal experience like Elie Wiesel's must have been like. Yet, Wiesel in but few words, literally this text is barely 100 pages, gives us a page-turning glimpse of an unfathomable black mark on world history. In rapid pace, you are guided through the harrowing times of a young teenager and his family being moved from their home in Sighet, Transylvania on foot and by crowded cattle trains from one camp to another. The text ends, but not the story, in the infamous Buchenwald Concentration Camp, where the author, shortly after the death of his father, witnesses the eventual arrival of the US Army.One might read a text like this not so much for the writer's mastery of the pen, but for the forcefulness of the story. Wiesel's preface to this modern translation is as much eloquent and eerily haunting as any of the translated pages to follow. The language of the story is simple, direct and vivid. If it had been cluttered with attempts to use more sophisticated and elaborate language, it would likely only get in the way. It's a book written in the perhaps the only way it should be.While powerful and unforgettable, it is not overly gruesome or graphic. Death and suffering are clearly not absent from this text. Depressing as it may be for today's teenagers and young adults in their formative years, this is a suitable book for the serious and mature reader even at those ages. Adults considering a book of this sort, not sure if the imagery or thoughts evoked may be too disturbing, might consider this volume worthy of consideration.

It was different from other books of this genre that I have read in that, it was written from a child's point of view and it seemed to illustrate the gradual then sudden impact of the the Nazi regime. This young boy describes his home, and his neighbors as just casually going along with the segregation and eventual deportation of the Hungarian Jews. He describes living in the ghettos as not too bad, and the germans as decent soldiers. then all hell breaks loose. Some of the events described left my feeling so empty and hollow, knowing that even if this account is in fact fiction....it is still spawned from truth and that somewhere during that time those events did in fact happen. This book was a powerful testimony that left me in an emotional haze for weeks to follow. One of the aspects I appreciated was that it was not overly long. The author does not ramble or get hung up in all the finite details, and the ending (which is what makes or breaks a book for me) was perfect.

An Oprah book club pick, this short, 120 odd page book, or as The New York Times describes it, \\"a slim volume of terrifying power\\", is a must read. There is even a Cliff Notes version of this copyright 1972 book which is newly translated by Elie Wiesel's wife.The book is about the atrocities of WWII concentration camps, but what makes it different than most others is the first person narrative which makes the ugliness of one human to another radiate with reality. Without any spoilers here, the book tracks several weeks in the life of Elie's family as they are literally brought into the night of sadness and death.What makes this book -- a quick read and very worthwhile -- even more unique is the very short, simple and yet eloquent writing style of it's author. The sentences are staccato, like a machine gun, with a \\"plain vanilla envelope\\" style that only adds to the boosk readability and believeability. Like the reality of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, which is punctuated by his use of black and white grainy film and hand held cameras, Night sticks to basic descriptions that serve to move the recounting along rapidly and realistically. Weisel, like Romero, understands that the power of our imagination to \\"fill in the gaps\\" with the most harrowing and vivid images could never be superceded by an authors flowery descriptions. He allows the reader's mind to live and breathe the horror.Romero's movies are fiction; Wiesel's first hand account at the loss of his family is fact. The book's ending, and at several points within the book, displays the seething optimism and will to live that percolates through the core of every human being, even in the face of death.I hope someone else will read this post and, looking for a quick and powerful read, choose this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"What an inspiring story from such a horrific experience.

There are parts of this book that literally made me turn my head from the print. But Wiesel's writing also urged me to take responsibility and finish what I was reading, skipping no words and forgetting no image.Wiesel is so matter of fact, so completely un-interested in writing melodramatic prose that builds the tension artificially, that this book takes your breath away.

Everyone knows the story of the Nazi concentration camps: No one knows the story of the Nazi concentration camps. Novels, films, photographs, poems, speeches, tours of sites all try to give some idea of the gripping tragedy of the genocide and the deplorable conditions that befell the victims of the camps, but nothing does it as well as this deeply moving account by Wiesel.The reasons are many. Not only does Wiesel tell his story in the simplest of language without cluttering the facts with gory details: the facts themselves are atrocious enough and when told through the words of a 16-year old boy who entered the camps from his life as a spiritually devout Jew in Sighet, Transylvania that gradually metamorphosed into a challenged believer who felt God and mankind had deserted both his ailing father and him, the impact is overwhelming.Wiesel's writing is at once eloquent and harrowing and his descriptions of survival through the camps at Auschwitz, Buna, Birkenau, and Buchenwald searingly become imprinted on our minds. Every reader may think these facts are redundant but they can never be retold often enough. Even as we read this book there are occurrences in various places throughout the globe TODAY that resurrect the atrocities herein described. And in reading the Nobel Peace Prize statement by Elie Wiesel that closes this book we are bound to fight against the hate that allows such exploding carbuncles.This is a book that should be read by everyone, globally. And it should be read repeatedly. In it lies our only hope that history will not continue repeating itself.

It called up simpler times and even during the most suspenseful parts, there was the reassuring sense that all would turn out well somehow.The book is centered in Roger Mifflin's large, cluttered but cozy secondhand bookshop, behind which he lives with his wife. It's part meditation on bibliophilia, and book lovers will likely salivate over the descriptions of Roger's bookstore and his cozy sitting room lined with his most cherished volumes. Roger himself is quite a charming character, if sometimes long-winded on his favorite subject (books, of course).Onto this cozy canvas of biblio-bliss unfolds a mystery: a volume keeps disappearing and reappearing from Roger's shop, strange noises are heard, and suspicious characters start to turn up.

This book is also a very interesting look into the American mind immediately after World War I. The bookseller has many underlinable speeches about the importance of books in a world of peace. For the modern reader, it's depressing, knowing that the utter non-peace of World War II -- and indeed most of the rest of the 20th century and all of the 21st-- hangs over this optimist's head."},{"Title":"The Haunted Bookshop","review":"The Haunted Bookshop is a sequel to Morley's delightful Parnassus on Wheels. Roger Mifflin and Helen McGill, now wedded, have opened a bookstore in Brookly called Parnassus on Wheels (NOT The Haunted Bookshop, as the illustrator of this edition's cover seems to think). The time is shortly after WWI, and President Woodrow Wilson is soon to sail for Europe to work out a settlement that will create the League of Nations. Into Parnassus at Home enters Aubry Gilbert, a young advertising man, Titania Chapman, a rich debutante sent to work there by her father so that she can learn some life skills, and a disappearing and reappearing copy of Carlyle's Oliver Cromwell. The book is a bit of a love story, a bit of a thriller, and a lot of a paen to books and reading.Readers of Parnassus on Wheels will easily recognize a couple of the themes in The Haunted Bookshop: Morley's insistence (through Roger) that books broaden the imagination, deepen the spirit, and cultivate the virtue of tolerance and open-mindedness; his worry that the publishing industry is increasingly feeding the public bad books just to push merchandise; and his conviction that the \\"common man\\" (and woman) is hungry for precisely what the world of literature has to offer. But there's a new theme here as well: Morley's hatred of war and the jingoistic hypocrisy that too often perpetuates it. In a particularly eloquent chapter, Roger shows Titania a special War section he's set up in his bookstore, and discusses at length the anti-war novels and narratives he's assembled there. Roger, the lover of heroism and sacrifice in literature, refuses to conflate romance with reality. War is noble only in books. In real life, it's brutal. This impassioned denunciation of war is as timely--and tragic--today as it was in Morley's own day.The Haunted Bookshop isn't as seamless as Parnassus on Wheels, mainly because it's more didactic than the earlier book. But for those who love books, and for those who want to think about the issues Morley raises, Bookshop is highly recommended. One of its bonuses is that it will send you scurrying to read some of the many titles Roger recommends. When I first read Bookshop 40 years ago, it made me hungry to read Thomas Hardy's epic poem The Dynasts. Now that I've reread Morley, I think it's time to revisit Hardy's beautiful and terrible denunciation of Napoleon and all purveyors of war."},{"Title":"The Haunted Bookshop","review":"Interesting for any book (or bookshop) lover.

Loaded with stereotypes, but forgivable for the time period.The story of a used bookshop in Brooklyn at the very end of WWI, and strange incidents that befall a young ad salesman who befriends the shop owners."},{"Title":"The Haunted Bookshop","review":"First Line: If you are ever in Brooklyn, that borough of superb sunsets and magnificent vistas of husband-propelled baby-carriages, it is to be hoped you may chance upon a quiet by-street where there is a very remarkable bookshop.A couple of years ago, Christopher Morley's Parnassus On Wheels was one of the books I enjoyed reading the most, so I was very happy to obtain a copy of the follow-up to it. The Haunted Bookshop follows Roger and Helen Mifflin to Brooklyn, New York, where Roger has a dream come true: he opens his own bookstore.In short order, the couple find themselves with a mysterious disappearing and reappearing book; a rich friend insists on sending his daughter to them so she can work in their store and learn the value of hard work and a paycheck; and a young man in the advertising business becomes involved with the mystery book and falls in love with the beautiful young heiress.All this could've been great fun. The young man in particular could be very amusing because most of his thinking was heavily influenced by ad copy and the popular magazines and movies of the day:\\"For one terrible moment he thought she was going to cry. But he remembered having seen heroines cry in the movies, and knew it was only done when there was a table and chair handy.\\"But the humor was buried under Morley's insistence in having Roger Mifflin-- formerly a very caring and observant character-- spout speech after speech on his views of truly great literature, war, and peace. Although I did agree with Morley's viewpoints on almost every topic, I did not appreciate being continuously beat over the head with his opinions.If those diatribes had been excised from this book, it would have been a charming sequel to Parnassus On Wheels. Oh well. You win some... and you lose some. My advice would be to read Parnassus On Wheels and give The Haunted Bookshop a miss."},{"Title":"The Haunted Bookshop","review":"This book is full of drama. I could not put the book down at night. It contains many quatos from other books. It is a good book and tells alot of details."},{"Title":"The Haunted Bookshop","review":"Usually the sequel is never as good as the original, but in this case, The Haunted Bookshop is even better than the first volume, Parnassus on Wheels. If you are a booklover, you will thoroughly enjoy both. This story is set in Brooklyn just after the close of WWI. The descriptions of the city made me feel like I was really there. The book is filled with observations about books and bookselling. Although the romance woven into the plot was somewhat sentimental, the book did have its serious side, and is stronger on plot than the first volume was. The bookseller and his wife are thoroughly enjoyable and likable people. It was really fun to read about city life early in the century, when milk wagons and bakery wagons still made deliveries, and apothecaries mixed prescriptions right on the premises instead of counting out pills from a bottle from the pharmaceutical company. This was a very refreshing book, and the observations it contained about reading have not gone out of date."},{"Title":"The Haunted Bookshop","review":"Okay, so I admit, the cover attracted me to the book. It wouldn't be the first time that this has happened. And the title was alluring(considering that I've worked in a bookstore for years upon years and now spend my working hours in a library, is it any wonder?) And so, The Haunted Bookshop and Parnassus on Wheels in hand, I made my way to a chair by a window and found comfort in Christopher Morley's words.&quot;Did you ever notice how books track you down and hunt you out?...it follows you and follows you and drives you into a corner and makes you read it...Words cannot describe the cunning of some books.&quot;That was all it took, all the motivation I needed, to buy the book. The story itself kept me reading. Roger Mifflin, owner of &quot;the haunted bookshop,&quot; is a man after my own heart. Some may find him a bit stuffy, perhaps just a tad bit pretentious(though charmingly so)in nature, but he's a man that knows the importance of books. In fact, he can choose the perfect book for a customer just by looking at him. Now that's a talent I'd like to have.Besides all of the book loving goin' on, the novel is peopled with charming characters, all trying to solve a mystery between reading and taking out the Mifflin's dog. The mystery is a little slow going at first, but soon after, as things fall into place, it becomes quite the page turner.All in all, a lovely book that any bibliophile will treasure."},{"Title":"The Haunted Bookshop","review":"It's been years since I read The Haunted Bookshop, but it's one of those books that really stays with you. The proprietor of the bookshop has the proper attitude about selling books and has the sign posted right up on his wall: \\"We sell no fakes or trashes.\\" I first read the book when I was in 9th grade, and remember thinking wistfully that I would love to visit the Haunted Bookshop. To my immense delight, I've discovered a few over the years, where I've made wonderful finds I never would have discovered at [local stores]. When you run across one of these bookstores, they are a joy to remember forever."},{"Title":"The Haunted Bookshop","review":"This was an unusual little book but I thoroughly enjoyed it. There were a few quirky points I could nitpick about -- the characters are a little mannered and Mr. Mifflin, the eccentric but charming bookseller, is at his best discussing books and less interesting as an anti-war crusader, but these I wrote off to the time period the book was written. For me, they didn't distract much from the overall enjoyment of the book. Even the mystery to the plot turned out better than I'd expected. I haven't read the prior book, \\"Parnassus on Wheels\\" but I've added it to my future reading list."},{"Title":"The Haunted Bookshop","review":"The Haunted Bookshop is quaint, delightful fiction that is simultaneously entertaining and thought provoking. Like its predecessor, Parnassus on Wheels, it is first and foremost a book for book lovers. The exuberant Roger Mifflin, the owner of a dusty, out-of-the way, used bookstore in Brooklyn, thrives on helping people discover new books and authors. His bookshop motto reads: \\"We have what you want, though you may not know you want it.\\" Making money is secondary to him and his favorite pastime is talking and arguing, especially about books.Written in 1919, the action centers upon a then contemporary event, the planned voyage of Woodrow Wilson to the Peace Conference in Europe. Roger's leather bound copy of Carlyle's Oliver Cromwell disappears from its shelf, only to reappear the following night. A clever story of espionage follows.Roger is a man of his times and is deeply concerned that the mistakes leading to the Great War not be repeated. His hopes for future world peace are poignant, especially as we modern readers realize that in just two decades the Great War would be renamed, and numbered.Christopher Morley's characters - the irrepressible Roger Mifflin, his pragmatic and loveable wife Helen McGill Mifflin, the youthful, diligent Titania Chapman that works in their shop, and her idealistic suitor Aubrey Gilbert - are all eminently likeable characters. The villains are indeed villainous, but thankfully, miscommunications within their ranks causes their plans to go awry. Aubrey, acting as an amateur sleuth, misinterprets the situation, but ultimately all works out for the best.I suppose it is best to read Parnassus on Wheels and its sequel, The Haunted Bookshop, in order, but it is certainly not necessary. I suspect that whichever you begin with, you will immediately begin searching for the other. It is no surprise that Christopher Morley, author of more than 50 books, is primarily remembered for these two marvelous stories.Years ago my wife and I stumbled upon a pleasantly enticing, used bookstore on a narrow street in downtown Mobile. It was appropriately named The Haunted Bookshop."},{"Title":"The Haunted Bookshop","review":"Page 120: That's why I call this place the Haunted Bookshop. Haunted by the ghosts of books I haven't read. Poor uneasy spirits, they walk and walk around me. There's only one way to lay the ghost of a book, and that is to read it.THE HAUNTED BOOKSHOP draws me straight into its story. It's a story that booklovers will enjoy--a romance with books and a mystery to be solved.Roger Mifflin owns the second-hand bookshop on Gissing Street, Brooklyn. The bookshop operates under the name \\"Parnassus at Home,\\" and is known as the Haunted Bookshop. He has a loving wife, Helen, and she is a fantastic cook. Her signature dish is the chocolate cake that every member of the Corn Cob Club relish. The Club is held at the bookshop for bookish discussions by the booksellers. I particularly enjoy and appreciate their discussions. For example, one of the booksellers, Benson said: \\"Look at the way a man shells out five bones for a couple of theatre seats, or spends a couple of dollars a week on cigars without thinking about it. Yet two dollars or five dollars for a book costs him positive anguish.\\"I can definitely relate to the thought above. Although the story dated way back in 1919, it is still true today. We could easily spend money on clubbing, movies, cigarettes and so on without blinking an eye but when asked to invest in good books, it sounds almost obscene to the other party. Again, Mr Mifflin articulated it very well in his dialogue with Titania, when he said: \\"You see, books contain the thoughts and dreams of men, their hopes and strivings and all their immortal parts. It's in books that most of us learn how splendidly worthwhile life is.\\" Those are beautiful statements. A good book meets human hunger. A good book for you may not be a good book for me, so there's a book for everybody. And that's what Mr Mifflin takes pleasure in doing--he 'prescribes' books for such 'patients' as they visit his bookshop and who are willing to tell him their symptoms. Such is his passion for the art of bookselling.The life led by the bookseller and his wife is easy-going and simple. Every day, they do business until about ten o'clock at night. Then Mrs Mifflin would brew a pot of hot cocoa and they would read or talk for a while before bed. Sometimes Mr Mifflin would walk their dog, Bock (short for Boccaccio). I would love a simple life like that. Often, I have such daydreams and hope that I would retire like the Mifflins and possess a passion like theirs.The story does not just stop there. One day, a young advertising man named Aubrey Gilbert comes into the Haunted Bookshop hoping to sell copywriting service for his agency. In fact, the story almost begin with this young man. Mr Mifflin does not believe in paying for advertisement and goes on to explain his rationale to the young man. They became acquainted that way and even had supper together because Mrs Mifflin is out of town. Together, they discuss about literature.Later, a young lady named Titania Chapman, the daughter of one of Mr Mifflin's best friends come to work for him. Her father believes that his daughter is frivolous due to her wealthy upbringing and education, so seeks Mr Mifflin to take her under his wings to teach her about earning her own living. Mr Mifflin is very excited about this opportunity and prepares for her arrival. Titania turns out to be a bright and very likeable girl. She is also very eager to learn about the trade.More excitement and mystery unfolds--all in the span of a week while Titania is working at the Haunted Bookshop. Aubrey is obviously smitten by Titania's beauty. Meanwhile a copy of Carlyle's Oliver Cromwell keeps appearing and disappearing from the bookshop's shelf. Then there is a German pharmacist and chef who are acting very suspicious. They are seen with missing copy of Cromwell--something nasty is cooking. What could they possibly want to do with a book? At this time, the World War I had just ended.I have totally enjoyed reading THE HAUNTED BOOKSHOP and will check out the prequel PARNASSUS ON WHEELS. This is a book that can be finished in one sitting and see the plot unfolds. There are some misunderstandings in the story. Some surprises. Twists and turns. The characters are likeable. I just wished for a happier ending for Bock the dog though..."},{"Title":"The Haunted Bookshop","review":"What happened to the delightful storyline and the quaint but congenial prose of \\"Parnassus on Wheels?\\" The prose of \\"The Haunted Bookshop\\" is preachy and the storyline dark. Where \\"Parnassus\\" is cheery and light, \\"Haunted Bookshop\\" is sinister and the events shadowy. It is as if Morley tries to regain the feeling of the first book but the mood escapes him. Here is what I think happened: \\"Parnassus\\" was written prior to 1914, \\"Haunted\\" in 1919. What intervened on the world stage that could have resulted in Morley's less than sunny mood? The First World War. You will find mention of it in \\"The Haunted Bookshop.\\" You will feel the \\"loss of innocence\\" and the onset of hopelessness the war brought to many people in America. Actually, reading \\"Haunted\\" left me sad. I wanted to regain the optimism and positive energy of \\"Parnassus on Wheels\\" and was blindsided by Morley's change of tenor and mood. I am a little sorry I read \\"Haunted Bookshop.\\" I could escape to a simpler and better time in \\"Parnassus.\\" \\"The Haunted Bookshop\\" brought me back to earth with a crunch."},{"Title":"The Haunted Bookshop","review":"This is a delightful, charming book any bibliophile will be sure to appreciate. Roger Mifflin is a man I can respect and adore. He is saddened that he will die leaving thousands of books unread (I totally agree!), but he still finds time to uncover a mystery and prevent a tragedy. This novel takes place at the closing of WWI and it is a very interesting, funny and cozy mystery that had a few surprises along the way.

Now, with sellers online, I found it again and am very happy I did.My original version of the book was quite large, like a child's picture book.

Additionally, examples of action research carried out by practicing teachers are most helpful and may act as a guide for readers to carry out their own action research projects--the future of the profession for language teachers.

Anne is her own person, a brilliant author, a strong, kind-hearted, caring, sharing person who has given everything to her readership over the years. I wish her all the best, & I DO still love her, but not this book - and for the record, I thought Memnoch The Devil as one of the greatest writing examples of all time.Oh well, 1st David Sylvian makes 'Blemish', one of the most worse albums EVER & now this book...don't rely on 'heroes', kids - be your own!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"(I'd give it 1.5 if I could)I could barely start this book. The language was completely erratic, and didn't seem to me to be Lestat. Yeah, yeah, characters evolve, blah blah blah. But it was so inconsistant! He uses &quot;Yo&quot; and &quot;Dude&quot; as well as &quot;thee.&quot; And yes, he does say &quot;yo&quot; despite a review that claimed otherwise.Mona is incessantly whining and wishy-washy. &quot;I'm not talking to you. I hate you&quot; in one breath and &quot;I love you, don't leave me&quot; in another. It became ridiculous.Despite problems such as those, there were intriguing moments in the book. A few chapters flowed well and I couldn't put them down. Unfortunately, that was not a trend throughout the work.And I don't know about you guys, but I am sick of Anne using Capital Letters for everything. I'm expecting one of her creations to say, &quot;Excuse me, I have to go to the Restroom to facilitate a Bowel Movement.&quot; It is absolutely asenine. And it started getting that way back in Memnoch.If you want to get into the Vampire Chronicles, read #1-3. Some of the more independent ones such as Pandora and Blood and Gold were also good reads. Stick to the first three for the Lestat saga. They are easily the best.I don't know much about the Mayfair witches, but I didn't find this ending all that satisfying, especially if it's supposed to be the hast hurrah.

I don't read to analyze/dissect the novel or anything like that. I read just for pleasure. I don't care if there's inconsistencies or some other small problems or strangeness in the novel. I only look to be able to share and enjoy the adventures with the heroes; to be drawn into the story. However, I feel alienated from the heroes. They seemed so aloof. There seemed to be no real passion in the story. I don't understand what's missing. I so terribly want to enjoy and like the books."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne Rice, ever since I was in my preteen era I had been reading your literature. Not your witch novels, they never interested me and I didn't feel they held the true power as the novels I did follow, which was the captivating and in- depth Vampire Chronicles. I have read all your vampiric novels and I grew to love most of them. Here is a short review of them all:Interview with the Vampire- Just as fascinating and pondering as the movie itself was.The Vampire Lestat- Even better, the characters kept getting strong and so did your whole plot of the vampires.Queen of the Damned- The movie was a disgrace, but the book was amazingly creative and I loved it.Tale of the Body Thief- One of my most favs, the plot kept me turning the pages. One of your best.Memnoch- Things were a little weird in this story I'm sorry to say. I'm not religious and so this reading was uncomfortable, and I felt I was growing detached from you already there.Pandora- Lovely, like she herself, but dulls in comparison to the others characters cause she herself was never as strong as the male characters story- wise. I liked it though.The Vampire Armand- I found this story to be very emotional and in- depth. The troubled relationship between Marius and Armand I never knew, and they kept me turning the pages. Armand is my fav character besides Louis, so I was happy you gave Armand his story.Merrick- I couldn't finish this story. It was drop dead boring. I don't see why Anne you added your witches with the vampires. What was the point? Honestly I could care less about this Merrick woman. I didn't like your witches and now they invaded the vampires land? Not a good move to me Anne.Blood and Gold- After reading about how Marius raised Armand, I have grown to be cold to him, but his story was almost as interesting. I liked the story, and the reunion between Pandora and Marius was a very powerful point in the Chronicles. I was hoping your Chronicles were picking up again.Blackwood Farm- This is where it all went downhill for me Anne. The Merrick horror came back. Quinn was a flat character and he seemed throughout the book a weak and sexually confused person. The story was weak and bored me almost to tears. It was hard to finish this book, this was not the Vampire Chronicles I remembered. I was hoping for a brighter tomorrow.Blood Canticle- Then I heard you were making one last book...Blood Canticle. I was so excited, hoping you were going to go out with an explosion of the old power you used to have. Then I read it. And all I can say was that, like many other reviewers Anne, I was severely disappointed. You ended the Chronicles I felt in the worse way. For one thing it seemed you merely wanted Lestat's ending- didn't you care about the other vampires anymore? I wanted to know what happened to the others, was it so hard for you to at least write one chapter on their last reunion? I think one thing we fans wanted was to see our vampires one last time. Lestat may have been your favorite, but he wasn't everyones, and we wanted to see our fav vampires one last time. You failed to do that and I felt that was cold of you.And you must have felt your new vampires, Quinn and Mona would satisfy our old vampires need. I don't think so. Quinn was still oh so flat in this story and Mona was just a whiny snot to me I was annoyed with her the beginning you introduced her. She was no strong female like Pandora. Quinn and Mona were two very dull and annoying characters.The writing itself was rushed and instead of writing on vampires, which it should been about, all of a sudden we are worried about a witch problem. Let them fix their own problems in their own series, don't bother the vampire world with the witch's problems I could have cared less. The plot and the writing were boring so throughout the whole story, although I was trying so hard to be hooked, I was detached and bitter.Lestat himself was the overall problem. How boring he has grown, and how silly he sounds throughout most of the novel. He no longer is charming, nor fun to read. He hasn't grown mature, even Marius was interesting and he is mature, Lestat was just weird at the end. Ever since Memnoch honestly the life was basically sucked out of him to me. His personality that was so thick like in Body Thief felt drained through this novel. The religious overtones as well were overdone. For a more spiritual than religious person, I felt very weird with a lot of what Lestat said and did, and that whole romance thing you gave him seemed so silly.I felt I was reading a whole different book than yours Anne. And I think the one thing that hurt the most in a literature way- and I think you should understand most other fans felt the same way- was that it seemed like through the whole book you yourself were dull and lifeless, like the story itself. Like you didn't care anymore about the Chronicles, for it did feel rushed. And also you seemed only to care about how Lestat ended. I felt you cared about the other characters just as much but I really think you only liked Lestat the best and it seemed you only cared for his ending. Why make all those rich characters and then just put all your energy into one at the very end? I didn't like that all.There were many things I found wrong with this book, and I just cannot believe this is the very last. And I also cannot believe you cannot understand why your fans are depressed and angry. Why don't you try sitting back and reading your earlier novels that got you these fans and see how you truly have changed over the years. You have, but it wasn't till Blacwood Farm honestly I started complaining. You changed drastically by that time and many fans like I were confused, for they were not the same stories we loved.I'm glad you have found a good path in your life Anne, more power to you, and I still love you as the author of possibly the most influential vampires ever made, but you ended I must say in a bad way. I'm sad such a great series ended in this way and I wish it hadn't. It is your story I understand, and so I won't say anymore than this review, but I wanted you to hear from a fan why I feel so many others are so angry with you. I am in a way with you too, but I go on- I mean it is merely stories, but stories we loved. You need to see our side if you expect us to see yours. I can see yours, and I understand, but please understand mine as well. Thank you for some good stories Anne regardless of it all, and some unforgettable characters of the past. But the end was not good for many, and you'll have to accept that."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've read most of A.R. books, not just the Chronicles & The Mayfair series & I have to say this is one of the worst. I always thought the \\"New Tales\\" were stretching the story a bit (except Pandora) & this book is the defining reason.Pandora is the exception because it was NEW and INTERESTING. What is the sense in telling the same story over & over & over again as A.R. is propelled to do? Blackwood Farm was excellent & I had high hopes for B.C, also reading on her website that this was the end. Making Lestat GOOD & falling in love w/ Rowan Mayfair? Give me a break. And the Taltos story came to a climax...that never happened. The publisher's reviews also made it seem like Patsy's ghost was throughout the book hassling Quinn. A.R seems to have lost it & I hate to say that. But her prose is awful here - all slang & \\"wanna do this..& that\\" Letsat has learned nothing. Mona quotes Shakespere but can't say \\"want to\\"? Perhaps if she had made this like \\"Queen of the Damned\\" and wrote it from many persepctives. I mean, Mona & Quinn were SO in lust&love, didn't her becoming a vampire affect that? If this is the end of the Chronicles where were the twins, Jesse, Louis, Marius? Didn't they hear Lestat's thoughts about wanting to be a saint? I think what A.R. is essentially telling us is that she herself doesn't want to write about evil anymore. She's done with it. And it's obvious from this failure of a novel."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"And for Anne Rice, that time was about fifteen years ago.Like so many other reviewers here, I too have great love and admiration for most of her early work, but as time passed and the quality of her output grew worse and worse until it was a dismal parody of her one-time greatness, I became disenchanted with a woman I once cited as among my favorite writers. While I agree Anne Rice, seemingly hamstrung by her own pride and over-confidence, could benefit from a compassionate and sound editor to correct her typos and blatant miscarriages of proper grammar, the one thing I truly can't forgive her for is her continuity errors. She contradicts herself from book to book (and nowhere so gracelessly as in this novella) and butchers the timelines and previous events of her characters' pasts. She degrades the legacy of what she once so skillfully achieved.Some might claim it is mean to say these things about Anne Rice, and, yes, it is, but I feel an established writer owes her audience certain things, and chief among those is quality: quality most exemplified by continuing the internal world she's created and not confronting her readers with such obvious errors of previous facts and \\"rules\\". I continued to read Anne Rice's novels right up to this one, but I ceased to take her seriously as a creative talent sometime in the mid-1990's.Anne, thank you so much for the great works you've written. I wish you all the best in the years ahead."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have never given a book a one-star rating before. However, if Blood Canticle is to be compared against Anne Rice's earlier works, such as The Vampire Lestat, Queen of the Damned, and even Blackwood Farm, it deserves a low rating. If you liked Memnoch the Devil, you will probably like this one; the religious ranting, lack of description, abundance of trivial dialogue, and lst draft feel are all there for you to enjoy all over again. Quite frankly, I don't remember Memnoch the Devil; I just remember that I felt this way after I finished it (bored, annoyed, disappointed).FYI, Anne Rice admits on her website that she essentially has full creative control over her books now; her editor doesn't really edit anything. That's clearly demonstrated here; I felt as though I was reading her personal journal. Lestat (she) rambles on and on about Catholicism, sainthood, and the like, and the book is only 300 pages long. It felt to me as though Blood Canticle was written over a long weekend. Mona is annoying, Quinn is a non-entity, and Lestat was a whiny bore.And then, to make matters worse, her prose is horrible! Lestat (Anne) enjoys using words such as gotcha, betcha, baby, yeah, and BOOGIE.Quote from the first page (Lestat writing to the reader): &quot;I know damned well how to be a full-fledged, post-Renaissance, post-nineteenth century, post-modern, post-popular writer. I don't deconstruct nothin'.&quot;Quote from page 7: (Lestat writing to the reader): &quot;All right, okay, yeah, forget about it, so what, stop the hand wringing, sure sure, knock it off, cool it, shove it, eh?&quot;Really charming, Anne. Every few sentences, Lestat (she) halts the story by inserting lame, pointless thoughts to remind us that this is his story. He even uses parentheses to comment about the previous sentence. I was constantly reminded that I was reading a bad book written in Lestat's annoying point of view. Very jarring and unpleasant read. I don't think I've ever winced so much while reading a book in my life. I don't know if A. Rice thought that this style was interesting or brilliant or what, but it's really, really bad. If you're a fan, you'll read it anyway, but please, don't buy it. Get it at the library. Borrow it. Be patient. Just don't pay for it.Looking for a new author with beautiful prose, excellent character development, and a book worth savoring? Try Tigana, by Guy Gavriel Kay. It's long and has a slow build, but it's so, so worth it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Dear, dearest Anne. We love you. But whatever happened with those perfectly defined, coherent, fresh characters of both sagas, and with their convincingly complex worlds? Please, please, give us a great finale worthy of your talent before you change directions. I propose that you write for us a &quot;Book of Revelation. The last Chronicle.&quot;"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Let me start by saying that I have read and loved almost all of Anne Rice's books. However, this book is just truly horrible. Rice has a habit of ruining her characters in the later books that feature them, and this was no exception. The attraction between Lestat and Rowan Mayfair was completely absurd, and Lestat's desire to be a saint was ridiculous. And why, for the love of God, does she have to include the last name of every Mayfair character every time she mentions them, even when the names are spoken by people who know perfecly well who \\"Rowan\\" is without having to specify that it is \\"Rowan Mayfair\\" they are referring to? It is is so painfully redundant that I am beginning to think that she does it to make the books longer. Sorry, but I have to vent a bit. Aside from the terrible content, the style is extremely annoying, with Lestat attempting to use hip words like \\"cool\\" and \\"wanna\\". Rice is just trying way too hard with this stream-of-consciousness, dumb-it-down style. It simply doesn't work and I don't think it's fooling anyone. I really wanted to love this book as I have loved Anne Rice's books in the past, but it was a terribly disappointing end to the series and a sadly unsuccessful melding of her vampire and Mayfair witch stories. It would have been better had she left well enough alone."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Okay? Where do I begin?This book is very condescending toward those who did not like Memnoch The Devil, insulting toward them in the very first or second chapter saying how it out-sold her other vampire chronicles and that those of us who don't like it only don't like it because we don't understand it. There are those who did not like it BECAUSE they understood it!This might come off as controversial of me to state but she has Lestat, the one who questioned everything and who says \\"Wouldn't it be great if no one had to die in the name of God again\\"' in the novel The vampire Lestat. But here in Blood Canticle she has him say \\"Church and state should not be separated.\\" This segregates all of Anne's non-Christian readers, and believe me, she HAD a few. And then he says The Pope is infallible. To call this maturing for the character is a sin.Now let's move on to her little blurb against us \\"Yankees\\" in the North.Deep into the book Lestat makes a comment about a man, and Lestat's saying the man was from the deep south and that's a place where people know how to treat blacks, not like intolerant Yankees. She was calling Northerners racist!And in the statement itself it gives way to the fact that in her mind African Americans are not people in saying the people there know how to treat 'blacks' as if white people are the only people and everyone else is '___ people' like they're an alien species and not Yankees or Southerners in themselves. This ain't 1865, Anne. The war is over, okay!I think she was deliberately trying to offend every one of her fans with this book. She has Lestat, LESTAT- the one who questions everything saying Church and state should not be separated. You know what this says? 'Freedom and justice but only if you're Christian.' Can you really imagine Lestat saying or believing that?Now we talk about redemption. Lestat became a rock star to have some reverence and therefor do some good, he wanted the world to see the evil that walked among them, to know the truth, and for the mythic evil that was never necessary to be wiped out. That was in The vampire Lestat novel.Not quite the same as saying Yankees are racist, that the pope can never be wrong, that church and state should not be separated and chastising a female vampire for being slutty and killing those that worship him even if they beg for their lives... All of which happen in Blood Canticle... Being good and being a religious fanatic are not the same thing, Anne.Yes, he wanted to be a teaching brother when he was twelve, and to quote her own book, he never believed in the religion. He believed in the cleanliness of the place, and he believed in the goodness of the men, but he didn't believe that God inhabited those halls. He saw their order, cleanliness, and teaching to be good- it wasn't about the religious aspect of it. He says this flat out.He never believed in the religious part, he had a secular belief, even then at age twelve, good and evil were all that mattered, it wasn't about the saints and martyrs. You can believe in goodness without believing in being rewarded for good or condemned for evil. There are atheists who believe in right and wrong. He held value to innocents because there may be nothing later. And he did not want innocents to suffer on Earth in case there was nothing after ward to justify their suffering. Doesn't she remember The Vampire Lestat at all? That wasn't about God. It was about good and evil, those were the themes, he wasn't even sure there was an after-life.In this book she has Lestat chastise a female vampire for dressing too slutty. And later the vampire girl apologizes saying Lestat's right. First off, Lestat LIKED modern fashion. His own mother dresses in drag for God's sake and he did NOT disapprove.There are no words to describe how offensive and bad Blood Canticle is. Racist, religiously bias, and sexist.If I didn't know better I'd say this book was deliberately bad and trying to ruin Lestat's reputation."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"You know how sometimes you spend hours and hours on a single work -- an essay, perhaps -- deliberating over each sentence, each word? You do lots of research; you proceed very carefully, making sure each sentence is as great as it could be. You are careful with detail. You take the time to craft that work.OK, you know how sometimes you type a careless e-mail to your friend about your day? Or maybe you're writing in your diary. You don't really care to take the time to be too careful with the imagery or diction. You just write it down for posterity. You just let things flow out.Well, Anne seems to have abandoned the first method for the second. At first I thought it was me. It started with \\"Memnoch the Devil.\\" I just couldn't get into it. With the first four novels of the Vampire Chronicles, I felt as if a whole entire world was popping up around me. A lush and ornate world that was full of grandeur -- details about places in Europe or New Orleans, the texture of the curtains, the ambience of the room, the sound of violins, the ferns. It was all very decadent and, quite frankly, amazing. She created this undescribable feeling that no one else could.Then something went wrong. After she began releasing more books, I realized that it wasn't just me. Maybe Anne was getting sloppy? Maybe she just couldn't sustain her interest in this genre after so many years? Her latest works seem to be written in the same manner that many write in their journals or e-mails. The sense of carefulness, of passion, is gone; it's no longer about the nuances. The subtley is gone. Now it's more like: \\"This happened . . . then this . . . and oh, don't forget about this.\\" There's a stream-of-consciousness quality going on that comes from a lack of precision. Either she didn't outline this current novel, \\"Blood Canticle,\\" at all or it was outlined poorly. I understand Lestat's language will change as time goes on. But \\"yo\\"? \\"Baby\\"? Does he have to sound like a sleazy Hollywood agent? Anne has failed to help readers make that transition; you can't have Lestat speak eloquently and formally in one novel and change his speech so abruptly without having some readers raise objections. His language clearly demonstrates Anne's lack of understanding of how people talk today; instead, she uses language that she thinks people still use today. This is comparable to Kate Beckinsale's \\"Romanian\\" accent in \\"Van Helsing\\"; she used an accent she thinks Romanians use.Let me say that I am a huge Anne Rice fan. I think \\"Interview with the Vampire,\\" \\"The Vampire Lestat,\\" \\"The Queen of the Damned,\\" \\"Tale of the Body Thief,\\" \\"The Witching Hour,\\" \\"Lasher,\\" \\"The Mummy,\\" and \\"Cry to Heaven,\\" were brilliant. And even though I did not love \\"Feast of All Saints,\\" I still thought the details were mesmerizing. Anne had that \\"it\\" factor going on; she cast magic with her books. She had the ability to transport the reader to any place she wanted, to bring people and worlds alive.She's been rather prolific in recent years. Personally, I think Anne should take a break. Stop writing a book or more per year. Find that passion again. Take the time to write something really amazing. I truly believe that she spent more time writing her older works than her newer ones. In spite of the negative reviews of her recent work, she should take pride in the fact that she has other books to be proud of; that many of her previous works have changed people's lives; and that she has left a legacy that many will appreciate in the future. If she doesn't have the passion, she should know it is OK to stop writing for a while and bask in the success she's had with previous novels. After all, even the best writers have written books or stories that have fallen into obscurity because they didn't measure up to their most famous works."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I love this book because I love Lestat too much not to rejoice at the prospect of him finally getting where he was always going. I sympathize with those who long for the brat prince of old, but the series was always largely centered on the quest for meaning and redemption and Blood Canticle concludes this quest beautifully. It would simply be out of character for Lestat, with his vigorous lust for life and dynamic personality, to arbitrarily regress to his old ways. He's a different vampire with every book -- with every chapter of every book even! It's the very fact that he grows that makes me love him so much! He makes innumerable mistakes in his multi-century long existence, but he learns from all of them. The ending of Blood Canticle was a deeply moving culmination of all of his hard-learned lessons and it reduced me to tears of joy. No one who ever really loved Lestat could ask for more."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"As an end to the Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches, this book does both of those series an immense disservice, as it is not a fitting end for either.Ash and Morrigan, the Taltos, should have been left alone if their fate was the best Rice could come up with. While the message Rice is sending there is obvious, it's muddled by the presence of the drug lords, and would have been much clearer and direct if left to the Taltos alone. As for the Mayfairs... Rowan's every action seems forced against her previously established character, and Michael is reduced to her accessory.Over on the Vampire side, Rice mercifully does ignore most of the pantheon of characters she has developed there. Louis, Pandora, Gabrielle, Marius, and almost all the others are allowed to drift away without acknowledgement, a blessing based on the way everyone else is handled. Maharet and Kayman make cameos without really appearing, which is probably also a blessing. As for the rest, Quin, like Michael, is Mona's accessory. Mona is spoiled and insolent, and if you hated reading what had become of her in &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot;, you'll really hate what she becomes here.Lestat, well, he's Anne Rice, not himself. He fully ceases to be his own character and instead becomes his author's mouthpiece, prone to rants and tantrums based on whether or not people like him.As the conclusion to both series, this could have been an epic, but instead it's more of a travesty."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"If I want to read \\"literature\\" where the protagonist uses words like \\"cool,\\" \\"babycakes\\" and \\"pah-leeeze,\\" I'll get into an online argument with a teenaged troll.Anne Rice, you were an amazing writer-- your works were full of beautiful, inspiring prose and muted meditation. Some called it turgid, though others like myself loved it. I bet even those critics are eating their words now. It's like you went from one extreme to another.Doubtless I'll get the trolls coming out of the woodwork with their cries of \\"OH Noes!11! You didn't just diss Teh Greatest Writer Evah!!!1!\\" and the rather mundane and predictable \\"OMG let's see u rite 25 bezt sellaz!!1\\"I don't need to be a farmer to know that pig swill is rubbish; likewise I don't need to be James Joyce to know that five exclamation marks and an undead 18th century French libertine trying to get down with da kidz through L337-speak is never going to be \\"Ulysses.\\"I'll keep hold of the books from \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" to \\"Tale of the Body Thief.\\" They're classics; they're sharp, well-written with great characterisation. If you're looking for quality writing by Anne Rice, try those books. If you've come here to tell people that they're wrong for daring not to like a book, or to roll out the \\"write 25 books\\" line, nothing will persuade you otherwise.Adieu, Lestat. It was fun while it lasted.Also, \\"Lestat\\" didn't write it. Apart from Lestat being a (hugely enjoyable) fictional character, he has been used as a sock puppet by Rice to berate people who recognised Memnoch the Devil to be an insulting rip-off of finer theological works."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I remember when I was first introduced to the wonderful, deeply lyrical and darkly enchanting world of the vampire chronicles for the first time by reading 'Interview with the Vampire'. How I was moved by 'The vampire Lestat', drawn into 'Queen of the Damned' and 'Tale of the Body Thief'. Then I remember how I gradually started to lose interest in these once so colorful, wickedly beautiful characters in 'Memnoch' which took me ages to finish, because it was just, so, very, boring. After that, reading the vampire chronicles became nearly painful, the stories grew more and more colourless, and Rice just kept repeating herself. Blood and Gold was slightly more interesting than the rest, but my hopes were crushed by the lousy 'Blackwood Farm'.Now, I'm the type of person that can't start a series without finishing it, unfortunately, because the characters I once loved have turned into something grotesquely boring and idiotic.My reading the rest of the chronicles made anything better, it feels as if Anne is just writing new books, losing inspiration, forgetting past stories, and how thoose characters FELT in the first place, just to make more money out of her name.So, let me put it in a way that no one can misinterpret. Blood Canticle sucks. I hated it. It's amateurish, bleak and even though all it's overdramatics never delves deeper into any of the people or incidents. And what's with the way Lestat is speaking? I cringed when I read his ghettotalk. And his ramblings about being a saint, his extreme LOVE for christianity. This change from how he was is poorly done, and hardly believable. I didn't think it could get worse than 'Blackwood Farm' really, which annoyed me beyond reason, with all it's sad oh-so-beautifully-tragic people, the overdramatic yet pointless rants etc. But Blood Canticle somehow manages to be worse.Anyone, who like me, fell in love with the first Vampire Chronicles, spare yourself from this! As a matter of fact, don't read the latter Vampire Chronicles, they're basically just boring, and repetetive crap. I won't force anyone, it's hardly possible, and everyone's free to read it and see or themselves what a piece of junk it is. But if you want to keep the image you have of the characters and Rice's style, don't even go near 'Blackwood Farm'.So, now, I will go and sit down with my copy of Interview with the Vampire, and enjoy the Vampire Chronicles when they were worth reading,(because they certainly arent after the 4th book), and try to push this horrid piece of literature in the darkest corners of my mind, where it will hopefully lie until being forgotten."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said by other reviewers? This has to be the worst book Rice has written, and it took an act of will for me to finish it. Rice has said that this is the last of her Vampire Chronicles. I only hope she keeps her word.So why is this book so bad? First of all, the story is thin. Newly made vamp Mona Mayfair (who spends most of the book acting out) wants to find out what happened to her Taltos child. Ok, interestng premise. Could have made for a good story. Mayfair family dynamics come into play--Mona's daughter was fathered by Rowan's husband Michael and Mona's mad at Rowan. Could have been interesting. Oncle Julien haunts Lestat because he's mad that Mona has been vamped. Interesting idea. There are other glimmers of a plot that could work, but mostly they get a superficial, breakneck treatment that reads more like the outline of a longer, more developed novel.However, my major complaint about \\"Blood Canticle\\" (and much of Rice's recent work) is her treatment of her characters. In her earlier works, they were better fleshed out and more complex. In other words, they were believable, and from book to book Rice maintained their integrity. In recent books, however, she's turned them into one dimensional cartoon characters that bear only a superficial resemblance to what they used to be. She manipulates them like puppets to suit her whims--disposing of them off-handedly when it suits her fancy (poor Ash, poor Morrigan, poor Merrick--oops, wrong book). Her characters have lost any psychological reality they originally had. For instance, Mona's just an spoiled, immature brat; Rowan's a controlling Mad Scientist who wants to leave her husband for Lestat; and Quinn (Rice's best developed recent character) is so bland he fades into the woodwork. Even Oncle Julien becomes a incompetent ghostly meddler who can't get anything right. As for Lestat, now he's a do-gooder who wants to become a saint. You know the book is in trouble when it begins with Rice using Lestat's voice to whine about how \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" was misunderstood. Much of the Vampire Chronicles has been about Lestat's moral evolution, but please, give the vamp his fangs back!Part of the problem here is that Rice has written some very good books that conveyed a real sense of the uneartly. \\"Blackwood Farm,\\" Rice's most recent book before this one, was downright creepy and spooky in spots. Even \\"Merrick\\" had an eerie atmosphere to it. \\"Blood Canticle\\" suffers in comparison and does justice to neither of her major series. Both deserved a better sendoff.Vampires & Mayfairs alike, may you rest in peace and be subjected to no further indignities."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"If Anne Rice herself is glad that the series is finished, it only goes to prove how tired the whole lot of books has become.She claims she doesn't need editing. Even Hemingway had an editor. If she weren't such an egomaniac, which is obvious from her rant, Rice would have established an ongoing relationship with an editor that she trusted.She says that she doesn't want to hear someone else's voice blended in with Pavarotti's or Horne's. But if she were at all educated about the opera world, she would know that even the greatest opera singers continue to have teachers help them to hone their craft. Rice believes that she is such a genius that she doesn't need instruction or editing. Well, the continued decline in the literary quality of her books speaks otherwise.This book is truly awful. If she hadn't already had so many books published, no reputable publishing house would have touched it.And no, I have nothing personal against Ms. Rice. I wish her the best. (And I wish she would get an editor rather than rail against the people who actually read her books and see the desperate need for one.)"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This was the most bizarre book I've ever read and I grew up reading R. L. Stine and Stephen King.Anne Rice always liked to depict her vampire characters as gods. They had powers beyond tradition and a physical comeliness that would melt any human heart. I wonder if Anne Rice was writing these stories to entertain the public or herself? I always sensed a bit of selfishness on part of Anne when it came to her characters. Perhaps that is why she doesn't allow fanfiction of her characters?Anyway, as the series progressed, the characters seemed to get more and more beautiful and superstrong. Before long, they had more in common with Dragon Ball Z characters than vampire folklore! A major turn-off for me. The only superpowers the vampires lacked were the abilities to shoot laser beams out of their eyes and say \\"Kamehameha!\\"I think the worst part of Blood Canticle was the point of view and the language chosen to illustrate the novel. It made me cringe and whimper for Emile Zola and, in general, GOOD writers with wondrous stories to tell.As I am an athiest, I also didn't like getting bashed in the head with the persistent god chitchat and Pope worship. If I wanted to be converted to Catholicism, I would turn on the TV and listen to the rambling of some televangelist. But of course, this reason for disliking the novel is purely personal.My third complaint is Anne Rice's ugly usage of the breaking the fourth wall literary technique. Terrible and irritating in its bluntness.When I read, I want to fall into another world, a magical world of words that I can only be pried from once the book is at its end. I don't want to be harrassed or addressed by Lestat(Anne) as incompetant because I don't believe what she does. How foolish, how juvenile.Last, but not least on my list of complaints, is the destruction of the character Lestat. Not for one moment did I feel as if I was seeing through Lestat's eyes. Rather, I felt like I was witnessing Anne Rice's deepest twisted religious dream. Lestat became Anne Rice's ultimate author surrogate.The silliest part of the book was Lestat(Anne)'s visit to Pope John Paul II:\\"I lay my hands upon him(the Pope), and I banish his suffering. A quiet penetrates his limbs. He looks at me with one eye, the other squinched closed as is often his manner, and between us there is suddenly an understanding...\\"Yes, it is sad that the Chronicles are over but only because we will never find out what happened to the other characters, as the majority were not mentioned in this book. Overlooking a few cringe-worthy passages, I found Blackwood Farm to be a decent novel. I read many of Anne's books in English and in Hungarian. I liked Anne Rice. I don't any more. I'm sorry I have to write this but I am compelled to get this out of my system once and for all.We must move on. Let's take out a different book and open ourselves to a new world, another adventure, and leave this sinking ship to be swallowed by the waves."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"The vampires were a metaphor for human struggle, emotion and questioning. It wasn't literally about vampirism. And now we have to deal with a religious tangent from a undead rock star who is certain that the catholic church is absolutely right and infallible and the world is full of sin?Where's all the talk of goodness from The Vampire Lestat? Where's the questioning? Where's the searching and angst? Tell me the angst is still there and I'll be forced to ask you to define angst because then I'd think youwouldn't know the meaning of the word.Don't you see, you make Lestat absolutely sure, and you make sexism okay, he says religion and state should not be separated (can we say Taliban?) yet in the old books Lestat had repeatedly said that it would be great if no one has to diein the name of God and then tell people that maturing means you stop questioning the world around them, now THAT is a bad example. That is not maturing, it's giving up. It takes away some of the humanness of the character that nowhe's certain what the fabric of the universe is made of. It makes the books superficial if there's nothing left to doubt or question. Because being human is to struggle and question, it's no certainty, it's not blind faith. It's life, it's questions, it's facing contradictions and corruption.But now Lestat has lost faith in the goodness of humanity, that secular innocence that he went on about in The Vampire Lestat novel that drew me in. To stop rebelling isn't maturing, it's surrendering. To be maturedoes not mean to give up. You can be very mature and still question the world around you and not denounce others for being provocative when you're A WALKING CORPSE THAT FEED'S ON BLOOD!!!!!This book makes me sick to my stomach when pitted against ANY other vampire chronicle because it's simply not Lestat. If you recall that Blackwood Farm takes place a night before it, he's literally changed this drasticallyover night.You can call this change but Anne Rice should be ashamed of herself in calling it maturing. Don't spit in my face and call it rain.I didn't love the blond hair or the fangs. I loved the personality and now it's not there. There's no trace of him. Yes, people change over time but fundamentally who you are deep down inside, the person you're meant to be, that never goes way. To quote Lestat himself, \\"We never change, we just become more of who we're meant to be.\\" And this creature in Blood Canticle is not apparent in any novel before it. Lestat was a part of Anne Rice, a reflection of Stan Rice. And if that part wasn't there anymore she simply should not have used the name. If that part of herself has been changed or replaced she should have used a new character to express these views instead of going 180 on a James Dean type of character and turn him into George W. Bush.I never felt this passionately about disliking a book in my life. And I THOUGHT I disliked Memnoch the Devil. I could not hate this book so much if I did not love The Vampire Lestat with all of my heart and still do. If I had nothing to pit it against I would say it's just a Catholic right wingpropaganda book and think nothing of it because there are dozens upon dozens of books like that. But if you stand it against The Vampire Lestat and then say this is the same character but he's 'maturing' that concept of maturity scares the Hell out of me. And I'm an adult. If I ever mature like that I want someone to put a gun to my head and pull the trigger, please..."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Allow me, please, to set aside for the moment all the controversy this book as engendered, and point out something I think y'all might have missed.For years now, Rice has been flirting with the idea of her vampires meeting up with modern science. If you've read the books, you know this. Now, with \\"BC\\", she's finally run Lestat up against someone with the education and background to make that a reality: her character Rowan Mayfair, M.D., founder of Mayfair Medical, an institution, we are led to believe, to rival the Mayo Clinic. I read with avid interest to see how she'd finally deal with the question. Answer: she doesn't. How does she manage to avoid it? Because Rowan's (SPOILER!) in luuuve with Lestat! She's in luuuve, and therefore her brains, her experience, her training, her medical genius, her bloody Hipocratic oath, all fly out the window. She's in luuuve, and so this medical prodigy becomes a big, blubbering crybaby.Well, that's insulting. It's insulting to any woman with any intelligence whatsoever, particularly those working in the (still) male-dominated medical field. And it's insulting to her readers who can spot a dodge when they see one.But by that as it may. *I* found it funny.Here's what I think. Rice ended the series as she did, because otherwise, how long could it be before Rowan wakes up, dries up, remembers her Hipocratic oath and all her training and decides to jam a hypodermic into her date? Runs a chromatographic scan on that vampiric blood and finds...what? Anne? Anne? Anne?The series ended because AR, after all these years, still has NO IDEA what such a scan might reveal. Figuring out what it might reveal would mean asking for help, and, as her statements regarding editors show, Ms. Rice has a problem with that. It would mean surrendering to the world of reality, to science, to the rejection of Arguments of Authority and to the tyranny of numbers. Anne doesn't like numbers. She's said so.Ah, well, as Barbie (TM) once whined, \\"Math is hard!\\"So farewell, Anne Rice. Good luck with that next, non-vampiric novel. Waiting to see the sales on that one.(Of course, there's always this possibility: That Lestat already KNOWS what such a scan would reveal, and THAT is why, despite his great love for Rowan Mayfair, M.D., he's holding back. He knows, and the news ain't good, for him or for any vampire. Just a thought.)[...]"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Rice's novels use to hold me captive. I could sit for hours reading her works as if they were made from fine wine (gee I sound like Lestat now). Since MEMNOCH THE DEVIL the Vampire Chronicles have gone down hill. Except for PANDORA and VICTORRIO, the other installments are the same story over and over again. The Armand and Marius based books are the same minus a handful of chapters and both repeating stories already told in THE VAMPIRE LESTAT. Now with this addition we have to go through BLACKWOOD FARM again. And Why do we have to go through the history of Taltos again? I was very disappointed. I loved the WITCHING HOUR. I is my favorite! But now the characters of Rowan and Michael seem so fake so not what they used to be. Sadly this book was a disappointment."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This is not a good way to end the series. It is a cowardly thing to end just because somebody criticized you. So much has happened since the last book. Ok, This isn't a personal attack but Anne Rice should not just give up because somebody gave her negative feedback. People always get criticized, you put alot into your work and when people insult your work it can feel like they insult you. But you don't just give up, you make more and challenge yourself till you perfect your work. All artists endure this .Think about it? Really, think about that and think of all the artists and authors who endure that? Aside from that this could be perfected and much better, everybody goes through this and does a few bad ones or a series of not as good work. You don't give up! You perfect it and keep working. This book wasn't her best, the storyline wasn't as good, the characters weren't at their best. It just wasn't exciting and if Anne Rice could just keep challenging herself like a good author does, then I think fans could forgive her current meltdown on fans. Which I'm sure she has been through alot of pain. I'm such a huge fan and didn't like the way it ended and the treatment many endured over fanfiction(which should be flattering to an author) and criticism of the reviewers who had an opinion which usually ends with a better book the next time or a challenge all artists and authors endure. Come on! I'm waiting for a new addition... I'll buy it when it comes out. Also take time on it and not worry about how quickly it is made. Something tells me Lestat and The Chronicles aren't over yet..."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I originally purchased Mrs. Rice's latest book when it was first released in hardcover. I read it immediatly and enjoyed it. I have been a fan of Lestat's since I first read The Vampire Lestat, and was glad to see his return. And while I don't particularly care for Mona, I can see how she is essential to the plot of the story and to tying the Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches together. While it is not my favorite of the Chronicles I did like it. I have been reading her work for the last eight years and have never been disappointed. And while I do think that everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, the manner in which one iterate's that opinion needs to be done tactfully. In other words, name-calling is something to be left on a children's playground, and not in a 'place' of commerece. If you didn't like the book put it down, sell it, whatever and don't keep offending yourself. That's something I fail to understand, why people when they find something that offends them keep subjecting themselves to it. If you don't like, leave it. I have read how many of you didn't like how Mrs. Rice ended her Chronicles. As a writer she has the right to end her own creation however she sees fit. And, as a writer myself, I understand that. Just because she's a best selling author doesn't mean she has to write to please an audience; she has to write what she knows and how she sees. Like I said if you don't like the book don't keep subjecting yourself to it. And while I am sad to see the end of the Chronicles, I see the book as an understandable end. Lestat will be forever; the Chronicles cannot go on for eternity. Lestat was Lestat before we came to know and watch him, and he'll be Lestat long after we are gone. 'Canticle' gives as much closure to an immortal life that is possible. I believe that it isn't designed to make us think that that's the end of Lestat; but to make us see that he's immortal, that he will keep going; we just don't get to follow along anymore. A wonderful book, full of Mrs. Rice's execptional talent with words and story weaving."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I love the Vampire Chronicles. I love Anne Rice. I love Lestat and Louis and Marius and Armand and Daniel and even Gabrielle, though you don't typically see much of her. These are some very simple maxims.So, why don't they apply here?Well, because none of the things I loved were present in the Blood Canticle. No Louis, Amrmand, Marius, Daniel, David, or even Gabrielle.And, though I'm ashamed and sad to say it, Anne Rice wasn't even there.I am sorry to see Stan Rice go. He was a talented and wonderful man that will be missed worldwide. I can't even begin to comprehend how Anne feels right now, and I don't think I would even be able to endure that pain as well as she does.However, the Blood Canticle is a disgrace. It was poorly constructed, written, and edited. It hearkens back to all the old fanfiction I see so often created. In fact, I believe I've read at least a dozen fanfics that stay truer to the characters and to the beautiful style with which the old Anne wrote.Lestat does not say 'yo', and if he did he would put class and beauty into it. It would be ironic and funny. But when Lestat says 'little bro' as he did in the Blood Canticle, there was no taste or elegance.Description lacked severly, and the dialoge held no wonder or poetry.I'm sorry Stan died. But that is no excuse for shoveling out this 'novel' without a second glance.This is no grand finale."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is the worst effort by Anne Rice. It feels like she phoned it in. I always hoped that she would merge the Vampire Chronicles with the Mayfair Saga. This is a sore disappointment. Lestat's quest for sainthood and his sudden passion for Rowan Mayfair are so far fetched it is almost funny. I will sincerely think twice before picking up another of Ms. Rice's books. Perhaps her genius departed with the unfortunate passing of Stan Rice. Maybe her stories could be more foreceful if she concentrated on one book per year like most other writers instead of cranking out two per year as has been the case lately. If you are contemplating reading this book, don't bother, save your time. This is the flop to end all flops."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Perhaps it is time for Anne to leave the vampires and move on to new subjects. I have enjoyed some of Anne's previous novels that had nothing to do with Vampires, particularly \\"A Cry to Heaven\\". Sometimes a writer just wears out a subject and I think Anne may have reached that point.I vacillated between giving this 3 or 4 stars and settled on 4 just because it's Anne, because she lost Stan, and because I'd like to see her continue to write and hopefully produce novels like she used to.The things that are right with the novel are many. Anne still can make you see what's happening with her prose. When I read this I can see New Orleans, I can see that graveyard and swamp behind the house, I'm there. She does try and bring many (but not all) of the threads from both the vampire chronicles and the Mayfair Witches to a conclusion. A nice gesture if you're really going to leave the subject. I did notice though that there is ample opportunity to write another one (or many) novels with the introduction of Lestat and Rowen's love. I felt Lestat blasting us about not liking previous works and telling us that he wants to be a saint is quite OK. That's Lestat!The thing that did annoy me with this novel the most was Anne/Lestat's \\"new\\" narrative style. I suppose that it's supposed to be new and edgy and as one reader suggested Lestat is allowed to change, including his narrative style, but I miss the prose that I just gushed about in the proceeding paragraph. The \\"Pope is wonderful\\" rant was a little off-putting since I would think that Lestat would think himself above such matters, but you must remember he is a French Catholic. I must admit that after the first book on the Mayfair Witches they have not been my favorite subject that Anne has written about. And I guess I've always been a little irritated that she combined the Witches with the Vampires.Yes, I'll read Anne's next book if it's about Vampires or about turnips. I have been disappointed in some of her efforts and enthralled by others. She's human (even if her alter ego isn't) and she's going to have good, bad and mediocre efforts. I won't give up because of a couple of stinkers.My star ratings:One star - couldn't finish the bookTwo stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the authorThree stars - enjoyable read. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection. Would judge other books by the author individually.Four stars - Liked the book. Would keep the book or would look for others by the same author.Five start - One of my all time favorites. Will get a copy in hardback to keep and will actively search out others by the same author."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne Rice's husband was diagnosed with a brain tumor when this book was being written and obviously, her work suffered because of it. The book is a threadbare cloth compared to the rich tapestry of detail characteristic of most of the Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches Series. In spite the this and curious and constant use of \`yo' and \`dude', it was a decent read up until the last chapter, but then things went really wrong. Anyone familiar with The Mayfair Witches Series (The Witching Hour, Lasher &amp; Taltos) should skip skipping the last chapter of Blood Canticle because although you get the point, you will never believe it.However, the most disappointing aspect of the novel is the missed opportunity. Three characters, Michael Curry and Rowan and Mona Mayfair are struggling with the loss of their children. As a mother who tragically lost a child to leukemia, Anne Rice could have really written something truly significant, but did not. Much is said about the toll on the characters, but very little insight is given about their internal conflicts.Sadly, Anne Rice has said is through with the Vampires and the Mayfair Witches. Hopefully, as time passes, she will change her mind and write an ending worthy of her two best loved series."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is the worst of all the serie. And these are supposed to be vampires? Vampires who don't dare to kill?Louis was so special in the first books because he was like a coward lion who didn't dare killing humans... now Lestat ended being worse than him!Rowan's affair with him is not believable and so forced. The only good thing in this book were Quinn and Mona, she was the one telling exactly the things I had in my mind while reading, yet Lestat insulted her and behaved like a teenager in love insted of the ancient vampire he's supposed to be.While reading Lestat talking about the church, the pope and even giving us a biography of a saint, I never believed it was him... instead I kept listening Anne's voice there. It was not him but her.Also, it's full of secondary characters that show up once and then vanish from the story after we were given a full introduction to each and every one of them... there's too much description of non-meaningful things...It took me two months to end this book. In the middle, I finished Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and Shelley's Frankenstein.I guess that speaks for itself.I really hate this review, because Anne was one of my fave modern authors, but I must go with the rest, the last books are terrible... it makes me sad... what's worse... we'll never get an ending to this serie... after so many books, we'll never know how it ends...*sighs missing Armand and the old good times*"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am sorry to say that this book realy does not live up to the previous books in this series. It seemed not to be even written by the same author. Mrs. Rice seems to be stretching to get just one more book out of the character lestat."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Boogie???!!! Yo?!!!! Lil Bro?!!!!!!!!!!!!How about &quot;Kill Me&quot;? How about &quot;I want a refund&quot;?Anne Rice has ruined everything she has done with \\"Blood Canticle\\". She has become a soulless machine that churns out garbage. There is nothing wrong with success and if someone offered me that much money, I would sign on the dotted line. But how about a book every 2 years? How about this, if you don't have anything new to bring to the series, then don't write. Get an original idea, take a break, take a vacation, take a pill... do anything but write tripe like this.She has destroyed her career and alienated her fans. She has become a parody of herself. And what's even more tragic, she thinks she has relevance. She thinks that what she has to write about is valued and worthy of a reader investing his time and 28.00 bucks. Deluded is best way to describe her. Even better, she has become a legend in her own mind. I suggest we stop buying her &quot;work&quot;. That is only way that this will ever end."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"If you have missed reading any of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles or her Mayfair Witches books you may find your missing some information when you read this book. I highly recommend reading all of her Vampire Chronicles and Mayfair Witches books in the order they were published. I have read them all with the exception of this book twice. I found the second read to be better than the first! I finished chapter 14 of this book last night. I started reading it two days ago. Anne Rice sure has a way of keeping you from putting the book down! I have only the greatest respect for her works. She has been a master in bringing the two stories together. They are indeed works of art!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This is my 1st Anne Rice book. Thank you to everyone who reviewed it. I didnt read all of the reviews just a few and with such a response both pro and con, I had to read the book and see what all the fuss was about. Well, I am very glad I did. I loved it! I loved the concept ,the story and the characters . I especially loved the character of Lestat and the love he had for Rowan. I plan on getting all of the other books! I cant wait to meet all of the characters again."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Once again Anne Rice out does herself. This book picks up where the witch serices and Blackwood Farm ends. It is an easy and enjoyable read. It answered all of my questions that I had after reading the Witch series. I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved this book! I loved it so much that i read it in only 3 sittings, and that's amazing for me! It usually takes me at least 10 reading sessions to get through a whole book (i'm not saying that this book is too short, just that i was so excited to find out what was going to happen that i read for long periods of time).Just make sure that you read &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; before reading this book, because it's basically a direct continuation of it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am a die-hard fan of Anne Rice. I truly believe she is one of the best fiction authors of our time and that Lestat is one of the best-written characters. Of course he has to change! There's just no way our Brat Prince would be the same after having seen all the things he's seen and done all the things he's done. He saw God Himself for goodness sake! Frankly, if Lestat HADN'T changed from the character he was in The Vampire Lestat I'd be disapointed. He was never meant to be a static character. Congratulations, Ms. Rice, on a job well done. A truly fitting end to a wonderful, magical series."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I truly enjoyed \\"Blood Canticle\\", I am in avid reader and fan of anne's and i was delighted to see lestat back in the driver's seat for this book! i dont find it racist (i'm black and native american and i dont understand how someone could call it so). lestat's use of modern lingo was enjoyable and i thought the wit used through out the book was wonderful, if you dont like the book dont trash it on the internet put it away and read something else :)."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Up to about 3 years ago, when Blood and Gold was published, I was a great fan of Anne Rice. I loved her style of writing, and her characters. I loved her beautiful use of the English (and other European) languages, and the marvelous way in which she weaves history into her plots. In fact, the very first Anne Rice book I have read is Ramses the Damned. And from that time, I fell in love with her writings, especially her Vampire Chronicles.That is, until her recent works came along. When they were first published (Merrick, Blackwood Farm, and Blood Canticle), I, being the faithful fan that I am, wanted to look at her books. But I found myself skimming them and utterly bored by them. Most of all, I did not like the direction that she had taken with Lestat. Which I suppose is what most fans are thinking.That was 3 years ago. A month ago, I decided to try reading those books again. When I was done with these books, I wondered why I ever thought they were 'bad' to begin with. I am ashamed that I ever skimmed them in the bookstore when they were first released. Anne Rice's abilities hold true in these most recent books, and so what if her characters change (by this I mean Lestat, who is quite a different person in Blood Canticle, isn't he?), and are no longer the ones we expected from her earlier books? Taken by themselves, these books are still excellent pieces of fiction, with interesting storylines, and her abilities as a writer are apparent in them. I think that Anne Rice should not be judged for trying to change her characters: why shouldn't they evolve as she does? Should we, as her fans, admiring an artist's work of creativity, EXPECT the artist to CONFORM to our preconceived standards? Doesn't make sense, right?Which is why I say now, to those who think the book was 'no good', 'horrible', 'poor', read it again. Give it another chance. I certainly did, and I'm not disappointed. I am, to say the least, still a fan, ESPECIALLY considering this latest piece."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"As I was reading this-I was reminded of those terrible moive adaptations of INTERVIEW W/A VAMPIRE & QUEEN OF THE DAMNED-even worse I was mostly reminded of that infinitely bad adaptation of EXIT TO EDEN[even the plots were similar]-I kept seeing Rosie O'Donnell as Rowan & Dan Aykroyd as Lestat. This was painful as I've been a fan of Anne Rice since I was twelve-I'm twenty-nine now & this is the last Anne Rice book I will buy. Someone here said something about relevancy which I disagree with-as I see it any kid playing VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE could make a better story & probably already has-therefore this book anyway has no relevancy at all. If you are into vampires stay away from this book-its terrible-just go back & reread the first three or find some other dark fiction to read."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"The story content of this book was very interesting to me. I wished that maybe there was some more debt into the Taltos but alas, I have lots of wishes.With this being the last book in the Chronicles and especially from Lestat's eye, it left me with NO closure. I was impressed that for once she didn't have Lestat turn someone, but to just end it and leave the world wondering what happenes is very frustrating to me. With this being the last book in the series, I personally was looking for some closure for the characters. Or should I say more closure. Even if it is just an Epilogue to sum it all up.I do not think of this book as a bad book. I enjoyed reading it. I can not say that it was bad. When the plot was in focus I was enthralled!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Ooooh, maybe Anne Rice will re-write the Bible for us. I hope she makes Jesus all erotic, too.Will someone please wake me up when this millenium is finally over?"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I read this novel shortly after it was first published; Anne Rice turned me back on to reading after a few year's absence while in high school. I became interested enough in literature to become a Lit. major, and although I've certainly moved on to other authors, I still pick up any new Rice books when they come out.I'm very surprised at some of the reviews I've read here. Yes, Anne Rice is considered commercial fiction; you can expect an occasional cheesy line or scene you're not happy with as a reader. However, looking over many of the reviews, I question the fact that some of these reviewers actually READ the book, because they've some important literary elements of the novel that perhaps might not be visible on the surface but are certainly not too hard to find. Think about it: was 'Interview With a Vampire' about a vampire? Certainly. But if you missed the obvious undertones related to loss and religion, Rice might not be the best read for you.If you didn't get anything more out of 'Blood Canticle' than the surface story, which I don't believe was her best but certainly not her worst, ask yourself what you're missing.And then read it again."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've always been a fan of Anne Rice way back when I discovered &quot;Interview&quot; when I was a freshmen in High School. I've read every single one of her Vampire books, as well as a few others like Servant of the Bones.I bought this book the day it came out, hoping for a wonderful classic ending to the Vampire Chronicles. After reading Canticle, I cant say I wasnt disappointed. I personally wasnt offended by Letstat's rant about Memnoch/being a Saint, I found it a way to lighten up the book. But to me this is not the Anne Rice of old - where are our beautiful descrptions, where is the elegant language? Plot wise, this book is horrible. To be the end of the Chronicles it seems to me that this was more about the Taltos! All of the &quot;loose threats&quot; remaind untied. Overall, I give it 3 stars because its by Anne Rice and its a Vampire Chronicle - I cant really make myself dislike it, I did enjoy reading it. But it definately wasnt as good as I expected, and it was a horrible way to end the great Vampire Chronicles that I've enjoyed so long."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I thought Anne was getting herselt together with Blackwood Farm, but it seems she just fell apart witrh this book. I adored all of her books from the time i was 13, and i had hopes this one would be better then it was.The main part of it was boring, and at times, i fought not to just throw it acros the room. It got mildly interesting towards the ending, but not enough to redeem it really. I will not be being this new, that's definite.Thought i would add to my review even if it has been awhile. Who knew that a few bad reviews would throw the author into such a tissy? granted, she wrote it, and i'm sure to her, it was her best ever. But, we, as people, are entitled to our opinions. My opinion of this book has not changed, i still think it's not her best. When held up to her previous novels, it falls short. I think she should have kept the mayfairs role in the last couple books to a minumum."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne Rice you should have done what Michael Jordan should have done, retire as the greatest; instead you have ended the wonderful saga of the Vampire Chronicles in shame and embarrassement. I love you Anne, but I'm so dissapointed."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Having just finished this book, I had to put down in words my dismay at all the reviews that blasted it.I understand why some people don't like it. This is not the Lestat they thought they knew. The style of the story is different. And there are none of the friends we have come to know and love, like Louis, Armand and Marius.But if you stop and think back over the whole Vampire Chronicle series, you will see that this book (hopefully not the last as Anne Rice has said) was inevitable.Lestat wants to be a saint; He tells us this almost from the very beginning. He talks about it as if there was nothing left for him to be but a saint. This is not the Lestat we have seen in some of the other Chronicle books. That Lestat was seen as evil, and as &quot;Cain, the slayer of my brother&quot;. But you have to remember that Lestat's words have only been used in four of the previous nine books. Louis told us the story in Interview with the Vampire, Armand told his own story, David told us of Merrick, Marius gave us the rest of his tale in Blood and Gold, and Quinn Blackwood told us the story of Blackwood Farm. When these others talked of Lestat, they were not using his words, his style. Blood Canticle is the first book to use Lestat's own words since Memnoch the Devil.And why wouldn't he have changed his manner of speaking in that time? Lestat is the one who, learning from the example of Marius, always found a way to fit in with the times he was living. So one of the lines is the book ends with !!!!!!! Isn't that the way people do things today in the world of Internet chat and email? Why should we be surprised that Lestat is doing it?As for his wanting to be a saint, think back in the Chronicles to a time someone said, &quot;As we get older, we do not really change. We just become more and more ourselves&quot;. Re-read The Vampire Lestat. Since he was a child, Lestat dreamed of being a saint. As he gets older, and becomes more and more himself, his earliest dreams and desires would surely come back stronger than ever.I won't talk of the story, because the story tells itself. It is a typical book in the Vampire Chronicles in that for the first little while, you may be confused, thinking nothing is happening in sequence, or meshes with anything else in the story. But then it all starts coming together, as it always does, and you have trouble putting it down.This is not the best of the Chronicles (See Memnoch the Devil). Nor is it the worst. It may not be the best way to end the series (if it is truly finished), but it a very good story, a very good read, and is very true to the Lestat we saw in The Vampire Lestat, Queen of the Damned, The Tale of the Body Thief and Memnoch the Devil. This character has grown into the times. And that's what is making people say this is a bad book; He's not the same. Good for him!This is not a bad book. It's good book.

Unfortunately it wasnt one of Anne Rice's best. Read it, but dont expect much. And Mona, what an irritating character."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm an avid Anne Rice fan and have read everything she's written. I also heard this was to be her last book, so I assumed she'd do some concluding and wrapping up. She did do that, but in a very clumsy, simple, uninspiring way. The beginning with Lestat's narration was hilarious! I'm a huge fan of Memnoch so that little diatribe made me chuckle. But what started so well did not continue on the same vein.I loved the Mayfair Witches and Merrick and Blackwood Farm seemed to begin to bring them together better than I thought would happen. This book, however, forced everything together way too fast with no real inspiration or effort behind it. And too many pages were wasted on the pointless. Why bring in Quinn's mother's ghost? It went no where. I had hopes for Julian's ghost but it was superfluous in the end! I disliked the lack of other vamps. There was no real flushing out of characters or of situations. Everything was tied up way too easily.I did read it in two days. it was only about 300 pages. I guess that's the other issue. 300 pages is not enough to do what needed to be done to bring both of these majestic chronicles to an end. If this truly is the end. However, it was not the worst of her writing and considering what she's gone through, I just wish she would have either waited or never written this."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book needs to be made into a movie. The Mayfairs mixed with Lestat is an adreneline rush that keeps moving."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Okay, so it's not her best novel, but far from her worst, either. Yes, there are a few typos and phrases in need of editing, but any fan of Anne Rice should be accustomed to that. The errors aren't distracting enough to prevent the reader from enjoying the narrative. Seeing as I read it in just a few sittings, I have to say that Rice still has a gift for making you want to turn the page. One strong point of the book, for me personally, is that it includes her most interesting characters: Rowan Mayfair, Lestat, the Taltos, Michael Curry, Mona Mayfair, and Quinn Blackwood. In some ways, it's more of an extended character sketch than a story with a solid plot. It's a little more introspective than her previous vampire books. Some of the soliquoys, I found myself skimming over. But, considering it turned out to be the final book in both the Mayfair Witches and Vampire series (despite the open-ended conclusion which would suggest a sequel, Rice has stated that she won't write any more vampire or witch tales), it does tie things up fairly well. I don't want to include any spoilers here so I can't get too specific. But if you are a fan of either the Vampire or Mayfair books, you won't be dissappointed. The worst part about the book, reading it after Rice's conversion, is knowing that it's the end of the series and there won't be any more. I just hope her conversion doesn't prevent her from allowing some of her books to be adapted to film."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have now concluded the entire group and enjoyed every book.

I remember seeing the previews of the movie Interview, when i was 12. However i really got into them until i was 16.Anyway....I was kind of dissapointed, first of all let me tell you! j/K. I don't really like the whole witches thing, it kind of made it seem like a freak show, like a bunch of freaks were reuniting.I think many people did not feel like it was a finale, but was more like a weak lingering.And about lestat's love interest, i was not too into her either, did not know why he got into her.However, the whole religious thing Lestat went through i think that it suits his personality and would be expected. It seems that at the end (death) everyone who is anyone gets spiritual and wants to get closer to God. Look at the works of any famous person, writers, composers, all religious in subject at the end.Anyway, just to put in my two cents, it would have been interesting if at the end Louis and Lestat would have ended up toghether. However, I don;t think it would have lasted.I think that what bugged people so much about it is that it ended semi-realistically, he ends up wandering trying to find something else to do, which will he be doing the rest of his life, until he gets bored, and can't find anything else and decides to kill himself. I think that people expected was a romantic ending. I think that he is never really going to back to Rowan, and turned her into a vamp. I think that he left her for good, he did not want to ruin her life. I seriously think that at this point Lestat had gotten bored of life and when he left that was it, I mean literally, i think he killed himself afterwards or a few months later. And no i don't think i'm exagerating or reading too much into it.I would love to hear any opinions regarding my interpretation, and I don't know if someone's already comed up with this, but if they did, hey, i just tought about it right now.Sonia G.23"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I absolutely adore Anne Rice's writing, and this book, for me, definitely did not disappoint. Although, like many others of her readers, I am sad to know that this will be the last one in The Vampire Chronicle...I am pleased that Lestat's \\"blood song\\" was fitting of what the last book should have been."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"As a long time fan of The Vampire Chronicles, I can't help but hope this book was not the last about all the characters we have all come to care about. While it was clever to pull the two sagas (the vampires and the Mayfairs) into one story, this book really concluded nothing, and very little actually happened in this novel. The story is rather weak and does not give us a final wrap up on Louis or Armand or Marius or David, not even on Lestat really. The end of the book leaves my hopes up for more to come and maybe a concluding novel that will do the series justice. It's worth reading if only just to visit briefly with the characters and world readers have come to know. Not Anne's best work - but we should all give the lady a break. I think (and hope) there will be more to come."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne should have taken some time off to grieve, and not to write this book. It is the worst of them all. I skipped entire chapters that were poorly written. My thirteen year old nephew speaks like Lestat. What a disappointment. Get it out of the library, so you don't have to pay for it, if you don't believe me. DON&quot;T BUY THIS BOOK&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm not sure how to respond to all this fuss, except to say, in the simplest of terms...I liked the book! I did! I, who've been a fan since I was 12, who at 13 prayed for Louis to come to me (always Louis, by the way, or Armand), I who have loved to hate Lestat the Blond for years and years... I just liked it!I don't understand what was wrong with it. It was readable. Lestat, if anything, was more Lestat than ever - though as and avowed Louis-Girl (whatever else that makes me) I'm not sure how much of a complement that is... However, Lestat is like Essence of Lestat for me here. Why do you all hate his gangsta speak? He's always spoken in a bizarre but sweet mixture of high fallutin' fancy talk and gutter trash slang. He's always been a bit of a baby! But we love him for his contrasts, do we not? Or we love to hate them, in my case.I love Lestat, but he is so blond and so bizarre, and perhaps that's why I can see how he has evolved into this character in Blood Canticle. It's ineveible! Why must he pander to pretentious goths everywhere who need psuedo-intellectual speak to like a book? He learnt from Sam Spade, remember? He's Lestat, baby!Enough on Lestat's voice. Live with it! I need to talk about the book itself. What the hell is wrog with it? Oh, it isn't my favourite chronical, it would have gotten five stars if that were the case. Lestat, dear boy, couldn't hold my attention for that long! But I liked it, as I said. I've liked all of them. And the Mayfair trilogy, also, and to see it all brought together brings a powerful sense of excitement to me. Why do you hate the witches? Why do you hate the Taltos? Why do you want to see our lovely vampires caught in the same storylines over and over and over? In fact, it seems like you all want 'The Vampire Lestat' and 'Queen of the Damned' rewritten ad nausium. To be honest, as a fan, that seems absurd to me. I want more! I want change! I want evolution!The melding of the storylines was inspired, I thought. I adore Quinn. Mona is a sweetheart. Rowan and Michael weren't all they could be, sadly, but rarely is there a happy ending. The Taltos were as fascinating and brilliant as ever. Lestat's wanting to be a saint was so damn Lestat that I laughed when I read it - in a good way. Of course he wants to be a saint! Hasn't he always! He only ever wanted to do evil if he thought it would do good. Our Blond Boy has always been a moral creature, whether you care to admit it or not. And he knows very well that he can't be a saint, which makes him want it even more. Always the case! One of the eternal themes of the Chronicals has been redemption, whether the seeking of it, the spurning of it, or the final admitance that it simply can't be achieved. Simply ridiculous that people haven't picked up on this.This isn't my favourite novel, but it is a good story. And I'm absolutely heartbroken that it's the last, but we shouldn't attempt to view this story as the pinnacle of a decade spanning series, but simply see it for what it is - a very good story.And we mustn't forget that Anne is the author, not us. Give the woman the respect she deserves, you bloody ingrates! And you call yourselves fans."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"While I don't think it's Anne Rice's best the story in the book was entertaining to me. I had been waiting to find out what happened after the end of Blackwood Farm.

A lot of people hated Memnoch too, but it was a really great book."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"If Opinions are allowed on Amazon, why shouldn't they be allowed by the author herself? Wonderful book, deeply moving and warm. Lestat, as in Memnoch, questioning the world as we all do as mortals and always looking for answers other than the obvious.

For those of you giving it bad ratings, you are so incompetent that you don't understand anything about the book. I've e-mailed Ms. Rice, and to me she seemed disappointed with you people for being so inhumane and unforgiving. I very much agree!I understand the character of Lestat more than all the other books now. Ms. Rice has really nailed him this time. He exactly as she describes him, arrogant, sophisticated, fun-loving, well-dressed, savvy, hilarious, insane, wanting-to-be-a-saint, chararismatic and smart! If you want the old Lestat back, whatever, go for it. I personally like the hip Lestat better.However, Ms. Rice is almost at her best in this book. It is deeply detailed, perfectly portrayed, and a sensational hit! I do agree with those you say it isn't right for children. Children are too immature, and they don't understand the concept, just like some of these adults. I myself am thirteen, yet I understand the book completely. So mature a little, then go ahead and re-read this lovely novel.I've been reading the Chronicles since I was 11, and I'm am totally enamored of Lestat's character. I have also read The Witching Hour, Lasher, Taltos, Pandora, and Vittorio the Vampire. I read at college level, so I know good books when I read them.The perversion of these attacks personally affect me and all others who are fans of Anne Rice. You insult her, you insult me. Is it not enough that her husband has died, and that she is under enormous pressure from these worthless fiends who write obscene comments about her? Guess not. Why don't you just take a baseball bat to her and work her over a while? That ought to satisfy your cruelty.And for the record, this is probably just a waste of time. You people are so wrapped up in yourselves that you carenon-whatsoever for others. You don't even deserve the right to apologize to Ms. Rice. You utterly disgust me.Also, you attack Ms. Rice herself with comments such as ,\\"Go mourn your dead husband.\\" or \\"Good thing she stopped writing.\\" You know what? YOU try dealing with the death of a loved one and stil continuing your career. Anne Rice is writing for a living, so why don't you insult some business owner or a cashier at a store? Hmmm???You can bite me for all I care! You are pathetic imbeciles just looking for attention! Leave this poor woman alone! Just don't mess with her!However, it is unfair of me to insult you if I don't even know you that well.(Might want to take THAT hint...) Anyways, I apologize. Blood Canticle was a really great book! It was my favorite of all the Chronicles. It really does hurt me that people would say such nasty things like Ms. Rice didn't write the novel, or she could have done better. I was sorrowful to learn that this was the last of a series I enjoyed so much, but all good things must come to an end. You can't expect the author to live forever, or people to commit to the series.That being said, I hope this will help reviewers out there to take in what I've said. Thank you for your time to read this, and please think this review over.P.S. Lestat is not a wuss! He is a brave, compassionate, tortured soul!!!! He is my hero!

Despite the mostly harsh reviews, I have to say that this book wasn't bad at all. I agree that it is perhaps not the ending to the Chronicles that we all hoped for, but that is because we have all grown to love our Brat Prince, Lestat. We have an image of how he should be in our minds, and being human, change is hard when we grow to expect things from someone or something. Like many of us, Blood Canticle was just another phase in Lestat's eternal life. As for Mona- I admit, the idea of merging the Witches and Vamps didn't appeal to me either. However... we love Anne Rice because she paints a \\"real\\" picture for us in her novels. That said, with the power of our Mayfair Witches, and the power of our Vampires, wasn't it inevitable that they cross paths- after all... there is only so much paranormal and supernatural happenings that can occur in New Orleans. Mona was meant to be a vampire. I'd rather her be a Vampire than dead. Mona allows the Vampire Chronicles to live in. You know Mona, the Power Slut, the genius, the witch. She is now our \\"Brat Princess\\" in the world of vampires. Who better to take that title than Mona? Yes... Lestat did whine a bit... But for the love of heaven, wouldn't you if you lived two hundred years, and went through things one can only imagine? If you seen God and creation, and knew it was real, then I would want to be a saint too. I'd be scared not to be, or scared to at least not try.Good job, Anne... This is just another chapter, and I think it was just fine."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I enjoyed Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, and I really liked the Lives Of The Mayfair Witches series, so I was greatly looking forward to reading Rice's newest effort. &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is one of those books where you can't quite decide if you love it or hate it. There isn't really one coherent plot, instead we get several mini-plots; Lestat's continuing search for redemption, Mona Mayfair's rebirth into the vampire life and search for her missing Taltos daughter, Julien and Stella Mayfair's haunting of Lestat, the supernatural chaos at Blackwood Farm and more. The problem is that there are so many things going on that none of them are fully delineated or explained. Why did Mona, who bore a Taltos, develop this bizarre wasting disease while Rowan, who bore two, did not? Why does Lestat become so passionately obsessed with Rowan Mayfair? What has happened to Rowan to make her so mentally unstable that she would throw herself at Lestat the way she does? How did the Taltos get to their &quot;secret island&quot; and take it over, and how were they in turn overrun by druglords? Why is Mona such a brat (and who really uses words like &quot;egregious&quot; in everyday conversation anyway?)? What is Oncle Julien's PROBLEM?Another problem I had with &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is Rice's prose. While I normally enjoy her lush, descriptive language, this book descends from word one into shameless melodrama and stays there. It's written from Lestat's P.O.V., so the whole thig is one dramatic, overdone, rambling stream of consciousness with words after words, so many words, oh my goodness the thoughts and feelings and emotions and...well, you get the idea. Wonder if Valium works on vampires? &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is the literary version of an oversized fancy dessert; luscious and sugary but you can get surfeited pretty quickly."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This is not only her worst effort , it's one of the most Dull,Laughable ,and Unreadable books EVER !!! Oh yeah none of the other vamps are here in case you were wondering, BTW I was a hugh Anne Rice fan but it's obvious she's lost her stride !"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved most of the \\"Vampire Chronicles\\". They established a rich and fascinating world full of wonderful characters and intricate storylines. The same can be said for The Witching Hour. And I have never had a problem with the combination of the two storylines. I thought that &quot;Merrick&quot; was a enough of a connection without it getting to &quot;novel&quot; like. But, unfortunately, Anne Rice does not feel the same way about her work. How else can you explain the horrendously boring &quot;Armand&quot;? Or the numbing stupor that &quot;Blood and Gold&quot; and &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; induced?I thought that &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; was as bad as novel's get, but I was wrong. &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; redefines the genre with what is undoubtedly, the worst novel that I have ever read. There are so many things that can be said about the \\"story\\", but why? Why should anyone take the time to dissect the \\"intricacies\\" of a novel, when the author can't even be bothered with putting forth any effort? Simply put, \\"Blood Canticle\\" is an insult to anyone who has ever read a \\"Vampire Chronicle\\" or \\"The Lives of the Mayfair Witches\\". Anne Rice should be ashamed of herself, and so should her publisher and her editor for peddling this drivel.Throughout \\"Blood Canticle\\", Lestat professes his desire to become saint. I suggest we do one better. Someone grab two pieces of wood and some nails."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Lestat seemed different. In a way he was the same but some things were just \\"missing\\". Maybe after being with Memnoch and everything, he lost some of his spirit. I don't mean to sound mean, but hey if it happened to me, I would not be the same either. I did enjoy the book though. I don't like people yelling at Anne about why they don't like it. I mean if you don't you, don't but don't insult her like that! I liked it but some of it I didn't like. I didn't like the romantic thing with him and Rowan because it seemed kind of forced but I didn't hate it either. It made some sense why he loved her. I didn't like the fact that Louis wasn't in the book except for brief mentions because Merick left off with him and Lestat being together. At the same time though, I am glad that he was mentioned. That they did talk about him. It kind of leaves off with you, wondering what became of Louis and even Lestat. It didn't end with the gorgeous fiend or the beautiful one dieing, just kind of left off at what next? Overall, I did like the book a lot and I am intrigued by the Taltos too."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Having read Blood Canticle, as well as the many reviews posted on Amazon.com, I am disappointed in the reaction of most reviewers. Though, to be honest, the book was not one of Anne Rice's best works. My two favorite works by Anne Rice are Violin and Memnoch the Devil. Violin is the best example of purple prose Anne Rice ever authored. She created a rich and fascinating environment and wondrous characters. Memnoch was almost all philosophy but philosophical musings that are common to most thinking people and presented in an enjoyable tale.Blood Canticle lacked the purple prose of Violin or even Blackwood Farm. It also lacked the scope that is characteristic of Ms. Rice's major works. As an independent story, the book did not work. Someone who was not familiar with the history of the Chronicles and the Mayfair family would be lost. However, it seems to me that the book is meant more as an epilogue to her earlier works, attempting to bring everything together. As a series epilogue, I think it worked reasonably well.One of the goals of this epilogue appears to have been to explore the moral evolution of Lestat. I would be profoundly disappointed if Lestat had not evolved over the years of this series. Blood Canticle shows a Lestat who has grown up somewhat. He is no longer the Brat Prince of the earlier books but someone who has a conscience, a sense of responsibility, and the capacity for selfless love. While this is the first time we have had access to Lestat's inner musings since Memnoch, the process of evolution was apparent in Merrick and in Blackwood Farm. With access to Lestat's inner musings once more the extent of his inner struggles is center stage.That the dream of the Taltos heading off into the sunset to live an idyllic life was shattered is a bit of healthy closure. There are good times in life and there are bad times but life goes on. The Taltos seemed to enjoy a good life for awhile but it is natural that the bad times came as well. In the end there is death but also hope for those who remain. Life goes on.While the Mayfair characters are a bit thin, they are supporting characters in this book. That supporting characters are a bit thin can be forgiven. This is a book about Lestat.It seems to me that Lestat is asking us how different is the human from the vampire. Obviously, the vampire lives off the blood of others. The vampire is a parasite on humanity. Yet, those who are killed, at least by Lestat and his children, live off the suffering of others. Though human are they morally different from vampires? They are probably more evil than the worst vampire because it is not inherent in their nature to live off the suffering of others. Lestat seems to be struggling with the knowledge of his fallen nature yet trying to make something noble of his existence as well. This is the classic human dilemma.Lestat discovers that no matter what our nature we are capable of discipline and free choice. Within the context of our nature, our choices shape who we become. As the story makes plain, Lestat's desire to be loved is also a desire to love. By the end of the story we see that Lestat is capable of selfless love, The Brat Prince has grown up. I find that satisfying closure to the tale of the Vampire Lestat."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have read every book that Anne Rice has written, and after reading this book I have come to one conclusion: Anne Rice did NOT write this book! There is no way she wrote it. Her style, which comes out profoundly in her writing was not present in this book. I was wondering if I was reading the right novel, or a story told over AOL messenger half the time. The overuse of &quot;dude&quot; and &quot;yo&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; throughout the book, then changing the name of the nurse at the beginning (wasn't necessary at all), and the overuse of punctuation!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;----like that...It just did not seem like her at all. Not only that but it was crawling with typos. Obvious ones!!!Overall, I gave this story three stars because I did like the story. I was just confused and wondering who the real author was."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"What has happened in Anne Rice's station on Amazon? It appears there has been a war between reviewers. I didn't even know until my friend told me in casual conversation, and she had read it on Anne Rice's web site.Well I'm fully well in the know now and I had read this book a few months back and I must say, honestly I did not like this book. It disappointed me how the vampire Lestat had changed from the brat Prince to Saint. And I was deeply expecting a reunion of some kind with all the vampires, just to assure the readers what happened to all the characters we had come to love. I must say I was a bit bitter over these two things, plus I never liked Lestat's new Blood Children Quinn or Mona and I was stuck with them throughout the entire book, adventuring with Lestat on a quest I cared not for because I never was interested in Anne's Witch series, which was what they speak of throughout the entire novel. So no, I did not appreciate this to be the last of the legendary Vampire Chronicles. The earlier ones I had grown up with were the ones I will forever be in love with.But I will say another thing. All authors make a piece of literature some readers don't appreciate. Like Stephen King, for example. One of my most favorite authors like Anne is, but I did not care for his novel Cujo. I thought the book was a bit silly. And it's the same with Blood Canticle for me with Anne. And I will not lie and say I loved either one even if I met the two authors face to face. But I also never, ever would say some of the bull others have been posting on here. It is perfectly all right to write like I did, saying you didn't like the novel and that's that, you've thrown your two cents in. But many of the things a few reveiwers have said were terribly offensive, and totally out of line. And for you who say Anne was out of line and egotistical, just think if you wrote a story. If someone remarked to you that you were one terrible writer and should never write again, you would get a little pissed off yourself. Just cause she wrote a novel not to your liking doesn't mean you turn vicious on her. When I read Cujo, I just shrugged as I did with Blood Canticle and replied to myself: Maybe their next novel I'll fall in love with. And that's the way to do it. I truly hope Anne keeps writing like King, for they're two writers I have known and read since a little girl and their writing has inspired me, for they're both writers that say the unspeakable in many ways.The point is nonetheless, I know Anne cannot write gold everytime. No writer can. No writer has. We must understand that. If I, noted a harsh critic at times, can accept that theory, I'm sure everyone else can. And we, the disappointed fans, can wait for the next novel, hoping this time we will fall back in love. That's what the mature fan does right?Anne, please continue on writing. And possibly, maybe, you could give us a formal farewell to the vampires? I desire to say farewell to Armand one last time.But overall Anne, you have my personal apology. And for any other writers whom have been attacked with such cruel- hearted and uncalled for words before as well."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I used to love Anne Rice's early works, specially \\" Interview with the Vampire\\" and \\"The Feast of all Saints\\". The characters where so rich and yet so real that anyone could in fact relate to them.The writting was simple and captivating at the same time.However, everything changed in the \\"Tale of the body thief\\". I ignored how ridiculous a rock star vampire can be, but stealing bodies? and the next books including God allmighty himself???...Lestat stopped being a sensual wicked playful vampire to become a pathetic \\"supervampire\\" who finds Jesus... I guess it is because Anne is into Christianity now which is perfectly valid but it doesn't go with vampirism much.The books have become pure preposterous fantasy and The Blood canticle is the cherry of the cake.Meeting the Pope, having ST Juan Diego(Which actually might insult the catholic-mexican comunity), is way over the top. Anne, you should have stopped the Vampire Chronicles with the \\"Queen of the damned\\".Readers don't think of you as serious writter anymore.Yes you still sell, and yes you have an audience : I have been to recent book signings and 90% of your audience were goth/vampire kids.which brings me to give you a short reply to your post here on amazon.com:-you say that you have avoided criticism most of your career. that only means you can't take it and can't accept the fact other people dislike your work.You call them (us) utter \\"trash\\".-You emphasize the fact that Lestat belongs to you; he is your character. well news flash: everytime a book, song, movie comes out the characters belong to the public since they are the ones who allow you to develop them further thanks to sequels.-you imply that the people who dislike your last books are too stupid to understand them. Well, insulting readers won't get you anywhere.Indeed, it only makes you look more selfish and angry because a woman of your age, who \\"has found christ\\",is expected to come up with a more mature response to our criticism.And please don't attack my spelling or grammar since you can't even spell \\"Juan Diego\\" correctly in your review (or should I say pathetic attack?)and I seriously doubt serious educated people read the junk you write anyways.I hope you find peace in your mediocrity and that you remember why you started writting in the first place."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved Blackwood Farm, but having now read the sequel, Blood Canticle, I find it disappointing. The story is loose, slow, unfocused. It feels like Rice has tried to tie up loose ends without being able to create a coherent story. At times, she seems to please herself with rantings that give the novel little direction. Read it if you must, but don't expect too much of this one."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"In reading some of the earlier reviews of this book, as well as those of its predecessor, \\"Blackwood Farm,\\" I agree that \\"Blood Canticle\\" has the look and feel of a first draft. If Anne Rice had put it away for a bit and then come back to it, I believe she could've corrected many of its flaws.One subtle thing that bothered me right off the bat was the style of language used by Lestat's character. It is markedly different than his speech in the other books and his new style of speaking, saying things like \\"babe\\" and \\"cool,\\" really doesn't work. He sounded more like Austin Powers than he did Lestat.Something that could've been developed a lot more were the references to \\"Memnoch.\\" For example, there's a reference made in either this book, or \\"Blackwood Farm,\\" to Lestat's mind or consciousness being \\"stolen\\" by Memnoch or other angels. To what end, the reader isn't told. This seemed like an obvious point to follow up on and I was disappointed that it wasn't.I was also disappointed to see the pages that were wasted by the appearance of Patsy's ghost. In my mind, that whole tangent added nothing to the book.And finally, I had read a rumor that Anne Rice was going to use the Blackwood saga to delve into the origins of the Talamasca. I was quite disappointed to see that she didn't do so in either of the books. The organization's beginnings are discussed somewhat in the \\"Witching Hour\\" trilogy (it is hinted, by the Lasher character, that it was started to breed Taltos), but, I think, never fully fleshed out and explored.In conclusion, I believe that this book is rife with missed literary opportunities."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I found this book to be so-so. I have spent the last year reading the 10 books in the vampire series and 3 books in the Mayfair Witches series. I am glad it is over. The books seem to get more and more boring as they go along. Some of the books seem to be nothing more than a rehash of previous books. If I were recommending to a friend, I would say to quite reading after Memnoch the Devil, and The witching hour is the only worthwhile Mayfair book. It seems the author got a successful series started, then cashed in by spitting out several mediocre books without much effort."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've been reading Anne Rice's books for well over 10 years now, and I have to say I've never been truly disappointed until Blood Canticle. Blackwood Farm was okay, especially when compared to the earlier Vampire Chronicles and the stories of the Mayfair Witches, but Blood Canticle was a huge let down. The diatribe on \\"getting\\" Memnoch was definitely insulting to long-time fans. Maybe it's time for Rice to leave the vampires and witches behind and start with some new \\"blood\\"."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Well, I read all the reviews here before I even opened the book. I was sort of expecting the worse. I think the major thing is that Lestat has changed, he changed in the novel Memnoch the Devil. Alot of people don't seem to want to come to terms with that fact. I found there was cohesion with this book and it was interesting. Of course it is not the same as the older books, Anne has changed and she has made her characters change as well. I did not find the novel wrapped everything up. I had more questions after I finished reading it than when I had begun. I was really annoyed with the &quot;running away&quot; of Mary Jane Mayfair. After the last book in the Witches Chronicles, how could there be any story with Mona that did not involve Mary Jane in some way. I did like the book, very much, but I am bitterly disappointed that this is how it is all going to end. But then again, why would I want to read something that Anne Rice really had no desire to write? Contrary to popular opinions I think she did want to write this, we just have to face up that it is just never going to be like it once was."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"If you liked Blackwood farm you'll love this book. Lestat isn't really his normal character but still a great book"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I thought this gave me exactly what I was looking for: more development into the Mayfairs tied with the vampires and development into Lestat and his character. I think my only complaint about the book is that it felt \\"hurried\\" and I felt rushed as a reader. I didn't enjoy that. It is quite possible it is because I couldn't put it down, but towards the end things didn't feel fully developed as they could have been.*spoiler* I loved the glimpses into the personalities of the different Taltos' as well as seeing the further degeneration of the Mayfair family's mental state as a result of their tragedies. It left me wanting more, but feeling satisfied at not knowing. Also seeing Lestat's caring and nurturing side and his human qualities coming out was very refreshing.Overall, I loved this book."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am a big fan of Anne Rice, have read all her books, blah blah blah. The bottom line is Anne Rice is ending her Chronicles with this? At least that's what I heard. I tolerated the disorganization and rambling about the Pope etc. because I was hoping for a great story. It never happens. The resolution is too rapid and clean. The characters, like others have pointed out, aren't consistent with previous books, even Lestat. I still love Anne Rice, would recommend this to fans, and would read anything she wrote."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Seriously, did she write this book or [...] I was just waiting for Lestat to call something \\"da bomb\\" after he used the word \\"cool\\" for the tenth million time. And what happened to Mona? She certainly turned into a whiny cardboard copy teenager. I have been a huge fan of Anne Rice and own everything she ever wrote, including books under her other names. This was just a horrible let down, like she didn't even want to write it. And by page 200, I didn't want to read it. I had to push myself through the pages. Someone needs to tell this woman when the book is this bad. It discredits her name. It discredits the editor. And the only reason it's in print is because it has her name one it. I still refuse to believe she wrote it.In this book are some of the best characters created in the 20th century and they were destroyed. What a horrible end to the Mayfairs and the Vampires."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've had a lot of trouble with some of Ms. Rice's books: Blood and Gold, Vampire Armand, Vittorio the Vampire, Violin, etc. And I realize that I am in the minority when I admit to having thoroughly enjoyed Tale of the Body Thief, Memnoch the Devil, Merrick, The Witching Hour, and Servant of the Bones; but I thought it appropriate to comment here on Blood Canticle. I have read all of the Vampire and Mayfair Witches books and like many others have followed The Saga for many years. As each series progressed there was a point at which it seemed everything had already been said, no further developments seemed possible, but I kept reading just to &quot;see how everything turned out.&quot; I suppose I became as weary of reading the series as Ms. Rice seemed in writing them.Blood Canticle is a coda; a short summation or just a long final chapter that, aside from the &quot;religious ranting&quot; by a born-again catholic, was surprisingly satisfying to me. Time was, I enjoyed the depth, the detail, the examination presented by Ms. Rice. But after having been disappointed with her work over the past few years, the coda-style wrapping it all up in Blood Canticle worked for me.Two final thoughts: As I was reading this book I realized why I had been drawn to her writing initially and ultimately disappointed with the later books: the scariness, the fear-factor I loved so much at the beginning was gone. I remember being thrilled to be scared by the content, the creepiness, the discovery, the concepts. It became too known, too understood, there was no room left for fear of the unknown.My final thought: could there have been more finality, more detail, more connection to the completion of both of these sagas? Yes, of course. There COULD have been and if Ms. Rice had been as dedicated to the writing of that as she was in the writing, say, of The Witching Hour, I would have loved it and devoured it. But based on her apparent lack of interest (or patience?) for these stories any more, I'm glad she wrote this coda to bring the kind of completion she was capable of at this time. I recommend this book to those who want a simple completion to his or her own journey in the reading of Ms. Rice's work."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"While I won't lambast this book as harshly as others, Blood Canticle certainly fails to live up to the Anne Rice of old. In fact, this is quite possibly my least favorite of all her books. But in all fairness, if you look at the dedication, you realize Mrs. Rice lost her husband at some point during the process of this novel. So I forgive her bitterness, although it is quite shocking to be ranted at for the opening chapter of the book. Apparently from this rant, many people didn't like Memnoch The Devil, a book I found fast paced and thought provoking. But back to Blood Canticle, I do feel cheated. The Mayfair Witches become one dimensional and boring. A pity because these were probably my favorite characters of all of Mrs. Rice's creations. Lestat's character does not move or grow in this book. His &quot;sudden&quot; desire to be a saint really isn't sudden if you have read the previous books. And his continual fantasizing on the subject really is pendantic. If this is the last of The Vampire Chronicles, I am indeed sad, they deserved a more fitting send off. I would not recommend this book to those new to Anne Rice, it's far from her best. Really the only people I would recommend this book to is the die hard fan, but you like I probably have found this book disappointing but are hopefully awaiting the return of the quality and imagination of the Anne Rice we know and love even if her story telling takes a new direction, as is discussed in the opening chapter."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Talk about a mixed bag of reviews! Either people hate it, or they love it. Either is fine, but why the personal attacks on the author? All that shows is bad case of \\"small person syndrome\\" - very bad taste people, let's keep reviews about the book.A lot of the negatives among the reviews here seem to want to compare the Blood Canticle with previous Vampire Chronicles and Mayfair Witches novels. \\"It's too fast paced\\", \\"it's lacking description\\", \\"it's not as good as...\\". Yes it is fast paced - great read isn't it? What you all seem to be forgetting is that the Vampire Chronicles all have several different \\"authors\\" who themselves have different styles. Even Lestat himself has had several lifetimes worth of fantastic supernatural experiences - is it any wonder his outlook (and therefore is focus when recounting a story) will change. Who says Lestat is not growing or developing - the very fact that the Blood Canticle is again different to previous books is evidence that he is. Enjoy the evolution for what it is, and stop trying to be too analytical and clever for your own good - read with an open mind and you shall see.For new readers to the Anne Rice series, this is a great book. Period. It is fast paced and full of action, and wonderfully entertaining throughout. Other reviewers have complained that the characters here are not as well defined as they appear in other books. That is completely irrelevant for this book, and takes nothing away from this story - all characters here are perfectly represented as they need to be for this tale, as they appear in the eyes of the writer and lead player, Lestat. This is the book of a story as told by him, as he sees it. It is not a narrative from a non-existent third person perspective - it has bias and it has feeling. There can be no better example of this than by going back to the first two books in the Vampire Chronicles, whereby the same story is told through the eyes of Louis, in Interview with a Vampire, and through the eyes of Lestat, in The Vampire Lestat. I think many \\"reviewers\\" here have forgotten, or indeed missed this point altogether. New readers, read this book. If you can wait, read it last - after you have read all of Anne's previous books. They will entertain you, provoke thought, inspire you - this list could go on for ever, but most of all, you'll want to read more of these characters. The different styles of writing in this series tells us as much about the story teller character as the words themselves, and this approach is in my opinion a true stroke of genius. Get involved, you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Bravo! Mrs. Anne Rice! On so many levels...but especially for ALL your novels and for expressing your opinion on your pathetically-less-than-devoted-so-called fans.I did feel that the southern charm was rather thick, but it was done so well and so beautifully that how else could this read come to live so much without it...it is called setting and atmosphere, two essential components for ghost stories, which this novel is much of. And I do love ghost stories. This incredible lady never fails to create lasting legend.For those of you who think she didn't stick with the characteristics that we have so much fallen in love with, I suggest you re-read each and every Vampire Chronicle and do try to pay attention this time!Just a few comments on the negative feed-back I've read...The post concercing Lestat using the terms 'yo' and 'cool'...It took me off guard, too, but I accepted it easily due to the fact that Lestat IS a rather unpredictable character and always chooses to do and say whatever he wants (poor little things can't handle slang coming from the mouth of Lestat, the horrible gasp of air you must have had! How DO you sleep at night?) For any true Lestat fan, it should have been just as easy for you to except this little 'faux-pas', which is clearly what you see it as. But then again, you probably aren't a true Lestat fan, or you would have easily 'forgiven' him this just as all the other 'blunders' he has ever committed. I'm a little shocked you even made it this far really.As for the comment about the ending and letting all the other characters 'go out' like that...a little insight on this...have you perhaps considered that Lestat's continuence reflects the continuence of all the other surviving vampires (and I shall point out Maharet's communications to Lestat from a distance). Thankfully Lestat continues as do the others. I truly was afraid I would have to say a tearful farewell to Lestat, but I am over joyed that he still roams.Someone also commented on Mrs. Rice's arrogance concerning her post about not allowing any editor to 'distort out...or otherwise mutilate sentences...she herself polished.' For you 'true' Lestat fans, had she allowed that, you would not have been truly hearing from Lestat. Be thankful she did not allow it and you got an ever more intimate meeting with Lestat de Lioncourt. Try to understand this and be grateful and honored, as you very well should be, not only for the opportunity to know Lestat more cleary but for Mrs. Rice's respect to you as her reader.I do believe Lestat gave you ample opportunity to NOT read the book from the beginning. Seeing as how you DID choose to read it, shut-up your whining! Perhaps you'll listen more closely next time...I applaud Anne Rice for standing her ground on keeping true to her characters, concerning letting no editor or publisher dictate how SHE should write HER story. That sort of thing is absolutely essential for hard-core authors such as herself and also for hard-core fans, as she obviously knows more than any of us ever can. After all, she does hold the fate of all those beloved characters in her hands. Their fate is not and in no way should be up to any other but herself and her characters.AND, as for being 'arrogant' about responding to the incredibably cold, malicious, taunting, outrageous, inhumane criticisms...HOW DARE anyone imply or out-right declare that she has no right or is 'out-of-line' or should just bear it because that's what a professional and accomplished writer would do! SHE IS HUMAN! I hope all of you nasty little minions become so one day yourselves!I'll conclude this now, and just say to Mrs. Anne Rice...Bravo! in SO many ways!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I feel as though I have to come to the defense of Ms. Rice. I am a long time fan, and I have always identified with her work. I think the reason I identify with her books so much is because Ms. Rice writes of her own personal experiences. Like most people, through the course of life, our experiences mold us and change us. This is, therefore, reflected in her novels. Do not kid yourselves. Ms. Rice does not write for you. She write first and foremost for herself. Why shouldn't she? Yes, her most recent novels differ from her older ones. Why shouldn't they? She is writing from a different view point, from a different frame of mind. No one has a right to hold that against her. You have the choice to read her novels or not to read them. For those of you who aren't satisfied by her latest work, do not read it--don't whine and carry on and act as if you've been betrayed. She never promised you anything. Ms. Rice wrote the best book she could in her eyes. You go try writing a novel yourselves. Then you can criticize."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have not finished it yet, but can see that it will be the perfect conclusion for the mayfair/vampires chronicles!

In case you people don't keep up with the news, she's retiring the publisher's needed her to write an ending for her chronicles. She had nothing left to give, but hell at least she tried. I don't see how anyone can complain. She wrote for herself not the public so get over her book being crap."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Let me first off say that im a big fan of anne rice. i simply adore her work. including this book. so her writing has changed, so Lestat changed, so what? Lestat, as a character, has met God. let me reiterate, he met the Creator, the maker of heaven and earth, the most awe-inspiring being in creation. and you expect him to remain unchanged? the problem is that you assume a wise man will speak in an antiquated dialect. Lestat's strength is his ability to adapt, to change with the times. look beyond the slang to see the moral evolution it represents."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've been reading Ms. Rice's works for years and I've got all of her books.Honestly, it's one of my priced possesion. I've been thinking that those who criticizes her work were'nt able to read the whole saga. this is not a question of correlation of the events in the book. it's clear that those who dissed her writing didn't even knew how to write their own bestseller! Yes, we knew that as the book progressed, it's story is not as catchy as it was before. But don't ever forget that it's still one of the sought-after vampire tale of the century...and so very unlike Dracula whose funny eccentricities are what I hate most.It was the lives of the vampires and not the technicality. Yes you people are the most unperfect creation of God yet you're the creature who fiercely sought for perfection. It was not like what you said because if it is... then the book will not be labeled bestseller!Have you got no sense at all? Just want to inform those fans who still support and love the chronicles down to the last chronicle, we asians still love the book and if we have some complain about it, it was'nt as rude as those who didn't even knew what writing means. i'm also a Writer and I knew that half of those who read the chronicles didn't even knew what to make of it. The ending of the book may be hurried, but still, Ms. Rice was able to impart to her readers the main character Lestat's feelings in very awarding ways. It's not a petty thing to be inlove and all people knew that. The book must not be labeled like a usual romance because it was'nt.though we still want another supplement and we knew the series is over. Well, admit that ms.

Really liked it alot."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I just finished reading \\"Blood Canticle.\\" I thoroughly enjoyed it. It brought together so many of my favorite Anne Rice characters and mythos (Is that singular or plural?)\\"Blood Canticle\\" is definitely written for die-hard Anne Rice fans. It would be difficult to fully understand or appreciate if the reader has not been exposed to the referenced tales before (Blackwood Farm, Queen of the Damned, the Mayfair trilogy, Merrick, etc.) IF you loved those books, though, you will love \\"Blood Canticle.\\"And last...for those of you who were \\"offended\\" because Lestat implied that people who did not understand \\"Memnoch\\" were unable or unwilling to...I quite agree with Lestat. I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Rice at a book-signing for \\"Memnoch\\" that I thought it was one of her best books ever. I stand by that statement today. The theology is high-brow but...hey...there's more to Anne's vampires than just chomping necks.:)"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm proud to live in America. We have so much freedom. Freedom of speech, for example. It's sad that some people abuse this right and instead of polite criticism, they feel the need to be vicious and hateful. Such were the words going through my head as I read the reviews here. Anne Rice has an unnaturally devoted following, and the people who say things like \\"This book sucks\\" or \\"The first page is lame\\" need to read into it a bit more. There are some people called haters who don't even give things a chance. I got this book last winter and had I reviewed it back then, I would've given it 2 stars at the most. That's the thing. People can't wait to criticize and judge. I gave this book a second chance and again, my opinion didn't change. I started reading it AGAIN today, and something changed. It was good. They say third time's a charm, and it truly is. Instead of being bored, I'm absolutely enthralled with the book. For me, Anne Rice has always required patience. The first time I read Interview With The Vampire, Vampire Lestat and Queen Of The Damned, I gave up too soon. Something eventually compelled me to buy them one day, and I had a new favorite author all of a sudden. I own all the books now, and the ones I too quickly dismissed, like \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" and \\"Merrick\\" are all about to get their chance, like Lestat, at redemption.If people took the time to read the book, and ignored the negative hype, they would see that this one is a great addition to the series. I wouldn't say it's the best (Queen Of The Damned holds that honor) but I don't think it's the worst book ever written. I'd say it's better than most books out there. Anne has ended the Chronicles, and she is secretly working on a new project. Something tells me it might be a children's book (she said the new direction might lose a lot of fans) but no matter what it is, she hasn't lost me with this book. My support will continue for an extended period of time.Thanks Anne."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I just have to post something here.I've read everything Anne Rice has ever published.I've enjoyed every single page I've turned.I love all her characters, Lestat, Rowan, Quinn, Mona, Stella,Julian, Michael, Louis, Claudia: you get the idea.I will continue to buy anything and everything she honors us with.Her books have kept me company, entertained me, comforted me and been my friends when no one else was.I hope she writes many, many more books.

My main concern is the venom and hatred I see spewing out of the reviews for this book. Why so cruel and angry? This is unlike any post I have seen on this site and I browse here often.I can understand stating emphatically that one dislikes a book and why...that is the purpose of a review, to inform others of your thoughts on the book. But this has come down to people attacking the author personally. I don't understand where this anger is coming from. It's sad really. Anne has given us years of entertainment and introspection. Now you are like small boys throwing tomatoes at her because you don't like her shoes.Would you say these cruel things to her face? I bet at least 50% of you wouldn't, probably more. The internet has many wonderful aspects and there is so much to learn. On the other hand, it allows people to hide behind a monitor and say what they like in anonymity. This spells cowardice in my book. If one has full confidence in his/her opinion, why is there a need for hiding?Anne Rice will always be great in my eyes. I have liked some of her novels better than others of course, but I have always enjoyed them.Anne, don't listen to this nonsense. Anyone who has to resort to insults to make their point isn't worthy of your time."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Why do you people insist on ragging on this book? I agree that it wasn't her most amazing accomplishment, but it wasn't a flop. Not every novel can be The Vampire Lestat or Queen of the Damned.I have been an avid Anne Rice fan for about five years when my aunt first turned me on to her books. And I haven't been able to stop reading them since. I have found such strength and passion in all of her works. There have been times where I have been angry or disappointed at the fate of a character, but that has never made me slander her books in the way that these reviews have.One of her best qualities is that she allows the characters to speak for themselves. Lestat is not supposed to be the same in every novel. His greatest quality is the fact that he is so flippant and whimsical. He makes resolutions to change and yet he is always the same. That is his fate.Mona was meant to be Claudia, the counterpart to Lestat's brat prince. But she could never overpower him because of who Lestat is.I think that readers should focus more on what a book says and visual what is happening and not just wait for the author to spoon feed you the details. Grow up readers and then return to apologize to Anne Rice."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This is one of the best books in the Vampire Chronicles. It was refreshing to read this particular volume because of the style and poetics Anne Rice wrote with. The words flow much smother then they did in Blackwood Farm (the book Preceding this one) and the general vibe was that of confidence with a clear direction. The voice of Lestat was very present and his growth within the series was clearly evident. Out of all the vampire Chronicles, i read this volume in the shortest amount of time. Again, i want to emphasize the clear and poetic style of prose Anne Accomplished with this book. All in all this volume is a very visual and is a heart felt piece of art in which you can feel Anne Rice had truly tapped into the world in which she created.As for this book being the end of the chronicles... I can only say it does not feel like a true conclusion. Lestat comes to terms with his basic questions regarding morality, compassion and sin, thus leading Lestat into a new Psychological space which really opens up the narrative for further adventures."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Interview With the Vampire and perhaps even The Vampire Lestat are masterpieces and will be read by many for a long time to come. but you have to understand, in reading anne rice, is that you're reading a highly refined stream of consciousness. go to her website and read her explanation for how she writes. i believe this has always been so with her. consequently, events such as the death of her daughter and her rise to literary stardom precipitated two astonishing and emotional novels. it was exactly that, in a simultaneous fashion. anne has gotten tough over the decades, if she wasn't tough already; and facing the death of her husband over a prolonged period of time I'm sure was no less astonishing. nevertheless, anne's novels have always been about that refinement, not only for her own mind, but for the world she seeks to understand and contribute to. that's why Blood Canticle is so much more significant to her works as a whole than I think anyone realizes. the rambling style and diction are absurd in comparison to Interview. but they reflect an inner ideal i believe she has come to in her life, that evil is absurd. not that it should be conquered or can be by dreams of redemption and sainthood. but simply that it is more absurd than good or ideals of good. without getting any deeper or violating an author who's still very much alive, i have to say this is a woman who has learned to accept pain and suffering from an early age. this is a woman who is selfless at heart. anne rice is still a new artist for this age. when you read rice you are reading a synthesis of joyce, byron, and the visual styles of dali and kahlo. Blood Canticle is a fitting end to the Vampire Chronicles and while less rambling, i would be shocked to find her new work anything but dry and vaguely existential. this is not pulp fiction folks... this is not a \\"read\\" in spite of how its main character might describe it. this is an end piece to a long-spanning collection of works. if you can respect rice, respect her for what she is, not what she says she is or idly wishes to be. after all, she is an artist..."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"There's no reason for all the bad vibe around here, Anne Rice is a great author.I have readother great authors, among which is Mercedes Lackey,Piers Anthony, Dean Koontz....and Anne Rice.I adore the fact that SHE KNOWS HOW TO WRITE.

I was about to order this book when I started to read all of the reviews - I ended up ordering something else - everyone seemed so disappointed.

I mainly just read the book to see what joke or vain comparision Lestat was going to call himself next.

She has taken her two separate series, The Witching Hour Series, where Rowan Mayfair is the main character, and the Vampire Lestat Series, and brought them together in a way that I could never have foreseen, and in a manner that left one feeling both satisfied with the end results regarding the personal searches that Lestat and Rowan had both been laboring under throughout each series, and brought them together. Kindred spirits in many ways, they accidentally find each other, and while there are complications...he is the undead, and she is married to a good and decent man who doesn't look much beyond the surface of his life any longer, yet loves Rowan unconditionally, (One gets the distinct impression that he would not be able to feel so strongly about the latter without embracing the former to the farthest extent that he is able to.) one is left with hope that these two extraordinary individuals have at last found the answers to all of their problems and loneliness, their search for the meaning of their existence even, in each other, and eventually they will overcome all to be together for eternity, one way or another...and for them, at least at the time, the promise of that is enough. Was it enough for readers? Two different questions, with a third that complicates matters and I believe affected ratings of this finale unfairly.After reading the book, I realized that on the earth Rowan and Lestat inhabit, they are quite probably the perfect match. Made in heaven? Made in hell? Somewhere in between? Only the reader can decide.The side plots to the story, in particular the appearances of Oncle Julien are charming, funny and equally unnerving. He is of course the same Julien of old...perhaps wiser, and perhaps he paid a price for that wisdom. He seems more cynical and determined in a situation that is beyond his control than he ever was when alive. Must be frustrating for someone who weilded such charisma, raw sexuality and sensuality, not to mention powers beyond those of a mere mortal, that he is perhaps the one male who can truly understand the great Lestat, yet he is dead. Hence is inability to truly affect things as he would will them to be, and his resulting \\"temper tantrums\\" that result. If Lestat is the Brat Prince of Vampires, then perhaps Julien was the Brat Prince of male witches?Let us not overlook Mona Mayfair...rescued from the jaws of death by the jaws of the Brat Prince leading her into the realm of the undead, but bringing her uncanny human powers along with her; the Vampire Witch. And let us not forget her brave companion, lover, teacher, and perhaps conscience? Quinn Blackwood. A love story that transcends death into \\"undeath\\". A fictional concept to be sure, but one that no mortal, deep down where we don't necessarily talk about it at parties, might wish, even just for a moment, to have as an alternative choice to the one reality we cannot control...true mortal death.I could go on with all of the interesting ways that Anne Rice entwines the two separate series and weaves the lives of the characters together into a fitting ending for both, yet leaving devoted fans of one or both series shamelessly pining for more details, for what happens next, etc. Pointless exercise, though I loved every word, and I loathed every word...for each brought me closer to the end of two series I dearly loved and now mourn.But herein also lies the crux of the problem of so many poor reviews by, up until now, true fans. Now many are simply truly angry that the story has reached \\"The End\\". Others are confused and don't \\"get\\" it at all. No wonder. Many were led to believe that this was simply a sequel to Blackwood Farm, where the Mayfairs, particularly Rowan, make there first contact with Lestat and vampires, in a purely accidental...or so it seems...fashion.For fans of each separate series each was bound to be disappointed, because they could never understand the history of the other series' characters, and how they do fit together so well. The living provide a bridge into their world for the undead, and vice-versa. But without having read each book in BOTH series, yes, I can see where one would come away a bit confused, feeling cheated even perhaps, and of course disappointed in \\"their\\" series' author.Myself, I read both, all the way through starting way back when with the first editions of The Witching Hour and An Interview With The Vampire. Some of which I've read repeatedly, from both series. I have no doubt I'll be revisiting them again from time to time...like old friends that one hasn't seen in so long, yet it is so easy to pick up the conversation where it was left off.After reading all the reviews here, I can see that a common theme developed...one-sided series readers, and both series' readers simply peeved that their favorite author could end not one but BOTH series at the same time. It's understandable that we'd feel a bit cheated, or let down. I could even tell which series they'd read, or if they'd read both, by the tone of their reviews. To these good folks, I do understand how you could arrive at your conclusions.To new readers and one series readers alike, I would offer this advice: Read the entire series you didn't, re-read the books in the series you did read that you feel you could gain a better grasp of the second time around, and only then re-read Merrick, Blackwood Farm, and finally this, the finale of both series, Blood Canticle. I think your perspective and your feelings about this final book will change, and you won't feel cheated...well not nearly as much as you do now. You can't help but feel a little let down, even having read both series to the ending of both here in this final book, because there are issues left unresolved that those of us who like neat and tidy endings will be a bit frustrated with. To those frustrated folks, the \\"happily ever after\\" crowd, to which I confess I can fall into if not careful, and have done so in the past, why not write the endings of the relationships and situations left kind of \\"hanging\\", but with promise, just for yourself? It might be fun! Or you can leave things the way the author meant them to be, and wonder. Whatever works for you, that's what's important.Personally, I loved and hated Blood Canticle...what reader who over the years has fallen for characters in each series wouldn't feel that way? On the one hand, there is the delight of enveloping yourself in familiar fictional territory, and on the other, there is the ultimate letdown of finding out you'll never be reading about the territory or its inhabitants again.But, never say never...eternity is indeed a very long time. :-)"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have been an Anne Rice fan for about 7 years now (hey, I'm only 20) and I have read every book she has written that I can. I enjoyed this book, it's not my favorite, but not because of the style, the content, or the \\"ending\\" which has seemingly put off so many others. Simply put, I read Interview with the Vampire when I was 13, and I can never forget how it felt to truly fall in love with a book. As with any book, you should read it yourself because if you only go by the reviews, you will miss out on so many chances to find something new! I admit, I was a little confused by the first part, but then I remembered how it was to read Memnoch the Devil and I felt much more at home, so to speak. Everything you've come to love about Anne Rice's novels are here, you just have to actually READ, as opposed to the half-hearted attempt many people make just to fit in or say they've read the \\"latest\\" new hit. Unfortunately, many people have come to think that this is all reading can accomplish. I loved the book and would suggest it to anyone.On another note, interesting how many people posted anonymous negative reviews. What, are the lot of you too cowardly to own up to your own opinion? What's the point of voicing YOUR opinion if you won't admit to it being yours in the first place?"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"For those of you that are reading reviews for this novel, I hope that you see beyond the sophomoric babble that dominates the first couple of pages of reviews. If you are a devout fan of Anne Rice and truly read her novels, you will enjoy this book. Anne Rice has been true and brilliant in her writings from the first page of Interview with a Vampire through the last page of Blood Canticle. The characters in this book are beautifully and eloquently developed, and the story is as compelling and undeniably virtuoso as all of her novels. I love the intimate feeling that Anne Rice has created with Lestat and I am distraught over the news that she will not be continuing the story.In response to comments made by earlier reviewers, an artist such as Anne Rice deserves more respect. She is an accomplished and gifted writer, and the fact that you are wasting your time writing your irreverent trash shows just how juvenile you are. If Anne Rice doesn't want her work to be mutilated by editors, she has earned that right. Did Mozart have an editor? What about Leonardo da Vinci? A work of art needs no editing. Finally, if you don't like her style and have trouble grasping her work, Read Something Else. Don't ruin her reputation (and our reading enjoyment) by printing such garbage."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Geez man after reading a lot of you guy's reviews of this book I thought about not reading this book. Now I glad that I did read this work by Anne Rice. Some complain about the sexuality in Blackwood Farm and this book.... Try growing up if you haven't noticed yet the Vampires in her books seem to all find some kind of sexual attraction to all creatures in her books. Who cares grow up and move past that fact. She has developed these creatures into a very observant and sexual people. So guess what from time to time they are going to have sex be it with the same sex of family... yeh it sounds bad but oh well. As for the description of the Taltos, no forget it this is what I got from the book.It starts off with Lestat ranting about how readers felt about some of his past writings. He try's to explain how he feels and is portrayed by using slang and broken English. You should skip the whole first chapter right off it really does no justice to the book. Move onto the story at hand.At this point people complained about Lestat's use of slang how he try's to talk like a gangster. This book takes place in current time. What douche bag goes around talking like he's from the 18th century, is it not his point to blend in with humans and not stick out more than he already does. So this book takes up where the last one left off which is all fine and dandy but it leaves you wanting more. The whole book is basically Mona learning their ways as Vampires and finding out secrets that her family has kept from her. Yeah yeah they go out in search of her missing child, which is a Taltos. After they find out what happen to her child and some of the secrets that they have kept them selves the story slows down to a close with a meeting between Lestat and Rowan. His two proclaimed subjects leave him and he is once again alone.Now if in fact there was another book to follow this one to give us closure on his fate as well as Quinn and Mona that would be great. Since this book is the last of her Vampire Chronicles we are only left with a bittersweet end. The descriptions she used in this book of people, places, and feelings leave you with a very vivid picture of the world through his eyes. It's a great read to kill time like I do at work lol. If you do nothing in life but read and write you may find something lacking in this book. For one such as my self who maybe reads once a month and reads only Anne Rice books, this book with hold you to the very end only to have you feeling like there is more to come. No No kids this was the end of a long legacy she has left us. God bless her and maybe she can find it in her heart to write us just one more for the age's one more to satisfy our bleeding desire for closure. Yet I am sure we will only want more lol.P.S. to you losers who hang out in front of her house get a life lol damn I cant believe people actually do these things. She a great writer but damn do something to help society with all that free time you have you bums."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved this book, as I have loved all of the Vampire Chronicles. It pains me to see the harsh, judgmental comments that people feel they need to share. I believe someone else said this quite well, Mrs. RIce didn't write her books for us, so they'd read the way WE wanted them to. She wrote them for herself, so that she'd be happy with them, so SHE could choose how the story developes. Those of you that act personally insulted because the book didn't end up like you wanted it to need to rethink the purpose of the READER in this relationship. The author writes, and you, the reader, read the book. If you don't like the book, then don't read it again. But don't you dare tear apart the book because you want to rewrite it. If you want a new ending, write it yourself. Mrs. Rice doesn't allow fanfiction of her work because she wants her work to be her own, in all aspects. Many authors have done the same, because they don't want angry readers like yourselves to write a book based on their work and totally ruin the idea for the rest of us.I, personally, have only read The Vampire Chronicles; none of Mrs. Rice's other works. I probably won't ever read the rest of her books, but its because the topic doesn't interest me. The vampire chronicles interested me, and still do, and I will never stop reading them. I have absolutely no complaints about any part of the series.Thank you Mrs. Rice, for writing these, and ignore the comments of the fools and buffoons who would try to shape your work in their image."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I absolutly hate hanging endings. I purposely don't watch TV because the season endings kill me. I am not very patient when I have to wait several months to see how something ends. I was so upset to finish Blackwood Farm and have it just drop off the way it did. However, when Blood Canticle was released, I bought it in hardback just to be able to finish the story! (I never buy hardback simply because I go through books very quickly and buying hardbacks add up.) Needless to say, I was not the least bit disappointed. I believe that it wrapped up the story at hand that began with Blackwood Farm and Merrick. Is it a good ending to a series? I don't think so, but I also don't think it was meant to be, whether it is the last book in the Chronicles or not.My mother always told me I was strange because I would always read \\"horror\\" books. I started out with reading Christopher Pike's young adult books. I have been reading Anne's works since I was in junior high. I was introduced, as many others were, to Anne by Interview when curiousity got the better of me after seeing the movie in the theater. After that, I was hooked. Her method of blending history, philosophy, theology, and fantastical fiction is absolutly beautiful. It makes me jealous that I don't have such talents (though I like to pretend that I do). I say bravo to Anne for producing such a wonderful work of art. I think that your eloquence of style is absolutely breathtaking.Lastly, to those of you who love Anne's style of writing, you should read her son, Christopher Rice. He inherited his mothers grace of pen."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm an extremely faithful reader of Anne Rice for years, and sometimes it is hard to be objective on someone's work when you love her as much as I do, but I'll try to be objective.And I apologize for any mistakes of english, I'm french, so it's a litte difficult for me to write in english.This said, I felt like a duty to post a review on this site, after writing an e-mail to her, a few months ago, to tell her my entire support. Not only because I'm one of her faithful reader, but because I felt some comments were an complete lack of respect to her, as a person, and mostly as an author.As a beggining author myself (I insist on the word \\"beginning\\", as I'm currantly writing my first novel), I imagined how painful it has been for her to read such venimous comments about her novel. I couldn't imagine that the responses had been so cruel for her and her work until I read all the comments posted here. And most of the time, truly, for the worst reviews, there are no really arguments, there are not really ideas to defend this point of view. So, it often lacks credibility.Writing a novel represents an HUGE ammount of work, researches and studies. I can't help but being in admiration when I realise how much she works for every single novel she writes. Before beginning to write, I had not the slightest idea of how hard it truly is to write a novel. Writing on your own changes everything in your life, and it changes the way you perceive the work of an other author. It changes everything. You have far more respect for an author, now that you understand how difficult it is. You realise how much an author is involved in his work, how much his writing represents in his life.There had been diffamous comments here. Doubting that she had written this book ... I hope the persons who wrote that realise how painful it can be to an author to read such a thing. When you begin to write, you realise the power of words, how it affects people, how it can make them laugh, or cry, or think.So, even if you didn't like this novel, respect is an essential thing. And I sincerely think that a lot of comments were purely disrespectful, for both her and her work, which deserves at least respect.As to the book in itself, I was, as always, delighted with every page. I cherish every line, every single word she has ever written. She is the author who gave me the desire to write my own stories, and this is while reading her novels that I realised that the rest of my life would be dedicated to writing.Reading her has changed my life. I used to see the world in black and white before reading her, now I see it in colors.I've got the most sincere admiration for her and her work, and if someday I got such a beautiful career as hers, I'd be the happiest person in the world.She has offered me, through her writing, to see the world, humans, religion, with such an fresh way ... I've grown up reading her, and her novels have been the most passionate pages I've ever read of my life.If I could, I'd put a dozens stars for this book, five is not enough."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm not sure why there's such controversy (and only on Amazon it seems) about this book.I loved that there was finally a real union between the vampire and Mayfair chronicles and this book essentially married the two, putting both to rest.The book was even better when you saw Anne's heart through the words. She is Rowan, Stan is Lestat. It was the end of a series but also the final chapter of her own love story on earth.I loved it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I think this book was great, it deserves more than what all those bad reviews gave it. They miss the true story. They want an ending some sort of a tragic ending. But how can you end a saga that doesnt have an ending. It was the perfect end to something that has or knows no ending."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"First os all, this book was not a complete flop at all. some readers may very well have expected the exact same stlye and story type, but what no one is paying attention to is the fact that Anne rice stays very true to her perseption of each character. Rowan has become a weak desperate child, mona is still the stubborn brat, just learning to take herself differently. ECT. each character in this book has followed through in the course that they were set upon. stoy lines change, so do characters. stop comaring it to all her other works and take this one for what it is, a new chapater."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"While I felt this novel was not the worst of Ms. Rice's novels, I certainly don't think it was one of the better ones, either. I have been reading multiple reviews in magazines and here and the spectrum of feedback about the book is pretty widespread. I rank The Vampire Lestat and Interview with the Vampire as two of my all-time favorite novels. Since then I have enjoyed all of her books, from any of the various \\"series\\", but never as much as those first two. However, my very serious discomfort with this novel is a problematic timeline and other discrepancies. It seemed that events and memories Lestat relates from his life, his personal timeline and other personality traits and preferences, were inaccurate, compared to what has been established in the past, and then the timeline for the Taltos community was confusing as well. I felt that there was sloppiness, and inaccuracies, especially in reference to Lestat's past - and this was my big issue with the novel. However, I still enjoy her writing and did feel that her characters, instead of stagnating, evolve in interesting ways (yes, outside of the discrepancies). It's the lack of editing that seems to be so problematic. Yet I remain a Rice fan."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Ms. Rice has lost her ability to write, keeps churning out junk.Hopefully her \\"turn to Jesus\\" won't make people sick as well.This wasn't worth the price paid, especially if you enjoyed \\"Interview with the Vampire/Vampire Listat.\\" It's a put down of her earlier works, when she was fresh."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"When I first read the reviews for &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; my heart sank--I had been looking forward to a good read, Anne Rice style. I requested the book as a present, so I was still obligated to read it, regardless of the negative reviews. I admit, the first 115 pages or so are rough, as described they are filled with a manic, egocentric rant by the vampire Lestat. Once the rant has time to play itself out a wonderful, curious and intriquing story is revealed--that of the Taltos. Those of us who are Rice fans will already be familiar with the Taltos, yet this story reveals more details concerning the character of these unique beings. I give the book five stars because if you survive the hackneyed beginning at the hands of Lestat, a whole new world is revealed. Rice is not all washed up or rung out from mourning, she still has a trick or two up her sleeve. If you enjoy having your vision of the world and its wide variety of beings revealed in vivid detail, give &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; a chance. With patience you will find that the rambling of Lestat is there to create a counterpoint to the languid world of the Taltos. Moreover, those who shy away from goth, will find that the Taltos offer a sci-fi element that is refreshing. Rice is a gifted writer, mistress of detail who is so brazen that she even combines several different genres (horror, science fiction, the fantastic and romance)successfully, between the covers of a single book. You go girl!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Not more than ten minutes ago I finished reading &quot;Belinda&quot;.Yes. Anne Rice's 1986 novel under the name Anne Rampling. An absolutely brilliant, wonderfully compelling and very REAL piece of work_minus the mysticism. Truth to tell, this was the third time reading this book. I loved it the first time_somewhen in the late 1980's and I love it even more now. Of course for different reasons. Fifteen years ago I was a teenager still living at home. Now, I am a 33 year-old man living on my own, trying to hone my Goddess-given creative abilities into something worthy and memorable. Times have changed. I have changed. My outlook on life, love, people, art, beauty_everything has changed,is changing and will continue to do so until the day I die (and quite probably even after). So what is my point? What has &quot;Belinda&quot; got to do with &quot;Blood Canticle&quot;? Simply this...Everything, everyone CHANGES. It's an inevitable fact/law of nature. It is my belief that artists_whether litarary, musical, pictoral or what-have-you_because of our creative, 'feeling' natures, are more responsive to life's little alterations that occur daily. And as we change so to our creations change. Art history has clearly shown us this. Think Rodin, Picasso.Now, no matter the cause, be it external, simple, complex, beautiful or unpleasant, the result is always the same. We are no longer who we were. Jeremy walker could not be the be-loved author/illustartor of little girl's books after meeting Belinda. By the same token we cannot expect Mrs. Rice to be the same author she was two years ago or for that matter, two decades ago. Even more so now given her recent losses(sadly, her husband Stan Rice and happily, her weight_as reported by People magazine). She is not the same person in mind, spirit and body who wrote T.V.L. all those years ago. I for one understand this and accept it. All we can expect is that she remains true to herself, her art and the message she wants to reveal. Which brings me to &quot;Blood Canticle&quot;.I thoroughly enjoyed reading B.C. It did not send me into raptures (as T.V.L. did when i read it the 1st, 2nd, 3rd...you get my point). It did not reveal certain truths and lessons that I can apply to my life as it is now (as &quot;Belinda&quot; did). Perhaps this will come in the 3rd or 4th reading. Yes. I will read it a fourth time. I enjoyed this book simply because it did what ALL A.R. novels have done_taken me out of this mortal existence into another realm, through time and beauty. For those few hours, I will always be grateful and thankful.So what Lestat is no longer the same brat prince we fell in love with in T.V.L. Thank goodness! I am very glad he isn't. I mean, he's been around for what, two centuries How can we NOT expect him to cahnge? Not sad to say, even ghosts, withches, spirits and vampires_yes! Vampires, are subject to that six letter phenomenon...CHANGE. Lestat is everchanging, ever-evolving. It's what makes him interesting and I love him now as I loved him then. As for his saintly asperations...We ALL have dreams and desires that will never, ever be realised in this lifetime. Lestat himself acknowledges this truth. It does not mean however that said aspirations should be left buried to be forgotten. They are part of who we are. They are part and parcel of who he has become since &quot;Memnoch The Devil&quot;. Deal with it.Lestat still goes around doing exactly what he wants in his own inimitable style. Only now he seems closer to understanding his own sense of morality, though some issues still remain inscrutable. Hell, he even managed to surprise himself by TRULY falling in love. In LOVE! You can't get a better catalyst for change than that! Now can you?Anne Rice, in allowing Lestat to grow yet still remain true to himself, all things considered, has remained true to herself as a gifted artist. Come what may (and I am looking forward to what does) I will always be a devoted reader.Before I end, I must say that I do hope to read more Belinda-type books from Mrs. Rice now that the chronicles have been laid to rest...for the while, if the rumours are to be believed. After all these years I still find the lives of mere mortals like jeremy and Belinda quite refreshing and interesting_at least when Anne Rice does them."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"The Vampire Lestat wants to be good. In fact, true to form, he wants the whole enchilada--he wants to be a saint. But the road to sanctity is paved with distractions--new vampires to make,new victims to drain dry, and parallel Anne Rice mythologies to meld together. Yes, in this final Vampire Chronicle, the worlds of the Vampires and the Mayfair Witches are going to merge. How? Those who read BLACKWOOD FARM already have a clue--eager young newbie-vampire Quinn Blackwood is crazy-in-love with the youngest witch Mona Mayfair, but Mona's at death's door due to a wasting disease brought on by her giving birth to a Taltos-human daughter, which child was spirited away by a lone male Taltos to an uncertain fate 4 or 5 books ago.Who? What? Where? Don't worry--newcomers will get all the backstory they need, because almost half of this relatively slender tome is taken up with the various characters getting together, squabbling, freaking out and providing Cliff Notes to everything that's going on. And when the plot does kick into gear, it zooms merrily along. Make Mona undead before she dies-- check. Drive Rowan Mayfair nuts--check. Exorcize a ghost at Blackwood Farm--check. Take off to a remote Caribbean island overrun by vicious drug lords holding the remaining Taltoses (Talti?) captive--check. In its final third, the novel becomes a Saturday morning cartoon featuring a seven-foot-tall, kitten-faced Taltos fembot in a leather miniskirt wielding automatic weapons, and Lestat bringing down a helicopter with fire-bursts. Either you'll buy this zaniness, or you won't, but it sure isn't boring.(Personally, my jaw dropped for about 25 pages.)Is this a fitting coda to the Vampire Chronicles? Everyone is going to have a different opinion, though for my part I feel that Rice's ultimate responsibility is to her own vision, and she should end things as she sees fit without undue rancor on the part of her readers. I'm sure plenty will disagree--just look at some of the outraged reviews in this forum already--but debate on this issue could take up more volumes than Rice could hope to write in an Undead lifetime. Now THERE'S a scary thought."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"THIS POSTED ON 9/6---BRAVOReviewer: Anne Obrien Rice (New Orleans, LA United States) - See all my reviewsSeldom do I really answer those who criticize my work. In fact, the entire development of my career has been fueled by my ability to ignore denigrating and trivializing criticism as I realize my dreams and my goals. However there is something compelling about Amazon's willingness to publish just about anything, and the sheer outrageous stupidity of many things you've said here that actually touches my proletarian and Democratic soul. Also I use and enjoy Amazon and I do read the reviews of other people's books in many fields. In sum, I believe in what happens here. And so, I speak. First off, let me say that this is addressed only to some of you, who have posted outrageously negative comments here, and not to all. You are interrogating this text from the wrong perspective. Indeed, you aren't even reading it. You are projecting your own limitations on it. And you are giving a whole new meaning to the words \\"wide readership.\\" And you have strained my Dickensean principles to the max. I'm justifiably proud of being read by intellectual giants and waitresses in trailer parks,in fact, I love it, but who in the world are you? Now to the book. Allow me to point out: nowhere in this text are you told that this is the last of the chronicles, nowhere are you promised curtain calls or a finale, nowhere are you told there will be a wrap-up of all the earlier material. The text tells you exactly what to expect. And it warns you specifically that if you did not enjoy Memnoch the Devil, you may not enjoy this book. This book is by and about a hero whom many of you have already rejected. And he tells you that you are likely to reject him again. And this book is most certainly written -- every word of it -- by me. If and when I can't write a book on my own, you'll know about it. And no, I have no intention of allowing any editor ever to distort, cut, or otherwise mutilate sentences that I have edited and re-edited, and organized and polished myself. I fought a great battle to achieve a status where I did not have to put up with editors making demands on me, and I will never relinquish that status. For me, novel writing is a virtuoso performance. It is not a collaborative art. Back to the novel itself: the character who tells the tale is my Lestat. I was with him more closely than I have ever been in this novel; his voice was as powerful for me as I've ever heard it. I experienced break through after break through as I walked with him, moved with him, saw through his eyes. What I ask of Lestat, Lestat unfailingly gives. For me, three hunting scenes, two which take place in hotels -- the lone woman waiting for the hit man, the slaughter at the pimp's party -- and the late night foray into the slums --stand with any similar scenes in all of the chronicles. They can be read aloud without a single hitch. Every word is in perfect place. The short chapter in which Lestat describes his love for Rowan Mayfair was for me a totally realized poem. There are other such scenes in this book. You don't get all this? Fine. But I experienced an intimacy with the character in those scenes that shattered all prior restraints, and when one is writing one does have to continuously and courageously fight a destructive tendency to inhibition and restraint. Getting really close to the subject matter is the achievement of only great art. Now, if it doesn't appeal to you, fine. You don't enjoy it? Read somebody else. But your stupid arrogant assumptions about me and what I am doing are slander. And you have used this site as if it were a public urinal to publish falsehood and lies. I'll never challenge your democratic freedom to do so, and yes, I'm answering you, but for what it's worth, be assured of the utter contempt I feel for you, especially those of you who post anonymously (and perhaps repeatedly?) and how glad I am that this book is the last one in a series that has invited your hateful and ugly responses. Now, to return to the narrative in question: Lestat's wanting to be a saint is a vision larded through and through with his characteristic vanity. It connects perfectly with his earlier ambitions to be an actor in Paris, a rock star in the modern age. If you can't see that, you aren't reading my work. In his conversation with the Pope he makes observations on the times which are in continuity with his observations on the late twentieth century in The Vampire Lestat, and in continuity with Marius' observations in that book and later in Queen of the Damned. The state of the world has always been an important theme in the chronicles. Lestat's comments matter. Every word he speaks is part of the achievement of this book. That Lestat renounced this saintly ambition within a matter of pages is plain enough for you to see. That he reverts to his old self is obvious, and that he intends to complete the tale of Blackwood Farm is also quite clear. There are many other themes and patterns in this work that I might mention -- the interplay between St.Juan Diago and Lestat, the invisible creature who doesn't \\"exist\\" in the eyes of the world is a case in point. There is also the theme of the snare of Blackwood Farm, the place where a human existence becomes so beguiling that Lestat relinquishes his power as if to a spell. The entire relationship between Lestat and Uncle Julien is carefully worked out. But I leave it to readers to discover how this complex and intricate novel establishes itself within a unique, if not unrivalled series of book. There are things to be said. And there is pleasure to be had. And readers will say wonderful things about Blood Canticle and they already are. There are readers out there and plenty of them who cherish the individuality of each of the chronicles which you so flippantly condemn. They can and do talk circles around you. And I am warmed by their response. Their letters, the papers they write in school, our face to face exchanges on the road -- these things sustain me when I read the utter trash that you post. But I feel I have said enough. If this reaches one reader who is curious about my work and shocked by the ugly reviews here, I've served my goals. And Yo, you dude, the slang police! Lestat talks like I do. He always has and he always will. You really wouldn't much like being around either one of us. And you don't have to be. If any of you want to say anything about all this by all means Email me at Anneobrienrice@mac.com. And if you want your money back for the book, send it to 1239 First Street, New Orleans, La, 70130. I'm not a coward about my real name or where I live. And yes, the Chronicles are no more! Thank God!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Illiterature at its most defining point. The plot and characters cruelly disjoint. This isn't writing that will edify, but typing: Word processing who can buy?"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm extremely happy that the Vampire Chronicles ended with Lestat, and that he has returned to the vampire I fell in love with. I was concerned for him after his encounter with Memnoch, but Lestat's humorous and descriptive voice still prevails. At the end of this journey, I find myself incredibly satisfied. Thank you, Anne Rice. =]"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am a huge Lestat fan, and eagerly await every novel he is in. I assumed once he met God and the devil, there would be nowhere else for our fiendish rascal to go to. At least a place worthy of his vast powers. There isn't anyplace on earth he can't go to or anyone he can't overcome, so Lestat only has his own conscience to battle.Lestat now wants to be a saint. He is wracked with guilt at killing, except any immoral people who deserve it, especially other \\"bad\\" vampires. He is in love with his companion, Quinn, and his newest creation, the beautiful but bratty Mona. These two are what keeps Lestat in check from doing any great wrongs. He has become more of a guardian and mentor than simply blood thirsty vampire prince. The underlings new experiences are now Lestat's. He has become even more civilized. Lestat sleeps in a fine bed and at times changes his clothes to put on sleep attire. A far cry from the man who slept in coffins or even in the earth.Anne Rice has combined the adventures of her witch clan, the Mayfairs, with vampires. Together they focus on a single goal, to find the \\"tall people\\", from Anne Rice's \\"Taltos\\" and \\"Lasher\\" series, who have mysteriously disappeared with unknown intentions to humankind.Lestat is a great character, but \\"Blood Canticle\\" just doesn't allow Lestat to be Lestat. His two pupils, though he loves them dearly, holds him back. Lestat is feverently in love with the mortal witch, Rowan, and promises to give her the dark gift one day, but it isn't enough. Lestat almost single handed, kills an entire island of drug smugglers by means of blood sucking, neck breaking or fire emitted from his being. It isn't enough because it is all done with such ease, I never worry about him. Except for the sun, Lestat has no weakness. Lestat's own stumbling block is himself, and any mistakes he makes can easily be rectified becasue of his great power.Lestat needs to make a great statement to the world, beyond the \\"rock thing\\" that he did a few novels back. Maybe Lestat, on his quest for sainthood, decides to make over the world to what he considers to be a better place and the result are the old vampires like Maharet, witches, mummies, demons and other Anne Rice creations, come out to finally stop him.If your a fan of the vampire Chronicles, especially Lestat, then you have to read \\"Blood Canticle\\". It's a decent read, but my favorites are still \\"The Vampire Lestat\\", \\"Queen of the Damned\\" and Memnoch the Devil\\"."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I read this novel a few months ago, so it's not really fresh in my mind, I admit that. But after reading these reviews, I just had to write one myself. I couldn't NOT. So here it is.\\"Blood Canticle\\" is a good novel. It is. It's better than LOADS more out there, thousands upon thousands. But it is NOT spectacular, which the first three in the Vampire Chronicles most certainly are. It's just not at that level. Personally, I don't have a problem with Lestat's \\"lingo,\\" because I can see him speaking and writing that way. The whole \\"Saint\\" thing did and still DOES bother me, but when you think about it, it is in his ego. BUT only when you look at Lestat's character a certain way. The rant on Memnoch was somewhat bothersome, but again, I can see Lestat doing it... but, once again, ONLY if I think about Lestat's character in a certain way. I guess a lot of it is just accepting, which I have a hard time doing when I love a character so much.There are more problems still: Merrick was one of Louis's \\"3 Loves,\\" yes? We learn this in \\"Merrick.\\" So how come, when she dies, Lestat doesn't even TELL Louis? And the only times Louis IS mentioned is in an insulting fashion.... which I find really very sad in a variety of ways.Also, considering everything, Lestat STILL seemed out of character for me. This started in TotBT for me, and it comes to a pique here. \\"Little Brother,\\" I just CAN'T see him calling someone that. It's not the lingo, the saint bit, the rant over Memnoch.... Just, OVERALL, I disliked him in this. It was NOT him. Especially with that whole Rowan love deal...Nonetheless, when reading this novel, one has to take into account everything that Anne has been through. The death of her husband would obviously have had a HUGE impact upon Ms. Rice. Consequently, I'm not blaming her for this novel at all, save perhaps that whole computer thing which could have been cleared up easily with the help of an editor. And even then, benefit of the doubt. Hence, under the circumstances, I think she did a spectacular job... but that doesn't mean I have to like the novel.This novel was still GOOD. It just wasn't, a mon avis, Lestat or true VC material. It just wasn't AS GOOD as all that."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is terribly written and I am ashamed that Anne Rice would even think of submitting it to be published. The Vampire Chronicles have been fascinating and interesting, and so have the Mayfair Witches. There has been so much effort spent to fully chronicle the Mayfairs and the individual adventures of the vampires that to smash it all together in this novel is not only unfair, but just plain awful. Rice has lost Lestat--his voice lacks the quality and sentiment of previous novels, and really he is pretty boring and dull. His ravings about sainthood are rather uninteresting. He was not a good character to narrate this story. Rice could have spent a whole novel dealing with Mona's, Quinn's, and Lestat's adventures together, much less shortchange the Taltos story as well as the Mayfairs'. The writing is shocking in its shoddiness. I have been an extremely devoted Rice fan for many many years now, and this book is not only the worst of her novels that I have ever read, but is just a bad one in general. I am hoping that in the future she will consider allowing her editors to make suggestions and spend more time on her subject matter! By writing Blood Canticle, she has done not only herself but her readers a terrible disservice. I would not recommend this book to anyone; true Rice fans must beware! This is not the Anne Rice that we know and love."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Spending years loving Rice's work, I was eager to read what is to be the conclusion of the vampire chronicles. The matter-of-fact off-the-cuff manner of writing disturbed me - unlike the manner of speech we are accustomed to from Lestat. The tiresome Shakesperean quotes from Mona &amp; Quinn. Tired of Mona's portrayal of herself as Ophelia already! Enough! So much about Saints and description of the clothes Mona takes from Aunt Queen's closet! Trivial dribble. So little substance. Far too much time wasted on the lackluster story of the Taltos. The rather odd and inexplicable appearance of Oncle Julien &amp; Stella. This feels like a half-hearted effort to appease fans looking for another Lestat story and close off the vampire series. It is evident her mind was not wholly focused on this with the understandable personal matters she faced at the time she penned this work. It is a sad farewell to the Vampires so many have grown to love. All the best to Ms. Rice in her new endeavours."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Alright, so we've had devoted Anne Rice fans defend the book merely because Queen Anne of the Damned wrote it, and former fans trash the book because it's not what they thought it should be. I'm not a fan of hers; I read some of Interview a few years back, and put it down because I thought it was extremely poor. Myself, I think she's an awful writer. However, maybe my objective position will be one of reason.Look, Rice has the right to defend her work. It's her own book, and what she wrote was what satisfied her and what she thought was the proper ending to her Chronicles. However, she should not treat her fans, even the ones who have left her, so poorly, and actions like her diatribe here and the fact that she actually complained about those who did not like \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" within this work are inexcusable. It smacks of egotism, haughtiness, and poorly disguised desperation.Fans of Rice, I can understand when a beloved series takes a unexpected and seemingly ill-advised turn. I'm a Star Wars fan; enough said. You have the right to feel disappointed by it, and to voice your opinion, but there's no reason to be so venomous.Because when you really get down to it, Anne Rice is really just a bestseller writer who found a particularly passionate niche audience, and then realized it was profitable to exploit it. Call it stereotyping all you want, but goths, at least the more fanboyish of the subculture, tend to be losers, quite frankly. Kids with no social life gather in whatever dark, tragic subculture they can, because it's like, so deep, and will totally disturb your parents, those conformists. But here's the truth: Lestat is not a real person, he's just a character in a series of books, and not a particularly interesting character either. Jay Gatsby, Stephen Dedalus - those are characters that transcend from the written word to life. Going so far as to profess love for a Eurotrash vampire is rather lame. There is nothing particularly glorious or deep about death and tragedy, unless there happens to be a particularly unique insight behind it. You will grow up and fall in love and see sunlight, and by that point, you'll forget all about Anne.Here's the most important thing about the debate, and what makes it seem so ridiculous to me: There are so many authors out there that are worth reading, analyzing, and discussing passionately. James Joyce, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Cormac McCarthy, Ernest Hemingway, Fyodor Dostoevsky, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and many, many others. And that's just in prose fiction! Please, give some real authors with real insight a chance. No, you don't have to read a classic to get merit out of reading, but at least realize that great authors truly do exist. You're just being played by Anne's hype machine and cult if you treat her as the alpha and omega of literature."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"First off, Lestat wants to be a wholesome saint....that will tell you something about this book. Anne Rice turned Lestat from our loving Brat Prince into....i don't even know what! Not to mention that there is way to much stuff about Taltos and Lasher. The entire book is centered around the now, meek Quinn and the bratty little fledgling Mona. No other characters are even in the book from the Chronicles besides Lestat and Quinn. And for the last of the books, shouldn't they be included. Louis is reffered to once, and not even by Lestat, and Maharet sends Lestat a letter. Come on!! The book is littered with Christian refrences that just ruin it. The book is slow and again, way too much about Taltos and Mona. I WANTED LOUIS, ARMAND, AND MARIUS AT THE LEAST. It was very dissapointing, and the only reason i read the whole thing through was in hopes that another Vampire would be included. Sigh. I could have written a better finale! Sigh. Oh Brat Prince, what a way to go!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Taltos, shmaltos, who cares about these evolutionary deadend salamanders. God has Lestat turned into a bore of a vampire. Do us a favor Lestat fly into the sun. Anne Rice has taken a great franchise and turned it into a loser. And these Mayfairs, what a bunch of dreary people they have turned out to be. Especially that Mona, pining away over her mutant daughter Morrigan, hoping that Mother and Father can be brought back out of the deep freeze. Oh for the good old days of the Vampire Chronicles!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I love Anne Rice. Everytime she had a book coming out, I would be the first to check it out online. My sister loved her, too, but I think I loved her more. The Vampire Chronicles were and still are some of the best books I have ever read.That is, until Blood Canticle came out. I can't express the sadness that swept over me when I discovered that this would be the last of my beloved Vampire Chronicles. Then I actually read it.What happened? Part of the allure of the Vampire Chronicles was that it breathed poetry and life into a subject that had been previously ignored by all other authors. Anne Rice wove a tapestry, a true world filled with the the undead that varried so greatly that you couldn't help but loved each and every single one of them. You could go on for pages without someone saying a word, just a calm peaceful time that could be used to describe the way the moonlight looked on the Mississippi River. Now you can't.It seemes every page is perferated with some trite meaningless diaglouge with some lame character. Lestat says, \\"Dude\\"? and, \\"Yo\\"? I'm sure I know some fifth graders that wouldn't even consider using such immature language in thier writting. Why does Anne Rice, one of the most sophisticated authors in the world, use such stupid words?And where are the other vampires? Louis, Armand, Daniel, David, Pandora, Marius, Santino, and every other vampire that ever showed his or her face in the novel? I love the Coven. Where are they? How could Lestat abandon those he had once loved so much?Lestat needs to be fixed. First he rants at us in a ridicules way, then he falls head over heels in love with a mortal he would have killed had he been in the right state of mind, and he abondoned the greatest vampire that ever came into being. Lestat! What's wrong with you? Where's the vampire that authored the best of the Vampire Chronicles? I understand that you went through HEaven and Hell, but surly that could hardly tarnish the vampire we all loved!In conclusion, all I have to say is WHY?!? If Anne is reading this by some divine miricale, please write another book! Make us believe in Vampires like you made us do with all the other novels. Bring back all the other vampires, including Lestat (ther real one that is), and delve back into that world of the living dead that we all adored so much."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Lestat advises us to skip chapter one if we are unhappy in our reading. Should have listened, skipped that chapter and all others.This ends my love affair with the Vampire Chronicles, which honestly provided me with great pleasure over the years. Seems to me the Publisher should have had some sense of decency. There is no mistaking this book for anything other that a childish,amateurish attemmpt to capitalize on a &quot;name&quot; author.Someone inform the publisher that it's perfectly ok, and even preferable to turn down an inferior effort..moreover, a service to the public. Kind of tarnishes the pleasant memories I have of Ms. Rice's prior efforts. Anyone reading this review, take Lestat's advice..skip chapter one..then skip the rest."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Although this novel is certainly not among Rice's best, it's not a slugging pittance in a boot and shoe yard either. Her characters shoot off in the same direction, albeit with a few hitches in their steps. The plot, while not rivotting, certainly has its moments and I'd say that if you like Rice's other novels, you won't find this one a total loss.However, that said, I think it's rather interesting that Anne Rice felt the need to vent on her readers with a strange diatribe right here on Amazon. (You'll find it if you go looking.) I've been to Mardi Gras twice in New Orleans, as well as Halloween, which is a wonderful even there. Rice lives in an amazingly charming mansion and lives the high life. Every cent of the money that paid for such wanton opulence came from her fan base, who elevated her writing and characters to cult status through faithful support. I'm one of them, so I ought to know.Mrs. Rice, you are a sad testament to the handful of spoiled best-selling writers these days. Get off your high chair and write something with true literary merit if you want more reverence and respect. Your readers have spoken, so I suggest you listen!!! I'm a creative writing instructor, so, yes, I noticed the multitude of flaws in this somewhat enjoyable read. Your fans were right, if a bit heavy handed in their critiques. But isn't that what you encourage? Heavy-handed writing breeds a heavy-handed readership. If the glove fits, slide it on and sit back down at the keyboard. Or, if you really want to wow the critics, try inventing a NEW series that doesn't involve vampires, succubi, or anything else that goes bump in the night. Take up thy bed of nails and walk!!!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm a real fan of the chronicles, but this one sucked ass. ALL he did was talk about how he wanted to be a saint, saint Lestat blagh blagh and hes all skytzo.

He talks like some kid they picked up on the street,is this the LESTAT WE HAVE COME TO LOVE? NO!!!!and Where IS EVERYBODY ELSE?! Just quinn, mona and him, no other vamps.There's NO CONCLUSION, and ooh yeah put michale on list of people in the family Mona's screwed.All of Quinns dead realitives have gone on to the 'other side'(except his mom *shudder*) now he cant screw any of his dead realitives ::sigh::, oddly enough, he now dresses Mona(girlfriend) up as his Aunt Queen (dead) and has her wear her clothes and shoes...If you've read the chronicles, dont get this one, if you havent you will be confused like hell.Sadly this is the LAST one too. Watch FOX make it into a movie..."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"i really wanted to read this book as it tied together and ended both the lestat series and the taltos series, which i really desired closure on. unfortunately, i'd rather have lived w/o the closure provided in this terrible \\"novel\\", which had nothing novel about it. i nearly quit after the first two chapters where anne/lestat rant and rant about unloyal fans for not adoring memnoch the devil. talk about huge ego. and my initial excitement about mayfairs and lestat (confession,skipped blackwood farm, now glad i didn't waste time/money)in the same story made me nearly gag. why does everybody-male female human vampire taltos whatever-fall in love with miserable rowan mayfair? so very disappointed. high hopes, crashed and burned. don't waste your time and money. find anything else. like an essay by an uninterested 3rd grader failing english class."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"True, this may not be one of Anne Rice's best books that we have come to know and love. But all in all its a fun book to read if you have a long flight ahead of you, or its a lazy winter day and you wish to curl up with a book by the fire!I can understand why some of Anne's fans are super ticked. The writing at times is a bit much, but lets face it......its a book on vampires...not Shakespeare!Lestate, Mona, and Quinn meet again! I won't spoil it for you any more, other to say its a fun filled book.Don't get your hopes up with the thought of her first books, but all in all, if you are a fan of her work, you will like it none the less.I am already looking forward to Anne's next book which is due out in November!Happy Reading!!!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Well, I'd like to start by saying even though I own the book, I haven't read it yet despite being an avid Anne Rice fan. It's on my list, I just haven't had the time to read it. I was notified by a \\"friend of a friend of a friend\\", so to speak, that *gasp* a well known auther had the nerve to respond to critique. So here are my mixed views:Point, Anne says in her response this exact quote, \\"First off, let me say that this is addressed only to some of you, who have posted outrageously negative comments here, and not to all.\\"As far as that is concerned, there are too many people who seem to have missed that line when they said she \\"flew off the handle\\" at her reviewers.Counterpoint: lines such as \\"But your stupid arrogant assumptions about me and what I am doing are slander. And you have used this site as if it were a public urinal to publish falsehood and lies.\\" and, \\"...when I read the utter trash that you post.\\" kinda hurt my head. Mostly because I think it's funny that someone I held in such regard could be so hypocritical, and partly because Anne's just asking for more. (Hate begets hate, etc.)Counterpoint, again: this line probably would have hurt me, had I been actually embroiled in either side of things - \\"There are readers out there and plenty of them who cherish the individuality of each of the chronicles which you so flippantly condemn. They can and do talk circles around you.\\" I like your books, Anne, I'm obsessed! But, as you can probably tell I'm not one of those \\"talk circles around you\\" types. I overuse commas when I write, I can hardly ever piece together a straight thought when I'm upset in any way, and don't even get me started on verbal communication.Self-slander aside, I don't believe liking or disliking someone's work has anything to do with their intellectual levels. Nor do I think that of whether you are able to read further into the piece of work. Even though I liked each of them I started and restarted QotD and Memnoch twice each, Lestat once, until I actually owned the books and had some free time. At that point I flew through them and was so engrossed. I fully re-read the chronicles 3 times. I had meaningful conversations dealing with real life ideals and beliefs based off of them, with people who hadn't read them!Let's go back to the other side of the spectrum for a moment: I have friends who dislike Anne Rice literature, all of them because they want storyline and Anne gives so much detail. Nobody has yet said to me \\"gee, I liked the first 8 books of hers I read and this one just makes things so different so I don't like it.\\"Short end of the story: I personally think everyone who is taking deliberate sides and bareing their teeth at each other is being a bit silly."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"OK so this wasn't the best book I will admit. Anne Rice is an awesome writer! I do love her books, but this one was somewhat disappointing. However, it wouldn't be so disappointing if it wasn't the last book. I really would love it if she would write one more. Wrap things up, tell us what happens to Lestat, Pandora,Marius, Armand, the rest of the cast, and my Favorite, Louis. Anne, if you ever read this, I really admire your work, and I understand that you're tired of writing. But if you want to end a series, then you should really end it. Not just stop."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"i am a longtime fan of anne rice and every single one of her books. i am reading blood canticle for the 2nd time, just because i feel like it. i think i have read all of her books at least twice because i find them even more amazing when i revisit them. the characters stay with you, follow you home, they go to bed with you, you can't get them out of your mind. as for blood canticle, i appreciate the coming together of the two stories (witches and vampires). i think that is why merrick appealed to me also. anyway- anne's words and her storytelling, and the sheer vitality of her characters truly puts you under a spell. a spell that you don't want to come out of. it has always been this way and with this last vampire chronicle, it still is this way...spellbinding. ms. rice has given so much to her readers over the last few decades in the vampire chronicles. what a treasure this final chapter is!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am surprised by all the negative reviews over this book and tend to think it is more a case of disappointed fans with too high an expectation than any real problem with the storyline and writing.For myself I found it enjoyable if not profound. It's complexity comes from interweaving several sets of characters and storylines into a single novel. If you haven't read the Witch series, for example, you'll likely be lost. I appreciated the cameo's of these characters and particularly liked Rowan's participation since I always considered her an interesting character that deserved some more attention.The book reamins a light read however largely because of the linguistic style used. It's very difficult to be horrified, saddened or even concerned about anything going on when Lestat is prattling on in his fresh new 'slang' intermixed with his usual egotistical prose. Even in his dramatic scene with Rowan near the end I couldn't help chuckling at some of his turns of phrase.In short, it was an enjoyable and light read. Light is not necessarily a bad thing, it was well-written and flowed well. If you, like me, are a casual appreciator of her work overall you'll probably enjoy this one. I tend to think it's only the truly hard-core fans who were hoping for some series revalations or particularly dark and dramatic writing who might have been disappointed.Regardless, nothing but obvious immaturity justifies some of the particularly nasty personal attacks posted here.The only thing that really disappointed me is the rumor that this is the last of the Chronicles. I can only hope Anne may one day reconsider."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am THRILLED about Mrs. Rice's apparent life choices and what appears to be progress toward regaining the ability to be happy.

If her personal recovery means I pay for ONE less-than-exemplary book, I'll take it! Hurray for Anne! Thanks so much for all the wonderful tales, and I apologize for my, and my fellow readers SELFISHNESS.

I have to now go back and see what's the deal with the Taltos. Overall it as a fun read."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Ah Lestat, I've missed you! To be brief, I would say I loved this book, but that sort of gushiness doesn't suit an Anne Rice book.However, if you've become so enthralled with the Chronicles and all things vampyric, you seem to be disappointed. May I say that -in this world where too much tv and film are hopelessly predictable and derivitive- you may also be so wrapped in your visions of what Tom Cruise, I mean Lestat, would do that your derision of Blood Canticle was preordained.If you're so disappointed, get out a pen and proceed writing something original- not fanfic for the boards. Lestat is not yours.Beautiful, vivid, enthralling; I couldn't put it down - that's my most helpful review."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Combining my favorite vampire with my favorite family was an exceptional treat. Anne Rice writes (via Lestat) with a fast paced and sensual delivery. LeStat's wonderful wit and intelligent languaging alone make the read worth it. The old character's revisited have often changed (such is life) and it's interesting from the perspective of time gone by in our own waking realities and those of the author. Julian Mayfair is always engaging and completely welcome in the storyline. As well, he could only fall short to one other character in strength and determination, and rightly so.The pleasure is in Lestat's personal ponderings and they tie in well with prior books while continuing forward with his ever present justifications of when to be good and why to be evil. Rowan Mayfair appears as a refreshing combination of realistic vulnerability and her old formidable self. This is a wickedly penned tale from the perspective of a huge character favorite."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Not necessarily the storytelling itself, mind you, but the way she goes about it. This is supposed to be the last book in the wonderous \\"Vampire Chronicles\\", right? There's a saying in the literary world, \\"You're only as good as your last novel.\\"Anne Rice apparently understands what that saying truly means. If you are going to end a series of novels, why end it with a spectacular bang? That leaves people wanting more, and you never truly get out from under the thumb of your own creation. It is better to go out in a fun way, whimsical almost, and enjoy yourself while writing it. That's one thing that DOES come through in this final book. Anne Rice enjoyed herself. I for one think that she deserves our praises, and our adulation, for that reason alone. She took back control of a series of books that SHE wrote. Kudos to you, Ms Rice."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"There are the vampires(Lestat,Marius,Armand etc) and there are the witches(Rowan,mona,suzanne etc)...Now Anne Rice brings the main characters(Lestat,Rowan,Mona) of each of the series together to give you the best of all.This is really a good way to finish the series...Here is the plot..Set in New Orleans, Blood Canticle is narrated by Lestat. The protagonist is a young Mayfair witch named Mona. At the beginning of the novel Mona is wasting away, victim to a mysterious disease brought on by the birth of her daughter, a so-called Walking Baby(a sort of taltos). As the novel plays out, Mona and her guardian, Rowan Mayfair, the current designee of the Mayfair legacy, reveal more and more about the powerful genetic plague that has haunted the Mayfairs for generations: the Taltos.In what she believes to be her dying hour, Mona - highly romantic in nature - buys quantities of roses and takes them to the house of her lover, Tarquin \\"Quinn\\" Blackwood(who was introduced in \\"Blackwood Farm\\"), who is a vampire and a dear companion to Lestat. She lays the roses on his bed, intending to spend her final moments here. So that she does not die from the massive decline that her body has undergone, Lestat makes her into a vampire. He does this largely to satisfy Quinn, who could not bear to see Mona as she was.(This happens at the beginning of the story,continuing from where the previous novel left off)When trying to prevent Mona's family from discovering her transformation, Lestat unwillingly falls in love with Rowan Mayfair. Secretly, she falls for him as well.Lestat's blood is quite powerful -- matching that of the eldest vampires. Mona learns this quickly and discovers that she can easily dispatch inferior vampires with the powerful gifts that Lestat's potent blood has bestowed upon her. Now her renewed vigor and her anger about her situation with Rowan and their shared secret of the Taltos causes her to lash out verbally at Rowan and Rowan's husband Michael(Michael Curry,for the mayfair series). As she struggles with herself, Lestat, and Quinn, she learns her place in her new world.As she learns, Lestat pledges to find her Taltos child if it still lives. For this, Lestat nees the help of Maharet. In a very short time, Maharet provides critical information for their search.The story comes to a dramatic conclusion as Mona, journeying with Quinn and Lestat, comes to the remote island where the Taltos live. But instead of finding a secluded paradise, the three vampires learn about years of intrigue and civil war among this isolated race of beings. In the end, the remaining Taltos join the Mayfair clan at the medical center in New Orleans, where they can be safe, learn, and be together as a family.Mona and Quinn are again together and will remain so, presumably without the companionship of Lestat.Rowan Mayfair seeks out Lestat, half in love with him and exhausted by her life, requesting that he perform the Dark Trick. Lestat declines, pained as he is, because she is a guiding force for the Mayfair family and he cannot take her away from it.\\"Enjoy...................Nigel."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This novel was a great reading for me. Don't pay attention to the immature and negative reviews here on Amazon about it; most of those reviews come from narrow-minded people who dislike Anne Rice for various reasons. How ridiculous and judgmental to behave like that.Aside from that, this is a great book. It is certainly not in the same league as The Vampire Lestat, or Memnoch the Devil, but it is a good reading.I especially liked the entire Taltos concept; felt like a novelty since I haven't read much at all about the Mayfair witches, and the rest of Anne's occult world (I've only read TVC and New Tales of the Vampires).The only thing that was sort of a disappointment, was that if you're going to end The Vampire Chronicles, please do it by giving us more: I wanted to read more about Maharet, Mekare, Armand, Louis, Marius and all of the other vampires that I've grown to love throughout the years."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I read this book a few days after it was released. I've reread it three times since then as I do all of Anne Rice's books. I have read every single book that she has written, right down to the Beauty series, and I have to say that she has never been a disappointment.Lestat's evolution into a saint and then inevitable plunge into the old Lestat was to be expected but that doesn't mean it was written poorly. Lestat is Lestat and as an aspiring writer I understand how sometimes books just write themselves. Just because you want Lestat to stay the same throughout the years it doesn't mean that he wants to. These characters are entities unto themselves and just like any character or person, for that matter, they evolve and grow over time. They don't always make the choices you want them to or become the people you think they should be but as Anne so eloquently put it, if you don't like it, read something else.Well I loved it, Anne. I look forward to what else you have to give to the world whether it is simple reviews on Amazon or a whole new genre of books. Thank you for the years you have given us thus far and the gift of your imagination."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I really enjoyed this book especially because I really love &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; and this is a follow up. There's more religious references and I think a lot of people don't really understand it, but we have understand that she's going through a lot and her Catholic faith is really important to her. I read her all her books and events in her life has a lot of impact to her writing. A lot of people hated the movie version of &quot; Queen of the Damned &quot; but I really enjoyed it. I took for what it is, not as a word for word movie version of the book. I think comparing her works is really unfair because she wrote them at different times of her life under different situations and events."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Have finally got the whole vampire chronicle series. Can not wait to read the rest."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"And I hope Anne will let us know about his farther achivements soon. I enjoyed this novel a lot; stunning opening chapter, which raises a lot of questions and touching, romantic ending. In a way it took me back to The Tale of The Body Thief, but Blood Canticle is absolutely different. It shows us the most domestic side of Lestat, beyond the glamorous fiend we grew to love. I don't know whether he ever saw Christ in His Glory, and I don't think I quite get to understand Memnoch, but this I know: Lestat is no longer 19-years-old. Sure, he will never abandon his eccentricities and wild disposition, his taste for fine clothes and rags now and then. But we cannot lock him up in his dazzling youthful body forever. Claudia would have never imagined a most cruel revenge.I like the moral evolution of Lestat, I like the way he comes closer to Armand's experiences and feelings on his own. I like that he meets (at last!) the \\"other sex\\" as Mona says (next step will be to accept that mum never loved you, my darling, it was not just she was bored or uninterested).Blood Canticle is a good novel of characters, with great dialogues scenes. We do not get here a thrilling and intricate plot, true, but the book is highly readable and very easy to follow, just as Lestat promised in the first chapter."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved this book so much, I needed something to take my mind off of the horrible state our country is in and this was perfect!I laughed I cried I forgot all of the dishonesty coming out of the Whitehouse for a couple of days. The Mayfair witch saga was my favorite set of books of all time and bringing them together was just perfect. Anyone who says they didn't like this book just needs to read the Mayfair witch books again and (I just read them again for the third time) and then read Interview With a Vampire and then read this one again. It was the perfect ending. Ms Rice, I am so sorry for your loss I know that this is something that you will carry with you forever just know that you are in the hearts of your TRUE fans and we love you!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"To say the least, I have read Blood Canticle more than once and I found it not what I expected at first. I am a huge fan of her work and personally, I found nothing negative about this book. The characters were presented in the way I have found comfortable at least to me, I have not been disappointed at all. I would like to clear up one thing that I found discouraging about these people who leave reviews on Amazon, they are just here to complain and that was not what I intend to do. I intend to tell Anne Rice exactly how I feel. I love Quinn and of course ALL of the Mayfair witches!Anne Rice, please don't listen to people who are just here to complain, please! I happen to have found your book incredible like all your books!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This was a wonderful book. I'm love with Lestat like never before. He has changed like we all do. With time, tribulations, joy, and pain we grown just as he has. He is the Brat Prince no more. I always loved reading as a child but really fell in love with books and reading when I read Interview with the Vampire. Every book from Anne Rice has been wonderful to me. I was able to relate to each of them each in its own special way. To all who trash this book, it's ok not to like it but get a life and just read something else. Get over it. It's one thing to give a review, it's another thing if you're going to burn Anne Rice at the stake. You all act like it's the end of the world. You try to dictate Anne's writing and our choices for what to read. What is wonderful for me might not be for you and vice versa. That's how things work, stop being so hurtful, angry, spiteful, and SAD! I don't know who hurt you but I'm sure it wasn't Anne Rice. Give your review but be careful with what you say, stop being so incosiderate. Don't say she shouldn't write anymore. I and many others still want to read her beutiful books. Anyway I couldn't put the book down and really enjoyed all of it. Anne Rice continues to enthralls me."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"The Vampire Chronicles continue with this tale of love, madness and redemption.In the first novel since Memnoch The Devil, Lestat is the central character on a quest to find love.Mona Mayfair has come to Blackwood Farm to die but instead she is given eternal life with the undead. As Mona is coming to terms with her new found life, Rowan Mayfair, neurosurgeon and witch, finds herself falling for Lestat. Rowan's husband, Michael Curry is seeking Lestat's help as he feels his wife is slipping further into madness, and Patsy, a country-western singer, returns to avenge her death at the hands of her son, Quinn Blackwood.\`Blood Canticle' is classic Anne Rice; dark, sexy, gothic and filled with rich descriptions.

Blood Canticle was the only way in my opinion to end was was in fact, one of the best Chronicles I have EVER read, and if you've been through Lestat's adventures then you would understand why in fact, this was ended in such a manner.Always loved are my books, and always will I keep this one and all of the others in high standards.I would give it 10 stars if I could!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I would like to begin with the fact that her books have NOT gone down hill since Queen of the Damned. I started reading Anne Rice when I was 11 or 12 years old. I am now 16. I think that the chronicles have improved very much since the first three books. Even though I loved the first three dearly, I would not however rate them as the best that she has written. I have read Interview atleast three or four times, and I have read a couple of the other books a few times as well. But I have read every Vampire book she has written except this last one. I know that this book cannot be THAT bad. Sure, the first hundred, or even two hundred pages in a book are gonna be bad, but almost all of the books are this way. She is still introducing the characters!!! It always gets boring in the begining but then once you get to the best parts you need all that was read in the begining. I cannot believe that you people are critizing her work like this. I know that any book written by her could not be this bad! Back to my original subject though, you say that the first three were the best? Then why is it that everytime I try to reread one of those (besides Interview, I only love that one so because of Louis) I can't do it. My mind keeps drifting off to either Body Theif or Armand, or yet my favorite Blood & Gold. In my opinion you must have not \\"got\\" all of the books to be critizing them in this way. Go back and reread them and perhaps you'll be able to understand what you obviously missed.Anne Rice's stories have grown greater and greater with time."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Furthermore, WHATEVER, PEOPLE!!!!Ya'll NEED to leave my girl Anne alone, she must be feeling better, 'cause she definitely put her foot in the pot with this one.With that said; I absolutley loved this book.Although this was not my favorite Anne Rice Novel; (My favorite by far is \\"Tale of the Body Thief\\" no, maybe it's \\"Memnoch the Devil\\".

I was like what am I going to read now? Dang!!!!Quinn, is so cool; he just shoulda been a brotha :-). I loved the fact that she finally put some black (one) folx in her books, since New Orleans is full of us.I was hoping Quinn, Mona, Jasmine, and Jerome, would be back (maybe not Mona, cause boy I thought she would be an ugly sight.)I have to agree with one reviewer who said that \\" the residents of Blackwood Farm, WERE/ARE some of the dumbest people on the planet\\" And the withces just shouldna been with my Lestat.All I have to say is if you liked The Vampire Lestat, you should like the story of Quinn Blackwood.

You have your own mind.Anyway, Thats all I have to say. When is the next one coming out? Does anyone know?"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"With the number of reviews spewing negative rhetoric about Anne Rice's 'Blood Canticle,' one would automatically assume that it is to be expected within a free country. This is a country in which its citizens are free to criticize, praise, or be indifferent to a work of fiction such as the book in question. However, the same freedom goes both ways from the readership...to the author. Suffice to say, this may be the most intriguing tale about a writer who stands up, not only for her work, but for herself.After reading her response to the negative reviews, I was impressed by the sheer courage it took to write it, let alone leave her address so that some of you could return the book in exchange for your \\"hard-earned\\" money. I am, however, curious about something. Have some of you shown the same courage by actually returning the book to her and asking for your money back? Keep in mind that it makes no difference compared to what I am about to touch on, but it is merely for my own curiosity.In weight of everything here, I can honestly say that as American citizens, we must endure these types of responses from cynics, critics and speculative people alike. That's the given. Although, I also can't help but think about how they knowingly gave their \\"hard-earned\\" money to such an \\"atrocious\\" book. The same \\"hard-earned\\" money that you people pay for the internet connection that allows you to post these reviews? Anyway, these same people that are so caught up in this site and so insistently determined to arrogantly preach about writing as if we should take their opinions as professional analysis are also the same people who do it with one goal in mind: To get under your skin.By \\"your,\\" I'm referring to fans of Rice's work and, of course, Anne Rice herself. Some of the negative reviews are so amazingly similar in writing style and structure, even in grammar and vocabulary (however horrible it may be), that it leads one to believe that some of you are posting under different names to concur with the same opinion. Not to mention taking the opportunity to get another personal shot in for the hell of it.Yes, you can criticize. Yes, you can do so free of consequence if you do it without defaming someone's character, but do it knowing that you leave yourselves wide open for the same critical analysis. With that being said, let's keep one thing in perspective here. All of you are nothing and nobody to hold your collective weight over a writer such as Anne Rice. In fact, I don't even think any of you are worthy enough to be speaking the English language judging by the mundane and cockeyed approach of your feeble criticisms. Your pseudo-intellectual whiney rants serve no purpose other than to promote yourselves. Deny it all you want, but it is impeccably obvious due to the redundant nature and somehow elevated aura the majority of you carry about yourselves. You are not relevant. You are not important. And for years to come, your greatest accomplishment will be the fact that you managed to get under the skin of a critically-acclaimed writer and her fans.Wow.Are you all impressed with yourselves? I wouldn't be if I were some of you, because while you all post here with your swelled egos and lack of intelligence, keep in mind that others could care less what you think, which I know would be the kiss of death, otherwise you wouldn't proudly post your opinions for all to see and reply to.I felt inclined to write this because I also write for a living. I write, and I report. I use the facts to report, and I use my heart to write. It's a balance. I believe that Anne Rice writes from the heart, but does so responsibly. For those of you that had or are still going to have choice words for Rice and her work, keep in mind that she does what none of you could ever dream of doing and has what none of you could even dream of having. She has relevance. The rest of you will fade into obscurity, and the only way we would have known that you even existed is by the dimwitted and negative comments you left behind.

I would only like to say that when you know the series and what it is about; when you've read every book; when you know and love every character, you should be able to see past the lingo/editing/plot lines. Because, aside from those things, Blood Canticle was still a part of the Vampire Chronicles. A true fan should be able to appreciate it for that reason alone."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Oh, I \\"get it\\" alright. This book is rushed from beginning to end. All the descriptions, a highlight of most Anne Rice books, are complete asides, and even written in parentheticals as if to underscore that AR does not feel like describing things any more. I love the character of Lestat, and there may have been some minor advancements, but the best thing I can say about this race to wrap up the story of the Taltos was that it was a quick read. Lacks the density and richness of the other books. I was not crazy about Menmnoch, but still found it an interesting read."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I understand that over time we all use slang, but the amount in this book felt very forced. Like Lestat was trying to remind us how cool he is (or at least was). And I can even understand that he wants to be good, but saintly? From previous books the only reason Lestat would want to be saintly is to be worshipped. His reasons why seem more political than religious. At least we know he watches CNN. His saintly obsession just goes overboard.I was very disappointed that the book did not center on a more vampirical story. In Merrick, Lestat left with Louis, David and Merrick. In Blood Canticle, not a mention of why he parted their company just that he had been alone for months. It has been a long time since we have seen many of the vampires together. I was hoping that Maharet would come to see Lestat. The constant fighting and making up reminding me over a bad romance movie. Lestat was indeed bespelled by Blackwood Farm because his sauve nature sure melts away. Hasn't he used a computer before? Lestat and Rowan falling in love, I'm thinkging no. It felt like I was supposed to be feeling more depth between them, like an unspoken bond, but I just couldn't.Peace Keeper Quinn, the pretty backdrop. And with Mona is with like Rice was trying to combined Claudia and a young Lestat, but she apologized so quickly I just started to become annoyed.Yes, this is my 'stupid' opinion.

It is Random House and Anne Rice hoping that people will buy it simply because it is a Vampire Chronicle. But is absolutely the worst novel that I have ever read.Anne Rice has always been hit (Queen of the Damned) or miss (Blackwood Farm). But &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is so bad that it defies even being cataorgized as a miss. Stupid, incoherent, and mind numbingly insipid, this book should be propping up the missing leg on your sofa.Characters are eviscerated. Well developed plot lines from previous novels are thrown away in a sloppy attempt to put to rest subject matter Anne Rice is bored with. It is so insulting and so base that will not ever waste my time with another Anne Rice novel."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Why waste my time with an extensive review? Anne Rice can't even be bothered to even attempt a half-way decent novel. I mean &quot;Yo&quot;, &quot;Little Bro&quot;... that's just stupid.Plain and simple, &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is a disaster. Anne Rice's book contract should be torn up, and she should retire before she humiliates herself any further."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I absolutely loved the Mayfair witches novels - until &quot;Taltos.&quot; Then the series took off in a direction that can only be classified as &quot;tripe.&quot; Poor Anne Rice - I think she has finally run out of inspiration for her novels of the supernatural. Having suffered through &quot;Blackwood Farm,&quot; I thought, well, let's try one more time. Thank heaven Ms. Rice is putting the Vampire Lestate to bed (in fiction, at least - there's rumours of a Broadway musical, heaven forfend!). The legion of fans who have made Ms. Rice a best-selling author deserve better than this sloppy, boring, idiocy that passes for fiction.

Well, this was definitely a badly written book. It's very inconsistant with the characters and personalities in the other novels and I certainly would not call what she's done with the character of Lestat maturing.

Anne Rice turned Lestat from our loving Brat Prince into....i don't even know what! Not to mention that there is way to much stuff about Taltos and Lasher. The entire book is centered around the now, meek Quinn and the bratty little fledgling Mona. No other characters are even in the book from the Chronicles besides Lestat and Quinn. And for the last of the books, shouldn't they be included. Louis is reffered to once, and not even by Lestat, and Maharet sends Lestat a letter. Come on!! The book is littered with Christian refrences that just ruin it. The book is slow and again, way too much about Taltos and Mona. I WANTED LOUIS, ARMAND, AND MARIUS AT THE LEAST. It was very dissapointing, and the only reason i read the whole thing through was in hopes that another Vampire would be included. Sigh. I could have written a better finale! Sigh. Oh Brat Prince, what a way to go!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I just want to say how much I was looking forward to this book (especially after hearing that it would be the final installment of the Vampire Chronicles). I own and have enjoyed all previous books in the series.That being said I was exptemely disappointed with Blood Canticle. Lestat began his &quot;change&quot; a few books back but I think it was taken to far. He's become boring, for lack of a better word.I like the combination of the Mayfair witches and the Vampire Chronicles. I was also looking forward to seeing what happened to the Taltos, but it just seemed all wrong for an Anne Rice book. It's like she rushed through it. There wasn't her usual elegant descriptivness about the things going on. I think there was too much going on for a book just over 300 pages long. I also didn't like how the Taltos story line ended (as far as Ash and Morigan were concerned).Aside from that, where were the other characters from the series? If this is indeed the final book it would have been nice to include something about some of the other characters (I don't think Loius wasn't even mentioned).Overall very disappointing...I hope Ms. Rice will take some time and come back in a few years with another of Vampire Chronicles if only to wrap things up more fittingly."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This has to be the most forced out book I read and one that is total incredulous (vampire stories are anyway, but it still has to make sense). Heck, no one talks like the way Lestat talks! Get real! Slang is ok, but carried to extreme as AR does it becomes tiring and just plain irritating. It takes the focus off the story. I had to put it down after 50 pages. What's the matter with you AR? You've written enough books to know that. My guess is you needed the money to pay your bills and you weren't inspired or had any stories left in you. The BC, rather than being a labour of love is more like the results of constipation. I think I'll send it back to you for a full refund like you suggest in your litany and I hope other paying customers that you offend do likewise. Maybe you'll be more grateful and perhaps a little more humble."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"From the opening pages, I was like..\\"what is this nonsense?\\" Lestat, whom I love and adore, sounds so different and quite honestly, ridiculous. He isnt the same Lestat he once was. Rice has made him uninteresting, for the first time. I didnt even think that was possible! He is so subdued, and almost weak. No more strong, dangerous, sexy \\"force\\"? Well, i love him anyway. But Mona is way too predictable and it seems Rice was sort of stuck in a rut with her character, very repetitive and boring. Even Quinn's charisma was gone, he was almost like an afterthought. I didnt like the focus on the Mayfairs, I wanted and expected the vampire story line, not Taltos. And Lestat falling in love with Rowan? It didnt ring true at all, I couldnt connect with that. This book sounded like Rice was just trying to write and get it over with. It didnt even sound like she was into the story! Or even cared about it. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I used to wait eagerly for a book of Anne Rice and her Vampires Chronicles saga, sadly I will not be doing it anymore. Let's hope, for our sake that Anne Rice recovers her wit and writes more interesting books."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Of course I will always love Interview with The Vampire, The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the damned. But many Anne Rice fans agree they go down hill from there. There are certain circles that refer to my previously mentioned first three vampire chronicles as the ONLY vampire Chronicles. All the rest come off like fan fictions from some other person.Nothing done now can change what had been. The Interview with the vampire is still the interview with the vampire. The Vampire Lestat is still The Vampire Lestat, The Queen of the damned is still The Queen of the damned. I just pretend it's 1989 and the others were not published yet. They did not happen.Lestat, in my mind, is still a rebel, still a brat, still mischievous, still questions things, still fearless, still angst driven, still a fighter, and still perseverent. He's still riding around on his Harley, hunting down his killers and falling in love with the world. He's still an optimist (He has a pessimistic view of humanity in Blood Canticle.) He still views society today as an age of innocence and he's still my Lestat. All the rest... to me.. They're just fan fictions.I wish Anne Rice had done a book that she once hinted about years ago. The idea of the vampires being found out by some mortals and possibly captured and studies and then the escape... Lestat talks about this idea in The Vampire Lestat. That could have been a great novel, especially with our proud and defiant Lestat. This conformist, prude, depthless, two-dimensional Lestat would fold under that pressure but the Lestat I know would not. The first three vampire chronicles- that's my Lestat. That will always be my Lestat and no one can take that away from me.Lestat in this book is whining, conformist, a hard-core Catholic who questions nothing, a cold hypocrite, a misogynist, a prude, and pessimist. This is not our Lestat! Our Lestat was a brat. Our Lestat questioned things. Our Lestat was always a rebel. Changing his personality this abruptly is like saying he now has blue hair and orange eyes. The angst is gone. The fearless soul that could never be oppressed is gone. I did not love the fangs or the blonde hair. I loved his personality. I related to Lestat, not the vampire! She's forgotten who Lestat was. Lestat used to see this world as an age of secular innocence where evil doers were scarce. And now he says there are many in the cities who deserve the vampire's kiss. He's become depthless (if he had much depth to begin with.) He's two dimensional. He's hunting down rogues and rule breaker vampires! He is a rogue and rule breaker! I want Lestat, I don't want Angel from Buffy The Vampire Slayer!I want Lestat the way he was meant to be. If Anne Rice needed a new character to express her obsession and new-found conformist mentality she should have used ANYONE but The Brat Prince to express it! I think this book disappointed every Anne Rice fan, everywhere, one way or another.I know I'm being harsh but Anne calls this maturing for Lestat. Being mature does not mean clinging desperately to something without question. Being mature does not mean becoming sexist with fashion, and seeing evil everywhere where he once was in love with the goodness in society. Lestat was a brat but he had faith in goodness. Now he doesn't seem to have that faith. His real and pure faith has been replaced by something superficial, something dark. And the restless spirit, the angst driven rebel, the one who could not be dominated... Our beloved antagonist, he's gone.... I don't know who this creature is narrating the story but it's not our Lestat."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Apparently Anne Rice has decided to sacrifice quality for being on the best-seller list. Having read all of her books, I was hopeful after reading Blackwood Farm, but not anymore. If you want to read great Anne Rice, try the Vampire Chronicles before Memnoch and the Mayfair witches before Canticle. She's turned into the McCaffrey of horror, writing more for money than quality. This book is a disgrace to the fans and to their beloved Brat Prince."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"What happened Anne? What is it that possessed you to write this miserable piece of literature? I have been finished with the book for just over a week now. I thought perhaps giving it time to sink in would help (as it did for Violin and Blood and Gold) but a week removed and I still hate this book as vehemently as I did when I finished it. After reading the last chapter I cried for a solid half-hour - mourning the loss of characters and stories that I dreamed of that Anne would not come through with.I was hoping for a magnificent send-off for our favorite Ricean vampires! A farewell to end all farewells. No chance of ever coming back. Lestat going down in a blaze of glory.No, instead we get Lestat going down in a blaze of self-pity. I was disgusted with what Anne has done with Lestat. I realize that we have not really gotten a taste of Lestat since Memnoch but I never imagined that he would turn out to be obsessed with redemption. I think, instead, she is speaking of herself when she speaks through Lestat.Lestat's monologues and dialogues with Mona and other characters are a travesty! What happened to our well-spoken vampires? Why is Lestat using &quot;dude&quot;? Editors Anne. Please. USE THEM.I once admired and looked up to the &quot;great&quot; Anne Rice. Now, I'm searching for a new favorite author."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Fortunately, I was wise enough after struggling through the god-awful &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; not to run out and purchase &quot;Blood Canticle&quot;, choosing to get it from the library instead (surprise:brand new book, no waiting list!). I didn't think anything could get as pathetic as &quot;Blackwood&quot;, but boy was I wrong! This book is a bad joke. All of the spiritual conflict and superb characterization of her first ten-or-so novels is gone, and she seems to be doing a Saturday Night Live commercial for Catholicism. I'm not sure why I'm even bothering to write this, except maybe as a plea to Anne Rice herself.I often wondered how such an incredibly gifted author could have slid from masterpieces like &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot; and &quot;The Witching Hour&quot; to the utter c#@p she's putting out now.However, on her website, Anne gives a very good answer: she doesn't use an editor, or use any objective input other than her own! This may have worked for awhile, when her publisher was so pleased with her sales they allowed her carte blanche to submit any old thing she could type out, but I'll bet that's about to change with her ever-dwindling readership.I recently saw Anne on a talk show, and she appeared to be as sharp, brilliant, and charming as ever, but not a drop of that is spilling onto the page.Please, Anne, stop insulting your fans with these dreadful, laughable books. If &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is the best you can do, it's time to retire."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Whenever a new vampire chronicles book comes out; I run out, get it, and read it right away. The classics like Vampire Lestat, Queen of the Damned....and even the individual focus books on Pandora and Marius were mystical and exotic. Those books took the reader on a journey through time with the tortured central character. Lestat was always the brat prince in all of us; and in his adventures we found our thrills.This new novel by Anne Rice is the finale of the series. As a finale, it is very much a let down. I couldn't believe that the story had no driving plotline....and seemed so meandering. Lestat seemed like a shadow of himself.I found myself bored with the text. Usually Anne Rice is so descriptive of the world that these Vampires live in, but in this book descriptive text is thrown around like an afterthought.I have read every book in this series; and this was a very disappointing finale. Instead of going out with as Lestat would say, &quot;A bang, baby!&quot;. The story ends with a whimper, leaving the reader not caring about what happens to Lestat or all the other characters....and what a shame that is. I think that the author needs to get away from these characters for awhile and come back once she is fully recharged and has a story worth telling.My final point is that the novel seems almost rushed to conclusion. The new one came out about a year after the last one (Blackwood Farm), and seems like it was put out just to fulfill a contractual obligation to the publisher. Go to the library and read it if you must, but otherwise just skip it and reread the prior novels. They are more satisfying to reread than this novel."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm more a fan of the Mayfair Witches (and, to be fair, really only of The Witching Hour, although I've read Lasher, Taltos, and Merrick), and don't know much of the Vampires beyond the movie. But I found Blood Canticle to be readable and interesting enough to keep me moving through the book--unlike Taltos, with which I got very impatient and Merrick, which never caught my interest.What this book \\"felt like\\" to me was the end of a prematurely-cancelled television show, where the various loose ends are wrapped up as conveniently as makes sense. (Did anyone ever see the last episode of \\"Once and Again\\"? Like that.) It offers a resolution to those who desire it. In fact, it was SO tidy, it almost felt like a fantastical fan-fic, bringing favorite (if you can call Rowan a \\"favorite\\") characters together to resolve two separate storylines.Maybe Rice is just tired of the whole vampire/witches thing. Has anyone else who's had the same job for over 20 years ever got tired of it? And instead of coming out and saying \\"please quit bothering me about these characters\\" she wrote this to give everyone an ending. I think it was a kind thing to do.Also, if I read the dates on the book correctly, she finished writing the story around the same time she found out her husband had cancer. I don't think one had to do with the other. To those who are being mean to her about her personal life, please stop. Don't you have any imagination? Can't you imagine what it would feel like to have the death of a loved one thrown at you as a criticism? Lame."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book was hard to get through. Being a fan of Lestat, it was hard for me to accept that out of nowhere he starts talking like Brandon Kutcher. Saying \\"that's cool man\\" and \\"dude.\\" It ruined it for me."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"After reading positive reviews (including 2 star) of this &quot;book&quot;, I must say that taste has gone way down hill.&quot;Blood Canitcle&quot; is the worst book I have ever read. What makes it even worse is that Anne used to be such a great writer. This is just... I'm not sure how to describe it. It's almost as though she's just given up. After Blood and Gold, Blackwood Farm and now Blood Canticle, I know I have given up as well. Give me Queen of the Damned or even Merrick... I take anything over this door stop.The positive reviews still baffle me. I can only assume that these people would gush over anything that Ms. Rice cares to dole out. It's time to stop praising this &quot;writer&quot;, and it's time to stop donating to &quot;Cash Cow: The Vampire Chronicles&quot;."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"In the first pages of Blood Canticle, Anne Rice's beloved Vampire Lestat tells us not to fret, that this story will pick up where Blackwood Farm left off and that the story will have a beginning, a middle and an end (in other words, a plot). Well, Rice has just made a liar out of Lestat, because there is very little plot to be found in Blood Canticle. As a matter of fact, there is very little to appreciate in this self-loathing, overrought novel.The novel more or less does pick up the loose ends of Blackwood Farm. This time, it is the young, sickly Mona who is made into one of the undead, upon Quinn's demand. But Mona proves to be Lestat's female counterpart; mean, always complaining, unrespectful and with very little love left in her. The one thing she does wants most, however, is to find the daughter who was stolen from her so many years ago.Her daughter was one of the Taltos, a strange kind of creature that grows tall in just a few days and who nearly kills the mother that gives birth to them. She asks Lestat to help her find this people so that she can be with her daughter once again.And that's it. Lestat will moan about a ghost that will not leave him alone and Quinn, the great, carismatic protagonist of Blackwood Farm, is nearly forogtten and completely underused. And the melding of Rice's vampire and witches series doesn't go as smoothly this time around.Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles had taken a hard blow in the last few years, only to be given life again with Blackwood Farm. But now, it almost seems as though Blackwood Farm was a fluke, because Blood Canticle has very, very little to offer fans of the series. Even Letat has changed, and for the worst. Maybe it's time for Anne Rice to put the Chronicles to rest for a while to concentrate on something new and fresh."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"From the very first book, That I aquired at a used bookstore i have been glued to the pages of this author. \\"Blood Canticle\\" was definately no different. It was just as good as \\"Interview With The Vampire\\" which is still my all time favorite. Kudos to you Anne Rice, May you continue to bless us with your written masterpieces.Slainte"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Well, I must admit I couldn't put the book down. I read it within a day. It was fast paced and lacking the usual pages of description for this or that event.Immediately I recognized a different style. I immediately got the feeling Anne wanted to show us Lestat's evolving character. I was charmed by Lestat's turn for the better-his attempts at being good even if he is a little bad. I could tell right away by the language he used that he had transformed once more (kinda like Madonna!) to adjust to what he had experienced and what his envivornment was.Yes, I found it difficult to believe there was anything between Rowan and Lestat because well-they never really spent any time together. I felt Michael Curry's character had dwindled from a blazing masculine and powerful figure in The Witching Hour to nothing more than \\"Carlito the pool boy\\".I was excited, however, to see the Taltos again-probably my favorite of Anne's creations. I always wondered what an encounter between a vampire and a Taltos would be like and here I had that curiosity fulfilled. I can't tell you how ridiculously excited I was at meeting Oberon with his metallic nail polish chugging a cold glass of milk. I only wished there had been more of this character and more focus on these curious creatures. The story of the Taltos here seemed rushed and I was wanting so much more.I loved the book for its ability to keep me hooked. I loved the meeting between major characters like Rowan, Lestat, and a Taltos. Despite the fact that I didn't believe the love between Rowan and Lestat, and that I've always hated Mona since I first read about her, and still did, and thought she should die right away, I enjoyed the book a great deal.And on that note I want to make a comment on the heated critizism I've read. I was really amazed at how emotional some of the posts were and I got to wonder how can a book (or books) create so much heart ache? I understood a lot of the posts because I myself had felt this way at some point after reading some of her later books. I had felt anger, hurt, dissappointment. It became personal also, lashing out toward the author and the author's writing abilities-the same author who had run away with my imagination.It dawned on me that Anne had succeeded in making her readers fall so in love with her characters, that they felt protective of these characters. That was clear to see! To see so much dissappointment and anger because of how this or that character behaved in later books, how this or that event didn't make sense, or about how much they missed the \\"good old days\\" when it was just the good old vampire conflicts and the old Lestat. . .It really struck me that Anne should feel so proud to have created so much fierce affection from her fans that she had earned their scorn. Amazing that after writing several books that did not fit into the same pattern of the first ones her own fans had disowned her. I suddenly saw such a strange comparison of Anne as the Maker. Anne the Maker now divorced by her fans as they swore to never read another book-and making personal insults all the way. Only intense love can create so much scorn. For that alone I say to Anne \\"Bravo!\\" and well done. I think in the truest sense of you vampire lore scorn is the greatest form of flattery.I wont claim to never to read any more of your books though. I'm always interested to see how your evolution as a human being reflects itself on your works!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is a wonderful treat. The joining of Vampire and Witch mythology that was suggested in 'Merrick' is finally, completely and irreversibly realized in 'Blood Canticle'. It's extremely fast-paced, with refreshingly few detours into tales of long ago. Rice finally reveals what happened after 'Taltos' and it's deliciously exciting. The Talamasca are respectable and seductive once again. Mona Mayfair makes a wonderful addition to the world of Vampires and the consequences of her transformation are superbly dramatic, rich and exciting. There were many points when the story could have drifted off into a two or three hundred page recounting of some series of events or character bio, but everything is kept racing along at a terrific pace; tight and relentless. This book captures everything that the chronicles once were and should be. The passing mentions of some vampire characters are tantalizing and I don't see how Rice can leave the series after this book - in fact, her interview on 'The View' suggested that this might not be the last Vampire novel, as she'd previously stated it was. My fingers are crossed because this novel demands further adventures for all the characters involved and makes the reader hungry for more from Anne Rice and the denizens of her world. Vampires, Witches, Ghosts, Angels, Devils, Criminals and Saints - all the ingredients come together perfectly in this one."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Wow, I was shocked to say the least when reading Anne Rice's \\"re-buttle\\" to all the negative comments. I sympathize with her rage though. It's terribly annoying when readers, editors, etc; act like a book should have been written for them, and to their standards. The fact is, The Chronicles are Anne's, the characters are Annes. We are invited guests into HER world, if we don't like it that's fine, but to belittle her and the choices she made about HER characters and HER story is simply ridiculous. I'll admit, The Blood Canticle was not my favorite book in the chronicles, but I really appreciated being let into that world again with those familiar characters that I have come to love and crave! Thanks Anne for hanging in there, and thanks for allowing us to enjoy YOUR world."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I thought that this book was fantastic! It was not as good as some of her early books, and I wish it had been longer- that is why I only gave the book 4 stars. The story was about Lestat and the Mayfairs, which is why Maharet and Kahyman were passing characters. I would love to see more books about the other vampires as well, but this book stands alone as being a great story about Taltos, Lestat and The Mayfair witches. I have been waiting for that combo for years (and was hoping merrick would be more like)and was so glad to see it! It was also very riveting- I finished it the same day I purchased it! And for those who didn't like it and want to slam it, remember a few things. First, you don't have to buy it. Second, Ms. Rice recently lost her husband, so be grateful that she has written anything for us at all! Third, I really doubt that anyone could do this better than Anne Rice. She is a talented, wonderful person who really cares about her fans."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This is tripe.

I did not like the story, the plot etc. I think it was not a good book. But having to listen the narrator added to the pain. He changes from a man's voice to a woman voice, from one accent to another, and that was not only extremely annoying, but almost comical."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Many people seem to have issues with this book, however I think it is quite an interesting endeavor. Lestat wrote this book, not Mrs. Rice. Meaning she wrote it as Lestat would have written it and I think she hit the nail on the head. For me, I can always tell by the end of the first chapter if I will finish the book or not, and I was hooked. Blackwood Farm is one of my favorite books and it was nice to see where things went.It was a very enjoyable read and I await her next project."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Blood Canticle is neither \\"affected\\" nor \\"whiney.\\" It's a great book and well worth the money. Though I've never been overly fond of the character of Rowan Mayfair and don't see what Lestat sees in her, I'm glad Anne has brought these two together. (But oh! How I wish she'd write a continuation of The Mummy: Or Ramses The Dammed!) Obviously some people are just put off because she claims this will be her last book about Lestat. I, for one, don't believe that. I think one day she'll be walking down the street, perhaps after doing a little shopping or after a nice meal, and Lestat will pop up and tell her \\"Hello, Anne. Have I got a story for you.\\" Because if there's one thing about Lestat we all know, he can't be shut up."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This was a great book, in my opinion! I loved Blackwood farm and loved this one too...as well as everything else that Anne Rice has written. There have been, of course, some that I've enjoyed more than others, but that's just personal taste isn't it? Does that make those books truly worse than the others I enjoyed more?Most of my reading consists of non-fiction...Anne Rice is one of the few fictional authors that I will read. Does that make the other popular authors of today bad? Absolutely not. They're just not my style. My point...what exactly is the motivation for writing a hateful, slanderous review of a fictional book? Who is anyone to judge whether a fictional book is bad or not? What appeals to one will not appeal to another.I don't understand all the comments about \\"Where's my brat prince?\\", \\"This isn't Lestat\\", etc. Are characters not allowed to evolve over a period of time? My God! This character has been around since the '70's. Do people truly expect him to remain unchanged over the decades? How boring! Lestat is very much still the brat he's always been, he's just a brat about different things. He's evolved!I feel that novels are a glimpse into the authors soul. I am grateful that Anne Rice has shared so many of her stories with the public. I am saddened that this will be the last \\"Chronicle\\", but it is certainly her decision to make. I'll anxiously await her next book, no matter what the subject.Everyone has the right to voice their opinion. But there's a difference between posting a negative opinion and posting out-right crap. I just hope that if someone is interested in this book, that they will give it a try and decide for themselves."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Despite all the criticism this book has received, mostly from those too immature to handle the fact that an author does NOT have to cater to the audience, I found it to be a truly wonderful piece of fiction. Rice beautifully intertwined the _Vampire Chronicles_ and the _The Lives of the Mayfair Witches_ and brought both story lines to a close. Fantastic imagery perfected this incredibly masterful plot line. I felt I knew the characters moreso from this novel than the previous 13 books combined. The depth with which Rice explored their personalities is unmatched by previous work.A word to the critics screaming that Anne Rice is another spoiled author - grow up. When you have written and successfully sold 25 novels, you can have your opinion. Until then, no one wants to hear your self-serving whining."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is a piece of trash. There is no other way to express how much I vehemently despise &quot;Blood Canticle&quot;. I loved so many things about the &quot;Vampire Chronicles, especially &quot;Vampire Lestat&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Damned, and yes, even &quot;Memnoch The Devil&quot;. &quot;Witching Hour&quot; was probably one of the most interesting family sagas I have ever read.And &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is what we have been given as a &quot;finale&quot;? It is beyond a let down. It is insulting. One dimensional flat characters, no plot, no cohesion, &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is the very best example of writing a novel for a pay check. It is sloppy and base. Usually, I can find something interesting in even the worst book, but this novel is far beyond even the worst Jackie Collins.I shall adopt the new vernacular of Lestat.Yo, Anne, you're a hack, and any future novels you write should be confined to the very bottom of the barrel."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Like most of his kind, the vampire Lestat is more a sinner than a saint but since his meeting and metamorphous after dealing with Memnoch, he wants to be on the side of the angels. He proves it again and again when he and Merrick Mayfair help destroy Quinn's evil doppelganger Goblin. He shows his kind nature again when he turns Mona Mayfair, the love of Quinn's immortal life, into a vampire after being at death's door for two years.At Blackwood Farm, he helps a trapped spirit move into the light instead of being trapped between worlds. When Mona begs Lestat to find her Taltos daughter, he moves Heaven and earth and calls upon the mother of all vampires to help him locate the land of the Taltos. When they reach the Caribbean Island where they are held prisoners by drug lords, he liberates them and brings them back to Rowan Mayfair the woman he truly loves but will not touch.Lestat is one of the most fascinating characters in fiction today. He is living (pardon the pun) proof that one who chooses evil can also turn to the light and hope for redemption from some higher power. The meeting of the vampires with the Mayfair witches is a peaceful one and readers will be very pleased that these are two different forces of nature that can not only co-exist but thrive in proximity to each other. Anne Rice has written another special novel brimming with creativity, action and challenges the readers to question their ideas of good, evil, redemption and honor."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Witches and vampires and ghosts oh my! Anne Rice has done it again. She's created another episode in the life of Lestat the world's greatest vampire (at least in his mind). Blood Canticle is the tenth novel in The Vampire Chronicles although you do not have to read them in order to enjoy them or know what is going on.The first chapter is all Lestat. Conceded, whiny and all about his me, me, me attitude. Frankly you can skip this chapter as it really has nothing to do with the story. He did a wonderful job of annoying me the whole way through. The real story begins with chapter two. Quinn Blackwood (the focus of book nine Blackwood Farm) a newly anointed vampire by non-other than Lestat is the focus of Lestat's affection this time around. Rice really loves her triangles though and shortly the love of Quinn's life shows up on his doorstep sick and on the verge of her death. Lestat being the wonderful and loyal friend that he is gives Mona the dark gift as a favour for Quinn. She is magically transformed into this lithe of beauty with long curly red hair that is captivating to one and all. Her one flaw is she's extremely emotional and tends toward fits of crying and tantrums. These two characters remind me a lot of Louis and Claudia from Interview with a Vampire.Now we have a dashing trio of vampires. The dilemma put before them is Mona wants to find her child taken away at birth. Her child has the unique gift of being a Taltos, a group of secret people seven feet tall with no bone structure that grow to adult size within a few hours. It was this birth that put Mona (who's also a witch) on her deathbed.As with any good search there are obstacles along the way. The ghost of Quinn's dead mother whom he goes around telling everyone he killed by snapping her neck and throwing her in the swamp. Everyone thinks he's kidding but he's not. There's also the ghost of scary Uncle Julian and the adorable Stella. Uncle Julian is one of the finest characters in this story and is sure to make the hair on your arms stand up. Other obstacles include the Secret People themselves and whether or not they can or want to be found and a band of drug lords, a family of witches and of course the prince of darkness himself.One of the things I love about Anne Rice's books is her attention to detail especially when it comes to scenery. When reading it's obvious she loves New Orleans. Like an artist she paints its beauty, mystery and hidden darkness of the streets, architecture, natural surroundings and residents.Although Lestat is the narrator of this story he's not necessarily mainstream. He's sharing the stage with the other characters, his loves, although I think reluctantly. Lestat is not the gruesome killer he used to be. He's trying to be a reformed vampire. His personal goal is to become a saint and be adored by everyone but his internal demons seem to always get the better of him. If you pick up Blood Canticle you'll be able to witness another Lestat adventure. Most enjoyable.Review Originally Posted at http://www.linearreflections.com"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm a big Rice fan, ever since I read Interview with the Vampire when I was 13.

Memnoch changed Lestat. Well, who wouldn't be changed after traveling with the devil and talking to God? And this book continues so far with the change in Lestat. And Continues the story of Quinn and Mona, and not to mention the Taltos. I heard a rumour that this is the last of the Vampire Chronicles. That's the only disappointing thing in my opinion. I can't, and won't criticize the other reviewers. I'm sorry to hear this book isn't thought of as &quot;a good one&quot; by some people. But everyone is entitled to an opinion, no matter how distasteful it may be. Keep up the good work Anne. Even if all you do start writing about God and the Devil, and the sinners and the saints to go along with the religion, I'll still read it. Just don't change your writing style too much. It's so rich!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've just finished the book and I feel deflated. I tore through it in two days, which indicates that it was a good read, but really I think I was looking for some substance, the substance that crams some of Rice's best work, the substance that positively possessed The Witching Hour, which is for me her best work. And therein lies my problem I guess, I've never liked the Taltos storyline that resulted from this great book, I've never liked what the consequent trauma did to the characters of Rowan Mayfair and Michael Curry. I think I tore through the book hoping that Rowan would come to her senses, that she could cease walking with God and return to Michael.But in the end does any Rice character of importance ever escape the voracious appetite of Lestat?"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I don't have anything to say about the book that others haven't already said. However, many of you are saying that this is your last of the vampire or witch chronicles and you're more than right about that. In fact, you don't even have a choice. Anne Rice has stated multiple times in her phone messages that this is the last novel she will ever write about vampires or witches. I think it's pretty disappointing for a final bow out."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've read all of Anne Rice's books over the years. And this isn't the worst by far. In fact, I thought that it was a rather jaunty read! It moved quickly (unlike some of the witch books), with little extraneous content. I especially appreciated the fun she had with LeStat's character. I like his narrative voice. I think that Rice has allowed him to grow and evolve in an interesting and I believe plausible way. Why wouldn't an ageless vampire find spirituality? What else is he supposed to do with his time? Wouldn't shopping, acquisition and general mayhem get a little old after a while? I would think that discovering the meaning of his own life would be a logical consequence of immortality. It was a fun read. Nothing too demanding. Just fun."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved this book. I'm not sure what the \\"die-hard\\" fans were upset about. I'm new to most of her books. I think that's why the rest of us enjoyed this book so much. I had no preconceived ideas of what to expect.To me, Blackwood Farm was part one, and this is part two. I would say this book is part of the Vampire Chronicles AND the Mayfair Witches series. I couldn't wait to read this book, especially considering the great cliffhanger of sorts at the end of Blackwood Farm.I encourage anyone, especially those new to Anne Rice, to read Blackwood Farm and Blood Canticle. I hope Ms. Rice's \\"established fans\\" will relax a little and try to enjoy her newer works as much as the rest of us do.An added treat is the unabridged audio books of Blood Canticle and and Blackwood Farm; the unabridged audio book narrator is incredibly entertaining.I look forward to reading Ms. Rice's next release, as well as her older titles."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"While I have no words of harshness in this review I will agree to an extent with part of the review that someone wrote...'Lestat, well, he's Anne Rice, not himself. He fully ceases to be his own character and instead becomes his author's mouthpiece.'The opening chapter in particular echoed of things I have seen said in more recent interviews that were taken by Anne herself.While I agree that the events of a persons life have some affect on how they see the world, in the past books Lestat has always remained Lestat, brat prince, in one way or another.Anne has said that her Husband was the inspiration for the brat prince himself. And with the loss of her husband we also have the ironic loss of Lestat.As far as books go, this is not a bad book. It still a interesting read. Just do not expect the lavishness and deep chapters of her previous books. Blackwood farm for me was such an amazing treat. It offered a new era, a new dawn. It was sad to go from that to this book, to see Mona reduced and Quinn playing 'tag along'.Even more so for me because in 'Blackwood farm' I found Quinn to be her greatest character since Lestat himself.Anne once was quoted as saying something along the lines of, (about the film Queen of the damned)' Names are all that this production has in common with any of my books or characters. 'This seems to be the case of this book too. A book that only has the names of characters as being the only thing in common with her other work.I hope that at a stronger point of her life, Anne will go back and realise that her chronicals deserve a greater ending this - while some may argue she owes it to her fans, I would rather argue that she owes it to herself. She can do better and does not deserve to be remembered with disapointment for this book."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Many of the recent reviews posted about \\"Blood Canticle\\" have not been about the book itself, but about the author. Furthermore, many of these same reviews have been nothing short of mean-spirited, ill conceived and downright ridiculous.You didn't like the book? That's fine. Many people didn't. Even I must confess that it was, at times, hard to follow, and that it was so very different in style from her other vampire chronicles that I often wondered if it wasn't part of a different series altogether.However, like anyone of intelligence does, Ms. Rice has changed. Her views of the world have changed. Her beliefs have changed. Her ideas have changed. This is an inevitable consequence, if one could call it that, of learning and living. And, learn she does. She obviously spends an enormous amount of time studying history, religion, and who knows what else? How else could she construct stories and characters with such rich and varying detail?It is inevitable, as time goes by, that a writer's style, ideas and views will change. And, when a writer's career spans decades, the degree of that change becomes more evident with each new work. If one were to pick up \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" for the first time, then read each subsequent volume of the chronicles, he would see decades of change in a very short time, which might lead him to believe that the writer has either given up care for her work by the end of the series, or that the writer suffers from split personalities.I believe neither is true. Times are much different now than they were when she started writing. She, therefore, is much different than she was when she started writing. If anything, I'd be worried about her if she hadn't changed in all this time. I would wonder if she had gotten so wrapped up in her writing that she forgot to live. It is living that has brought about such changes in her, as it does to us all...as it has and continues to do to her characters and stories.If you don't like the direction in which she took her story, or you're disappointed in the way she told it, then tell your own story. Read other stories. But, ultimately, you've no decency in judging and ridiculing her the way you've done.She is a human being who has suffered great loss, and now is certainly not the time for people to turn on her. If you are so vicious and vile that you would abandon someone for whom you've had any semblance of affection in the past during a time when she may need you the most, then your opinions are, indeed, meaningless, and you shouldn't expect her to take them to heart. She didn't turn her back on her readers. Many of her readers turned their backs on her.I can't blame her a bit for writing the things she did here to those of you who attacked her like rabid jackals. Everyone gets to a point in his or her life when worrying about what others will think if you're honest just doesn't factor into your existence anymore. She, as a writer, has tried very hard to please the broadest audience possible. But, as a businessperson, she has been restricted in what she could and could not say to her public. If she's had negative things to say to her attackers, she's had to bite her tongue and refuse to defend herself.Now, she's undoubtedly at a point in her life where she doesn't need peoples' money anymore. She doesn't need huge book sales to help her achieve the life she wants. If she continues to write, she does so simply because she enjoys writing, and she wants to continue to share her stories with the world. But, she doesn't need to turn the other cheek to her critics any longer. She cannot be destroyed by poor opinions of her character.So, she lashed out at those who've been so unimaginably nasty to her. That's her right. So, she praises herself and her works as being unique, pioneering, even perfect. Well, someone needs to say such things, because she still needs to feel she's working for something, if nothing more than acceptance. If no one else is willing to give her what she deserves, then I see nothing wrong with her giving it to herself.She's earned it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Well what can I say, I truly don't even know where to start.Where Anne is the Brat Prince of old, where is our Lestat, what have you done to Lestat?

My husband and sister, as well as a lot of friends, are avid Rice fans, though. I wasn't planning on reading this book, or any other Anne Rice book, for that matter, but all the hoopla has changed my mind. If this book is truly that different from her others, then I may actually enjoy it.I do want to say one thing, though. I can't believe the way some of Ms. Rice's fans have turned on her so viciously because of one book. I really have a problem with the personal attacks. If you don't like the book and are disappointed in it, then by all means, say so, but to launch a vicious personal attack on Ms. Rice is immature and shows the limited mental capacity of those who would do so.I plan to read this book and then come back and post my own personal review in the future. In the meantime, it would be nice if the naysayers could put away the mob mentality and the torches and give solid, informative reviews instead of spittle-drenched virulent invectives."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Well it looks like the reviews are going to be mixed. I love the new style and voice. It was risky from Anne's perspective to try something new. Everyone: this is a new and important perspective into Lestat's character. Come on! This is his first narrative since &quot;Memnoch the Devil&quot; and the voice had to change to reflect his evolution.This book was well written despite what others say. The style actually reminds me a lot of Holden from &quot;Catcher in the Rye.&quot; 5 stars, thank you very much."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am not a hardcore Ann Rive fan. I read her books as I can, sometimes out of order, but always with interest. Each book has a different 'taste' to it even while they maintain the core of all that is this fictional universe. The characters change over time, as we all do. For those looking for a great read and something a little different in pace and mood that some of the previous iterations of this series, I encourage you to check it out.As for the articles. I always have to laugh at how cowardly an individuals most polarizing critiques are. Some of the anaonymous negative post are so clearly the same poster that is is comical. Not only is the writing the same, but they even use some of the same analogies and I believe I even stumbled across complete sentances. Either someone is a very poor plagarist, or they have ADHD and can not remember they posted the exact same drivvle a few days or weeks earlier.I treasure sites like Amazon and epinion, because they often times give you a real world perspective on products. The ability to post fairly unmoderated opinions allows shoppers to bypass the advertising machines and get to the real crux of a products worth. Part of that though is being a savy consumers and I dont think Anne Rice has much to worry about in regards to the most obvious and idiot of negative of responses listed here effecting her bottom line. Or swaying popular opinion of her entire writing legacy. Unfortunately, and wonderfully, the internet allows and accepts the lowest common denominator of society, so you can never really avoid sadistic responses if you are someone positioned in a genre that creates the type of emotional response as Anne's writing does.It would be nice if Amazon allowed only those using a registered account to 'rate' an item however.I rate it 4 stars. Not her best work, but the worst of Anne Rice's is better than 90% of whatever else is out there."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Like all of Anne Rice's vampire novels I found this one to be entertaining. If you are looking for better, read Mick Farren's Rehnquist trilogy. Lestat is mediocre next to Victor Rehnquist."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Er, don't mind that title... It's a poem I wrote. Heh. Loved this book, it was great. I don't see why everyone else hates it but hey, Freedom of Speech, 1st Amendment... So yeah. I love the style of writing in the novel, it was fascinating how Ms. Rice combined the usual intellect of her novels with a more laid back casual style of writing. Very good. Eh, I don't feel like writing a long review today... :P I'm being stupid again. So yeah... I'm bored. I'm writing reviews out of boredom now. *Smiles sardonically* The world is strange in its fates... Great novel, loved it, peace to all! I'm outtie."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"O to be a true artist... what that entails. It's touching the subject, sticking your hands, no your Soul, into the grime of it all to come out w/ the masterpiece from the pain, the pleasure, the grit, the glory and everything in between and beyond those borders.Anne Rice has made a believer out of all of you... even those of you with negative reviews. Only a TRUE Artist could elicit such responses both from a place of hate & contempt or from a place of true love. Both of those emotions come from one place, the same place... intensity. And it is with intensity that each artist who truly has mastered their media, portrays their views, derived from the life experiences, the grime if you will. And Anne Rice has captured, to this point of my reading of these reviews (approx 217 views thus far), a vast array of emotion from each one of you whom felt she was worth your time to express your feelings about her work.Lashing or full of praise these are words from people who needed to express how an Artist made them feel. When an artist has achieved such devotion in this century, where a person will spend their precious personal time in writing about them... well... that's what they were put on this earth to do, and they've served their talents & passions well. Artists drive the world, they partly shape it but mostly narrate it. They use prose, color, lines, form, light, sound, motion, emotion to tell their stories, and each of you who read this, who write this... you're a part of the Art that Anne Rice has fed us all. Like it or not... you're a part of the chronicles. You're a part of Anne Rice's world.And that's exactly why she is who she is, and why you feel what you feel... because SHE Made you! She has a gift. Whether you appreciate it or not, you've been touched by that gift. And she has done her job. She has done her job well.And for that, and for the almost 2 decades of my devotion to her art, whether I always appreciated it or not, I glorify her...As for the book in question... I thought that it was devilishly clever, as was Blackwood manor and Merrick in bringing the two stories of the two great Ricean \`families' together... this wasn't an abrupt unexpected affront to those who just had a vampire fetish and didn't necessarily want to explore her entire portfolio (which I must say you are missing out. Cry to Heaven, her Erotica series, the Mayfair saga, Violin, Servant of the Bones, etc... all amazing stories quilted together with the same lush and acute understanding of poeticism in her writing), or to those who for some reason only explored the blood chronicles. (and don't get me wrong, I've been a vampire fanatic since before I could articulate such a thing).This book has been in the making for some time, and for you who say it was unexpected... well GOOD! I would hate to pick up a book and EXPECT something of it, and be gratified that my expectations were well founded. How sad a world would that be if I could predict ever book I picked up. Why would I even read? I expect an author to take me on a rollercoaster ride I wasn't ready for so I can feel the butterflies. Why else would anyone ride a rollercoaster if not for those butterflies?Was this my favorite of the tales on either side... no. Am I sad that Anne has said good riddance to the two... desperately. Because this book was so open, as open as eternal characters stories should be.. open to so many more possibilities. Never once have I ever read one of her books thinking it was the end. And I hang hopefully by an exquisite silk thread hoping that this book isn't the conclusion... if it were? I'd be just as content as if there were 10 more, because I can always explore her world in my head and imagine where Louis, Armand, Marius, The twins, Pandora, etc.. are, what they are doing. Because Anne Rice, built a world so vital that it is always inside of those who truly believe.Even if you don't feel like appreciating that."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Lestat, Lestat - your saint ramblings break my heart.

And who are these tacky bitter people who so rudely post such mean spirited reviews of Blood Canticle? Are they qualified? Is there a great writer among them? I don't see a Stephen King or a Salman Rushdie or a Naguib Mahfouz listed here. For these three are among her true peers; including maybe a few others alive today who can weave interconnected tales spanning both real and fictional time.My name is Marc St. Camille. Who am I? Why does my review matter? I'll tell you. Best grab a glass of wine first as this may take a moment. To set the mood I have J. S. Bach Lutheran masses playing in the background, about 100 candles providing ample light and my faithful dog Tessera resting her head on a First Edition Interview With A Vampire. On my mother's side I come from an ancient royal bloodline that ruled Persia until the middle 1900's. There were always rumors linking our earliest roots to a family that predates known history in ancient Egypt. Never mind Maharet. My father's side of the family has Zoroastrian, Sufi and Jewish mystics and wizards going all the way back to the beginning of Persia's history. These are people who loved, respected and passed down interwoven tales of their own history combined with popular mythology from generation to generation. (Read the Shahnama of Ferdowsi). So please believe me when I say that I recognize a good tale when I see one. Not to mention one that spans over 20 books. Pray tell me how many people on this planet have had the ability, talent, patience, perseverance, memory, imagination and gift of having such a long running series published. Especially when combining accurate history; ancient philosophies; detailed minutiae relating to places new and ancient round the globe; memorable characters; visuals so vivid they will be imbedded in my soul forever?Do these vile critics think producing a book an easy thing? A fun thing? Something to do between Buffy episodes? I have no respect for people so flip with their words.

I loved Blood Canticle and was very sad to hear that the Chronicles are done with, but she has moved on and so will all the fans. I cannot wait to read her next book.

Even if you don't like something you should still have respect for it. A talented writer such as Anne who has been giving us wonderful books since I was in diapers deserves a little respect...don't you think? And when she actually stands up for herself everyone just freaks out. Amazing, it's like you think that only you have the right to speak your mind. If someone was trash talking something I had written or created I would be irritated too and want to explain myself. I just think she deserves respect. I CANNOT stress that enough. Even if I had hated the book I wouldn't spend my time trash talking it on here. I would use that energy and go write a good review on a book I did like. Or even just saying, hey I didn't like it...but to sit there and literally rip this womans amazing writing to shreds? Well you people have way too much time on your hands. I hope you find better things to do with your time than make other people feel crummy.Brittany"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have read all of Anne Rice's vampire and witch chronicles, I found the book \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" 11 years ago in the hallway when I was still in high school and have been hooked ever since! My favorite of the chronicles was \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" I know that some readers didn't enjoy the somewhat deeper theological subject matter. However I thought it was one of her best works, because of it's intricate detail and interesting religious perspective. I liked that Lestat becomes somewhat enlightened and confused at the same time, which when dealing with religious enlightenment is,I believe the way many people feel.\\"Blood Canticle\\", in my opinion was another great read. I thought the characters were all wonderfully written and the story of the mingling vampire and witch families still very intriguing. Again Anne Rice pulled me in and filled my imagination with vivid haunting imagery of the mysterious blackwood farm and the eccentric Lestat\`s dark internal human struggles clashing with his simplistic animal nature. I hope to continue to be thrilled and intrigued by her future works, wherever they may take us."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I agree, Blood Canticle was one of her lesser novels -- BUT how would you feel if someone criticised so harshly your life's work?As a fellow writer, I can only sympathize. If you didn't like the novel, then say so, but let's not be unkind. And if you did like the novel, well good for you!My take on Blood Canticle was it was a wrap up. It felt from the moment I opened its pages like a conclusion. I hadn't learned yet that there would be no more vampire novels, but I knew when I began to read that this book would be Lestat's last adventure.Anne Rice set out to make the world love Lestat, and she suceeded. If you didn't love him in Blood Cantilce, you loved him at some point. Come on, admit it!I've loved Lestat for years and will probably continue to every time I pop in my Interview with a Vampire DVD.But in short, take my man's advice and borrow the book from the library first. You may or may not enjoy the ending of the Vampire Chronicles."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"&quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; was the masterpiece. If you want to compare this book with other Rice books, it's probably not the best. That said, I've tried to read other authors while I was eagerly awaiting the next Rice book, and I've yet to find one that satisfies. Rice includes just enough background info to support new readers as well as those who may have forgotten details from the previous novels. Her descriptions are rich, which is part of the escape that she provides. Lestat was modeled after Rice's husband, and with his recent passing Rice has said that this will be the last novel written in Lestat's voice. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Many people have different opinions on this book. Some completely hate it, while others completely love it. They continue to rant on and on, for whichever side they're on.The truth of the matter is that this book still has the excellent writing that Anne has always had. It's written wonderfully, and the 'plot', if you'd like to call it, is just as good as any others in the Vampire Chronicles. It's a wonderful book not only for her excellent writing, but because it combines The Mayfair Witches with the Vampire Chronicles, as in Blackwood Farm. Devote fans of Anne should be pleased that the two series have been combined, in a way. Any avid reader of the Vampire Chronicles -should- be pleased with this book, as it finalizes many things that have been in past books.(...)"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Now before all you twi-hards attack me for my title let me explain.I truly loved this book. I have read all the chronicles (particularly loved Pandora, the construction of the setting and ambiance of that book was really mesmerizing, as was the female protagonist). However I digress. Blood Canticle offers for Rice fans the ability to see in motion the culmination of years of hard work in defining a genre, in constructing timeless characters, and challenging readers to understand those characters in different ways. This book is heavy on the last point. I enjoyed seeing Lestat change and develop from being so consumed by vanity, to questioning himself, and then to fall again, and again. His struggle between these two points was always entertaining to watch, even more so when we relate it to the changing motions of the vampire world Anne Rice created. What each book gives us is the changes in decades, which some of the reviewers have commented on. To construct all this, and then to bring into it characters from other supernatural worlds which Rice has created, and have it even be as remotely as good as this, as thralling as this, is an achievement unto itself. Now to my point. Read this book and the series it belongs to, understand what it did for the vampire in literature; for those purists you must admit that Rice had an impact in resurrecting (o yes the puns!) this ancient creature so many of us have been in love with. She created the vampire with a soul, the vampire with no remorse, the source of all Vampires and the changing faces of these characters reflect even more than what Im saying here. Blood Canticle will shock you if you start from the beginning to end without really considering the characters in transition; but for someone who looks for that transition in Rice's books I was more than satisfied.Ultimately my point is where is this ancient creature now? The reviews here talk about editing, the technicalities of Rice's writing and prose. You ask such high standards when books such as the Twilight series, which have done nothing for the vampire genre other than popularize it to a rather literature-deprived generation, are being held up on a pedestal saying this is art! I wont get into how technically messy Twilight is, Im sure there are plenty of websites to educate you on this, but my point in comparison is this: what did the most for the character of the vampire? This book is not perfection. You want to blast Anne Rice, do so, even though your voice will be little in comparison to her presence in time as far as the creature of the vampire is concerned. But I for one will not let this book, not the best, but a much better understanding of true character development and mythology, be held down, while true failings are exalted on no real merit at all. It disappoints me as a reader that so many people who have dedicated their time and effort to this series, just don't get it yet! These characters embody so many changes, the very transition of which is the point of Rice's books! And yes you still expected Lestat to play the same tune, and dance the same dance. I wouldn't have had it end any other way than it did.And if you are a twilight fan, Im sorry I didnt jump on the same boat as you did, but honestly pick up another book to read. Please? this one's a good one to end on (you probably know where to start if you only vaguely know Anne Rice and were around for the 90's).Anyways thats my two cents :) let the feathers fly!Seema"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This, was Rice's second-best book. Once again, Rice continues to expand her characters, and shows yet another dimension to them. And, just as people evolve with time, Lestat evolves as well, without truly changing who he is.If you haven't read this book, you should read it. If you have read it, and you didn't like it, you didn't understand it. Mature a little bit, and then read it again."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"If you love the witches and love the vampires - this book is for you.

Anne Rice still has the ability to sweep me away with her stories, leaving me almost convinced that these words were written with Lestat's hand. I can hear his voice, I can see his eyes, I can feel his teeth on my neck. As I flip through the pages of Blood Canticle, Lestat comes alive for me, sadly enough, for the last time. And I am even more in love with him now than I ever have been. His character flaws endear me to him, and make him what he is, the Brat Prince among vampires. I love his vanity, and I sympathize with his desire to be as human as the next person without having to give up his supernatural powers. We all want to be normal, yet we refuse to give up that piece of ourselves that sets us apart. And who doesn't want to be an actor, a rock star, a saint?? To be adored and fawned over by all?? He is as bloodthirsty and merciless as ever, yet compassionate and loving at the same time. His love for Rowan Mayfair is heartbreaking, and his love for Blackwood Farm is sweet. The Vampire Chronicles and The Lives of the Mayfair Witches, undoubtedly the best of Anne's work, come together beautifully within these pages as we bid our nocturnal and haunted friends a melancholy farewell. It is sad indeed that the Chronicles have come to an end, but at least I have all the stories on my bookshelf, so that Lestat and David and Louis may keep me company on a rainy day. Brava, Anne.

I would have liked the chronicles to go on for thirty more years, but that's probably impossible, and Anne Rice ended it the way she saw fit, and the way that it was supposed to have been ended. If it wasn't supposed to have been written the way that it was, perhaps she wouldn't have started the series. Her imagination, the words she uses, the way she describes things literally send chills up my spine. Never before have I become so dedicated to a writer, and I don't think ever again will I find somebody that can put images into my head, and truly make me see the stories, clearer than any other writer (but her son is a very close second). The book is excellent, and is definately worth the cost. If you haven't read any of the Vampire Chronicles, don't start with this one, because the beginning is the best place to start, but the ending is where all the magic comes to an end, and Anne Rice does it so beautifully."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Let me start of by saying this...I have been in love with Anne Rice since my early teens. It all began with Interview with the Vampire. By the second chapter, I was in love. Her words took me to a different universe all to itself. After the first Chronicle book, I couldn't stop. I quickly went through all of the available Chronicle books at the time until I had to wait for The Vampire Armand to be released. While awaiting my beloved Armand, I read her other books...Feast of All Saints and Servant of the Bones to be among my favorites. To end with this brief history of my love affair with Anne Rice is this: Her words bring forth a life all to its own. They are refreshing as they are erotic. She is simply a Goddess.Now on to my review of Blood Canticle...This book was a rather interesting tale. Anne Rice has certainly evolved to another level of writing. I certainly praise it. At the same time, I was intrigued by the fact that Our Beloved Brat Prince has decided he wants to become a saint. How could this be? Of course if you have read Anne Rice's own comments of Lestat you would see the reason why. Lestat's own self is really a base part of us all. He has played this &quot;evil&quot; guy for so long and he wants to be delivered from it. Lestat is inherently good though his actions can and may be deemed (sp) bad. Before you judge the book as a whole, look within yourself and you would realize that Mrs. Rice is shining the light within ourselves. -Thank you."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"There are some extremely harsh reviews here, and I think they are very insulting to Anne Rice. She is right in her response: if you don't like her writing, don't read it. She doesn't owe any of us anything, especially not closure. The Vampire Chronicles, like the rest of her work, belong to her. They are her intellectual property to do with as she sees fit: she can take the story in any direction she wishes, and she can stop writing them all together. Lestat is hers, not ours. I really don't understand the nastiness and anger in so many of these reviews.This is an interesting book. It's a kind of part 2 to Blackwood Farm, which is wonderful, and it continues the blending of the Mayfair Witches and Vampire Chronicles, which is intriguing, illuminating, and fun. I loved it, and I'll surely reread it over the years. I say that if you are buying Blackwood Farm, absolutely buy Blood Canticle with it, no question.We all need to respect authors and their work. We're lucky to have been able to read Anne Rice's stories. I'll consider myself lucky to read more of her stories if she chooses to publish more, and I hope she knows that she is deeply respected and valued by many, many readers."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am a bit mad at the fact that this is the last chronicle but I really cant believe that, even if she says it is so; she left it all too unfinished.I lived through menoch the devil and I can live through this. . . i hope. Sorry if i have made any of you mad but honestly i dont care!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I waited months for this book to come out and after all the yelling I gave to my local Wal-mart for lieing ot me about carrying \\"Blackwood Farm\\" day of relese they made sure they carried this one I even went as far as to email Anne about it either way tho I got this book I loved it sure there are a few things that I was wondering about like why the taltos have this thing about the color white and so on and so forth but I came to one conculsion about it its something for us readers to think about coming into the seris late I came in when Armand and Pandora and Vittoro where released and I love them all theres nothing worng with this book im my mind other than the fact that it was/is the last one of them but over all I am pleased with the way that Anne took the series I am not sure if her new ventures will be of any interest to me but I am willing to give it a try I will be a life long fan off Anne Rice thanks for the good work Anne you will never know how your books helped me when I was in High school"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've read the Vampire Chronicles, and now I'm working on the Mayfair series. I would like to say first off, that, those that complain about the lack of a storyline in this book have to look to the other books. The books are based off of the lives of the characters. Therefore, the story line is simply the lives of the characters in it's basic form. While there is more to it I wont go into extreme detail. I do love the Chronicles. I've reread them countless times while I waited to get the next book in the series. I'm not a fan of the movies though. My thoughts on QoTD was while it was a good movie, it wasn't that good as a part of the Chronicles. Getting back to my reason for being here tonight. The storyline of the books continues throughout the series to me. Each next book is a sequel not a new independant book. Some people seem to lose that. While there needs to be new conflicts, the majority of the story is from the last book. I like all the characters. I did wonder what happened to all the characters in the books past. Louis and David main point. I wont go into that now, maybe ever. Anne Rice has created for us a world that is ours to retreat to. Ours to imagine. Anne has been writing for quite a few years. If I remember right the Chronicles were the first or second books that were published. Perhapes she got tired of the characters, and with the passing of her husband she decided to end it. I do not know, and I claim not to know her thoughts on this. I am rather disapointed however, with not Anne, but rather, those that talk bad about her and her writing. She doesn't deserve it. Maybe a little more thoughtfullness on our parts would go far. Anne is a great writer. She's brought us a wonderful series. If you read all the books directly after the other it would be obvious to all that BC was a direct sequel to Blackwood Farm as opposed to the Chronicles themselves. In my opinion anyways. A final thought from me before I leave you to your lives. People should think for themselves, and not rely upon others views to dictate their own. Which is what I think happened. One person said they didn't like it, perhapes without reading it. The person they talked to then told another, so on and so on. I read the Chronicles within a year. And then again I read them. (Yes I do have tons of time on my hands.) Anne's style matured completly as she wrote the Chronicles and her other books. People change as well, and Lestat can and does change alot during these books. Lestat is far too trusting because of his dreams, but without that where would all the fun be had? Again, Anne my praise on a job well done. For this and your future novels I'm sure."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I can't believe that people said that Anne Rice's latest Blood Canticle was \\"rubbish\\"Now, I have read all of the vampire chronicles, the new tales of the vampires, and the Mayfair witches, and I have to say that this is one of her greatest works. Her achievement is continuously mounting! I am so proud of her, the strong woman she is. She continues to take me into a different world, one which I wish existed. Rice is so vivid and historically correct in all of her books; I learn more from them than I did while I was in high school and college combined! I am just glad she writes, I am glad she has devoted most of her life to making sure we have entertainment, and anyone who can do that is worthy of everyone's praises!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"\\"Go mourn your dead husband and shut up\\"??? \\"You should have quit writing while you were ahead\\"???What has Anne Rice done to anyone here that would deserve such hateful and venomous scorn? By your own words, several of you have enjoyed the adventures of Lestat for almost two decades. You're disappointed in her final installment and now you want to eviscerate her?I will admit that the writing style suprised me as I began the first chapters of the book. I will also admit that this was not my favorite Vampire Chronicle. But I do not want to lead villagers bearing pitchforks and torches up to her gate so that she can be burned at the stake. The style was different. Not a hanging offense. As I read, I began to enjoy looking for what new human slang Lestat had picked up.I also did not feel that Lestat's desire to be essentially canonized was \\"sudden\\". He's been to Hell. Literally. He has conversed and consorted with THE Satan and seen Heaven. I'd imagine that might precipitate a smidgen of change in an earthbound, once-human creature.I assume that everyone who reviewed the book with such personally-directed vehemence must be perfect beings. Everything they do is enjoyed and liked by everyone. I wouldn't wish the unforgiving, rabid and vicious attacks that many here have heaped upon her on anyone!Much less an author who has given me many hours of pleasurable reading."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've heard a lot of people say that they hate this book, and frankly, I think they are crazy. Blood Canticle, according to me, is the best book in the Vampire Chronicles. I don't think many words can describe this book. It's just...fantastic. I would recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I just finished reading this book and I'm not entirely sure what to make of it. I was definitely disappointed by its quality, but I would say that my Anne Rice fandom has been falling off for quite some time. However, I don't feel that that invalidates my opinion but rather emphasizes it - I don't feel that this was so much a failure as a Vampire Chronicle as a failure as a novel.As is previously mentioned, Lestat's language was a bit jarring. But I also agree that Lestat as a character is designed to be able to adapt to the times and new surroundings, and it seemed to me that he might have picked up a bit of vernacular in the span of his lifetime. That said, Anne Rice was definitely a few steps behind the &quot;times.&quot; I almost clawed my eyes out at the use of &quot;yo&quot; and &quot;dude.&quot; I absolutely abhor it when writers attempt to integrate language of that sort into writing and fail miserably. And I must confess, I have never thought that Anne was particuarly good at that anyway - the language she writes for Jasmine and the other black characters always seems forced and unrealistic, especially in this book. Very poor.Point blank Mona annoyed me. I was willing to tolerate Lestat working the Dark Trick on her, with faith that it would work out in the end, but it most definitely did not. I've never been all that fond of Mona in the first place, but at times I found her likeable. That is, I did in her own storylines - her speech in Blackwood Farm was absolutely intolerable. I couldn't tell whether or not Anne was having trouble thinking up synonyms for &quot;egregious&quot; or if Mona was just one of those annoying sorts of people that uses the same word over again - and when I settled on the latter, she grated even more. But I digress, the point is essentially that Mona and her incessant outbursts, whining, crying, and Lestat-Worship were just bloody irritating. I hate submissiveness, and that's precisely what she was, submissive. To have her grovel to Lestat to forgive her, and him to be so petty as he was!Patsy's Ghost - No place at all whatsoever in this book. Oncle Julien's haunting as well was a bore. It might have been interesting if developed properly, but he seemed there only to bugger Lestat, and in doing so, he annoyed me as well. And his begging, pleading, and fright at the end of the book was unacceptable.The characters were completely and utterly undeveloped. Quinn especially, and how disappointing. He could have worked very well as an essential character, but he just sort of shadowed Lestat, and Mona even. In fact, certainly as fledglings we should have examined them and their interaction more carefully instead of transitioning to the Taltos which shouldn't have even been included in this story. And fine and good for Lestat to love Rowan but that bit in the last chapter? Rubbish.The hunting was horrible contrived, nothing so romantic as Lestat and Louis' cunning, unnoticed killings at parties and the like. A bore, I wanted to be done with it all.And let me not forget to mention Juan Diego. It might have been an interesting insight into Lestat's psyche if it had a point. But it didn't. It just was there, filling up space, sloppily glued together with the rest of the flimsy &quot;plot.&quot;Overall I would say that it was temporarily entertaining at times, and that definitely wasn't because of the poorly executed plot. This was just a filler, I think, as I wait for better fare, being shipped to me as I write."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Blood Canticle lacks narrative cohesion. It feels like a jumbled dream sequence, out of focus and elastic. Rice's descriptions are lovely but even the best prose is lost amid a untidy heap of out of tune dialogue filled with equal parts slang and pompous diatribe. I must agree with whoever said that Lestat left her after Queen of the Damned. I'm afraid the witches have left the building as well. The Mayfairs do and say things SO out of character that it isn't just unbelievable, it's sad. Quinn doesn't get any good dialogue and comes off duller than a stump post. Lestat is out of his mind with wanting to be \`good' and falling in love with everyone, including the ghost of Julien Mayfair. It's all rather silly. Rice introduces two really nifty new taltos characters but we only get to spend a few pages with them before the book closes, lamely. While what story was there was interesting, it really could have been told in half the pages and without all of Lestat's sermons on sainthood. Sorry Anne, better luck next time."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne Rice's strength as an author has always lay in her ability to create characters who reside within the imaginations of her readers. It is easy for us to imagine, for example, the way that her characters have long teeth, the way they drink blood, the way they live and breathe and emote and sing and dance and fly and do everything else that the people in the world around us do. For that, she is to be commended.Starting with her \\"Harry Potter\\" series, Rice began to push the conventions of the novel form, and her most recent work appears to be the culmination of that exploration. This fact is most apparent in her use of lines such as:\\"Hello! Lestat Discovers The Opposite Sex!\\"\\"Look at those naked arms.\\"and\\"Patsy all dressed in pink cowboy clothes . . .\\"Based on the strength of such lines, it's a real disappointment when we come to the conclusion of the book only to find Rice's limitations displaying themselves in such spectacular fashion. Nothing in her previous writing could have prepared us for the fact that Lestat would whirl through a variety of physical manifestations ranging from bartender to top gun pilot to secret agent to a saucy young upstart trial lawyer. Anne! Anne!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I was very diappointed with this book. It was an easy read but the meanings of the stories felt to me, that Anne rice didn't want to write this. It felt like she rushed it just to meet her deadline. Let me first start by saying that we never knew at the end of &quot;Taltos&quot; what happened to Ash and Morrigan. That book ended good and the I did not feel that we had to go through that again and really find out what happened to them. Lestat was marvelous as always but I didn't think that the witches and vampires should have been brought together in such a way. They should have been kept separate. I would tell any Anne Rice fan to read this book but I can only hope that her next will be better."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Like most writing reviews, I've read and enjoyed them all. I'm a particular fan of well researched historical novels so I completely devoured &quot;The Witching Hour&quot;. The Vampire novels are great escapist fantasy for me and I value them for that. After reading &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; I couldn't help but feel that at some point, maybe about halfway through, Ms Rice had just &quot;had enough&quot; and decided to complete the book in summary fashion. Major chunks of time seemed to be covered in a paragraph or two. I felt like the last half of the book should have been at least twice as long. &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; was disappointing for me because I felt that way through the entire book. Oh, the story line was OK - not particularly gripping or anything. It's been a while since I read the Mayfair books but I don't remember disliking Rowan as much as I did in this book. Quin seemed pretty irrelevant - I'm not quite sure why he was introduced in the first place. If this was it for both the Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches, I don't think the introduction of Quin did much to pull them together. I would much rather have had some closure on already introduced characters. When you consider the cast of Vampires, Mayfairs, Talamasca, etc., it would seem there was more than enough to work with to tie it all together without the Quin/Mona relationship - which, really, got pretty nauseating. If there is more to come I really hope the Rowan/Lestat relationship isn't presented like Quin/Mona - though the last scene where Rowan comes to Lestat seemed to indicate that it might. Through both books I really had a hard time with that presentation - very &quot;stick your finger down your throat&quot;, overly melodramatic yuck. The whole Carribean drug smuggler line seemed pretty uninspired. The final explanation as to what Taltos really were seemed empty and contradictory as well. They couldn't really survive yet they had for thousands of years - peaceful simpletons yet some are treacherous murderous, some are brilliant and some are idiots. Mainly, though, I just felt all the way through that the book was in a &quot;rush to get it over with&quot; - like the second half of Blackwood Farm. I really missed the depth of plot.Still, I read it in an evening as I knew I would and enjoyed it for what it was - I just wish there had been much more. I certainly couldn't do any better and, if this was really it, a heartfelt thank you to Ms Rice for providing me with tremendous enjoyment over the years. I'm sorry to see such epic fantasy end, particulary sort of limping out like this. I expect it will be a long time before anything comparable comes along again."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"What a depressing end to an amazing series. Of course it hasn't been good since after Memnoch the Devil, but in this book, Lestat is not himself, none of our other favorite characters dare touch it with a 20 foot pole, and what little plot there is is incomprehensible. More of a vehicle for the author to voice her thoughts on issues and religion than a novel. This \\"Lestat\\" is nothing like the Brat Prince we know and love. Tempers run high and there's more drama than a high school gym without any reason for it. And plot? What plot? Not to mention it contradicts lots of previously established things. For example, Lestat \\"I can hack into police computers in ToTBT\\" de Lioncourt doesn't know what e-mail is? You're kidding right.Waste of money, waste of time. Very depressing."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Many others hated this book, but I personally did not find it that bad. It's not the worst book in the series, but it definitely isn't Rice's best. My major problem with the novel is that it doesn't resolve the Vampire Chronicles to me, focusing more on the Mayfair saga. There is no true resolution given between Lestat and the other vampire characters, which I think should have been done in order for this to have been a proper finale to the series."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I still enjoyed this book almost as much as any other Anne Rice book I've read. I understood the fusion of the Witch stories with the story of Lestat and Blackwood Farm. I didn't necesarily want to mix my vampires and witches, but I came away understanding a lot more about the witches, which was important to me. I waited a long time for a Witch book, and although I wasn't completely satisfied with how Ms. Rice delivered one, I still enjoyed the book a great deal. Regardless of whether or not I thought Blood Canticle was my \\"favorite\\" book, I know I will still eagerly await the next book that she grants us. I've read all of her books, and I know Anne Rice is a guaranteed good read, and will remain a faithful fan until she lays down her pen for good. I've read some of these reviews, and it sounds more like some people simply cannot let go of the Chronicles and now want to spew spite and hatred at Anne because they don't like her decisions. I know I'll miss the Chronicles, but I respect her decision to not continue the saga. Long Live Lestat...and God Bless Anne Rice."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Of course I will always love Interview with The Vampire, The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the damned. But many Anne Rice fans agree they go down hill from there. There are certain circles that refer to my previously mentioned first three vampire chronicles as the ONLY vampire Chronicles. All the rest come off like fan fictions from some other person.Nothing done now can change what had been. The Interview with the vampire is still the interview with the vampire. The Vampire Lestat is still The Vampire Lestat, The Queen of the damned is still The Queen of the damned. I just pretend it's 1989 and the others were not published yet. They did not happen.Lestat, in my mind, is still a rebel, still a brat, still mischievous, still questions things, still fearless, still angst driven, still a fighter, and still perseverent. He's still riding around on his Harley, hunting down his killers and falling in love with the world. He's still an optimist (He has a pessimistic view of humanity in Blood Canticle.) He still views society today as an age of innocence and he's still my Lestat. All the rest... to me.. They're just fan fictions.I wish Anne Rice had done a book that she once hinted about years ago. The idea of the vampires being found out by some mortals and possibly captured and studies and then the escape... Lestat talks about this idea in The Vampire Lestat. That could have been a great novel, especially with our proud and defiant Lestat. This conformist, prude, depthless, two-dimensional Lestat would fold under that pressure but the Lestat I know would not. The first three vampire chronicles- that's my Lestat. That will always be my Lestat and no one can take that away from me.I miss Lestat. Lestat in Blood Canticle is whining. And he's become a conformist. He's now a hard-core Catholic who questions nothing, a cold hypocrite, a misogynist, a prude, and pessimist. This is not our Lestat! Our Lestat was a brat. Our Lestat questioned things. Our Lestat was always a rebel. Changing his personality this abruptly is like saying he now has blue hair and orange eyes. The angst is gone. The fearless soul that could never be oppressed is gone. I did not love the fangs or the blonde hair. I loved his personality. I related to Lestat, not the vampire! She's forgotten who Lestat was. Lestat used to see this world as an age of secular innocence where evil doers were scarce. And now he says there are many in the cities who deserve the vampire's kiss. He's become depthless (if he had much depth to begin with.) He's two dimensional. He's hunting down rogues and rule breaker vampires! He is a rogue and rule breaker! I want Lestat, I don't want Angel from Buffy The Vampire Slayer!I want Lestat the way he was meant to be. If Anne Rice needed a new character to express her obsession and new-found conformist mentality she should have used ANYONE but The Brat Prince to express it! I think this book disappointed every Anne Rice fan, everywhere, one way or another.What happened to our man of action? Where's The James Bond of the Vampires? My God! In these later novels the character himself can't even get his own name right. He keeps saying he was twenty, he was twenty-one as a mortal when he killed the wolves so how could he appear twenty now?I know I'm being harsh but Anne calls this maturing for Lestat. Being mature does not mean clinging desperately to something without question. Being mature does not mean becoming sexist with fashion, and seeing evil everywhere where he once was in love with the goodness in society. Lestat was a brat but he had faith in goodness. Now he doesn't seem to have that faith. His real and pure faith has been replaced by something superficial, something dark. And the restless spirit, the angst driven rebel, the one who could not be dominated... Our beloved antagonist, he's gone.... I don't know who this creature is who is narrating the story but it's not our Lestat.I'll always love the first three vampire chronicles, Interview with The Vampire, The Vampire Lestat and The queen of the damned. By my advice to anyone just starting, don't go any further than that. Tale of the body thief is good for comic relief if you have a dark sense of humour but that's about it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have read almost every one of Anne Rice's novels, and I have to say this is the worst one. Usually the language is poetic, yet forceful, and in this one, I thought Lestat seemed scattered and stupid. Suddenly, everything and everyone was &quot;facinating&quot;. He talks like a 17-year old surfer, not a 200-year old well-read vampire. It almost seems like it was written by a different person. I can blame Anne Rice for some of it (though the story was good) but the editing was terrible (a slow downward trend has been noticeable for some time). Has she made so much money now that no one is going to tell her that she needs to FOCUS... not babble? Someone needed to take the fluff out of this book, but didn't."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"No, I didn't like Blood Canticle. I haven't really liked any of Anne Rice's books since Merrick. As someone who loves Rice's earlier vampire books, I can understand the vehemence of those reviewers who have vented their disappointment in their reviews. Yes I have read Rice's response, and it was definately a bit arrogant and ill-advised. But the retaliation has been a bit much. I believe that when an author publishes a book that it becomes part of the public forum - people have a right to comment on it, praise it, criticise it. But there's no need to run Rice into the ground. Despite the fact that I have disliked her most recent books, they have in no way lessened my love for her early vampire chronicles. Neither has her criticism of those people who give her bad reviews. I read The Vampire Lestat or The Queen of the Damned, and it's still the same as when I first read them - they are great books. I can read them over and over. So roll with the punches. Anne's written some bad books but she's also written some really fantastic ones. Think about that before you run her into the ground. If you can't respect the author then at least respect the work she has produced that you loved."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm trying hard to finish this book. But it is so hard to think that Lestat would say any of the &quot;cool&quot; words that Anne writes. &quot;Give ME a break&quot; Anne, you really should have an editor or at least someone that would read your book before you send it off to print. And, let that person be honest.How very disapointing for a finale."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I believe this will go down as my least favorite of the Vampire Chronicles. How disappointing to find that the book held little interest to me after the first few chapters, especially when I could barely put Blackwood Farm down once I started it. I guess my expectations were so much higher than they should have been. I expected a lot more from one of my favorite authors. This book picks up immediately after Blackwood Farm ends and goes off into a lot of repetition which I assume is for those readers who did not read the The Witching Hour, Lasher, and Taltos. If you're an Anne Rice fan than you more than likely read them all so this one was boring and repetitive...and had me wishing the book would move along to something new and exciting. It never got to that point. It's ending was as disappointing as the beginning."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is better than most of the books that I've read, but it's one of the worst of Anne Rice's books. Characters are supposed to mature over time, but come on, Lestat wanting to become a saint? That is just too much. What happened to the Lestat in Interveiw, the guy that you love to hate? What happened to the brat prince? This would be a good read for those who aren't familar with Anne Rice and her books, but for those of us who are, this book is depressing. I gave this book three stars because Lestat is narrating the book again, and there are parts in the the book that send chills down you back, but they are few and far between."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Hmmm. On top of all this silliness between those who liked this book and those who didn't, I'm still not sure if this is the end of the Vampire Chronicles or not. If it is, it went out with a whimper. If not, let's hope we get something with a lot more to \\"bite\\" on. While I found this book disappointing, I wouldn't go as far as to trash it but nowadays, this is the way many express themselves. It's an in Your Face World made worse by the advent of anonymous, written communications. This means that the lunatic fringe make an appearance ready to insult and denigrate, as do the \\"children\\" who should stick to their homework or go to bed. Does Anne Rice deserve all this vitriol? I think not. Could she have written a better book? I think so.Why didn't I like it? Well, for one Lestat has changed. Which is fine. This is Anne Rice's character and she is free to do with him what she wants. For me, he will always be the \\"Brat Prince\\" who defies convention. By portraying him as a Saint and essentially a parent, he has lost his fangs. I preferred him battling his inner demons but in Blood Canticle, he is just too much of a good guy for me. He is not Marius. He is not Maharet. He is Lestat, a monster who constantly finds himself yearning for what he lost yet revels in his immortality. The introduction of Mona as a vampire was just too close to Claudia for me. It felt like a repeat of his previous mini-coven. In addition, she is so annoying and immature, that I question why you even continue to involve her. The inclusion of the Taltos mystifies me. Why merge them if there is no resulting climax? Maybe Ms. Rice has other plans and if so, then I will give her the benefit of the doubt on this count. But absolutely nothing of substance between Vampire and Taltos occurred. I was eagerly awaiting Rowan Mayfair's transformation but that never occurred as well. This is the premise that most attracted me, a Mayfair witch of Rowan's power becoming a vampire. Surely someone that could have challenged Maharet or Mekare as the Queen of the Damned.So, I didn't like it but tis not the end of the world and hopefully Ms. Rice will grace us with another attempt at continuing the saga. If you do, please Ms. Rice, can you involve more of the older immortals? I find no magic in the new brood of Mona or Quinn. Bring back Maharet & Mekare, Pandora, Marius, Kayman, etc. Combine them with Rowan and Lestat and give us a true ride as you are capable of. I understand your anger and frustration. You did not deserve some of the comments flung on you like dung but...some of them do have a point. If anything, please direct your anger at the tyros that made Queen of the Damned into a movie (If it could be called one. How could you have let them do that!!???). I didn't expect them to stick to the original story-line but my god....that was an insult."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I thought Anne had lost it back when I read \\"Blood and Gold.\\" How I hated that book! \\"Blackwood Farm\\" was better, but still too much mundane detail. I'd read a lot of bad reviews for \\"Blood Canticle,\\" so I approached with caution.This book isn't nearly as bad as most people would have you believe. It moved a whole lot faster than the two previous books; I finished it in a fraction of the time and never even considered putting it away ... or burning it, like I wanted to do with \\"Blood and Gold.\\"That said, it isn't vintage Rice. Lestat's new use of lingo is annoying and seems very out of character, no matter how he tries to justify it. A 300-hundred-year-old white guy with long blond hair and velvet clothes trying to talk like a black ghetto kid just seemed forced and silly. Fortunately, he slipped out of that lingo quite often.As the conclusion to the Vampire Chronicles, it is very unsatisfying. I've always wanted to know more about Louis, for instance, but you get nothing about any of the older vampires. I expected some big-bang ending for all the vampires, or at least that Lestat would ascend to Heaven or something, but it just didn't happen. As an installment in the Chronicles, it was fine. As the ending, it was unsatisfying.Rice said she was finished with the vampires after \\"Memnoch the Devil.\\" Personally, I think she should have left it there. But, since she did return after that book, maybe we can hope she'll return again and give us a more satisfying conclusion."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This is the second wrost vampire novel I have ever read.

I've grown to love her stories, but this one just has me reeling. I'm not sure if it was the loss of her husband or what the problem is, but this one just doesn't seem like \\"her\\". Even so, I'm looking forward to seeing what she does next."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne Rice has written some stinkers in her time -- \\"Memnoch the Devil,\\" \\"Servant of the Bones\\" and \\"Violin\\" amongst them. But for sheer disappointment, it would be hard for her to top \\"Blood Canticle,\\" the not-so-grand finale of her classic Vampire Chronicles series. It wraps up both the Vampire and Witch series not with a bang, but with a slow squeaky whimper.The book actually starts with Lestat's fantasy about being a saint. Yes, Lestat now fantasizes about being like Saint Juan Diego and chatting with the Pope. This comes out of nowhere, and is merely an opportunity for Rice to tell us that we're all stupid shallow ingrates for not liking \\"Memnoch the Devil.\\"Then we switch off to where \\"Blackwood Farm\\" ended. The dying Mona Mayfair has come to Blackwood Farm to expire, but Lestat decides to make her into a vampire because.... well, otherwise Quinn will be sad. But while she's transforming, Rowan Mayfair arrives to pick up her young cousin and Lestat has to keep her from finding out what he's done. Also, Rowan and Lestat fall in love. Seriously.Lestat takes the two younger vampires under his wing, and shows the newly powerful Mona how to maneuver the world as a vampire. But her new life also revives Mona's interest in her old one -- specifically in the Taltos child she bore some years before, which triggered the disease that almost killed her. So the trio sets out to find out if the Taltos are still around.I'll be frank: \\"Blood Canticle\\" reads like fanfiction. Lestat falling in True Love with Rowan Mayfair? Lestat playing vampire dad to teen vampire lovers? Lestat's obsession with sainthood? Lestat having a midlife crisis (judging from his slang)? A thriller-like expedition to find the Taltos? This whole disaster sounds like a C-grade Vampire Chronicles fanfic!Sadly, not even Rice's trademark lush, atmospheric writing can save this hokey mess of a plot -- her prose seems limp and colorless, like a stalk of wilting celery. She also seems to be trying to wrap the whole mess up as quickly as possible, since it's basically about Lestat being told where the Taltos are and a quick trip there. It seems like she's utterly tired of the Vampire Chronicles and just wants it over and done with.She also seems to want the vampires themselves over and done with. Pretty much no beloved character except Lestat appear -- Maharet only communicates via email, Louis and Marius are only mentioned, and Rowan appears just so she can fall in Twilight-like instant love with Lestat. The only vampires who appear other than Lestat are... well, Quinn and Mona. Whee. So happy.And Lestat does not resemble the wild, brilliant, charming vampire that appeared in the previous books. This guy seems more like a middle-aged rich guy who's having a midlife crisis -- using slang, hanging out with the \\"kids,\\" getting a crush on a random woman, getting befuddled by technology, and so on.\\"Blood Canticle\\" is a sad, shameful ending for what was once a wonderful (or at least decent) vampire series -- a damp, sputtering creature that drifts away from its own lack of substance. Just finish the series at \\"Queen of the Damned.\\""},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I just thought i'd put in my $0.02. I also have been a fan of Anne Rice since i was 10 or 11. I have read her for years and have an amazing amount of respect for her creative talent and her eloquence. I fell in love with her books not so much for the subject but for the style of her writing. I've always been in awe of the poetry that is her novels. She can make anything sound beautiful. She has an amazing gift of persuasion. I can not believe that anyone would criticize her art. I've read some shocking things in these reviews. I agree that everyone has a right to express their opinion. But to do so harshly and personally is taking it a little extreme. I read this book when it first came out and I had no feelings of disapointment or discontent. I will admit, as a fan, the journey in the book is not what I would have chosen. But that is the beauty of it. I do not write these books. Noone does but the wonderfully talented Anne Rice, who I owe the pleasure of hours and hours of delighted reading. She is the creator of a tantalizing world where you can lose yourself in the darkness. By choosing to read her books you give her the liberty to take you wherever she chooses. So far from being disappointed, I was entranced by the unanticipated events that make up this little novel. As far as Lestat the character is concerned, what is he if he is not unpredictable, self-absorbed, self-serving, pitiful but pensive? He has many faults and yes, is a brat but isn't that why we love him? Do we find fault with him now because he has thoughts of atonement? Why can't we just accept this as a moment of weakness if that's what it can be called. No matter what Lestat has been through, he started off human nonetheless. But whether a few readers feel he is out of character is no matter. He is what he was created to be. And the only person who knows that is Anne Rice, who I am ever grateful to. Thank you, Anne, for always keeping us on our toes. And for every one person who has a distorted view of your book, you know there are 100s who understand what it truly is. A personal work of art. Thank you for that gift."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I considered myself a true Anne Rice fan, I even stuck it out through all those dreadfully boring vampire books after the Queen on the Damned, but I will never again read one of her books.This was truly a terrible book.If you liked the first three vampire books and The Witching Hour (which was my all time favorite book), stay away from Blood Canticle. Don't even read the description. This book ruined Lestat and the Mayfairs for me."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"These reviews are more entertaining than this terribly written book! As a young reader I have read more intellectual content in the pages of Harry Potter! Yes Anne, thank god it's over because I doubt anyone wants to waste any more time and money."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Wow, I guess I must be in the minority considering the reviews on here, but I really enjoyed this book. Lestat is at his wonderfully evil best, and Rice breathes more spirit and gumption into this novel than in some of her previous ones (The Vampire Armand and Blackwood Farm-good books, but slow moving at times). I definitely didn't find the characters one-dimensional, it was nice to see Lestat being himself again, as he hasn't in some of the previous books (although traveling to heaven and hell would be a bit traumatizing, I'm sure). I don't think I have ever been more in love with any character I've ever read about,and that spans a lot of books, believe me! Yes, the Brat Prince does like to spend a lot of time pondering things, he is a thinker, but I don't believe that something new, he is like that in all the chronicles, its part of his appeal.I will admit this book was a bit fast-paced compared to any previous books she has written and maybe that turned some of her fans off, but I found it a nice change, and read it in two nights. I enjoyed all the action, and the mystery of the Taltos, which is a series I neglected to read previously. I don't think the Mayfair witches turned into whimps at all. After all, who could resist Lestat? Come on! Certainly not me! I think Rowan Mayfair is a wounded soul in this novel who maybe now can get past the terrible things that happened to her and finally move on, and her husband also. Lestat to the rescue! Yeah!Overall, I would definitely have to recommend this book to any serious Rice fans. She is a lovely author I would like to meet sometime. She questions the same things in life I do: Is there a God? Where do we go after this? Etc.A good read, definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am a rabid Anne Rice fan, but I must admit I was sorely disappointed with this little book! Warning Spoilers! I found the characters to be somewhat shallow and lacking the usual definition she is famous for. I understand that she may have felt the need to rush this book somewhat, but it could have been so much more. I was devastated over what happened to Ashlar, but I never really cared that much for Mona or Morrigan. Oberon was interesting, but I guess his sarcastic attitute is probably from the Mayfair blood he carries. One can only assume that Rowan (God I despise her character)will play mad doctor with him and his sisters for awhile. I can find no place in my heart for Rowan. The way she treats Michael is absolutely repulsive. Don't get me wrong, Michael is a weak minded Pedophile, but then again, he does carry Julien's blood. And Julien, Mon Dieu! I was even disappointed in him. The interactions between him and Lestat seemed superficial at best, and he was utterly unlike himself (Julien) in former books. Stella was a breath of fresh air as always. I think Anne just brought in way too many unimportant characters and tried to people the book with them. I have read in other reviews of this book about fans being disturbed over Lestat's ghetto talking. I wasn't particularly bothered by it, though it did seem somewhat out of character for him. Then again, he cannot really be expected to talk 18th century forever. He's a vampire in touch with his time who is trying to make changes in his life. Altogether, I think my review was colored more by what she did to Ashlar than anything else. He was one of my favorite characters, and it was simply too tragic. Alors, Adieu to the Great Saint Ashlar, and the end of an era!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Although I love Anne Rice and her works, it's sometimes a love-hate relationship and occasionally one seems to dominate over the other. In the case of this book, I'd like to be more optimistic, but find myself strained to be so. I would recommend this book, it's not a waste of your time, but it's definitely not the older books.I personally *HATE* the witch books, and I hate it even more when they cross with the vampire books. Why? Because witches have no relevance to the world of the vampires. Lestat could set them ablaze with a thought, and frankly, I find them boring. The notions of family are well developed, but simply have no place in the realm of the vampire, where family notions tend to fall apart because of the very nature of the vampire as developed by Anne Rice herself.Sigh, I really wanted a better end, one more in tune with the classic writing style of yore. I think she was better off writing other stories than demeaning the vampire chronicles with stories involving witches or narrative experimentations. I actually thought she caught on in Blackwood Farm where Merrick was mercifully set ablaze. Apparently, I was wrong.I don't know, I definitely recommend her other books, but this should never have been written. If she wanted to send Lestat off in the blaze of glory, she should've turned him into an Archangel opposed to God and Memnoch alike and let it go from there. I hate saying this, believe me, but I was disappointed. If you're a fan, you'll probably feel the same way, if not, I recommend you start with another of her books."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've read most of the other reviews here, and while I agree that Anne seems to struggle in this book for the gift she had tapped into in her early works, I don't think that this book should be discarded wholesale. Yes, it reads more as a jaunt than a journey, but the melding of the Mayfair Witches, the Taltos, the Talamasca and our favorite Brat Prince is cohesive. Anne's gift for storytelling is not lost. Anne's ability to match the pace and vernacular of her prose to the personality of each character has not been left behind.I get a sense of resignation here. Maybe Anne was ready to hang up the Vampire Chronicles before Tale of the Body Thief, but has been responding to the clamoring of fans unwilling to give up the indomitable Lestat. Did she make her fans happy? Perhaps some. I am a Rice devotee. I'd probably read her grocery lists (in hardcover, no less) and love them. So here, I enjoyed the story and the familiar Rice tropes. But also, I got the feeling that Anne may have achieved, in Canticle, a catharsis of sorts, exorcising these characters from her system so that her next effort will have the fresh and feverish feel of Interview.To those who claim that their beloved Brat Prince is gone in this book, replaced by a genuflecting whiner, I'd like to point out that the take I get on Lestat is that he's always ready for the Next Best Thing to come along. His current obsession with sainthood is just another &quot;thing&quot; that he'll cling to with great passion until something more captivating crosses his path. He's true to form in his verbal combat with Mona, his bent for fashion, his dining on only the Evil Doer and his desire for companionship of both the human and vampiric ilk. He's the same ol' Lestat underneath his latest &quot;enchantment du jour&quot; and I love him, now and forever.So thank you, Anne...for (maybe) sending Lestat out into the sunset (and not the sunrise...would he have survived a second trip?) at a jaunty clip. If I see him again, great! If I don't, then I'm already anxiously anticipating what/whoever you send our way next!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved this book. I have read all of the Vampire Chronicles and the Witching series and to bring them together like this was great. I love how Lestat tells this story, great job!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I really liked this book. However, I don't compare these works with each other because to me they're a progression, the sum of their parts. And to ye who feel that Ms. Rice's work echoes her sentiments and/or religious beliefs, to that I loftily say, \\"Well, DUH!!\\" If memory serves, the brilliant \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" helped her to process her feelings of tragic loss, and \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" helped her find joy in life again. If a literary work is not part of the author, it is disconnected and less interesting. So, as far as I am concerned, Lestat's progressions reflect Ms. Rice's own personal journey, and I thank her for sharing so much of herself with us.And Ms. Rice, thank you for writing here and keeping in touch with the public. Please know there are many out there who love and support you and are offering their sympathy to you in your time of need.Long story short on the Vampire Chronicles: I'm so sorry they're over, and I will desperately miss my literary love, Lestat. He was, is, and will always be my FAVORITE character. There is no character out there so complex, so full of contradictions, so absolutely wonderful. Lestat forever."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"i have been reading the anne rice books for a couple of months now. i read interview last year, and this year started with the vampire lestat(which is by far the best) and worked my way down to almost all of them until i got to blackwood farm, which i enjoyed immensely. i was awaiting for this book, and even preordered it, but it was nto the conclusion i was anticipating. lestat seems to have lost his fire, there are a few instances where the old lestat comes back, but the lestat i was first introduced to, the one i feel in love with, is not here.i think entagling the vampire world with the mayfair world was a mistake. making mona a vampire, which i also thought was a wonderful character also in the witch chronicles, she also lost her fire in this book. when we first see her again, she is a waif of what she used to be, and i was glad to see she was not going to die after lestat made her a vampire, but his falling in love with rowan made me sick. rowan seems to fall in love with others too quickly, when micheal is this great guy. the finding of the taltos was another ridiculous story. there just seemed too much done in too little time and our beloved characters have all lost their fire.i did not think it was the proper end for lestat, or the mayfairs. the whole wanting to be a saint just did not suit the brat prince, and i skipped all references to it. while i love the rice novels, i know she was going thru a tough time with her husbands death, so i will forgive her. all her other books have more than made up for this folly."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book, as every other Anne Rice book I've ever read, left me wanting more. Not in a way that I feel the plot was lacking, but in a way that made me feel sad that this was the end of the line. I have read every Anne Rice book she's ever written - and never been disappointed. Even her strange religious excursions have been at least interesting. Sitting down to read the Witching Hour I was appalled at first to see the entire thing was mostly history of the family. I didn't see how that could possibly mean anything to the family or the current events. What happened instead was an obsession for the detail and other-worldly life Rice can make you believe in.Blood Canticle was EXACTLY what I was hoping for. Another amazing Anne Rice novel. Lestat has returned, and has progressed in life and character - as I feel he should with the changing times and changing events. The Blackwood family is simply exotic and Mona, dear Mona is almost bitterly annoying in her plight for love and Ophelia death. I can't say enough about the entire series (that being both the Mayfair Witches and the Vampire Chronicles). Read every book beginning to end. You won't ever been disappointed. Anne Rice doesn't create just a story, she creates another world."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"First, I would like to say that I have no idea why there are so many people writing negative reveiws about this book. Why is there controversy over it? Actually, the people who wrote these comments don't seem to understand fiction - or the Anne Rice (in her vampire days), for that matter. I am a fan.Here's the deal. If you are a Anne Rice fan - you will love the book. My suggestion - don't read it without picking up the Mayfair Witches series. I read them all, and Blood Canticle weaves all the worlds together, quite nicely. I read something about how the person didn't like how she wrote some of the characters - but I don't think they understood the power of Lestat, or the allure. A new leader emerges from this - and could bring up a \\"new\\" world, but unfortunately, we would never know. Yes, the book does start of kind of slow, but towards the end I was fascinated. Is it the best out of the series? No. but, everyone has it's favorites. Is it the worst? Certainly not. And the most compelling thing - the return of Lestat. It's a great piece to add to the collection. Do not let \\"controversy\\" (over what, i can't even contemplate) steer you away. Anne Rice is as she always was, and her story is a treasure. I am sad to see the Vampire Chronicles come to an end. She is, and always will be, the best author in vampire (and witch) lure.But dear one, see for yourself."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"To be honest, I was too excited about the storyline with the witches and vampires coming together to even notice the writing (good or bad, although normally I'm pretty picky about these things). Then again, I was always that kid who got super hyped up when two cartoons merged forces for an hour long special against an especially difficult villain. I was SO looking forward to the next book- until I found out there wasn't going to be one (at least not one I want to read)! I am so bummed out that one of my favorite writers has decided to write solely about her religion. Another one bites the dust! But- I do still love this book."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"What can I say about Blood Canticle other than give it a few days after reading it to stand back and say was this the end? Maybe even why the title? If so there is nothing better than her solution. I'ts beautiful.

That is my Lestat. He is finally himself here almost as he was in Interview With the Vampire.Lestat always has around him people that are close to him and choose death as a result of it.Well watch for Lestat to give readers a drubbing down. Nice one Anne. She is here with all her sly remarks and witholding promises but so be it. How many times am I going to hold her to her promises? Can't do that with Anne Rice. Lestat finally takes the bull by the horns. Again beautiful Anne..."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne Rice is back on her blood track. Lestat is back too and as lethally biting as usual. She brings together her two story lines : the Mayfair Saga and Lestat's Memoirs. It leads to some very fascinating moments where the psychology of the vampire, as it has evolved from that of the living being that was before, is explored in the various clashes each one of them has with the others, other vampires of course, but also human beings. And Anne Rice brings the Taltos line back into her writing. Fascinating too, but to a point. She decides to retrieve the Taltos from doom a little bit too late and she finds too many corpses that have been produced by a society, the Taltos society, that was doomed to get destroyed because of their own psychological and biological limits and possibilities and by the impossible commerce these Taltos can entertain with humans. They are taken over, which means destroyed both by the plotting members of their society and by the thugs of drug dealing. So we only get a description of their society through the survivors. It would have been interesting to enter this society and discover its shortcomings and its values and possibilities before they were destroyed. This is a little bit frustrating. But what is also kind of irritating is the fact that Anne Rice opens a great number of possible future developments but produces here a transitory book that does not really reach the level and height her novels generally reach. To the point of making a mistake and asserting that Lestat had to retrieve the microprocessor of a computer to take the memory of the computer along. Luckily she corrects the mistake later and this microprocessor becomes a hard drive, though only the hard disk was necessary. I find this volume a little less powerful than the previous ones and defintely less full of research and culture. Maybe she wanted to satisfy her readers who wanted a real Lestat again. Lestat may regress if he does not reach beyond what he has already done and into absolutely virginal lands. For sure he discovers love for a woman, and what woman, but this runs the risk of becoming a little bit soft in the intensity of the psychic and psychological exploration. And that poor Lestat loses his ambiguity in this adventure, though his ambiguity is his personal signature.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"After Blackwood Farm, anything would be hard to follow. I think this book was a great ongoing sequal to Blackwood. The new characture of Quinn and Mona could be a series all in itself, always with Lestat, the one we love the most, and Marius popping in. The New Orleans picture painted in these stories is beautifully described and much needed right now after the hurricane. I totally support Anne Rice and hope that the \\"bad\\" reviewers haven't turned her away from writing about our favorite charactures as life without them is uninteresting. We must keep Anne Rice writing, she is the only writer that writes about these charactures that you can't put the book down once you start. I await patiently for the next series. One suggestion, the first chapter Lestat sounds more like an angry Austin Powers, then it goes back to Anne Rice being channelled by Lestat. I can deal with that.....Go Anne."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne Rice has been one of my favorite authors of all times and i have enjoyed all her vampire novels. Expecting this book to be the same, i was dissapointed throughout the whole book. I did not read the Mayfair witch series because I wasn't interested in them in the first place. When she combined the two series together, i felt so lost and wondered why in the first place Anne Rice would do that. It was a waste of time and money.

Thank you Anne, once again."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have read all of Anne's vampire books and have, for the most part, loved each one in it's own right. This, however, is such a departure in writing style, story-line and intensity, that I am shocked it was written by the same woman who brought us timeless stories of other vampires. Lestat seems to be written like an 18 year old surfer, using the word &quot;dude&quot; too many times for me to count. Mona is detached and cold. Quinn is a stumbling fool. This book lacks Lestat's charm, it also lacks Louis, Marius, Armand, Pandora and every other entertaing character she has previously brought to life. I am sad this is her last chronicle. I am more sad that this is how the chronicle ended, which such a disappointing book."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This is far from the worst of the series. Though I am happy to see a wide variety of readers finally realizing that Anne Rice is really not all that special, to claim that BLOOD CANTICLE is the most insulting of her novels is sheer folly. MERRICK, anyone? Or THE MUMMY? Truth be told, there are probably a dozen of her novels that are worse than this one. In fact, I dare say BLOOD CANTICLE is one of her better efforts. The main reason for this is the narrator. Lestat has always been her most intriguing character, and it's about time he was front and center again. Ignore those who are whining about his semi-modern language; it's a serious improvement. Characters that exist in the present day should more or less speak like characters that exist in the present day, a point that Rice finally concedes.The climax is somewhat disappointing, however. I was looking forward to something a little more exciting (or maybe even profound) for the conclusion of the book/series. Instead [spoiler warning] we have no tension as a group of drug dealers is liquidated and the Taltos are freed to live happily ever after. Sort of. I have to say that I am relieved to see this whole Vampire Chronicles enterprise coming to an end. It peaked long, long ago. And now, like a boxer who's been knocked out too many times, it staggers into the sunset,punch-drunk and confused."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"People please, give an artist a chance to expand. Anne Rice is extrodinarily fluent with her pen and while this creation may not be her best i.e. The Vampire Lestat it still reflects a genuine awe inspiring reading experience. I read the book when it first came out a year ago in Hardback. Shelling the extra dollars out of my college wallet to buy this precious bit of escapisim I found it completely worth while. One of the most mature aspects of the book is that it shows the characters change. This is not just the next book in the Vampire series but the next book in the Witching series as well. Characters change in this novel and that is somthing that most writers never achive...the simple change of a literary figure. Most people who complain are saying that it dosen't have the action of the earlier books or the fiery Lestat we have all come to love. but the series would be incredably boring if we only ever saw Lestat terrorizing the streets of London or New Orleans.Personaly I thank Mrs. Rice for her latest book.

After finishing the vampire series (the four completed ones at that point), I moved on to the Mayfair series and have developed a steadfast admiration and respect for her talent.The stories are fun reads but, like all good classics, larger issues lie at the core of these series - namely death and meaningfulness. What would you do with a life that was potentially limitless? How does death define personal meaning? How would one find meaning if all wealth and magic were at their disposal? Each of her characters serve as vehicles to explore these (and many other) notions. Obviously there are no answers but here treatment - through these characters - is profound. From Tolstoy to Maugham, all great authors have done the same thing for different audiences at different times.For many years now I have been first in line when another Anne Rice book hits the bookstore and never have I grown tired of her discussion of these ideas and never have I been disappointed. Some have been more profound than others (e.g., Pandora), some have been a little work (e.g, Memnoch), and others I read too fast because it was a cool story (e.g. Witching Hour & Blackwood) - but that was OK, the second and third times I read it more slowly and savored the ideologies.Ms. Rice has been generous in allowing me (us) to hitch along her ideological highway and I am grateful. With even a distant understanding of the trials she has endured during these years, her work is all the more personal, vulnerable, and poignant. Those reviewers here who pick up one of her books \\"from a library on a beach\\" and then suddenly feel qualified to offer a cogent opinion give me the unsettled feeling that the depth of human ignorance is bottomless. It is certainly more of a commentary on the reviewer than that which is being \\"reviewed.\\"I personally loved \\"Blood Canticles\\" but for a rationale unique among my many Rice-loving reasons - in it she offers a fitting closure and send-off to the characters that have come to have a life of their own. If the entire vampire/Mayfair series was one big book, then \\"Canticles\\" would have been that last chapter that lets you set it down with satisfaction, hope (and a bit of piqued curiosity). I sensed a lot of love and goodbye in it - at least that is how I read it.And to Ms. Rice, in regards to those \\"reviewers\\" who seem to have flocked to this website, I offer the words of another person who made the mistake of offering himself to the ignorant masses; \\"Forgive them, for they know not what they do.\\""},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"After reading through all the reviews, and all the drible, and all the horrible remarks and rebuttles, heres what I found out from reviews.So, her last book wasnt the greatest. After 25 books, you cant write a winner every time.She was under contract and HAD to write another bookHer daughter and husband have both died. Well Jesus Christ, that might change me too....and my writing is a reflection of me, so MAYBE the writing would change?She's ill with diabetes and is having trouble with simple tasks?The slang from Lestat is....annoying...but Lestat LOVES being annoying. He really hasnt changed all that much. Mona was always a whiner, and like a previous post, Rowan was falling in the last book...Memnoc is apparently the turning point for a lot of readers. Just except that Lestat changed. Going to Heave and Hell would change you.... A character changing and growing makes him believable. And for the reviewer who said she was trying to 'convert him' to her 'religion' get real. Its FICTION.Lestats purpose in life is goodness. Has always been, he wants to be good, but loves his evil self. Hes ALWAYS been a contradiction. How bout you read the books first, then review.Lastly, you can hate a book all you want. You can publicly announce you hate a book, and why you hate it. But to lash out so horridly, taking attacks at the author personally cause she didnt write how YOU wanted for once is low.For anyone who hasn't read the book...I suggest reading it and forming your own opinion. Anne Rice was never an easy read, she has a lot of detail and it can get slow, but thats HER writing style. If you don't like it, don't read it. If you chose to try it out anyways and STILL don't like it, don't tell the author to go 'Mourn her husband and shut up.' Just put it on the shelf or give it to a used book store and try something new.My eyes are killing me after 30+ pages of cruelty. Grow up flamers."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book by Anne Rice, Blood Canticle, a conclusion to the Vampire Chronicles, was an insult. I felt Blood Canticle concluded absolutely nothing but my desire to read anymore of her books. Anne did not like the negative reviews she recieved for Memnoch the Devil, the last book that truly featured the character Lestat, and in the first chapter, Lestat/Anne berates her readers for it. While reading this terrible book, one gets the feeling that Anne is writing to those that did not like or understand Memnoch the Devil by saying, \\"Here, you simpletons, I've written a book that even you can understand.\\" The result is that the book reads like trash. Indeed, I believe even Anne herself admits to this when she has Lestat tell the readers to \\"Go ahead, throw this book away. Spit on me. Revile me. I dare you. Cast me out of your intellectual orbit. Throw me out of your backpack. Pitch me in the airport trash bin. Leave me on a bench in Central Park!\\" I wish I had listened.Blood Canticle picks up where Blackwood Farm left off, and the way it was presented, I wish it had not.In Blood Canticle, Anne merged the Vampire Chronicles with the Withching Hour series. The WH series in itself was great, but Anne ruined the other wise rich and intriguing characters in it.1. In Witching Hour, Mona was a tough, overly mature, genius at the age of 13. In Blood Canticle, at age 20 she is constantly whining and crying, and throwing temper tantrums.2. Michael Curry, the hero of the Witching Hour series, and one of the kindest characters, has been reduced to a spineless shell of his former self, allowing his wife Rowan to do whatever (whomever!) she wants.3. Rowan Mayfair, the cold hearted neurosurgeon, who has the ability to kill people with her mind,( and she does, several times), has cheated on Michael with a Taltos, has left him for dead while Michael was drowning in a swimming pool, shot 3 bullets into her innocent Taltos daughters' face, tried to pimp Mona off on Michael, wanted to (but did not) have sex with another Taltos, had sex with her adoptive father while her adoptive mother was dying in agony of cancer, and has tried to leave Michael again for Lestat, is only 'just now' depicted as mad in this latest book.4. Doesn't Lestat kill women like Rowan Mayfair? He always has before.....but no, what does he do? He falls madly inlove with her! The way that the Rowan and Lestat love affair was written, I swear I was reading a Danielle Steel novel.So much has already been written about Lestat's little trip to Heaven and Hell with Memnoch, that I'm not even going to get into it here. Suffice it to say the Lestat we all love to hate is gone.5. None of the other characters from the VC are in what was supposed to be a conclusive book.Anne Rice left openings in her previous novels such as the threat of the Talamasca, or Lestat's time with the angels, so the Vampire Chronicles had still some potential. Instead she wrote Blood Canticle, and it felt as if she just threw it all together simply to get it all over and done with as she wishes to move in other directions now.In an interview, Anne Rice said her readers had to come where she was going. If she writes anymore of this drivel, and loses her world wide fan base as a result, she'll be coming back to where her numerous fans are still waiting for a much better ending to the VC."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I read all of the reviews for this book and I thought it can't be that bad. From the 3rd chapter I thought to myself who is this new whinny,weak Lestat? The story line was weak and my goodness Quin is such a wimp! What a useless side kick! Also what was up with Lestat's lingo??? Yo Bro? I have so many more things to add but I'm sure it will just be the same thing has everyone else's. So, I will just say this for shame anne, for shame you could have done a lot better then this!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I Bought the book, only so anne rice could sign it, and that's the only reason i won't throw it in the trash. i'm going to have to reread books 1,2,3,4, and 6, just so i can remember why i loved the vampires to begin with. honestly, i couldn't get past page 100. the dialogue didn't flow, and made no sense, so unlike anne. when anne's on, she's the best in description and dialogue, but this book just proves that no writer is great all the time.i don't particularly enjoy reading about ghosts or her family of witches, but if it was a good story, i would hardly have noticed the obvious flaws. and it's practically dripping with catholism, which i don't mind in a good book, but this book wasn't.i know anne's been through a rough time, with her husband dying in the next room, so i'll just pretend i never read this horrible slap in the face to the vampire chronicles. i think she's a great writer, now she just needs to write great books again. poor, poor lestat, and where's my louis?"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"We'll it's a first for me: I had a review removed, and to have it removed for this particular book is quite amazing, considering all the insults and name calling that have been posted here, aimed at and between both readers and Mrs. Rice. Someone obviously didn't read beyond my prior post for them to consider it the most heinous and offensive post here! So for this repost, I'll try not to step on any sensitive toes. God forbid that to happen! That my review was removed, while others exponentially worse, more insulting, and grossly crueler remain, is nothing short of miraculous! My faith in the ability of others to respect the diversity of opinions is renewed! We should all strive to be one and politically correct, after all. Onward to my review 2.0...In my most humble opinion, this book is just as boring if not more so than the novel that preceded it in the series. Early on in the novel, we, the readers, are chastised by Rice through Lestat for not liking \\"Memnoch the Devil.\\" While Rice remains one of my favorite authors, I still retain the right to not like a work that she produces - as I do with any writer. Of all the books that I've read in my life, I've never seen criticism addressed in such a manner. To me, it seems petty to do this and to alienate the readers, without whom Rice would have no audience.This book suffers from a boring plot. The book mainly seems to follow Lestat and company (Lestat, Mona, and Quinn) trying to find Mona's lost child, a Taltos. What exactly is a Taltos? Apparently tall humanoid creatures, lacking bones (yes, bones!) and human wisdom. Ironically, they have the intelligence to build vast financial empires, as one of them does in the story, but they can't survive amongst humans. Oh yeah, and they only consume white foods. They're boring, and they only drag the story down with them.The style of writing isn't nice to read. Lestat's manner of speaking is quite hard to follow. Especially early on in the book, he thinks in sentence fragments. It's not a flowing prose, and it's hard to read. Parts of this novel are written like an abstract poem, and not a novel.The content of the book is disturbing, too. This book is full of sexually deviant imagery, as was the novel before it. In the last novel we have Quinn and Goblin, who are bothers - albeit one of them is a ghost, having sexual contact, and in this novel two of the Taltos, who are brother and sister have sexual contact. If this isn't deviant sexuality, then there isn't any. But, hey, what do I know, right?This book is also a continuation of the religious imagery contained in previous novels. I hate to read Lestat go on an on about Catholicism and saints, while at the same time profaning the very tenants for which they stand - faith, morality, fidelity (he has an affair with Dr. Mayfair!), absolute truth, Biblical authority, etc. It makes Lestat come off not as a saint or even a person trying to be saint, as Lestat states over and over in this book, but as a hypocrite and a false messiah. I think it's an expression of New Age philosophy and Universalism, born out of extreme, all-inclusive, amoral liberalism. Rice's books have become increasingly \\"preachy\\" since \\"Memnoch the Devil,\\" and this book is no different. I'll not apologize for disliking this kind of pseudo-religion.To me, this book is another one that can easily be skipped. I've read all of her vampire novels except \\"Interview with a Vampire.\\" The early ones are the best, and, in my opinion, they generally go downhill from there, with \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" being the absolute worst and \\"The Vampire Armand\\" being a close second. My advice is to go read any of the following: \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" (which I think is the best and nearly perfect book by Rice), \\"Vittorio,\\" \\"Pandora,\\" \\"Merrick,\\" or even \\"Queen of the Damned,\\" \\"Tales of the Body Thief,\\" and \\"Blood and Gold.\\""},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Bravo, Anne Rice. If you must leave the vampires, for a moment; for now; forever...you have left them in style.Blood Canticle continues to renew my interest in Anne Rice. For years I have followed the vampires' exploits...and for a long period of time was very disappointed in the fact that it all seemed to be familiar territory, time and again.Then along came Blackwood Farm; which took my breath away. Blood Canticle is what I would term an 'extension' of that story. But not only that, it is a continuation of the Mayfair Witch saga; as well as a (purported) finale to the story of Lestat.Quinn Blackwood has most everything he wants; he has been rid of his ghostly shadow, Goblin; his hated mother Patsy has been dealt with; Mona Mayfair has been brought over to the realm of the undead, to prevent her mortal expiration from the ravages of disease left behind by events relayed in Lasher and Taltos; and his new friend Lestat is completely enraptured with him.Mona Mayfair, the headstrong designee of the Mayfair Legacy was prepared for death, which she did, in a manner of speaking, meet. But that mortal death has brought her a new 'life'; that of the vampire, and an eternity to spend with her beloved Quinn.Lestat still seeks redemption for his soul...having met with angels and demons in Memnoch, the Devil he wants 'to be a saint, ...to save save souls by the millions, to do good far and wide, to fight evil'. The 'Brat Prince' of the undead wants to be delivered into salvation, despite his evildoings. And he wants Rowan Mayfair, the beautiful, mysterious, strong-willed doctor who desperately wants Mona to return to her so that she can help her die in peace, not knowing that Mona has been given the gift of the 'Dark Blood'.Once a vampire, Mona realizes that her life will never be the same, and that a whole new existance is open to her. But there is one final door that she must close on her human life...one final question that must be answerd; the fate of Morrigan, the daughter she gave birth to years before, who disappeared with Ashlar, an ancient Taltos, never to be seen again.Lestat, Quinn, and Mona search for Morrigan, and any other surviving Taltos, while Lestat searches for an end to his own quest. And when Rowan returns Lestat's interest, his determination grows all the stronger to help Mona, and Rowan.In this supposed finale to the Vampire series, Anne Rice ties up the loose ends of some of her more recent works, and the Mayfair series. While this book will not give you insight into the further stories of Armand, Louis, Marius, or the other blood drinkers Rice has made famous, fans have been clamoring for a book in Lestat's voice for years. And Rice has delivered.This book, the 12th in her Vampire Chronicles, is a fine addition to Anne Rice's tales of the undead. Read it, savor it...it could be the last one for all eternity.'And love becomes again my reprimand, my goad, my song.'"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I was going to read this book. I've heard from some people that they had enjoyed Rice's past works. Now that I've seen her response to some reviewers, I can't in good conscience put more money in her pocket. Anyone who would use so many flagrant ad hominems in response to criticisms of her work needs to grow up. Did you notice that I don't have a \\"Real Name\\" badge by my name? Of course you did. You seem eager to notice that sort of thing. Do you even know what the difference between having that badge and not having it is? Credit card information. I am less than surprised (after reading your \\"From the Author to the Some of the Negative Voices Here\\") to see that you are so petty as to disregard comments from people who do not wish to share credit card information with Amazon just so they can write an open review of your book. You ought to be ashamed.This is a quote from Anne Rice's own response to the book's detractors:\\"nowhere in this text are you told that this is the last of the chronicles, nowhere are you promised curtain calls or a finale, nowhere are you told there will be a wrap-up of all the earlier material. The text tells you exactly what to expect.\\"To this I say, \\"Oh, really\\". Then why is it that at the very end of that same exact response do you then say \\"And yes, the Chronicles are no more! Thank God!\\". Clearly you intended this book to be the last. Then why try to lie to your readers? These people paid money, in at least some cases, I'm sure, for the privilege of reading your book. I think they deserve a little better from you when they post their feelings about the book in a public forum. Especially when you lambast them for wanting closure in the final book.This forum is meant for reviews. Not everyone will love every book as you seem to, Anne. I noticed that you haven't given any book fewer than 5 stars in any of your reviews. Is that because you've never read a bad book? I know I have. Do you subscribe to the idiocy of \\"If you don't have anything nice to say...\\"? What value would these reviews have, then? How dare you censure people who paid for your book, read it, and cared enough about the content to tell other people about how they felt.How stupid do you think your readers are, anyway? Maybe I shouldn't ask that question. It seems obvious that you hold your high and mighty self at a level above us mere peons. Clearly the word \\"opinion\\" means nothing to you.It seems to me that the majority of \\"positive\\" reviews for this book since Rice's puerile response to her book's detractors have an appologetic nature that smack of fanboy/girlism. Quite frankly, with the rift in objectivity between the two opposing sides, the \\"positive\\" reviews do more to harm my perception of the quality of the book than the \\"negative\\" ones do. At least the negative reviews aren't kneejerk reactions that belittle the intelligence of your dissenting reviewers. How mature of them, eh?In case you didn't notice, the instructions for posting reviews reads, \\"Tell us what you think. Write a review of this item and share your opinions with others.\\" Is it really so difficult to believe that not everyone who reads this book will like it as much as you do? Must you be so childish about all this as to have an online temper tantrum and say \\"Fine! Give me back the book for all I care!\\"?\\"Stupid arrogant assumptions\\" you say? Pot, meet Kettle.3 stars. right in the middle."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Back in 2001 I decided to choose a writer and read everything that they had published. That author was Anne Rice. So far I have read them all under every name that she has used and it hasn't been easy sometimes. This book is not the worst, but it's a disappointment. It seems Anne was ready to let go of all of our favorites before we were. Now I'm a diehard fan, I've read Memnoch twice!! I was determined to get it. The only thing I can't abide is the way this book seemed to just dump all of the characters into a soup and shoved down our throats. We do deserve better than this for all of our years as fans. The characters deserve to be treated better.I own copies of all her books and the ones written about her and her work. I've reread every single book at least twice. The Witches set,The Mummy,Feast of all Saints, Lestat and Blood & Gold over and over. Violin, Cry to Heaven and the Beauty series not at all my cup of tea but I got through them. And even the new religious books I've continued on with my goal. My only hope is that even with Anne Rice returning to a religious life she will allow her past work to be filmed to the high standards that Interview was done.Go back and enjoy all of Anne Rice's books for they are really too rich to fully get with just one read."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am firmly convinced that some people would read anything that Anne Rice writes and praise it. The fact is, even the best authors have bad books. But the reason people are so down on this book is because this is the final insult in what has turned into a toboggan ride into hell for her work They have become increasingly formulaic and terribly written. Blood Canticle is just the absolute bottom of the barrel, and people aren't interested anymore in her writing. There is nothing redeemable about this dreck. You can defend it and you can look for all of the metaphors and subtext that you want, but it is simply a shockingly bad novel.If this had been turned in by any other author, it would be at the bottom of a trash can. But Anne Rice is a brand, and they would publish anything she sends them. Why she has become so adamant in the assassination of her own career is beyond me. Perhaps she has become aware of something that has been evident to her fans since &quot;Servant of the Bones&quot;: it's over. But instead of bowing out before she completely humiliates herself... she published &quot;Blood Canticle&quot;. Well, I am glad this is it for the Vampires and the Witches, they have suffered enough. I am afraid to see what she decided to butcher in her next &quot;novel&quot;."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is a sad, pathetic end to an otherwise exceptional series. The characters are flat and the story boring. Like Blackwood Farm, Rice pulls from both the Vampire and Mayfair Chronicles, but it just doesn't work. Great characters like Lestat, Rowan Mayfair, Michael Curry, and the pugnacious Mona are weak, crazed, and/or boring. By the time I finished this &quot;novel,&quot; I felt nothing for the characters. They neither grew nor moved forward. Lestat's obsession with Rowan Mayfair seems forced, the Taltos story is a major letdown, and the ending just sucked. If this is truly the end of the Vampire Chronicles and the Lives of Mayfair Witches, we (and the characters) got screwed.I have been a fan of Ms. Rice since first discovering Interview with a Vampire and have devoured her novels since. Some have not always been satisfying (Memnoch being a good example), but I've always come back for more. Now, I'm not so sure. If she chooses to write something different, it will have to be damn good for me to lay down $25 for it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I bought this book. I read this book. Then I put it back on the shelf where it has sat ever since.I'm a more recent convert to Anne Rice's vampire books, having only read them since Pandora came out in '98 (By the way, thanks for that one Santa!)but I have since bought all the vampire and mayfair witches books. I enjoy the witches and the vampire books in two very different ways, and if I had not realised this before, it was made clear to me by this book. Unfortunately, even those parts I enjoyed were ruined by those I didn't.The introduction was both patronising insulting. Lestat's scene with the Pope, frankly silly, as has his very character become.I think the main problem I had with this book was the romance between my formerly favourite gorgeous fiend and Rowan, which seemed tacked on to the story as an after thought rather than a truely pivotal plot point. The series has been going for a while, and one can't blame the authoress for losing interest in the characters after so long, but one can't help but wish Lestat's final outing had been less... well, bland. I found the typographical errors frustrating, along with the plot holes and continuity errors (which others have gone into in great depth, so I won't bother with them).It's an okay resolution to the Witches series, but leaves the vampire series gasping and flipping around like a dying fish on the carpet.It's hard to say more without giving away the plot, so I wont, however, I will recommend other books by Anne Rice should this one not suit your taste.DO read: Interview with the Vampire, Pandora, Vittorio the Vampire and Tale of the Body Snatcher.Pandora, which I read first, remains my own personal favourite.Now to address all the idiotic controversy:1) Play the ball, not the man.When you write a review, keep your opinions of authors names to yourself. No-one cares. Nor do they care about your opinions of their private lives or habits.2) Saying an author writes only for his or herself is not only a hideous cliche, but is undervaluing the work that goes into writing a successful book. If people are parting with their hard earned wodges of folding stuff to purchase copies, and you are supplying copies, you are no longer writing only for yourself. If you are writing for yourself, it would be scribbled in private diaries.3) On a public fourm, anyone can express their views, positive or negative. Variety of opinion is a sign of a healthy readership.Deal with it.4) Don't feed the trolls.When an author posts a rant, even if you feel it is justified, remember: Trolls who are posting merely for the attention take any response to them as a win and are thrilled. People giving honest reviews and critiques will find the vilification and insults defensive and immature. People who are devoted and loyal readers probably wont read any reviews.And those who make up the majority of the worlds readers, who have no particular affinity for any one author will take away a negative view of all those concerned. If you must reply to reviews (even the very off-topic ones) for goodness sake provide an calm and reasoned explanation do not denigrate, patronise or attack those with differing opinions.This goes for reviewers as well."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"First things first: Mrs. Rice, if you're out there: I am very sorry to hear of your recent loss.Now, Literature, or the lack thereof:With her first novel, \\"Interview with the Vampire\\", Anne Rice acheived something remarkable: she stripped from vampire fiction all the musty, B-movie trappings it had accumulated since Stoker, and in doing so allowed her characters to be human, and thus accessible to a human audience. \\"Interview\\" was a revolutionary and influential book; without it there would be no \\"Buffy,\\" no \\"Angel,\\" no \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" and cetainly no \\"Underworld.\\" Mrs. Rice is on record as stating that if she's read two hundred years from now it will be for her adault \\"Beauty\\" series... I warrant it will also be for \\"Interview\\".The trouble comes will all the subsequent books. Rice puts back all the pointless trappings, plus some, expecting her readers to accept, not only vampires, but witches, ghosts, astral projection, dopplegangers, ad nauseum, with very little inducement for suspension of disblief save for an implicit, authorial 'because I said so'. I understand she uses the entire first chapter of this latest book to chastize (via Lestat) the readers who dared criticize \\"Memnoch\\": \\"I give you this metaphysical vision...and what thanks do I get? 'What kind of novel is this,' you asked.\\" Well, Anne, if you're wondering, the answer is simple: the world moved beyond arguing over how many angels can dance on the head of a pin some time ago, and 'because I said so' isn't enough. Piling on unsubstantiated, \\"metaphysical\\" tommyrot outside the realm of their experience--indeed, outside of ANYONE'S verifiable experience-- serves only to alienate your readers. They are mortal, and children of the twenty-first century. They teach Critical Thinking in colleges, you know.But, all of this is apparently now moot: \\"Blood Canticle\\" purports to be the last of the \\"Vampire Chronicles\\" (Riiight... how many times has David Bowie retired?), so perhaps disenchanted Rice fans may place their hopes on the upcoming Elton John/Bernie Taupin musical adaptation of The Vampire Lestat. And, who knows? Perhaps Mr. Christopher Rice's recent forays into horror fiction are but practice for the day he takes over the franchise."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Blood Canticle delivers a startling double-shot of literary unprofessionalism.First, Anne Rice uses her most beloved character to berate and insult her fanbase for not appreciating her 1995 release, Memnoch the Devil. In his half-coherent rant, Lestat points out that Memnoch sold more copies than any other book in the series. Were those numbers really a surprise to anyone? After all, the film version of Interview with the Vampire had become a huge hit only months before. But apparently (at least in Anne's mind), most of those books went to idiots who didn't bother to understand its importance. So yes, Anne, insult us. Insult the readers who have kept up with your work for a decade or more, because we obviously just don't appreciate you. Never mind that literature is, by nature, always open to interpretation. We didn't read Memnoch the way you wanted. We deserve to be berated by the Brat Prince.Please.Oh, and the second unprofessional element in Blood Canticle? Rice follows up that rant with a novel that's practically unreadable. Characters act entirely differently than in past books (and that's not character development -- that's simple inconsistency). A few of the luckier characters have disappeared completely, thus escaping this soapy car wreck of a narrative. And what in the world happened to Lestat's written voice? He used to turn a charming phrase; now he speaks and writes like a half-literate teenager.I hope Anne keeps her promise and makes Blood Canticle the last book in the series. Her once-great characters deserve to rest in peace, if this sort of book is the best she can manage for them otherwise."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"'Blood Canticle' is by far the fastest-reading one of the Vampire Chronicles. I found myself surprised by the pace, as I've been reading Anne Rice for years and am accustomed to their taking a bit longer to get through. This one was a three-nighter.I'd call this one 'Anne Rice for people who don't really read Anne Rice.' It's a bit lighter fare than some of the others and it's quite playful in places. I for one enjoyed Lestat's opening diatribe chastising readers for not liking 'Memnoch' and found his recent discovery of 'lingo' amusing. I can't understand why so many readers were so violently upset over Lestat's linguistic change - I mean sure, maybe 'yo' and 'dude' and 'shove it' are a little behind the times, but that aside, do some of us have a problem with Lestat entering the 21st century? He is getting on to 300 years old, is he not? He's an immortal, is he not? Hadn't he better get used to the world changing? Hadn't the readers better get used to it too?It would NOT work for a character like Louis or Armand to be talking that way, but it works for Lestat - he is an always has been completely full of himself and I think that's a fine and funny way to keep things fresh.It was kind of strange to have Maharet communicating by email! That threw me for a loop but again, it is the 21st century.Missing from this book are some of the lengthy narrative descriptions - Anne Rice is a master of description and in many of her books this can go on for pages. While it can sometimes be a bit bogged down, I almost found myself missing it in 'Blood Canticle.' It was as if something had been abbreviated.The characters seemed somewhat abbreviated too - especially the Mayfairs. 'The Witching Hour' is my favorite Anne Rice and one of my favorites, period, and I was delighted with the idea of incorporating Mayfair with Vampire Chronicles. But after the lushness of 'The Witching Hour,' these characters return in 'Blood Canticle' somewhat diminished. I forgot Michael Curry was even in the room on several occasions - wouldn't even know he was there until he spoke some line of dialogue. The same went for Quinn, who also disappeared almost completely in this book. I liked him in 'Blackwood Farm' (and yes, I liked 'Blackwood Farm'!) but in 'Blood Canticle' he's rather reduced to a vehicle for shushing and comforting distraught females. Oncle Julien didn't seem quite himself either, although putting him in the book was throwing a great bone to the readers. I never really understood why it was Stella who appeared with him, of all the Mayfair witches to choose from, and it occurred to me that if you hadn't read 'The Witching Hour,' you'd have no idea who Stella was.The Rowan/Lestat thing made sense to me. They've both done some unspeakable things in their lives and they're both seeking redemption in some way. They each see the goodness in the other and they're drawn to one who sees their goodness. However, I found their teenager-like encounter at the base of the oak tree unnecessary. This thing existed in the book on a much loftier, almost metaphysical plane until that happened and I was a bit grossed out.The whole Taltos thing was rushed and needed more explanation for readers who haven't read the Mayfair books. I totally understood what was going on because I have, but I imagine that someone who hadn't wouldn't cotton at all to the Taltos business, and some of the reviews I've read here are obviously by readers who haven't read 'Taltos,' 'Lasher,' or 'Witching Hour.' Those three books are the perfect example of suspension of disbelief and they are great.I did feel sad at the end knowing that this is the last of the Vampire Chronicles because for all these years I've been reading them, but I suppose we can all just use our imaginations from here on out and hope that Anne Rice will continue writing, even if it's something completely different. Subject matter aside, she is an excellent writer and while I don't necessarily love each and every one of her books, I'll always continue to read them.I'm shocked by some of the mean-spirited reviews I've read here. Everyone's entitled to their opinion and that's why this is a great website, but to be so destructive in attacking Anne Rice only deters people who have never read any of her books, and now never might.No, it's not 'The Witching Hour' or 'Interview with the Vampire' or 'The Vampire Lestat', but 'Blood Canticle' is fun. It's a good time reading it. It's entertaining and it's good escapism. What else are you looking for if you just want to enjoy yourself with a book?Sure, I would have loved to see Louis but it looks like Louis has moved on with his life so more power to him and let the rest of us take his example."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"&quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is a novel that Anne Rice was well over 3/4 of the way writing when her husband was diagnosed with brain cancer. She took time off from writing and then went back to the novel in order to make her dead line. When reading the novel, the shift in her tone is evident. (Besides the fact that the novel was finished on October 5, Stan was diagnosed in August. No way the novel was done that quickly, no matter how sloppy and poorly written it is.)Still, that means she had written over half the book before he was sick. So you know what that means... no excuse. &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is repellent. And it would be forgivable if Blood and Gold &amp; Blackwood Farm had been even half-way decent novels, but they weren't. And so the all the excuses and half-hearted defenses with continue for Ms. Rice. It still does not make up for an once brilliant author who had decided to churn out novels more processed than Velvetta.The language is terrible, the &quot;plot&quot; is a joke, and all the while you can't hope but think, she knows it as well. But she doesn't. And I don't think this will be the last chronicle. Let's face it... writing a vampire chronicle pays, and it's obivious that is what Anne Rice is concerned with. Art and intergrity have been stomped on and there isn't even a glimmer of the once great author she was. That's the greatest tragity. Yo, I think it's time for us all to boogie on over to a better writer, baby."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"If you love the Vampire Chronicles, please don't read this book. It won't be the smashing hit you want it to be, it won't even come close.If you heard the Vampire Lestat was back and he's starring in Blood Canticle, you were lied to. The Lestat you knew in the first few books of the Chronicles is gone. Blood Canticle stars Saint Lestat, a contrived rip-off of the original.The butcher of Lestat's character aside, how do you remember all the other characters? You Mayfair fans, don't look for your characters here, unless your looking for the fancition-style card board cut-out of them.I'm as big an Anne Rice fan as the next person, believe me. And I wouldn't be saying such harsh things about her work if I didn't believe they were true. It saddens me to say it, but this book was nothing but a disappointment. I do not recommend it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Usually, I think that appreciation for every book is up to an individual's taste. Believe me, there are a few classics that I would rather be bludgeoned to death with than have to read again. But, how can anyone who has appreciated Anne Rice's earlier work even give this novel 2 stars? I mean, it is really bad.The work (or lack thereof) is just terrible and shoddy. I have read short stories by 8th graders that had more thought than this drivel did. I have read every novel Anne has written. Some have been better than others. But nothing has been as poorly done as &quot;Blood Canticle&quot;. She has just completely lost touch with reality. Does she really think that people speak like that? And does she truly think that by having Lestat use words like &quot;Yo&quot; and &quot;Bro&quot; that he has adapted to modern times?Religion is great and Lestat used to be so interesting. But Lestat, like the author, seems to have found a new orifice that he like to speak out of.I won't comment on the characters. They are all one dimensional idiots. There is no plot, even though we are promised one. And... I just can't even go on. I will never read or purchase another Anne Rice book. This is just too insulting. I think I will join two Taltos in the deep freeze and just pray that it goes away."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is really not good work compared to Ms Rice's earliest works, although I still think the Witching Hour is the finest book that she has written. This book has the thinly etched sense that makes me feel as if I have already read it.I don't see any point in being nasty or personal, that's just my take. These are reader opinions, not professional reviewers, but we do buy (and buy and buy) her books. If she can't take the heat she should stay out of the Literary Amazon Kitchen."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Of course I will always love Interview with The Vampire, The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the damned. But many Anne Rice fans agree they go down hill from there. There are certain circles that refer to my previously mentioned first three vampire chronicles as the ONLY vampire Chronicles. All the rest come off like fan fictions from some other person.Nothing done now can change what had been. The Interview with the vampire is still the interview with the vampire. The Vampire Lestat is still The Vampire Lestat, The Queen of the damned is still The Queen of the damned. I just pretend it's 1989 and the others were not published yet. They did not happen.Lestat, in my mind, is still a rebel, still a brat, still mischievous, still questions things, still fearless, still angst driven, still a fighter, and still perseverent. He's still riding around on his Harley, hunting down his killers and falling in love with the world. He's still an optimist (He has a pessimistic view of humanity in Blood Canticle.) He still views society today as an age of innocence and he's still my Lestat. All the rest... to me.. They're just fan fictions.I wish Anne Rice had done a book that she once hinted about years ago. The idea of the vampires being found out by some mortals and possibly captured and studies and then the escape... Lestat talks about this idea in The Vampire Lestat. That could have been a great novel, especially with our proud and defiant Lestat. This conformist, prude, depthless, two-dimensional Lestat would fold under that pressure but the Lestat I know would not. The first three vampire chronicles- that's my Lestat. That will always be my Lestat and no one can take that away from me.I miss Lestat. Lestat in Blood Canticle is whining. And he's become a conformist. He's now a hard-core Catholic who questions nothing, a cold hypocrite, a misogynist, a prude, and pessimist. This is not our Lestat! Our Lestat was a brat. Our Lestat questioned things. Our Lestat was always a rebel. Changing his personality this abruptly is like saying he now has blue hair and orange eyes. The angst is gone. The fearless soul that could never be oppressed is gone. He seems almost defeated by life, and defeat is against Lestat's nature. This whole book is against his nature! Certain aspects of one's personality don't change THAT drastically over time. And he's supposed to be roughly two-hundred and forty-six-years-old. And for most of that he was the Lestat I loved. This so called maturing is tragic and if this is what you call maturing I'd rather be a child. I never viewed maturing as becoming closed minded, sexist, spiritually defeated, conformed or becoming pessmistic. What a dreary view of life that would be!I did not love the fangs or the blonde hair. I loved his personality. I related to Lestat, not the vampire! She's forgotten who Lestat was.Lestat used to see this world as an age of secular innocence where evil doers were scarce. And now he says there are many in the cities who deserve the vampire's kiss. He's become depthless (if he had much depth to begin with.) He's two dimensional. He's hunting down rogues and rule breaker vampires! He is a rogue and rule breaker! I want Lestat, I don't want Angel from Buffy The Vampire Slayer!I want Lestat the way he was meant to be. If Anne Rice needed a new character to express her obsession and new-found conformist mentality she should have used ANYONE but The Brat Prince to express it! I think this book disappointed every Anne Rice fan, everywhere, one way or another.What happened to our man of action? Where's The James Bond of the Vampires? My God! In these later novels the character himself can't even get his own name right. He keeps saying he was twenty, he was twenty-one as a mortal when he killed the wolves so how could he appear twenty now?I know I'm being harsh but Anne calls this maturing for Lestat. Being mature does not mean clinging desperately to something without question. Being mature does not mean becoming sexist with fashion, and seeing evil everywhere where he once was in love with the goodness in society. Lestat was a brat but he had faith in goodness. Now he doesn't seem to have that faith. His real and pure faith has been replaced by something superficial, something dark. And the restless spirit, the angst driven rebel, the one who could not be dominated... Our beloved antagonist, he's gone.... I don't know who this creature is who is narrating the story but it's not our Lestat.I'll always love the first three vampire chronicles, Interview with The Vampire, The Vampire Lestat and The queen of the damned. By my advice to anyone just starting, don't go any further than that. Tale of the body thief is good for comic relief if you have a dark sense of humour but that's about it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have always been a huge Ann Rice fan, and have read several of her early books more than once. The first few vampire chronicles and Mayfair stories were awesome. But I can't get into Blood Canticle, even after giving it the standard 100 pages I try to give all books I read. Mona is a trashy brat, Lestat is over the top cocky, Rowan is loopy...only Quinn holds any interest for me at this point and he has hardly been featured at all. Unless Ann brings back Louis, Armand and the old gang, in some new adventure, this will be my last vampire chronicle. There's just nothing like the good old days!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"And I don't say that lightly. It really is the WORST book ever. My favorite book of all time is The Vampire Lestat, so it hurts to have to say that. But it is true. From the first diatribe ridden page to the last anti climatic ludicrus page it is truly horrible. I've read and reread all of Rice's books except for Feast of All Saints and I've liked all of them (except Taltos and to some extent Memnoch the Devil; but at least that book had SOME redeeming qualities, Blood Canticle has NONE). I refuse to even think that the character in this book is actually Lestat. There is almost no similiarity to the Lestat I know very well and love. This is a completely different character who is boring, juvenile, and insipid. None of the characters are consistent with what they were in the previous books. Michael is reduced to just having a hot bod and being Rowan's cast off. Mona is a brainless you know what. Rowan is a shadow of her former self. The love story between Lestat and Rowan is unbelieveable, laughable, ridiculous and painful to have to read. The storyline about the Taltos is almost disgusting and it is beyond that, besides any point I could see the novel might have. I could say so many things about this book. When I heard about the plot about Lestat wanting to be a Saint, I thought it would be very interesting. It is so far from interesting it goes absolutely nowhere. He yammers on and on about some obscure saint, and has nothing insightful to say about the subject. Inexplicably he gives up the subject half way through and goes of to have a relationship with Rowan who he is paired with through some sort of convenience for the author to try to wrap things up. Lestat could have gone out gracefully, but this book cuts his head off and buries him in sludge (not literally of course). I was excited for Julien to be in the book.....he is hardly in it and is ineffectual as a ghost, person, or character. I see no reason for him being in the book at all. I could go on and on. Seriously, and no kidding, worst book ever."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've been reading Blood Canticle and am astonished at the philospohical overtones. Letstat is boundlessly optimistic, seeing wisdom generated from indulgence, knowledge from greed, strength from indolence. If true, then by allegory we can presume the USA is becoming the wiser, the smarter and the stronger by being indulgent, glutinous and lazy.This flies in the face of all religious thought, centering itself -- as it does -- around matrial deprivation as the key to intellectual aquisition.Lestat, in his lavish excesses and vanities, indeed seems to prove that affluence leads to wisdom. And America, big pregnant child, also seems to verfify Lestat's belief. I confess that I see the sense in it too. Destitution as I have experienced it has retarded my intellectual frowth, not enriched it.I'll stop here because another paragraph will be pesteferous. I very much enjoy Rice's intellectial content, her suberb writing style and her charming vampire (who chats with the Pope not only on equal terms, but on slightly condescending terms!) Anne Rice's Dickensonian appeal to America's millions says valumes about us as a people. We're going for the gold ring. I have so much more to say . . . ."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I really love anne rice and almost all her books, but this one wasnt one of her best. Since when has lestat ever used &quot;Yo&quot;. That just wasnt in his character. The good thing about this book was bringing the mayfair witches and vampire chronicals together again. As her last book for her vampire chronicals, it didnt really tie up any loose ends with marius or armond or any of them, not even lestat. But as her last I still enjoyed reading it, but hopefully, maybe she'll make just one more."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne has tried her best with this last book she is a wonderful person who gives to her fans all that she can.When she lost Stan she returned to her faith. She has already made it clear this will be her last book about Lestat. She wants light in her life and needs to leave the darkness behind for her own reasons.I loved the vampire chronicles and would love to have her write more.I agree that B.C wasn't her best, But I'm glad I bought it.I wish her all the luck with whatever she does and she will always have a fan in me."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I just visited the official Anne Rice website and read her thoughts about Blood Canticle. I had to admit I had some reactions about certain parts of the book but after reading her message... I understood more clearly the vitality of Lestat's voice and musings and overall element of the book. Initially I felt a bit like a stranger to Lestat with his introduction...I dont know why because I always look forward to his introductions on the chronicles and with this one... Im sorry but maybe i felt him babble a bit and got bored. I was also surprised to see the word COOL a number of times and there was even a YO. If Lestat felt he can pull it off... I can deal with it. Overall... As always I loved the book. I loved his longings to be good, thoughts about \\"pure love\\", his intimacy with mona and quinn, even when he's angry... i love it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I agree with another reader that \\"Blood Canticle\\" is definitely not Anne's best endeavor. But, it is understandable why it isn't, being that her husband of forty years just passed away. People aren't even considering this. Think about it. Anne had been with Stan for two-thirds of her life. She basically grew up with this man! And she was obviously in a state of grief (for even as she wrote this, his health was failing rapidly). But here are her fans, her \\"loyal\\" fans, acting out like bunch starving vultures! I could care less whether anyone agrees with this review, or not. That is the way it is. I lost my wife five years ago, and I am practically still grieving. Stan just died eleven months ago! I mean, what is she supposed to do? HOCUS POCUS, I'M MAGICALLY OVER HIS SICKNESS, OVER HIS DEATH. TIME TO WRITE GROUNDBREAKING NOVEL! No. It doesn't work that way, folks. She is human. I would love to see even half of those whom gave negative, or downright harsh reviews, sit down and write some meaningful fiction (which in a state of grief, can be quite meaningless, I can imagine) after your spouse has just died weeks or months before. Please, you guys, be more understanding. Even more pathetic is a reviewer from another website, pretty much saying \\"Ah, first Anne's daughter died, now it's her husband that has died. So we're sure to get a good book out of her!\\" That's disgusting. Truly disgusting. What's wrong with everybody? This whole \\"who cares about Anne's feelings, just give me a good novel\\" thing is not so hot. Okay, so it's not a good ending to the Chronicles. I can understand your frustration. Just.....try not to be so heartless with your words."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I read this book in one day, couldn't put it down. I see it as having a more psychological and philosophical bent than the earlier ones (perhaps that's why some reviewers are so unhappy with it). Lestat is very different, it's true. But this book is not just a book about vampires and witches, but a testament to loss and the will to go on in spite of it, which may be a result of timing: Anne's husband Stan's devastating illness just at the time she was completing the book. I found it deeply moving. By the way, reviewers have referred to this as the sequel to Blackwood Farm, which it is, but it is also a sequel to Taltos, one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm avid reader and also an Anne Rice fan for decades. I fell in love which each book for their uniqueness and for the difference between each. There was a new world in each book. This book (and also the others) cannot be compared to each other. I always open a book with my own expectations and this one has meet all of them. Is fresh, new and not like any other. That's what makes a good book and a great writer. Unfortunately not all people can accept the fact that is HER book and she can direct her story and shape her characters which ever way she wants.Intriguing and intoxicating... give it a try.And for those of you who have enough time to bash at someone you don't even know to attack her directly; I'll be patiently waiting for your own book to come out."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"As a published author and avid reader from childhood, I can comprehend what it takes for many readers to lose themselves in a book. Anne does this to me in every book that she has written and I can never get enough of the Vampire Chronicles. I fear the series will end, but I hope not.As for writing style, she is one of the best. Some may not agree, but for those who find themselves transformed into the world of vampires and feel every words as through you are present in that remarkable places she creates, then Rice has done her job as an entertaining author.Blood Canticle was everything I dreamed it would be and more. With so many vivid characters to work with, Mrs. Rice could very well blow the Vampire world off the map. I hope there will be more, especially now with the new Brat, Mona Mayfair throwing her spoiled, childish personality into the works. With her being a new Blood Child, the possibilities are endless on the troubles she could cause for one and all. I can already imagine her (Mona Mayfair) taking off on her own, which would bring a good battle of skill, wit, and strength to battle with many of the other infamous Immortals, especially with LeStat, with a hopeful return of Louis. After all, he did start the whole Chronicle of Vampires, did he not? Let's just wait and see."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne Rice's latest book, Blood Canticle, in my opinion was amazing. The plot, storyline, and charactor interactions are just as touching and poignant as ever. It was quite nice to hear how old charactors were faring and the development of newer ones kept my attention mesmerized. Picking up this book was like hearing from an old friend; I can not wait for her next book to be published, appluad her accomplishment, and am waiting."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Having been an Anne RIce reader for most of my life, I was excited to read Blood Canticle. I fell in love with the Vampires, then the Mayfairs. I honestly don't understand what anyone could find wrong with this book.The characters are going through different issues, and in turn behave differently. Some of these reviewers make mention of the characters being \\"different\\" but thats because they are. Rowan has an understanding of what she is and why she is different. Having that level of understanding is bound to change a person.Additionally, the story itself is completely fullfilling. All the loose ends tied up. I would recommend this book without a doubt, especially to someone whose read all of the former books in the series.This book melded together both series beautifully. Anne Rice, if you are reading this, keep going, don't let these insipid pseudo intellectualists upset you. It seems silly for these people to write about something they don't like. Its like going to a concert and just to boo."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I love the language and voice of this author. All of her stories are worlds unto themselves but this was truly a masterpiece. There is so much raw emotion in the character Lestat--anger, jealousy, possessiveness, love, lust, guilt, tenderness--that you feel in touch with him as a though he were a living, breathing entity. In this book, more than any previously, you really see the evolution of the Lestat character. He BECOMES. No more is he merely the quixotic, daring and beloved brat prince. He is so much more than that.The story is full and rich, as are all of Rice's works. But there is something here that I think is quite different from her other works. I felt like I was reading something personal and unique in this book, and it touched me as no other book has before. At the end of the story I was sobbing, and I couldn't tell if it was from sorrow or illumination.This is a rare work, a priceless work. On the surface, this is a fun and exciting installment of the Vampire Chronicles. Lestat is at his very devilish best. But looking beneath that, to the raw core of the story, you can really see the fully blossomed talent of a modern master of the craft who has shared a great gift with us, her readers.I don't think I'll ever look at life and death, sin and salvation, the same way again."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"\\"Blood Canticle\\" concludes the \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\" crossing over with \\"Lives of the Mayfair Witches\\" alongside other independent novels that exist in the same universe. Falling back to an earlier character, Lestat de Lioncourt tells his tale on his final journey with not the original cast but with newly acquired Tarquin Blackwood and Mona Mayfair. The literary style has short clipped sentences and not as verbose or beautifully written as in the past.Outside of one particular vampire bloodbath that was very thrilling, the remaining parts uninterested me. Lestat, initially an engaging character, has become annoying and I do not wish to hear his babbling speech or read his stories anymore he has changed so much. Of course Lestat falls madly in love once more. As always, the created vampires are omnipotent, able to use any of the powers of an Elder and do not have the appreciation of one who struggled to survive.The entire Mayfair/Taltos/Vampire theme fusion has pushed the creative envelope giving way to an untrue vampire story. A nurse in the previous novel has her name spelled differently because apparently Quinn, who interacted with her on a semi-regular basis in that telling, didn't know how it was correctly spelled. Addressing such a thing was a waste of space and unnecessary. However the purpose of Stella and Oncle Julien is left unresolved, possibly answered in outside novels but I will not seek the answers elsewhere and end my experiences with this narrative.The author forgoes some of the traditional limitations found in the vampire genre such as the crucifix, holy water, and garlic, creating her own world where images on reflective surfaces are allowed. The outrageously powerful vampires have telepathy and the eldest can perform telekinesis and spontaneous combustion on the younger vampires, abilities I've not encountered in other works. I believe having certain restrictions on the undead brings some balance to the victims yet the novel isn't as much about the conflict between vampires and humans as it is about internal turmoil.Thank you."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I consider this novel just a simple follow-up to the Blackwood Farm story. I have never read any of the Mayfair books, but I know that Rowan and Michael are the main characters in that series, so I found interesting to know about them trough Blood Canticle.I really doesn't think that this is a good novel. Even when is not as bad as Blackwood Farm, it fails in a very strong point: you never fall in love with any of the characters, and Lestat's commitment with Mona's quest only tells me that he has a lot of free time. The Taltos being part of this story doesn't make it interesting at all.It seems to me that Anne wrote this book (and Blackwood farm also) only because she was trying to force even more the Mayfair family into the Vampire Chronicles. Te idea of witches turning into vampires is good, but Anne really fells short on exploding the capabilities of a witch vampire. In Merrick, the Talamasca menaced Lestat with starting an open war because of the Merrick's affair. Now, Mona is a vampire, too, and it seems that the Talamasca forgot it's former anger. And Louis, my favorite character from Anne's books, have received Lestat's (and David's) full strenght, and Anne hasn't exploded this point at all. Please Anne! Bring us a really interesting vampire novel, not the strange things you have done in the past few books!Also, I'm a little curious about how fast do Anne Rice's characters fall in love with each others. In Blackwood Farm, Tarquinn falls in love with Mona as soon as he first knows her. Same thing happens here with Lestat, who falls in love with Rowan in less than a few seconds. Generally speaking, falling in love usually takes some time, don't you think? I think that maybe this is the only way Anne can make a romantic novel out of a vampiric one.A final note: I am mexican, and also a christian, and I don't know what to think about all the references to Saint Juan Diego. I will only say that Anne did a good research on Juan Diego and the Blessed Mother of Guadalupe's tale."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I was really excited when I heard that this book was coming out. I have enjoyed all of the new Vampire Chronicles, but I was always vaguely dissatisfied with them because they didn't feature Lestat very heavily. &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; features him of course, but the Lestat featured in &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; doesn't seem very much like the Lestat of old. The Lestat in &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; wasn't very much like the Lestat of old either.I hestitate to say that I was disappointed in this book, but it didn't keep me as enthralled as the other Vampire Chronicles have. There wasn't a whole lot of suspense, and the style that the book was written in definitely didn't seem like the Anne Rice style that her fans have become accustomed to. It was very breezy, loose, and the language that was used made it seem like the book was written for an eighth grader instead of an adult. What has happened to the intelligence, the sophistication, the intricate plots, the suspense, the keen detail, and the character conflicts that Anne Rice used to write? I really hate to say it, but &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is just a bit of fluff fiction that seems like it was written by a rookie writer just making her debut instead of the engaging, interesting, and mysterious writer that we all know Anne Rice can be. There is also no mention of what is going on with Louis, Armand, Marius, or any of the others in this book. Their names are mentioned only in connection to events that happened in Lestat's past, so you won't get to catch up with any of the other vampires in this book. I was especially disappointed by that because after I had read &quot;Merrick&quot; I really hoped that Louis would show up in this book and we would hear more about how he is coping with the stonger vampire powers that he received at the end of that book. You don't hear anything about what has happened to Louis lately at all.I'm not saying that you won't enjoy this book if you read it; it was nice to catch up with the Mayfair family and Lestat again, but you should prepare to be shocked at the drastic change in writing style that you will encounter when you read Blood Canticle. I know I was. Any fan of Anne Rice and the Vampire Chronicles/Mayfair Witches series should pick up this book and read it, but you should remember not to expect too much. This book won't really make you think, but it won't leave you with a ton of questions either (as most of her books do). 3 stars"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Frankly, I think all of you who gave this novel one star suck. I think you suck because you're expecting a writer to live up to what *you* want. That's not what writing is about. Frankly, I've been amazed to see Anne churn out all these vampire books for so many years. The quality of the writing comes and goes, but for me they have not been her best works anyway. They're written to appease the masses and for once the masses aren't appeased. So what? Does that make her less of an author? No.Is every Dickens a masterpiece?Did Shakespeare really write all those plays with his name on them? (No!)My introduction to Anne Rice was The Witching Hour when I was eighteen years old. Following that, I read the other two in the series. I was enchanted, simply enchanted, and hooked on this writer who was brilliant. I can't remember which of her books I read next, seriously. I tried to keep up with what she was putting out between 93-2002 or so, and I think I did a fairly good job. However, I also went and read the things she wrote under pseudonyms. In fact, I think I read them before starting with the vampires.I read the Beauty series. I thought I was going to pass out, they were so good and I was ecstatic there were three of them! I couldn't guess what happened next, and she so thoroughly pulled me into the world she'd created that I was in love.Then, I read Belinda. There just aren't words for Belinda. I love that story. I love it with all my heart. It charmed me, it made me cry, it touched a little girl part of me that always wanted to be rescued (and loved) and never was.Exit to Eden. I was in lust with Exit to Eden. I've read it several times (that's saying a lot because I don't usually read books more than once). The twists and turns of the plot, the realism of the worlds she created, the emotional rawness of the characters and the way that rawness intersected with their sex lives.Then, finally, I came across one that was very old. One that no one really talks about, much. Cry to Heaven. It not only introduced me to subject matter I knew nothing about, but enthralled me. I wanted to know more, I wanted to learn more, I was inspired. I ate that book greedily and I still cry, like all of you vampire fans, that there wasn't more.In my opinion, all of these novels surpass the recent vampire novels in quality and depth. The depth of the characters, the depth of the plot, the emotional realism.In todays economy, the author is responsible to the fans, like it or not. So you've had your vampire novels, they keep coming. Now you want to cry because the last one, the end of the series no less, wasn't good enough for you. What about all the ones you absolutely loved? Weren't they *enough*? Weren't they enough of an achievement for any writer?I believe that in some ways Anne has stunted her growth as a writer by continuing to cover old territory. She's done that for a while. I think she probably has done it for the fans, for the people who love the vampires. Even if that wasn't the prime motivation, it factored in.I don't care if you want to knock her for the personal things she's got going on in her life. It really doesn't matter to me. What matters to me is her evolution as a writer. That hasn't been happening with the vampire series for some time now. I want to see more of Anne, not more of what her fans want to see."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Thanks to the accomplished voice of David Pittu the latest in the list topping Vampire Chronicles from Anne Rice simmers with suspense. The multi talented Pittu who excels not only as a voice performer but as actor, director, writer and teacher easily inhabits this world of vampires and witches. His reading is made all the more powerful by thoughtful use of pauses and inflections - superb listening!With Lestat as the narrator &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; begins where &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; concluded. The wicked one whom we all came to love is now, would you believe, a seeker of good - not just good but he aims for sainthood. Quite a switch.Characters include many from Rice's previous works, all finely knit into the tale. Beloved of Quinn Blackwood Mona Mayfair returns to Blackwood Farm to die. Her demise is circumvented by Lestat who makes her vampire. Rowan Mayfair, a top neurosurgeon and witch, arrives intent upon seeing Mona. We will learn that she and Mona have much in common - all involving the murkily mysterious Taltos (an unearthly ancient race who resemble humans although not very much).Ms. Rice seems to have had a fine time imagining &quot;Blood Canticle,&quot; sparked by a kidnaping, rife with romance and adventure. Listeners will have a fine time, too."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This wasn't my favorite of the Chronicles, but that doesn't mean anything. Notice the four stars. I think Interview is my favorite, but probably next is Memnoch, which I take it from the opening chapter of this book is not a popular opinion. I don't agree with many of the ideas presented in Memnoch; in fact I probably agree with almost none. What I do like is to read about a dynamic character in an interesting setting. Lestat is dynamic, and yet also always true to himself. After a trip to Heaven and Hell, wouldn't you have to make a decision?I shot through Blood Canticle just as fast as I did all the other Chronicles. Hardly stopped the whole way through. And Lestat didn't disappoint me. And he's changed. Witness the end, the way it ends with Rowan. No spoilers, but it was right."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have no idea where the lot of you get off with the blatant bad-mouthing you've been doing. That isn't criticism, it's slander. I loved this book just like I adored every single book in the series. I was horrified when I found out that this book was undergoing such a barrage of insults. Not only that but I am very proud of Anne for coming here and telling you presumptious pseudo-intellectual braggarts what was up. It made me love her even more. Anne, you are a goddess.This book was marvelous. I would highly reccomend buying it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I think my comments above say it all. This is probably the most boring/useless of the Vampire Chronicle books. Spend your time/money on something worth while...this isn't it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I just finished re-reading Blood Canticle by Anne Rice. I get it now. How all the threads come together. It's actually quite beautiful.If you understand Memnoch the Devil as the midpoint in the series's development... and connect the parallel's between the various threads... It's actually kind of amazing. For example Quinn and Mona are the new Louis and Claudia. Even now Lestat hasn't quite perfected his existence but he... approximates. How much he's improved himself and his life.It doesn't quite tie up the individual stories for all the characters she's introduced to us over the years, which means it can never pass the fanboy test. It doesn't come to plot closure but it does come to thematic closure. The combinations of faith, love, evil, alienation and grief that she's been working out in the series are honed to their clearest point. The progress of her soul as represented by Lestat has gone about as far as it can with these characters.I will admit that I found the early sections of the book where Lestat was ranting at the audience, claiming he would present us with a more direct tale while portraying all the self-consciousness of the most pretentious of post-modern novelists... annoying as all hell. However, I forgive her, and him, for it as it's clear to me some of what she was setting up with that."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This series should've stopped several books ago. How many people can Anne make into vampires and then force us to endure listening to their angst as they come to terms with enjoying that ultimate vampire orgasm which is drinking someone's blood? How many more side characters can she stretch out into full stories?My biggest disappointment was the \\"love\\" story between Rowan Mayfair and Lestat. It was unconvincing and contrived. One of the nicest parts of the Witching Hour was the romance between Michael and Rowan, which Anne proceeded to destroy in subsequent Mayfair books.This is a tired, tired series. Try doing a sequel to The Mummy, Anne."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I was a big fan of Ms. Rice's books for a long time. Blackwood Farm was the first vampire (or Mayfair witch) novel that I didn't love. Actually, she had been declining for a couple of books before that, but it was in Blackwood that I noticed the sharp drop in quality, which only drops even further with this book.Now, I know that Ms. Rice was going through a hard time. Her husband died, she found out she had diabetes, etc etc.If Ms. Rice had said to her fans (via her website or otherwise) 'You know what, I'm just dealing with a lot right now, so I'm going to take a break from writing' or some such, I'd have supported her one hundred percent. It would have been completely understandable.But no. For whatever reason, Ms. Rice decided she wasn't going to write more vampires since she found Jeebus all over again and is now gonna write Christian tripe, so she thought she'd end the Vampire Chronicles/Mayfair witches with this book that brings them together. Normally, this idea would excite me.But this book left a sour taste in my mouth. Everyone has become flat and cardboard. Mona, Rowan, Lestat are all shadows of their former selves. And Taltos being the prisoners of drug dealers? PUH-LEEZE.Anne Rice has a ego that nobody would envy. I don't know what was worse, this book or Twilight. NO ONE is above the editorial process. When I write, I thrive off feedback and critique. No one can consider themselves 'good' at anything unless they are willing to admit to themselves that there is always room for improvement. And this is only exacerbated by the declining quality in her work... writers often get better, not worse.It is a huge shame that the Vampires and the Mayfair Witches had to end like this. A crying shame, really."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I wish I could say that it didn't deserve any stars, but this review format won't allow me that luxury. A gold star for effort I suppose.I want to know what happened to the Vampire Chronicles. They were amazing at first, true works of art that transformed my idea of vampires forever. But then they started to decline. That is, they started to decline once the witches were introduced.But I'm here to write about Blood Canticle, aren't I?Well, I still want to know what happened. It used to be that Lestat could contemplate for pages on end, but now there is never a page that doesn't have some half-hearted dialoge! What happened to the rich history and beautiful description?And, above all, what happened to all the old characters? The old coven that made me love these books more than any other horror novel?I miss the Chronicles. I miss them alot."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I believe this will go down as my least favorite of the Vampire Chronicles. How disappointing to find that the book held little interest to me after the first few chapters, especially when I could barely put Blackwood Farm down once I started it. I guess my expectations were so much higher than they should have been. I expected a lot more from one of my favorite authors. This book picks up immediately after Blackwood Farm ends and goes off into a lot of repetition which I assume is for those readers who did not read the The Witching Hour, Lasher, and Taltos. If you're an Anne Rice fan than you more than likely read them all so this one was boring and repetitive...and had me wishing the book would move along to something new and exciting. It never got to that point. It's ending was as disappointing as it's beginning."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Let me start off by saying the story wasn't so bad, it was the execution of the story that was terrible.I was thrilled to see that Lestat played a major role in this story, until the dialog kicked in. He sounds like some metro, gangsta, surfer knock-off. He actually says \\"dude\\" all too frequently. Please.The story actually does a decent job tying the Mayfair Witch/Vampire scene together. It revolves around Quinn Blackwood and how he is struggling to deal with his fresh mortal life and his new vampiric existence. But, again, let me say that for the first time in any Rice book, Lestat killed it. I could not get passed the random, rambling soliloquy that popped up everywhere.Sorry, this one didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've read every one of Anne Rice's novels, and have graciously accepted Lestat being &quot;reborn,&quot; but I can not accept Lestat becoming such a bore. The Brat Prince is now just a brat. Blackwood Farm deserves a classier follow-up. I miss the great storytelling author who wrote &quot;The Witching Hour.&quot; What happened?"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Religion, like a parasite, not only infected our politics but also our beloved Vampire Chronicles. In Interview, Lestat was a short-sighted sociopath with little caring beyond his own nightly needs. in The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned, Lestat was given a more noble personality in order to be the main character. All three books were some of the best ever written on the genre. Louis, Lestat, Armand, Marius were all powerful, multi-layered characters who kept you turning the pages.Back to reality, Anne, found religion, and in it, she sacrificed her Vampire Chronicles for her imaginary friend Jesus. Lestat finding religion would be like Michael Corleone finding work as an FBI agent. Now, what peoples' beliefs are, are their business. But murdering the series which, let's call a spade a spade, took you from a studio apartment to a becoming a multi-millionaire does seem somehow wrong and distasteful. Much like how Bob Saget continuously slams the show Full House, I would like to approach him and ask him that if he feels like that why don't he give back all his royalty checks.IWTV, TVL and QOTD were and still are great books. TOTBT is the first descent into being 2nd class but that is expected with any series. What else could be done after QOTD besides explain the stories of Marius and Armand which would be almost a redo of TVL. But turning the chronicles into an outlet for christianity is the ultimate slap in the face and a gross departure from the atheist origins that IWTV implied.Anne, I don't pray to any fake Gods, but this book inspired me to pray that when YOU mature and drop the religious fanaticism, perhaps you'll write a real last Vampire Chronicles conclusion, first chapter being an apology to the fans for the last several books and reboot the series after QOTD or TOTBT.Until then, hopefully we can count on Tom Cruise to make a long-rumoured sequel TVL or TOTBT and one can only hope Anne Rice isn't involved in the creative process because I don't trust her enough not to butcher her older work with offensive religious overtones."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Since May, I've counted down te days until this novel was released. Blackwood Farm looked like the series was improving in quality a little. Since Blood Canticle is supposed to be the FINAL book having to do with the vampires and the witches, I figured that I would have an understanding and closure of the destiny of a good number of the characters in the series accompanied by a DECENT story line. Is that to much to ask?....Apparently, it is. The book itself is narrated by Lestat and appparently his ego of wanting to be good and a saint has taken up the ENTIRE book. The story line seemed ok, so I still had my hopes on it, which for its potential and for Lestat's intro which was really funny gets two stars. The following factors prevent this book from getting 5 stars.1. There is NO way that anyone could include everything in the series in 304 pages of reading material. There were still TONS of questions that I was asking at the end. Which leads to....2. Where have all of the vampires gone? The ONLY vampires present in the action of the story are Lestat, Mona, and Quinn (i really don't like him), and VERY LITTLE Maharet and Khayman. Well, others are mentioned but only like &quot;ooohhh i wonder where someoneso is? or I remember someoneso and I did this together. It's kind of a lazy way to include characters like that. I was expecting something like Queen of the Damned, which was good at including everybody in.3. Do we really need to rehash every bit of the Mayfair story? Rowan and Michael (some of the Mayfair Witches) meet Lestat and tell &quot;a little&quot; about themselves. It is a little expected that readers of this book are familiar with the basic plots of what hapened in the Mayfair series since this book CONCLUDES BOTH the vampire and the witches. I don't mind it that much except that it leaves VERY LITTLE time to explain and flesh out the subplots from the book and left me unsatisfied.4. Why do a lot of the Mayfairs seem whiny, weak, or cruel? The way that ALL of them are portrayed in the book made me wonder whether some moody pod people kidnapped the characters from the original series. What was with Mona and Julien?5. How if you're not sober do you come up with the concept of the mystical Taltos people being kidnapped by drug lords? I almost through the book against the wall at that.6. Finally, do we really NEED that much description over trivial things. Instead of saying the beautiful jewelry box, it'd be like the beautiful, green, ornate, cool, awesome, ribbon strung....blah blah.....jewelry box. Really annoying, huh?Well, in conclusion, I really had false hopes with this book and for people who still think the next book will explain everything missing, think again. THIS IS THE LAST BOOK. No more. Both series started with sooooo much potential. Sad to say that this book does very little justice to both series or the anticipating fans. If you want to know how much potential the series had, read or reread in both series The Witching Hour (Mayfairs) and Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the Damned (Vampires) Now that's good reading."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I thought it couldn't get worse than what I consider the worst three books in this series- Queen of the Damned, The Vampire Armand and Merrick. I was very wrong.I'm in the minority of people who actually kind of liked Blackwood Farm. It was a little ridiculous, and maybe the marriage of the The Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches series could have been handled- or not handled- much better. But the main problem I've had with this series since Queen of the Damned is that there are too many whiney characters who all seem very alike and constantly talk in long boring dialogues about how miserable (Armand) and/or good looking they are (Lestat), or, worse, about religion (Armand, Lestat, et al). So, I had some hope coming into the final book that some of these issues might be resolved since Blackwood Farm seemed to eliminate a few of them.Rice does not \\"resolve\\" these issues. Instead, she completely eliminates any semblance of these characters' original personalities and replaces them with whiners, and, most horribly of all, a repentant Lestat who uses grimace-inducing, self-aggrandizing slang almost constantly and, although he refers to himself every few pages as \\"wicked,\\" has lost all of whatever \\"wickedness\\" he was supposed to possess. Instead he's a simpering wannabe saint who touts very obviously Rice's own (stupid) beliefs about a good many things.What's more, the new characters are extremely brittle and two dimensional. Rowan and Michael Mayfair might as well have not existed in this novel. For no apparent reason, Lestat falls in love with Rowan. I can't tell you how many scenes consist of Lestat and Rowan staring longingly at one another. Rowan also constantly cries. Surprisingly, the character I found most entertaining was Mona Mayfair, but naturally, as with almost all of Rice's female characters, she gradually degenerates into a constantly-crying, tortured whiner. Oh, wait, that's all of the characters. Never mind.Those are the plot problems. Let me get into the writing itself. At one point, Rice uses FIVE- count 'em, FIVE !!!!! exclamation points. She also frequently uses several question marks. Why is this? Is she feeling the pressure of an aged series and wanting to make it \\"younger?\\" I know plenty of young people who are familiar with simple grammatical rules. There are also the usual problems with her later books- many completely pointless scenes, needless repetition, the incessant use of words like \\"beautiful\\" and the jarring and clumsy erotic scenes that usually come off as just sort of awkward.Then, there's the Anne Rice Classic, where some characters are involved in a big event, and on the next page, DIRECTLY AFTER YOU'VE READ THIS ENTIRE EVENT, mind you, all of the characters sit around and talk about it, recounting it word for word.Now, considering all of this horror, you'd think it would be a long book, wouldn't you? But no, it is not. It's fairly flimsy. I cannot comprehend how a person can go from writing something as rich and dark as Interview with the Vampire, Tale of the Body Thief or even Blood and Gold to...this. It's awful. I frankly wish I wouldn't have spent the two dollars on it that I did."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved every book in this series up to Blackwood Farms and this book, both are filled with pedantic drivel. If you like to read 10 pages about a little old lady's shoes, or how wonderful said woman thinks it is that her grandson is bi-sexual, then this is the book for you! I'm sure Rice will just think I don't get it, or understand the complex, artistic nature of her book, and who knows she might be right. Either way, not many people liked it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This was the last thing I ever thought I be doing. Giving an Anne Rice book, least of all a Vampire Chronicles book, one star.There really isn't a God...Anne, dear Anne. I've followed your writing for so long. The VC books have captivated and fascinated me for years. When I found out that The Blood Canticle was the last book, I was upset. Devestated. Horrified. Frightened. Then hopeful. Hopeful that perhaps this one would feature all of the old Coven. You all remember them, right? Anne had kind of ignored them for a long time.I hoped for Louis, Armand, Marius, Daniel, Padndora, Gabrielle, and any other old Vampire that ever surfaced in this series. But, low and behold, I didn't see any of the Vampires that I loved.In fact, I didn't even see Lestat.No. No Lestat. No Brat Prince that I had adored for so long. Instead, there was 'Saint Lestat', a pseudo-Lestat hellbent on being good. He wrote fragments, used all capital letters for several words, verbally attacked his devoted readers, said \\"Yo\\" and \\"shove off\\", and somehow lost all of the poetic sayings like \\"Savage Garden\\" that he had once so freely written.No paragraph exceeded six lines. I seem to remember several paragraphs going on for a whole page.Where were all the elaborate sentances? The description? The heart-felt dialoge. In all the other books, no one ever spoke. So when one of the Vampires actually decided to talk, you knew it was important. In the Blood Canticle, the pages are rife with frivolous coments about how Mona's calfs look great in high-heels.I think I read that Anne stopped using an editor after Queen of the Damned.I think she needed thirty to save this book."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"The thing about Anne Rice is that when she gets it right (Vampire Chronicle 1-3, The Witching Hour), her books are extraordinary. That it makes it all the more disappointing when she gets it wrong, as she does with Body Thief, Memnoch, Taltos, and , Blood Canticle. The biggest disapppointment is the language of the story -- Ms. Rice has (sometimes), a wonderful gift for language, but her lush and elegant prose is compleletly missing from this latest effort. The story itself is weak, and previously engaging characters are either missing, or curiously lacking in personality. I hadn't read her books in a while, but happened to pick up Blackwood Farm, and was intrigued by Quinn and reminded why I liked Anne Rice in the first place. I went back and read Merrick, and was eager to see where the story would now go. Unfortunately, it doesn't go anywhere. As this is the consulsion of two series, I wanted to know what happened to old favorites like Louis, and was keen to see more of Quinn and my old favorites Rowan, Michael. Unfortunately, Louis isn't mentioned, Quinn is reduced to the role of lovesick puppy/useless sidekick, and Rowan and Michael, and even Lestat feel like one-dimensional and flat caricatures, rather than fully-devloped characters. Lestat and Mona are also less sympathateic and engaging that they have been in previous books. And not that believability is the hallmark of an Anne Rice novel, but the Taltos meets the drug lords storyline seemed was a bit much to swallow even when you suspend belief as you turn the first page. All in all, an unsatisfying conculstion to two storylines that both began with so much promise."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I ask beacuse it couldn't possibly be Anne Rice...she who wrote so brilliantly in the earlier Vampire Chronicles. I honestly wondered as I struggled through ENDLESS fragmented sentences and \\"flashes\\" (meant to entice readers who have never read her books to buy another to get the \\"full story\\"- hopeless, beacause if this is the only book of hers you ever read, I can't IMAGINE anyone wanting to read another ) who was writing this trash. Blood Canticle contains every possible mistake that a writer can make: bad prose, stupid, melodramtic dialog, and a complete disregard for the characters personalities that readers have come to know over the years. Honestly, if Lestat had said \\"yo\\" or \\"cool\\" one more time, I would have been certain that the manuscript was meant to be on the reject pile and a dreadful error was made at the publishing house. (Actually I'm positive of it!) If this is the best she can do, I'd say it's a blessing that this is the last Vampire book she plans to write. (...)"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Yes, yes. We've read the articles about your assertions of your narcissism, which are within characer.

Are you going to run some full page newspaper ads again?But you're making an idiot of yourself. Your recent comments don't play to a broad audience. Please stop whining and write something decent."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I agree that reviews should not be mean spirited or slanderous. I wouldn't dream of saying that it was not Anne Rice who wrote \\"Blood Canticle\\". It is clear that she wrote this book. One can look at the huge downward slope of her novels, to see that \\"Blood Canticle\\" is the absolute bottom of the barrel. Yes, taste is subjective, and you have the right to like anything that tickles your fancy, but I have the right to dislike it.Mrs. Rice doesn't seem to think that it's possible to not like this \\"book\\" because it's just simply really, really, really bad. Instead, she says that basically she is a great, great talent and that \\"we just don't get it\\". Well, maybe if she put aside her enormous ego, she might realize that some of us really do get it. I got it from the first sentence. It's an awful \\"book\\". You can make lame excuses all you want, but nothing excuses bad writing. \\"Blood Canticle\\" reeks of nothing more than a case of fulfilling a contractual obligation. I won't go through the trouble of dissecting the \\"book\\", because it's clear that the author was troubled with plot development (I mean drug overlords and Taltos?) or character development (massacre). But, there is justice as it is apparent to me that more and more people are getting it: her novels fall off of the bestseller list like a rock and her print runs have been dwindling steadily since \\"Servant of the Bones\\". Maybe Anne, you don't get it. Perhaps, Ms. Rice should look towards a successful peer like Stephen King. Mr. King manages to be quite prolific and not descend into blithering drivel.Anne says that she is above being edited. I cannot remember when I have heard a more egotistical comment in my life. If her words were \\"polished\\", there wouldn't be plot and character inconsistencies that a Hummer could drive through. Thankfully, I didn't pay for this tripe. I will NEVER purchase another Anne Rice book, and I will make sure that I tell every single person that will listen to do the same."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I cant agree more with all other disappointed fans out there. When i read The Vampire Lestat i knew Anne Rice was going to be my favourite writer. I loved queen of the damned, tale of the body theif and then mamnoch came out and i was like, what was that all about. Still the chronicles that followed kept me interested. Blackwood farm and Blood Canticle had nothing to do with the series and what we had been reading earlier. A BIG BIG disappointment this one. When Merrick ended i thought the story will take a new turn secially with the unexpected threat from the Talamasca.The chronicles had so much potential Rice could've continued with them forever, but this was really low. Yes like other readers i also want to know what became of Louis who really started it all. And why was Lestat without companions in this book so pathetic when he managed to bring everyone together so long ago. He has both his fledglings David and Louis both faithful to him but oh.. they were forgotten in the last book werent they???. I didnt like the Mayfairs or the Taltos crap.This is not how it should end and for most readers it didnt end at all. What can be worse.. this book wasnt even scary. Why did Lestat fall so stupidly in love with Rowan. Suddenly Lestat the magnificent has developed so many weak points in his personality. No he was not like Louis, Louis has a reason to mourne or whine, Lestat was whining for no obvious reason. Really Rice should consider writing another one to end it decently. Her fans deserve this much!!!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have read almost every book of The Vampire Chronicles of Anne Rice. I think \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" is the best book of the series and I waited patiently for the return of the phlegmatic Lestat. And he has returned, only in this book he sounds as if Anne Rice hopes that nobody ever will ask her again to write about Lestat. He sounds like a vampire who does not believe in himself anymore, doesn't take himself very seriously. And therefore the reader is not taken very seriously.I have believed in Lestat, had hope even and the belief that he existed, but now I know that Lestat is dead, just as the writer of the book wanted to achieve. Lestat is dead. I hope she never writes about him again."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Blood Canticle is by far the most stripped down raw and honest installment of The Vampire Chronicles. I have read them all dozens of times. I am not sure where all the hostility towards this novel comes from all I can offer are my own insights.Spoilers:This novel starts with an interesting open. Its a glimpse of where our narrator (in this case Lestat) is currently at heart and soul wise. Brilliant open really curious insight into his mind. Sometimes I think that since its been so long since we the reader have heard from Lestat, well I think this could really sum up this novel in a whole, but I truly feel that the Lestat some had in their minds ceased to be once Memnoch reached its end. Since that point there have been glimpses of Lestat in other novels but not the man himself. I guess overall the audience who found this novel tough to digest were angered maybe because there was no answer to what happened to him during his slumber. As for the open lots of wonderful moral questions and solutions that could be found if only Lestat could become a Saint, themes to play out and the stage is set for a novel (whether you liked it or not)we did not see coming. Again this did not surprise me character wise and I am kinda surprised that the hater audience for this novel latched on that idea so much. Do you all not remember Lestat as a human long ago wanting to be a priest? Its almost like it never happened I know it was so long ago but I laugh at the notion that this novel lacks character development.On the subject of Character development. I should say that for the first time I could recall the mortals in this story far outweigh the immortals, which I found to be a breath of fresh air. I loved all the characters that emerged from Blackwood Farm and was happy to see them again. As for the development of the Mayfair's that was brilliantly handled by Anne Rice. What a treat it was so revisit them again, Michael and Rowan (who I love the most of the whole Clan Mayfair) and Dolly Jean, Uncle Julien, Stella and of course the roving harlot herself Mona and Mona of course still dealing with the effects of the Taltos ironically becomes a thing apart from humanity much like the Taltos she birthed so long ago.There are several intense short brilliantly written chapters in this novel one of my favorite being Lestat in the hotel room with the drunken woman waiting for the hit man. Pure brilliant writing short and brutal and beautifully written. The other is Lestat speaking of his love for Rowan Mayfair. Very intense writing there.The long and short of Blood Canticle is this.Its been more then 30+ years of Vampires and Witches. The two central characters of both worlds fall hopelessly in love with each other. And never has love felt so helpless in reading of a Anne Rice novel? The choice Rowan and Michael made to not go into the unknown at the end of Taltos lead to Rowan going to Lestat at the end of Blood Canticle. All of the horrid choices Lestat made over the years lead to him not giving in to Rowan, is Lestat redeemed for not giving in? Has his Saintly being finally shown thru? Is Rowan more then ever reinforced in her quest to right all her wrongs? We will never know, and honestly that does not bother me. That's where this tale really resides, in the unknown. It doesn't bother me that we never knew what happened to Lestat during his waking sleep. There are hints, glimpses but that is not what this story was about. To me Blood Canticle is about Love, spiritual love, love of the Earth love of what you cant have, Love of what you hope to be. A pure shame that so called fans only want complain about their personal wants not being met. We often forget as fans, as devoted as we are we really forget this is not ours. The creation belongs to the creator, we pay for the privilege to read along for the ride. And money well spent I love this book. Its my fave right behind The Vampire Lestat and The Witching Hour."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"With this book Rice completes her sad transformation from compelling gothic author to melodramatic hack. There have been many times over the years when I've wanted to throw an Anne Rice book across the room, but the sheer fascination of her mythos kept me coming back even through the most deadly books (of which Servant of the Bones is a prime contender). With her last book, Blackwood Farm, the writing was as purple and crammed with descriptions of furniture, clothing and architecture as ever, but after the first 100 pages of breathless description she took off with a story that was hilarious in its kitchen-sink, anything-goes byzantine plot. It may not have been good, but it was a juicy read. However, with it's follow-up, Blood Canticle, Rice has turned in what is probably the worst book of her career, and a pathetic close to the Vampire and Mayfair Witch sagas. The fact that she hasn't allowed an editor to change one word of her writing is a strong clue that she takes her dross for gold, but this tripe seems like the thinnest gruel of fan fiction. If there were such a thing as a Anne Rice drinking game where you did a shot for every time you read someone refer to another character as &quot;darling&quot;, &quot;dearest&quot;, &quot;beloved&quot; or &quot;my love&quot;, her readers would all be in alcoholic comas. The woman can't write dialogue, and really never could...the difference is that she used to know it and restrict herself to narrative. Now, we get diatribes about the infallibility of the pope(!) and Lestat's babble about how he wants to be a saint. Demented claptrap! I'd have to agree with those who found the first 3 Vampire chronicles, along with Witching Hour and Lasher, to be Rice's finest inventions. Rice has stated recently that she no longer wants to write about her Vampires and Witches, and for those of us who care about the once fascinating brood this can only be long overdue news; the author has turned on her children and defiled them and their story in what seems clearly a delusional belief in her writing skill and voice. Better she should retire now, for she ran out of things to say a LONG time ago. RIP!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Yes, they're hers but she gave them to us and I have the right to be disappointed. Any artist that abruptly changes something good that they've already created- the fans have a right to react. It's unhealthy to believe that any human being is infallible. You can be loyal to someone and still admit they have faults. Don't be afraid to speak up, you have voices, and you have the right to have an opinion other than absolute love for everything someone has done simply out of blind loyalty for what had once been glorious. Yes, Anne Rice is an artist. Yes, she's a genius but let's face it, kids, once she signed that fifteen million dollar contract that got her pushing two or three books out a year she dropped the ball. I'm an Anne Rice fan but I'm not afraid to say she made a mistake. Okay! She made a mistake. It's all right. It's not the end of the world. You're allowed to dislike something an artist creates. You can like a dozen movies by one director but if one doesn't sit right with you, that's okay. It's okay to admit she's wrong. I am a fan of Anne Rice. I adore the first three vampire chronicles (the trilogy as someone else once called it). But I'm not afraid to admit she's dropped the ball here."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"It was excellent, it's hard to believe Anne Rice is through with the vampires. The rich, well drawn characters, need to return and hopefully, with responses from readers, she will go back and bring back our favoite vampire and his newest companions. I have read all of them, from the beginning, and have reread most, and reread Blackwood Farm before starting Blood Canticle, which I will reread. Please, Anne, more...more...bring back LeStat!Queen of the Damned was my favorite until I read Blood Canticle.I was very disappointed in the movie \\"Queen...\\", it was the longest book and was ill adapted as a story in a screenplay."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Ok, I would just like to clarify that I have not completely finished Blood Canticle. However, I was so upset by all the negative posts about this book, I had to write something before I finished it. Anne Rice is a clever writer and for anyone to say she is burned out or that she didn't even write this book is ridiculous! You can clearly tell it is Anne writing this novel, she is just bringing Lestat into modern times by switching his vocabulary. Remember, he loves humans, it's natural that he would mimick their mannerisms. I do admit that I could do without the &quot;!!!!!!!!&quot; over-exaggerated punctuations, but Anne is just doing something different. And having Lestat go on a quest to become a saint and end up being Lestat anyway, what do you really expect? Lestat is Lestat, he loves how he is and wouldn't change a thing. I would be terribly disappointed if he was redeemed and was cannonized. As for this being her last novel, you never know. Her husband died, her Lestat died with him. Maybe she will find another muse. Don't give up on Anne, and don't bash this book, she has written 25 amazing books (even if some weren't too good, I would like to see others do better) and has kept readers enthralled for years."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"It is my wont to not read reviews for books until after I've finished them. Often I find that I laugh at the vehemence of other readers over their feelings for the characters and authors they either labaste or glorify. Rarely do I find a book reviewed from such opposing poles as this one. I just had to throw my hand in.I fell in love with Lestat in 1988, when by some chance I acquired Interview from the Science Fiction Book Club at age 13. Throughout the years I followed his escapades, often devouring one of the Chronicles in the space of a day. I recall first picking up Lestat from the library and tearing through it with wild abandon in the summer of 1990. I remember thrilling at the antics of the Brat Prince through the intro for Queen Of The Damned when I borrowed it in softcover from a neighbor.Slightly disappointed as I was by Body Thief the first time I read it, subsequent perusal prior to the release of Memnoch showed a subtle power which rode me like a night hag through to the finale. Memnoch... Others seem not to understand some of the metaphorical depth there... But Faust is a tale that never grows old, and retelling old stories is stock-in-trade for all good bards. I find something new on each reading of it.The stories of the others... Armand, Pandora, and the inimitable and underappreciated Vitorio... Each brought joy to me and showed depths of character and skill in Ms. Rice... showed her growth, and the fact that she was as tired with the antics of the Brat Prince as we, her constant readers (To paraphrase Mr. King) were. I watched her find him again, fall in love with him again (as did I) in the final pages of Merrick.Sometime betwixt the reading of Merrick and the release of Blood & Gold, I tore through the lives of the Mayfair Witches... Julien will always be the icon of the consumate southern gentleman, Faust in his own way (and you know what they say... If at Faust you don't succeed... My appologies to the late lamented Mr. Zelazny). And Blood and Gold I consumed... twice in the week I purchased it. Marius ever was my favorite.Years pass... Five years have gone by and I've changed. I was in a bookstore last week and found a copy of Blackwood Farm. What the hell, I thought. So I bought it. It took me three nights to get through. After I went through and read the others once more. Yes. The Brat Prince was back. In all his glory.Yesterday at nine in the evening I started reading Blood Canticle. I finished it less than a half hour ago... 12:30 PM. Lestat's voice ringing in my ears once more... The same voice he used in his original autobiography. Changed, yes... But time changes us all. I laughed at his rant over Memnoch. Some might think it gauche, but I admire the guts it took for Ms. Rice to give us all a piece of her mind. I found myself laughing and weeping along with our hero and his companions, thrilled by the mixture of ghosts, action, and humor... Romance in the classical sense.And I smile at the idea of Saint Lestat.It is a fitting end to a long and beautiful story. Although I already find that I long for the voice of Lestat again, I accept that I will likely not again, any more than the words of Lazarus Long are likely to come to me from Robert Heinlein's grave.Nick Cave said it best:\\"And so I kissed her goodbyeSaid 'All beauty must die'And I leant down and planted a rose 'tween her teeth\\""},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have recently read all of the Vampire Chronicles and Lives of the Mayfair Witches books, and I must say that I enjoyed this book. Lestat is back at it again, along, this time, with Quinn and Mona Mayfair. If you have not read the LOTMW series, then I recommend you do so, if you want to fully understand this book. I would like to comment on a reviewer who said that Lestat is a &quot;goody goody guy.&quot; He is indeed not a goody-goody, though he indeed talks about wanting to be a Saint. After what he has been through in Memnoch the Devil, it is entirely understandable. He has seen both Heaven and Hell, and is still a little out-of-shape from his experience. Fear not, potential reader, for Lestat is still most certainly the Brat Prince, through and through. He just has his moods, and so does everybody. But again, I warn you, this book covers a great deal on the Mayfairs and the Taltos. Also, give Anne credit where credit is due. She has produced a wonderful series, the best books about vampires that I have read, and she again delivers a good book. If you have previously read the other books in the Chronicles, then it might be good to read this book."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Challenge it, then.If you must. You obviously must. Where someone can go and how someone can feel. Right, well, after having spent the last half-hour reading the reviews I'm sure you'll find below... wow, some of you really trashed this piece of work. Please explain to me... devoted fan or first-time reader... what is so terrible about someone (fine, in this case, Lestat) contemplating the mere thought of being... and let's not get carried away here... GOOD. We are surrounded by the common, reasonable debates of goodness everywhere. Are we not deserving of a little unreasonable, passionate consideration of the subject? Someone brave enough to take it to extremes? If you are not able to handle the emotional and abstract wonderings of the heart and mind... then, Anne, is not the author for you. The book. It is an artfully worded journey on the above referenced contemplation. It's strange. It's a strange situation to begin with. Isn't that what makes it wonderful? The story itself... well, so, it's sad. Yeah, crime of the century. That characters might feel something as far fetched as dissapointement and frustration and the pangs of searching and hope. You wanted the sunset. Admit it. Well, it's Lestat. Creature of the night. The sunset is bound to be complicated. And Lestat, himself... well, he loves getting a rise out of people. And I think that if a piece of work can bring forth a discussion, a questioning, a disagreement, and passions as strong as those that are clearly here... then, it was worth it's time to the world. Otherwise, if this is your first Anne Rice book, don't make it your last. This woman is alive, bold, unafraid of description and adventure. All she asks is for you to be open to the same."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book was terrible!!! I cannot stress to you how bad this book is, and I have been waiting for it for so long! I feel so cheated! Where is the Anne Rice of The Witching Hour?"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I can't believe that anyone who has ever had a passion for Anne rice books can not tell that She did not completely write this on her own. I live in lousisana and Mrs Anne Rice has been reported to very ill, besides losing her husband this past year.She has been reported to have last stages of diabetes and has been seen needing asistance with small tasks. I just wish that she isn't obligated to produce books because of her contract. So please take heart Because everyone here in the big easy knows how fragile she is"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I find it a sad thing when people feel they have to put down others to make themselves feel better. The things some have said in their review of this book are personal attacks on the author and that is wrong. If you didn't like the book, just say you didn't. Many, including me, enjoyed the book. So if you really want to help other readers, just say what you didn't like about the book and let them decide if the book is for them or not. All the childish name-calling is just pathetic."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I personally loved this book. I \\"got\\" it. Not everybody is going to, and not everybody is going to like it.

Whatever happened to common courtesy?Play nice people!!!!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Apparently everyone out there fails to recognize this book for the masterpiece that it is. Personally, I was relieved that this book brought entertainment back into the vampires' lives. Armand bored the hell out of me and then I was unfortunate enough to read Blood and Gold which seemed to me was the exact same book. My only disappointed lay in poor Merrick's fate after such a short time. If I were you, I would stop whining about Rice's writings. I thought this book a work of art, but then again I've always been fond of crossovers. Oh, and what the hell happened to Louis and David?"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved the book. I read most of her other books and they were all really good. I was not disappointed by this last book I actually enjoyed this one more than Interview with the vampire that had its boring moments."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I finished this book in one night, unable to put it down, literally. There very well may be answers that are left to speculation as some have not so eloquently put it in earlier reviews, but so what? I know I personally need things to ponder to keep my Beloved fresh in my mind. If everything was neatly wrapped up, it would leave no hope, no faith, no wonder to the Vampire/Mayfair legacies. I was completely satified and drawn into all aspects of this piece of fine artwork. This is a piece of someone's mind we are reading here...And I have read about 25 pieces thus far...We should be past the point of criticising by now. It dissapoints me to read all the negative remarks about a book so interestingly written. It is a different approach to the books of past, but it is our Beloved Lestat, Mona and Quinn and it is wonderful to be within their embrace once again."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved this novel, but the only thing I didn't like was that Rowan and Michael just kinda fell apart. They seemed so passionate in The Mayfair Chronicles, and then it was just gone. Why Anne? Why?To some of you who like to complain about Lestat being different than he was in the first three novels, have you ever stopped to think and understand that yes, it is possible for someone to grow, wether they're alive or undead? As Ms. Rice stated, she is the voice of Lestat, and she herself has grown in the years since she has written Interview with the Vampire."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"As a long-time Anne Rice fan, I was absolutely delighted with her latest tale. For years, I have longed for a merger of Witches and Vampires. Now I finally have it. And what's more, it's FUN! An exhilarating read. Well, done, Anne!(...) What on earth gave you the idea that Anne should write exactly to your specifications? How absurd! Art is art. It begs no explanation. You are entitled to your opinion, but slander is unacceptable. This book is fantasy. This book is fiction. It is not the be-all end-all of human existence or the answer to life and death's greatest questions. This book is simply a beautifully and thoughtfully woven tale of the collision of two worlds.ANNE, I am sorry you've had to deal with the foolish ravings of those who haven't the courage or the stamina to do what you do. I believe in you, I believe in your writing, and I look forward to your next book. Thank you for many, many years of gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and heart-warming entertainment. Keep it coming!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"A true Anne Rice fan...will know that this is the best so far....too bad its the last...as a 20 year fan its too bad that i will no longer read anything good from her again...she has become a born again writer..i will stick to the old ones..."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Ms. Rice has gotten so many ugly comments on this book, I have NO idea where they come from! Some people need to grow up and stop saying such nasty things. Ms. Rice has more writing talent in her little pinky finger than most authors out there put togetber. I hope she will be around for a very long time. The book was exactly what I had been expecting. Give this book a chance and do not listen to those horrible, cruel people.I am a devoted fan and will be always!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"While this book may have been short and lacking the usual poetry we have come to expect from Anne Rice it is, I feel our own fault. She states in the book that while MtD may have sold well, fans did not get it. Notice how up until Lestat's rant in the begining of BC she eluded to another book of his journeys with angels? She has realized that many fans don't seem to want to read what she wants to write. So she has written a book for the masses. She was trying to satisfy all the readers who seem to want a continuation of the story rather than her usual poetry. It is our own fault for not letting her know how awesome MtD really was. Shame on us for not supporting her when she wrote from her heart. Stan's death I am sure was a factor. But she has shown in the past the her greatest writing is done when she herself is at her lowest. It is her escape. We have no one to blame but our selves. Long live Lestat!!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"i haven't read Blood Canticle but i can't wait because i'm such a huge fan of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. I agree, Armand was just so so boring..i couldn't put myself to reading it. But wow..the reviews for Blood Canticle..i hope it isn't as bad as every one says it is. Though i would love to see Marius and Pandora back in."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Why 5 stars you ask? Well, I think we as readers sometimes fail to take everything into account. We merely read and forget to look at the literature, which we are lucky to have, as a great work of the mind. For most it is a simple escape...a fantasy. However, Anne Rice continues to stay true to herself and isn't that what we all constantly complain about...to find some author who won't be a big sell-out. She has an extensive knowledge of myth, folklore and history and she has continued time and time again to prove these books are a labor of true love. One could never accomplish these wonderous works she has given us time and again if it were merely her bread and butter. This is a really good book if you as the reader can take the time to appreciate all the labor she has dedicated herself to in order to give us intelligently written romantic horror fiction. Please take the time to take it all in and don't rush through for a small fix because she gives us a huge fix if we can find the beauty in her work once again."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is great!!And I really don't see a problem in Ms. Rice's reaction to the harsh reviews, as a matter of fact I would react the same way. Offcourse you may not like a book, but to say it in the ways you do it, that is really harsh, so who are you people to judge Anne's reply?This just makes me mad, because yes, I love all of Ms. Rice's books (exept the erotica ones I think, but I did not read them and dont intent to as well, because I know it will not be my thing) but what if I would read the erotica books? What if unlike her other books I did not liked them? I wouldn't not dislike Anne Rice's other books for that, or tell everyone to not read any more of her books like someone here said. That was a real stupid thing to say!I think Ms. Rice has a great mind and creates great story's and she has the courage to write what she desires to write, I don't see a lot of writers who dare to do that, and I truly love her boldness in the stories.I love Anne Rice's books, and none of your harsh critisms will stop me from doing so.And Ms. Rice if you happen to read this, dont worry, there are tons of ppl who love your work, as you can see by the amount of postive reviews, and you really dont need to justify yourself to these kinds of people. Though I probably would have done the same.Your real fans will love your work nontheless, like me."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"As for the Amazon service in getting me the book - they get an A+. As for Anne Rice's tale, well, she has done better. This one rambles around and fills the book with useless descriptions of New Orleans, but the story line is very weak. It is obviously an additional attempt to link the famous Lestat character with the Mayfair witches. Doesn't play well. This is one of Anne Rice's novels that could be skipped and not missed."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I recently wrote a review more of other peoples' reviews of this book. Now, I figure it's time to review the actual book, but since we can only write one review per item, I'm writing this under the paperback listing.I first read \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" twelve years ago, in the tenth grade. I have since read every Vampire Chronicle to be released. Just quickly, I'd like to say I felt the best volumes were \\"Interview With the Vampire,\\" \\"The Vampire Lestat,\\" \\"Queen of the Damned,\\" \\"The Vampire Armand,\\" and \\"Blood and Gold.\\"The other books were not quite what I've come to expect in this series, but that's not really for me to judge. Overall, it's been a wonderful series, and I truly am a little sad to see that she's closed the overall story.\\"Blood Canticle\\" was a very quick read, yet still full of her usual attention to details that give you a very good image of the characters, places, objects and events in her stories. The character development, though rapid, was ample.One of the things that has made Ms. Rice's Vampire Chronicles so interesting and engrossing has been her dealings with existence, spirituality, mortality, and other aspects of \\"human\\" life. Much of these dealings are missing from \\"Blood Canticle.\\" Almost the only thing I saw throughout this book was a dealing with lust. However, lust has been explored, in depth, and at great length, many times throughout almost all her works.The one thing I saw in this story that was unique to her dealings with Lestat was his refusal to give the \\"dark gift\\" to someone with whom he is deeply in love. This is the first time he has put his selfishness, loneliness, and lust second to his desire to see a generally good person continue to do good things with the abilities and resources available to her. He has seen the work she does, and he can comprehend just how vast and promising it is. He has deemed this far more important than his own needs and wants.This ability to put the needs of others before one's own is an absolute must for anyone to be deemed a saint. Perhaps Lestat took the biggest step he could have toward reaching sainthood.Ultimately, that's what this book was supposed to be about...Lestat's desire to become a saint. However, the story's dealing with this theme has been, until just this moment, as I write this review, seemingly nonexistent. It was never clear, as I read the story, that Lestat was doing anything in particular to achieve the goal he talked about, almost tiresomely, at the beginning of, and throughout, the book. However, I have to say that it makes me grin to think back on it now and realize that I didn't see the most saintly event in the book for what it actually was.But, since the event was treated with no more importance than anything else that happened in the story, I have to wonder, also, if Ms. Rice understood that she was giving Lestat his first true taste of sainthood as she wrote about his turning Rowan down for the dark gift, especially for the reasons he did so.This is the end of the Vampire Chronicles, as has been mentioned. Its ending, however, didn't feel at all like an actual farewell, let alone like an ending to a series that has now run nearly thirty years.As books go, without considering the complete body of works in the Vampire Chronicles, it was, I feel, a decent work. Some of her works have been much better, but some have also been much worse. However, her books, in general, are still considerably better than many works several \\"renowned\\" authors have turned out over the years.This book left me wondering what the next installment of the Vampire Chronicles will be like, but, as Ms. Rice has made unmistakably clear, she is finished with this series. So, I must admit there is a bit of disappointment in this last story, because I don't feel it fulfilled the role of ending the series. But, again, as a book in its own right, it's not bad.So, I'll end in saying that, considering the fact that you can pick up hardcover copies for pretty cheap at bookstores, you wouldn't be remiss to add it to your library. If you read it and find that you didn't like the story, well, put it on a shelf anyway. You may come to a point in your life when the story will make perfect sense to you, and you will come to love it. You just can't know until it happens, but if you never buy the book and read it, you'll never have the chance to know, either. I can think of far worse risks to take than giving this book a try."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I fell in love with Rowan Mayfair in Rice's previous works, but am disappointed with her character in Blood Canticle. Poor Michael... that's all I have to say. Well, one can't be good all the time, right? I like you, Rice, & will keep on looking out for your books."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"well i do think that this book could have been better, but i think this book is better than many people give it credit for. i think that it is a good thing that she is bringing this series to an end, the only reason i say this is because i dont think there is anywhere else to go with the series. i base this observation on the fact that she had to bring in characters from her mayfair series to add a little something new to her stories. however, in this book i would have found it a little more enlightening if i had read the books concerning the mayfair family. she tries to give the reader a quick rundown of events that pertain to this story but i think there is too much history and story to condense into one chapter. i think that as a character lestat has had his day in the sun, and that it is time to put him to rest. he is his same old character in this one and dont get me wrong i still like his persona but i feel there is nowhere else for him to go as a character, i mean the guy now wants to be a saint, to me this is reaching a little bit. as far as the other characters go in this book, i genuinely like mona mayfair. she kinda reminds me of lestat when he was just a fledgling. the girl has a fire inside of her and a hearty will. but anne rice has also given her a weakness, her temper will get the best of her and cause her to do foolish things, and then she always runs crying back to lestat. this aspect i did not like about her. i had wished for quinn to have more of an active role in this book, to me he just seemed to be just tagging along with mona and lestat. this is not her best collaboration of the witches and vampires, i give that praise to her book merrick. i do not like the fact that rowan and michael mayfair are really important charactes in the book because there is too much about them and their past that the reader is not aware of, and i think that plays a large part in this story. i made reference to a tragic ending, and this is in reference to the ending of the chronicles. like other readers i would have liked to have seen some of the tried and true vampire characters emerge in the novel and play a part or at least bring a little closure to the story. i wish that she would put out a book of short stories or something just to let everyone know what has happened to some of their favorite characters. all i can say is that i am both happy and sad that the vampire chronicles are over, and hopefully her son can write some great books like his mother used to."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"There is something I feel is \\"off\\" about this boook. I started with Blackwood Farm, then worked my way through Armand, Memnoch, Blood & Gold, Tale of The Body Thief, Queen of the Damned,The Vampire Lestat..I am not sure what it is, but something tells me it's our hero, LeStat. He seems petty, trite, and comical. I dont know. I feel a bit wishy about this so far. Mona doesnt seem right either, more like a trashy teen gone wild, which she always sorta was, but at least she had a better vocabulary ! Will revise this when I finish. I guess the other books held more mystery & history.12/1/03...okay I have been finsihed this book for a couple weeks now. I will say, to quote the author from Pandora: \\" If you so cling to reason,then in the passage of time reason may fail you,and when it does you may find yourself taking refuge in madness\\" I think Ms. Rice has done exactly this. Why ? She has totally destroyed the characters that we, her readers have loved. Sorry, this book was a disappointment."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I can't believe I spent good money on this book and then reading her disdain toward all of us for not liking this s@!@ bomb is just absolutely detestable. I can't stand her now and her Cannon books are only fit for toilet paper for the homeless YOU STILL NEED AN EDITOR. I've had email conversations with her through email and you would never have thought to see her as the kind of snooty deluded witch she really is after I read her answer to those of us who disliked Blood Canticle. Even though it is deleted off of Amazon thank God someone had the presence of mind to copy and paste it and put it elsewhere on the net so those of us who were not in the know about the Real Anne Rice are now. I bet mine gets deleted too the truth does hurtYou know comparing her comparing her writing to Opera singers is a hoot she has a high opinion about herself don't you lady the sin of pride gets us all eventually.Now to my review there are so many places where this book could have gone. If I remember correctly in TVL Lestat makes a statement about what it could be like if science got a hold of his kind and there could have been this huge battle ect ect this could have been that book but did we get that a big fat NO. Instead what we get is an Undead blood sucker spewing out Pope worship and how perfect and pure the Catholic Church is a BLOOD SUCKING CORPSE!!! Of all things we get a book that should have bern called The Catholic Church for Dummies through the eyes of a Redeemed Walking Corpse. Anne your a troll on here if you read this please PLEASE don't ever write another Lestat book let him rest in peace. He has been spayed and neutured by what used to have been the greatest writer ever and i've read your Christ books you still need an editor but her ego wont allow such a thing. YEAH THANK GOD THE VAMPIRES ARE DEAD!!! Cause now those who can cut it as a writer are writing about them now. Laurel K Hamilton, Kim Harrison, Brian Keene ect ect well Keene does Zombies but still dead undead it's all the sameWhat kills me is how open ended this book is theres no conclusions to anything she teased us with a possible war between the Talamasca and the Vampires in Merrick but what do we get in Blood Canticle we get a infomercial for the Catholic Church and a horrible love story between Rowan and Lestat that went NO WHERE. She had the perfect opportunity to for Rowan to steal his blood we could have had THE ULTIMATE ENDING TO A WONDERFUL SERIES but all we got is Catholocism 101 and the Brat Prince being so out of character and sloppily developed that he was totally unrecognizable. Where was Louise and Merric and the Twins and Armand and Marius and Lestats mother you RAPED US!!! She ripped us off with no complete ending to these books and this is the last one! She is pure literature death and has no buisness ever writing a Vampire novel! She can't do it anymore she is unable too which is why she turned to Jesus so she can milch the Christians now and dress up like a 1950's reject off of Leave it to Beaver. This book was a smack in the face to her fans Oh Great and Majestic One that she is. And then berating those fans who saw MTD as the piece of junk it was at the beginning of this book shows how full of herself she really is. I really think she believes she is above criticism of any kind she really believes she's just that good and above all of us You are NOT Stephen King you don't even come close to earning that title! Hey at least Hamilton and Harrison still meet with there fans and mail out requests for signed book plates and what not all we get from The Queen is a no thank you I can't be bothered im above all of you I made my money off of you now I don't need you I only write propoganda for The Catholic Church and Jesus. Fine who needs you your book sales will finally convince you you need us again someday when you can't pay your rent in your luxury homes. You can only keep making royalties off of your past glories before that well dries out. I bet anyone here she still makes a good buck off of Beauties Punishment and Belinda that im sure she doesn't mind hypocrit that she is she doesn't want to write about so called evil things but she doesn't mind making a buck off of it and she doesn't know what she's talking about Stephany Meyer created a wonderful Vampire world and she is a very commited Christian and her Vampires actually have morals and avoid blood so YES Anne it can be done your just not capable of doing it anymore.Blood Canticle sucks stay away from it go read Circus Of The Damned or This Witch For Hire there far more deserving than this lazy limp story from a washed out deluded author blinded by her own self worth"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"About the protagonist in this particular piece of Rician fiction, it's not him.

AT LAST, we have Lestat speaking in his own voice again, and not the catatonic, or insecure, confused Lestat we've glimpsed from novels post-Memnoch, but the secure, strong, vibrant, life loving, motorcycle riding, powerful, macho, rich, witty, sexy BRAT PRINCE is back! And he's back in his full velvet frocks, dashing blonde mane, sensual french accent, and full lusting hunger for humans, my dears!! For this reason alone, the book is worth buying. But this book is about more than our favorite anti-hero, it's about the wonderful Mayfair witches, and answers the question many Rice fans have asked, \\"How would Lestat react to this dysfunctional brood?\\" She could have used Louis, she could have used David, or Marius, but she saved the best for last, and used Lestat. She chose a wonderful theme from which to introduce our hero into the 21st century, and Lestat implores us all to share in the pure FUN and joys of living in the 21st century.It's my personal opinion that there are many naysayers who have been naysaying so long, their minds are no longer open to pure entertainment. Which of course is what Canticle is... Pure entertainment. Don't look for Rice to answer any deep, philosophical questions here, for it's clear this was a pure joyride. The book has an upbeat, maniacal, life-affirming pace that many of the more \\"goth\\" Rice fans simply wont appreciate. BUt if you're a fan of the kind of book you absolutely loose youreself in, the kind of book in which one single character takes you on a ride from which you don't want to return, and if you LOVE Lestat DiLioncourt, GET THIS BOOK. DOnt even wait for paperback. Go to the library if you must, but instead of watching \\"American Idol\\" this week, meet Lestat again. He's here, and he is, as before, your every dream."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I took the time to read through a few reviews before writing my own, for the sake of not repeating what others have already stated. What a shock I found. No, this novel was not up to par compared to her early novels, but I see things differently than most of the replies out there. First of all, in real life, people grow and change depending on their experiences. So get this through your thick sculls: Lestat will not, could not possibly be like, his orginial character from book one. This is a vampire that has #1 blood in him making him stronger than almost any other (so hell yeah I would be scared of him if I was Mona, Julien, etc.) He has gone to Heaven and Hell and back. He's even lost his body. People, Vampires, change.Second, I don't know what book you all others read, but Mona was always a spoiled, brat, who was always jeolous of Rowan. Nothing changed there. The last time Rowan was in a story, she was showing signs of burn out. Anne Rice was following through with the effects of causes which occured in her previous books. Characters must change to seem believable, they don't always change the way you wish them to.Lastly, I think Anne WAS using Lestat as her voice. I would like to think she was telling Stan that she will join him when her work is done. Much like Lestat told Rowan he would come for her when her work will be done. Like I hope one day to join those I love."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I was sorely dissapointed with this book. It's the only book in the series which I didn't enjoy. While it has it's good/bad points, mostly bad, I didn't feel like it was part of the same series of books. It should have been part of the Mayfair witches series, guest starring 2 vampires! But, I respect her as a writer, and believe that no one knows the characters better than she, so it must be right. I wasn't expecting anything cataclysmic in the end, so I wasn't shocked by the ending...it left an opening for a new book, if she ever wants to pick them up in the future. Even though this book was horribly dull, &quot;slightly racist&quot;,about everything but vampires,and drenched with religion, I would still read a new book if she continued. In conclusion, die-hard fans only need read--and get it from the library, unless you're building a collection."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have read a lot of reviews that believe this book to be the worst of the vampire chronicles. While I see some of the reasons the book merits some of the criticism, I also would like to write a defense of this novel.First, Lestat's character has changed since Menoch the devil, which most fans seem to be split as to whether they liked this change or not. It is a little grating to see Lestat start with a chaotic rambling of \\"gangster\\" talk, but then again I don't think it was suppose to be permenant. In Blackwood Farm, Rice did acknowledge that Lestat still loved etiquette, as seen when he rebukes Quinn for spilling blood when Quinn tried to kill Stirling. This chaotic rambling can also be attributed to two things: Lestat is still in mourning for Merrick, and Anne Rice has (at the time of this story's creation) just lost her beloved husband Stan Rice. Stan Rice was Anne Rice's inspiration for Lestat, and perhaps with the loss of her inspiration, Rice might have meant for Lestat to appear distorted. (Rice's claim of inspiration is found in a published Houston Chronicle article.)As for the inconsistency between Lestat supposingly knowing about computers and then not knowing how to write a simple email: well I guess I do blame that on poor editing or lack of counsel.The novel is still written in Rice's magnificent writing style. There is indeed a clear beginning, middle, and end. Anne Rice's problem laid in the fact that she did not seem to find a stronger plot to merge the Vampires with the Mayfair withches. The love between Rowan and Lestat does seem to be a bit hard to believe, but then again they are both rather complex characters. Rowan's dark past seems to be paralleled to Lestat's own past, perhaps darkness seeks darkness because they understand each other. Michael is reduced to a duller and somewhat sad role, but this is not new. In the Mayfair witches triology, fans have seen that Rowan has taken him for granted by abandoning him at least twice. As for Mona's supposingly inconsistent bahavior, this is not the case. Mona's obsession with sex, computers, and immature behavior is still persistent throughout this tale.As for the role of Oncle Julien: he is a character that simply has been important and critical in the previous Mayfair triology. He played a vital role in being the ancestor of both the Mayfair witches in the Mayfair triology, and being an ancestor to Merrick who becomes one of Vampires. Merrick seems to have been the first link of fusion between the Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches.What we have here is a story that fuses three very interesting species: the Vampires, the Witches, and the Taltos. It also attempts to delve into religion's part in life itself. The reference to Saint Juan Diego is dued perhaps because he was one of the humblest saints in terms of orgin. It seems Lestat feels drawn to him because Lestat also started out with humble beginings, and since Juan Diego has attained sainthood then perhaps Lestat thinks he could also. Rice just likes to explore the afterlife in this novel, is there a heaven and hell, or is there a purgurtory-like plato like that of Quinn's twin or Oncle Julien's?The only major complain I have towards this novel is the Taltos storyline. The way that Ashlar and Morrigan (Mona's taltos daughter) ends is just hard to believe. How could they have been taken over by drug dealers of all things. I found Rice's obession with gangsters to be absurd.Perhaps it could have been written with more extravegence and a stronger plot line, but it still ends with a rather interesting and cliffhanger like ending. Much of the complain seems to stem more from ignorance of the Mayfair Triology then anything else. As a fan of the Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches, I support this story, and take it as a last gift of this marvelous series for there will apparently never be anymore of Lestat and Co. stories to be in awe of or complain about."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"To sum it up, Anne if you had not been a published writer this book would have been trashed. I can't beleive any one would pay money for this."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"It isn't often after I've read an author as long and as faithfully as Anne Rice that they can surprise me. Normally, I open their latest book like I put on my favorite shirt. Warm, comfortable, easy to relax in, but nothing startling or new. Anne Rice threw out my favorite shirt when she wrote \\"Blood Canticle\\".And I loved it.Although perhaps not her best (ask any Anne Rice fan, and they'll be more than happy to let you know what her best are), for the first time in years I saw her really taking risks as an author. Risks in voice, in style and in plot.Lestat finally had a voice! In \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" Rice descibed Lestat's narrative style as inconsistent and a cross between a \\"flat boatman and detective Sam Spade\\". And every time I've read those lines I've thought, \\"No, you don't. You sound like the same voice as 'Interview with a Vampire' as 'Witching Hour' as 'Servant of the Bones' and many other of Anne Rice's narratives.\\" In \\"Blood Canticle\\" I actually heard a new voice. A different voice. A voice peppered with pop-culture (granted perhaps not 21st century pop culture) slang and imagery. It was the voice of someone who had learned how to write from pulp fiction and the movies. From the first lines, I could sense Lestat tearing across the page--so much to express that not only his hand but his head could not keep up. It still had the richness of detail that I as an Anne Rice fan expect, but I heard--for maybe the first time--a distinct voice that was unique for the author.The risks she took in style really pleased me. The short vignettes of action and imagery were such a refreshing experience in one of Anne Rice's books. The chapters where it is pure motion--no thought, little characterization, little-to-no dialogue were wonderful and showed how much she learned in the experience of writing screenplays. For the first time she allowed action to truly dicatate the pace rather than characterization and theme, and it was a great surprise from an author with such a traditional style of story-telling.On the other hand, the chapters where she digressed to religion and other heady-matters could only have come from Lestat! None of her other characters would ever imagine we would want to know their opinions on religion and philosophy in such a direct fashion.[]As to the plot--no, it was not a typical Anne Rice supernatural yarn. I did, however, come away from this one thinking more about what had occurred than in her last several books. Yes, Lestat has changed--he's met the devil and perhaps God. He went insane for a period of years and has slowly crept back toward sanity. But who experiences a life-changing event and doesn't come out the other side a different person?Lestat's values have changed. Yes, he still loves adventure and sticking his nose in other people affairs. He still is the \\"brat prince\\" but now with a teenage daughter--a teenage daughter who gives Lestat a run for the title of \\"brat\\". A teenage daughter who happens to be a single mother. All you need do is read the last chapter and see the choice that Lestat makes to realize that values have changed for both Anne Rice and her alter ego.So, is \\"Blood Canticle\\" a book I'll go back and read time and again like other Anne Rice novels? Probably not.Am I sorry that for the final Vampire Chronicle Louis, Marius, David, Pandora and others never even made an appearance? Yes.Am I sorry she'll never tell us the \\"lost years\\" of Khayman (who has always been my favorite vampire) or the silver-legged Flavius? Absolutely.But I give her props for taking risks, trying something other than what her audience (obviously) expected, and allowing her life experiences (i.e. the death of her husband) to affect her \\"art\\". Yes, I would argue that this book pushed Anne Rice back from the brink of pop-fiction to something worthy of where she began as an artist so many years ago.So, read at your own risk. It's not typical Anne Rice fare. It's not the brat prince we knew & loved--and knew & loved to hate. But enter with an open mind and give an artist the opportunity to grow (and follow where their heart leads) and you might come away with more than you ever expected from an author's twenty-fifth novel."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"The best I can say is that it was good to finally put the wraps on a series I began reading in the late 70's when Interview came out, but it's clear MS Rice's heart was not really in this book. Probably a contractual fullfilment."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am a loyal fan of Anne Rice. I've only just started reading her books about a year and a half ago, but I feel I'll never find a more talented author.Blood Canticle is said to be Anne Rice's last novel in the Vampire Chronicles, but I can't seem to believe it. Too much is left unsaid, unresolved. Lestat is still struggling to obtain sainthood, Maharet's life story between the time she became a vampire until Queen of the Damned is still a mystery, and what has become of all the other characters that once played a prominent role in Anne Rice's magnificient novels.Even with all these questions left unanswered, she still manages to tie up a few loose ends with Mona's reunion with the Taltos and the future of Blackwood Farm.There was something that seemed a little off in this book. I felt confined while reading it. One of the things I love most about Anne Rice's novels is that each one is a journey through time from the viewpoint of a different individual. This book didn't do that. It stayed right here in the present time. Also, while reading it, you think a lot is happening but after completeing the book you realize that not too much really did. I don't like how Rowan became so weak and that her love for Michael is disappearing (Most likely because I am also currently reading the Witching Hour). Mona doesn't seem to pay that much attention to Quinn anymore either. And even Quinn himself doesn't seem to do too much in the book.All in all, it's a decent novel but I feel that it lost some of the old charm that the other novels had."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"The problem with this book, is that it's set in modern day times, and there's not a lot that we don't know about the vampires now. The story is pretty much an everyday life tale of Lestat and his latest 'coven'. Of course there is the part about the Mayfairs and the unnatural offspring, but that part wasn't all that interesting to me. I wish that Anne would write more books about new and different vampires, older vampires from different places and tell their life stories. That is the books I like the best. Lestat has already told his story, so we know all about him and his spoiled self. A life story for Mael would be nice."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've read just about everything from the &quot;Rice Collection&quot;, and this one, save the ending, was decent. The plot was nice, if a little distracted at times, but overall, it was a great read. I went through it in a little under 3 days.A bit of warning though. *possible spoiler* There isn't much of an end.And oh, to the one or ones who call the Queen of the Vampires a &quot;hack&quot;? Keep in mind what personal struggles Ms. Rice was going through, and probably still is.Great job Anne, wish you'd keep writing. Oh yeah, Memnoch was one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Our dear Lestat is back, and this time he's gotten hip with the times. (Sometimes to excess, but what can I say? It's probably intentional..) Like most of Mrs. Rice's books, this one reads through at a good clip, then allows you to go back and reread for the deeper meanings and complexities that exist in her novels. And Lestat's criticism of his &quot;Dear Readers&quot; was delightful! I laughed out loud. The plot may get a bit silly, with half human drug lords and such, but overall, our narrator ...well, narrates... with his unmistakeable style. If this is truly Lestat's last book , then by the end at least we all know that he finally did something RIGHT."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I believe that there is one true love and one true faith that never fades and it all begins with blood! Instantly, the word blood brews a preternatural primeval verve in the veins. Why, because blood is a symbol of both life and death in one fatal and final word. I was enthusiastic about reading this great novel that is both popular and literary.The words were wielded with skill and attention to detail that few other writers endeavor. As soon as you begin to read the intellectual mind asked philosophical question about the nature of evil and moral insanity. Are these creatures we call vampires truly the protagonist of the novel or should we view them as the enemy, the antagonist that should be stopped?The primary focus of the vampire chronicles in general is to perceive the vampire as the reluctant anti-hero that is a slave and an addict to his need for blood. At times the reader is made to feel both stimulated and sympathetic for the vampire main characters. Lestat is an indisputable sex symbol to some and an unassailable villain to others, the appeal of Lestat is both ruthless and rueful murder of his vampire victims. Through the kiss of vampire death he makes the victim relish the thirst for blood and live forever."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Ann is better at writing in historical settings. She is just not in touch enough with popular culture to attempt anything set in the present time. Having read all of the vampire chronicles, most of which I loved, I found myself very unsatisfied with this one. A lot of unanswered questions. Not enough character building. The newly introduced race of \\"Taltos\\", not very convincing. I put this book down about 20 pages from the end because it just fizzled out. It reads like a sketchy first draft of a third-rate novel."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"What can I say? She is my favorite author and I'm glad she's &#34;back&#34;....just playing catch up with the few I missed."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"The story itself was wonderful and highly recommended for Anne Rice fans but the editing of the Kindle version was terrible. In addition to spelling mistakes there were also quite a few instances where whole words were replaced with incorrect ones! Examples; several times the word \\"mat\\" was used when it should have been \\"that\\" and \\"dunking\\" instead of \\"thinking\\". While I could guess the correct word it detracted from the story. Not sure how the editing process works for Kindle books but someone obviously didn't do their job on this one. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book was ok. I started out liking Mona Mayfair, but by the end I couldn't stand her. Now don't get me wrong, it was nice to have the 'Brat Prince' \\"write\\" again, I think that Anne has given up on the dark side. She's gone spiritual. There's nothing wrong with that, but if you've read other books of Anne Rice's you'll notice a difference in this one. The first chapter was tedious and boring; it made me want to stop reading, right then and there! However it's a lot of babble so I skipped to chapter 2 like Lestat suggests. It does tie up the loose ends with the Taltos, which I always wondered about. I hope that if Mrs. Rice decides to do another Vampire book that she looks back to her original books. There was nothing wrong with \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" a lot of what is talked about in the first chapter, I just think that a lot of people didn't understand that she was trying to warn us that maybe we've reached the end with Lestat. This is the first book since \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" that has been written by Lestat, maybe she's out of ideas. I mean come on! How much MORE can he do? After you've been to Heaven and Hell and back, there's just not much left that seems to be so important right? I'm sure that's how she's looking at this through Lestat's eyes. So those of you criticizing Anne for being full of herself, you all are just silly! Overall the book was ok. Had its high points and low points. Not one of her best work but I will continue to keep it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am an avid Anne Rice fan. I have read and reread the Vampire Chronicles and the Witching Hour series. They are excellent. This final book, however, is very disappointing. First, Anne should be very careful when she is complaining through Lestat in the first chapter. It isn't Lestat, it's Anne, and it's obvious. I wished for so much more. I am rereading the Witching Hour just to get this book out of my mind."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Blood Canticle, the 10th and final novel in the Vampire Chronicles, is a little odd. Lestat is once again our narrator, but he starts off by chastizing the readers for not liking Memnoch the Devil, as well as the descriptive, flowery prose in the novels. He then compensates for this by speaking like a surly teenager throughout the rest of the novel (pa-lease, dude, yo, etc.). I felt this was Anne Rice's none too subtle way of saying everyone should have appreciated Memnoch and other recent chronicles that weren't receiving glowing reviews. I didn't really appreciate the message, not to mention that it was completely out of character for Lestat and an off-putting start to the book.Anyways, then we move back to Blackwood Farm where Mona Mayfair has recently been made a vampire and our real story can begin....except that not much happens. Lestat struggles with his nature and his feelings for Rowan Mayfair, Mona wants to find her Taltos baby, and Quinn is still pre-occupied with Blackwood Farm. When the action finally does get going, it has little to do with vampires and I'm not even sure how this can be considered a Vampire Chronicle, with the exception of Lestat narrating. A disappointing end to the series. Au revoir Lestat, I wish our parting could have been sweeter."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I would have rated this novel higher if it had not been the series finale. The tone of \\"Lestat\\" was all wrong. His voice and narration felt forced, the plot was OK but lack oomph, and the characters were lackluster.I ended up feeling like Rice wanted to end the series and did so in a rushed fashion. I understand that Ms. Rice's husband died around the time this novel was written. Understandably, her frame of mind wasn't in writing mode. I am not faulting her for that. I just think she should have waited until she could give the series a proper send off."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Geez...I get that feeling that I've read the same books over and over. I am still struggling with Blood and Gold, such a dozer. Merrick was substandard. Merrick who was not included anywhere in the Mayfair Witches becomes a vampire. Why tamper with something great like \\"The Witching Hour\\". It was such a great read - imaginative, piques your interest. I don't intend to buy Blackwood or Blood Canticle. And don't get me started with the \\"New Tales of Vampires\\" collection. Please, stop ruining your tremendous books, Anne. \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" gave me goosebumps...now it's just goose...."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have not read this book yet (I live in a rural town that isn't selling it- about 8 copies of Blackwood are in the bargan box at the book store, when Anne was insanely popular here when I was in school). I was about to buy it, but Anne's obvously gone mad. Am I the only one who remembers that vampires can't see ghosts? Maharet clearly articulates this in QoTD. Yet ever since Memnoch and Roger's haunting (which outraged me) ghost have been in almost (if not every) future chronicle. Why?? no explanation is given for Maharet saying this nor for vampires like Armand who, if his story is to be taken serious, knows of ghosts. Anne runs out of ideas and breaks her own rules."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"A thought on this &quot;conclusion&quot; to the Cronicles--though this might offend. Did Anne's new religious bent get in her way to make the vampires straight prudes? First David (remember Carlos from ToBT with Merrick (and he turned out to be a child molester as well). Then Louis with that MarySue Merrick (So glad she's gone, but how does Louis feel?). Then Armand with Sybelle (of all vamps, Armand?). Now Lestat with that (impolite word here) Rowan. What gives? The Cronicles were goth favorites because of the adrogny (sp) factor. Also, why would a person like Lestat, with his love of being seen, clothing, etc like living in a Northern LA swamp? Has he turned into Louis and that is why Louis is not seen? Also, how does Petronia feel about her fledging bolting on her? And why would Kayhmen show up at Blackwood Farm for a visit? Is Daniel still insane and why did he get that way anyway? Just questions to ponder as you try to make your way through this swill of a book. Also, this is a Witches book, not a Vampire one, just so you know. (Maybe this was actually written by Anne's son--hmmm)."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I had real high hopes for this novel, as well as for Lestat himself. I didn't like Blackwood Farm, and I only assumed this was so because Lestat wasn't the star character. So when I heard Lestat was coming back as first person again, I was joyed, for he always brung life to Anne's novels from his own biography to the Tale of the Body Thief, my favorite out of them all besides The Vampire Armand.And yet the first thing I hear about is he wanting to be good and a missionary of some sort! It totally threw me off how different Anne Rice made Lestat! It's like Anne neutered him! He's no longer cunning, bad, or vain. He's just a goody goody guy. That thoroughly disappoints me. And since this is supposed to be the last book in Anne's Vampire Chronicles series, I expected so much more and didn't get any of it. I wanted a big reunion of some sort with all her vampires coming together once more, so we could picture the other famous characters that have starred in the Chronicles such as Marius, Armand, and Louis again one last time. But you don't see any of them, Lestat barely even mentions them. That upset me the most.But I'm speaking as a Vampire Chronicles fan. I've read all the novels in Anne Rice's vampire series, so I'm more attatched to the characters. Some of you may be reading one of her novels for the first time, so I'll split this into two categories:Other Anne Rice fans of the Vampire Chronicles-Great chance you'll be just as disappointed as I was. You don't see any of the other vampires but Lestat and his two 'ho- hum' new children, which are Quinn and Mona. The only good thing about Mona is that she sometimes in the book through anger somewhat changed Lestat back into the entity we once enjoyed, other than that, don't expect anything special from these two new vampires. They throughout the book follow Lestat around and call him 'Master' without any civil disobediance whatsoever, unlike Louis and Claudia so famously did decades back in Interview with the Vampire. You see no other vampires but plenty of Mayfairs, and Lestat turns into a drooling zombie over one of the Mayfair women that is twice his age throughout the entire novel. Mainly, say goodbye to the old Lestat you witnessed in the older novels. Don't expect any reunion like I did, because there's not even a hint of it, and the entire plot of the novel doesn't even dedicate to vampires, but to helping the Mayfairs, so don't expect to be knee-deep in seductive vampire conflicts, for there are none. Just the Mayfair witches of Anne's and their problems. My advice, read it about halfway, and if you feel you are enjoying it, then go on and read the rest. But if you feel disappointed, don't do what I did and read the rest, hoping something exciting will happen before you know it, for chances are, like me, you won't.For you viewers who aren't knee-deep into the Chronicles, this may be a good read for you, despite all my comments up above. It's a book of folkloric creatures, vampires and witches, whom embark on a journey to find the secrets of an ancient bloodline called the Taltos linked to the Mayfair witches. A bit of controversy, a dash of action, and an unfolding of ancient secrets makes this novel a good read for many.So for you readers who are just starting out in the Chronicles and this is one of your first readings, I would urge you to read this, because I'm sure I would enjoy it if I wasn't so involved with the other vampires she had other than Lestat. There were action scenes, especially the times when Mona angered Lestat, that made the book worth reading once.But for you Chronicle fans such as I, I strongly urge you to keep your receipt on the novel. Just in case."},{"Title":"Bollywood Babes","review":"I checked this out from the library, and enjoyed listening to it. The narrator is very good at creating distinguishable voices, and it was interesting to listen to. Tho I could tell how it would end, the journey there was an enjoyable one."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"In the hands of a lesser author, I'd be irritated with Richard Sharpe's ability to play a key role in seemingly every key British military action in the early 1800s. But thanks to Bernard Cornwell, I can dismiss petty contrivances and just enjoy the blasted books - and enjoy them I do.(And I'm also reminded of the two soldiers in Ken Burns' magnificent Civil War TV history who kept journals and managed to be in over twenty critical battles . . . sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.)Cornwell has written so many books that he does not feel the need for poetic titles. \\"Sharpe's Trafalgar\\" unsurprisingly puts Sharpe at, well, the Battle of Trafalgar. I know only a couple of Brits well, but from talking to them it's easy to see that Trafalgar is to Britain what Yorktown, Gettysburg, or D-Day are for the United States. There is nothing more stirring to national pride than a magnificent, critical military victory. So Cornwell can be forgiven if he jumps through a few odd hoops to have his favorite Army Ensign play a key role in the purely naval clash at Trafalgar.Sharpe needs to get home from India to join his new regiment, the 95th Rifles. Obviously, Sharpe can't walk back to England from India, and this allows Cornwell to \\"play Patrick O'Brian.\\" Sharpe learns the ins and outs of life on board a British naval vessel, including the close proximity of your fellow passengers, the problems of sailing with an uncooperative wind, and the perils at sea if your captain sells you out.Sharpe also spends a lot of time romancing the glamorous Lady Grace, inconveniently married to a British lord, a general in the Army who is more politician than soldier. (This, by the way, means \\"villain\\" in Cornwell's universe, and he's a good foil for Sharpe.)But the whole novel is really an excuse to get Sharpe to Trafalgar, where he meets Admiral Nelson and gets to wreak his unusual brand of havoc against the French navy. These latter chapters is where \\"Sharpe's Trafalgar\\" really soars, and it does so in both expected and surprising ways.First, the obvious - Trafalgar's a battle, and nobody writes a better real-world battle scene than Cornwell. Sure, it's at sea, but that doesn't slow down an author of Cornwell's talent.But what really makes the battle scenes at Trafalgar powerful is Cornwell's decision to give up portions of the narrative to Captain Chase, Sharpe's friend. I read and re-read several passages where Chase walks the decks of his beloved ship, hands clasped behind his back, as French muskets and cannon fire all around him. While keeping an air of nonchalance, Chase is terrified inside . . . and as such epitomizes the 19th-century British soldier. These are some of the best lines Cornwell has ever written.I am early into the Sharpe series, and I expect I may find a later book that I enjoy more than \\"Sharpe's Trafalgar.\\" If I do, that will be a happy day indeed."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Another outstanding addition to the classic Richard Sharpe series. With Sharpe departing India and sailing aboard an English warship, he soon becomes embroiled with a renegade, an unfaithful wife, a wealthy and jealous husband, a scattering of nautical characters worthy of Kent and Pope not to mention some terrific descriptions of life at sea aboard a King's ship. The author once again demonstrates his uncanny ability of placing our hero in some dangerous prediciments, with some splendid details about ship board hazards and some rousing sea battles and some rather torrid romantic interludes as well. A worthy addition to the collection, filled with adventure, thundering battle and splintered decks, romance and sudden death. I hope that Mr Cornwall considers doing a few books featuring a new naval hero, his writing style would capture that quite well. Once again, Sharpe marches on."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"An homage to Patrick O'Brian's \\"Master and Commander\\", the series based on the British Navy of the same period. The fan of both will see numerous similarities.Sharpe's new friend, Captain Joel Chase, is the spitting image of Jack Aubrey. He's a bluff, good-natured fighting captain whose men would follow him through the gates of Hell, and he personally feels the same way about Admiral Lord Nelson. Sound familiar? He rarely flogs erring sailors. He loves his coffee. He pays for extra powder and shot out of his own pocket so that his crew can practice gunnery. And he's loyal to friends like Sharpe, who comes to Chase's rescue during a Bombay brawl with a dishonest merchant who cheated them both.There are other touches as well. Sharpe's struggle to climb the masts and perhaps avoid using the maintop's \\"lubber hole\\" refers to the same running gag about Stephen Maturin, Aubrey's friend and intrepid but without sealegs.Sharpe, a soldier, doesn't really belong at Trafalgar. But Cornwell contrives a plausible way to get him there, as Sharpe returns to Britain in 1805 to join a rifles regiment. The India books were fun but, after we've seen all those city walls stormed, all those rajahs plundered, and all those hideous Oriental tortures meted out, it's time to move on. Putting Sharpe on a ship, with its backstays and quarterdecks and scuppers pouring blood during battle, is a fine change of pace.Cornwell's battle detail is typically gripping. And in this book Sharpe finds a romance that, one senses, may be more fateful than those he's had in previous books."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"I was somewhat disappointed in this book. I always look forward eagerly to another in the Sharpe series, but this one was not one of Cornwell's better efforts, in my opinion. Still worth reading for we diehard Sharpe fans, however.Sharpe is on board ship and gets involved with a married woman. She and her husband are gentry but of course, she falls for Sharpe's good looks and rough demeanor. I found this a little hard to believe, especially taking place aboard ship with little opportunity for quiet and intimate meetings to develop the relationship. In the end, Sharpe has to handle the complications of keeping his affair a secret, and oh yes, the Battle of Trafalgar intervenes. Actually, the battle scene is handled well as is typical for Cornwell.Possibly I was disappointed with this book because I was reading the Richard Woodman &quot;Nathaniel Drinkwater&quot; naval warfare series around the same time. Maybe the naval setting was not the best milieu for Sharpe's (and Cornwell's) abilities. If you haven't tried the Sharpe books, I highly recommend you pick up _Sharpe's Rifles_ without delay."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Sharpe's Trafalgar is a recent addition to the Sharpe saga although one of the earliest in chronology. While I had seen some of the Sharpe movies on TV, Sharpe's Trafalgar was my introduction to the books. As much of the action occurs at sea, it is has a quite different setting than the other works. Fortunately, the novel works well in the tradition of novels pioneered by C.S. Forester.Sharpe's Trafalgar begins with Sharpe making friends with a Captain of a third rate Royal Navy ship. Rating refers to the number of guns as the captain and crew are first rate. Sharpe books passage back to India on a commercial vessel and after some chicanery participates in a sea chase around the Cape of Good Hope and up the Atlantic, arriving at Cape Trafalgar on October 21, 1806. On board there are intrigues but it all takes a back seat to the Battle of Trafalgar.Cornwell has done a good job of writing a novel of wooden ships and iron men. Unlike the heroes of Forester, Woodman or Kent, his Sharpe has no official standing in the ship although we know that Sharpe won't miss out on any of the action when it comes. However, by establishing a friendship with the captain we are privy to much of the inner workings of the ship. Cornwell also provided a sketch of a typical ship so that a reader unschooled in naval literature will understand where everything is. The sailing details are minimal but I get bored with reading about the t'gallants being let out or the royals being reefed. If a reader found O'Brian impassible then Sharpe's Trafalgar might be a welcome introduction to the genre.Cornwell also does a superb job of describing the Battle of Trafalgar. Unlike the most notable writers of the genre Cornwell does not describe a naval battle in elegant terms. Essentially naval warfare is like a vicious, bloody street fight in which the two fighters get in close and kick, gouge and bite until one falls. The kicking of the downed fighter only stops when it is sure he will no longer get up. Trafalgar is brutal savage butchery and Cornwell excels in blood and gore.While Sharpe is the hero of the novel, not all of his actions are justifiable. Some of his actions are totally inappropriate and totally unacceptable even under the circumstances. Perhaps that's part of the interest in the series is that the hero doesn't always do the right thing. Paradoxically, I had the most sympathy for one of the villains when he gave his traditional- I'm gonna kill you and here's why- speech. The man made some good points. However, Sharpe's Trafalgar is a novel where the good guys wear white hats and the bad guys wear black, so to speak. Having a hero who does some unconscionable things and a villain who has some legitimate motivation for his evil, make it a little more interesting.One thing that Cornwell communicates very well is Nelson's charisma. Sharpe's Trafalgar has the best presentation of Nelson of any novel of the era that I have read. Not only does he present Nelson's power to the reader but he also shows how the Royal Navy would follow him without question. The brief passages that include Nelson are almost inspiring and certainly very inspired.Although Cornwell does not typically write in the hearts of oak genre, he could. Perhaps Sharpe won't go back to sea but let's hope that Cornwell's pen does."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"In chronological order, Sharpe's Trafalgar is the fourth book in the series. You could also think of it as an out-of-sequence book because it has little to do with the stories about Richard Sharpe as a soldier. In fact, unless you want to read a little about what it was like to be at the Battle of Trafalgar, you could skip this book and not miss anything important in the way of character development. Unlike the India books where Sharpe was continually fighting off deadly threats to his life, Sharpe is more concerned here with sneaking around with a married woman, a remote cousin of Sir Arthur Wellesley, Lady Grace Hale.The Napoleonic Wars were fought in Europe. Naturally, Sharpe has to leave India if he is to appear to save the day in all of those amazing battles on the continent. Naturally, he's going to pass by Trafalgar. Why not write a book about the battle and have Sharpe stumble into it? That's clear the thought process behind this book.As a result, you end up with a lot of plot \\"development\\" that is sort of filler before the main battle. Having never studied the sea battle, I found that the explanations were interesting and the story helped make the technology and strategy easier to understand. Had this been a novella that focused on the last third of this book, I probably would have graded the book as a five-star effort.The ins and outs of avoiding being swindled by ship chandlers, East India ship captains, and common seamen didn't seem all that interesting to me. The romantic side of the book wasn't too credible to me and didn't add much to my enjoyment of the story. If you think Bernard Cornwell's novels about Sharpe lack enough of a love interest, then you'll probably like this book a lot better than I did.The writing is quite good in comparing naval battles with the kind of fortress breaching that Sharpe engaged in during the three books in India. I don't recall reading another novel from this era that made those comparisons quite so explicit and interesting.By contrast, some of the dialogue is particularly bad. In fact, Cornwell makes fun of his own dialogue by putting words into the mouths of characters who don't agree that every ship's captain is a \\"fine fellow.\\"The unforgettable part of the book is the characterization of Lord Nelson who led his sailors to such a remarkable victory that day.Fire!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Bernard Cornwell is a historian first and storywriter second, at both he is superb. Trafalgar is possibly the most famous naval battle in British history and it just so happens to fit in with the Sharpe timeline. Naturally as a historian Cornwell would want to put Sharpe in this position and am glad he did. I found this book to amazingly interesting. The account of the naval battle is both detailed and gripping. He recounts the events with such accuracy its amazing how he made it seem so interesting and not just a report from a history book.The book has all the ingredients that make the Sharpe series so great, you just have to read it to love it.I give this book 4 stars, and it's well deserved."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Yes, Cornwell has to jump through some literary and historical accuracy hoops to get Sharpe -- confirmed landlubber extrordinaire -- to Trafalgar, but, here, it just plain works. After a few preliminaries, Cornwell uses the heart of the book to tell the story of Trafalgar through the eyes of the redoubtable Ensign Sharpe. Yes, Sharpe gets more tail than your average movie star . . . and, yes, some traditional British cliches are present -- the nasty sneering aristocrat, and so forth, but Cornwell's sheer story-telling ability makes it one of the finest (along with Waterloo) Sharpe novels yet. The final hundred pages, even though the feature ships are fictional, tell the story of the great naval battle in more readable style -- while getting all the important details correct -- than any non-fiction book I've yet encountered. As the afterword teases, our hero must march again. If I can kick in my two cents, I'd suggest sending an aging Col. Sharpe to help the Greeks win their independence from the infidel Turks. All in all, a great read."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Readers following Sharpe's exploits in chronological order will by now be familiar with the formulaic nature of these books. There is a climactic battle, a new girl, a troublesome villain and Sharpe finally prevails on all fronts. It never fails to be exciting and is always a lot of fun. This book is no different. The challenge, though, was to place Sharpe, a soldier on land, at the great sea Battle of Trafalgar. Well, Sharpe is now going home to England after three books of Indian adventures, and sure enough, he finds himself on a ship involved in the battle. Along the way he also comes face to face with Nelson. The improbable series of coincidences apart, what makes the book noteworthy is the comparison of sea battle to land battles, as seen through the eyes of a soldier. The shipboard routine will be familiar to readers of the Aubrey-Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian and certainly this book reads like one of those. I am a big fan of O'Brian and being familiar with naval cannon from his books have always been puzzled by the puny cannon used by the land forces of the Sharpe novels. In this book the point is driven home that a single line-of-battle ship in Nelson's fleet carried more guns than entire land armies laying siege to forts in India, and these were much larger guns by far. This is all the more amazing to modern readers when we consider the frail wooden nature of these sailing ships. Here then, is an illustrative example of true naval power.The book is historically accurate. Readers interested in an eyewitness account of the Battle of Trafalgar should try Tom Pocock's non-fiction \`Trafalgar: An Eyewitness History' released in 2005 for the bicentennial of the battle."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Bernard Cornwell continues his incredible adventures of Richard Sharpe. With the series having explored nearly every aspect of the Napoleanic period in which the British were invovled, the author is running out of historical chronology in which to insert his main character.Cornwell has been re-tracking Sharpe's career ever since he finished the Peninsular War and Waterloo. Its a credit to the author's genius that he manages to make it work, but the lengths at which he must go in order to do so are getting a little thin now. With this book Cornwell devles into Patrick O'Brien terrority with Royal Navy nautical lore. He seems to have the nautical jargon down pretty good, although this land-lubber wouldn't really know if he was off or not!All the ingredients of the Sharp series are here. Some stawart companions, arrogant aristos who always want to bring Sharpe low, treacherous characters who are not what they appear, and a lovely lady of the blue blood who falls for Sharpe's manliness! We have seen this all many times before in the earlier series, but Cornwell still somehow makes it work! The plot moves along with the usual on the edge page-turner writing and after the slow build-up we explode onto the carnage and horror of Trafalgar where Sharpe gets to meet Nelson first hand and compare him to Wellsley!The battle scenes are Cornwell's forte and the blood, sweat and tears of Trafalgar become vivd before the reader's eyes. The carnage among the Franco-Spanish fleet was truly horrible and even through the British suffered much less severely, the stress and strain of the battle was no less for them. Cornwell describes this very well, even though Sharpe's penchant for killing continues to stack the body count in his favor. In the wholes series Sharpe has probably killed close to several thousand people! A bit unbelieveable perhaps, but Cornwell's supurb action writing still manages to hold it all together. Next stop, Denmark and the 95th Rifles! After that, Sharpe series shouid get a much needed rest."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Bernard Cornwell must be one of the very best historical fiction writers in the world today. Sharpe's Trafalgar is a gem. Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"It's the summer of 1805 and Ensign Richard Sharpe (who, not so long ago, was Private and then Sergeant Sharpe) has been on duty in India for six years. Having grown up in a workhouse and then on the streets of London, he regards India as much \\"home\\" as anywhere -- but now he's heading back to England to join a newly-forming rifle regiment. (Although, having been a \\"redcoat\\" since he was sixteen, he's not happy about switching to a green jacket.) But first he has to get there, and that means four months at sea. And his timing is such that he's destined to be off the coast of Spain in October. Fans of Napoleonic naval fiction will recognize what that means. Sharpe's voyage is eventful, first on an East Indiaman that's captured by a French ship through the treachery of the English captain. Then, after a week as prisoners below decks, the passengers on the Indiaman are rescued by the intervention of a British ship-of-the-line -- which just happens to be commanded by a captain of Sharpe's previous acquaintance. The captain indulges in an ocean-spanning chase of the fugitive Frenchman -- which includes some of the best descriptions in the book for those who know Hornblower and Aubrey -- and they all arrive off the southern coast of Spain at just the right moment. Meanwhile, first on the Indiaman, then on the warship, Sharpe has been carrying on an affair with the beautiful young wife of a coldly arrogant peer, to the secret amusement of practically everyone on board except the lady's husband, who may or may not be ignorant of the adultery. Actually, the two plots don't overlap much. The love story seems unlikely, given the difference in station between Sharpe and the lady, and the naval plotline seems positively forced, being just a way to allow our hero to be present at one of the greatest marine confrontations in European history. The adventure is all very well, but it does stretch credulity. And believability is ordinarily one of Cornwell's greatest assets. (I wonder if Sharpe is going to be present at Gettysburg, too.)"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Richard Sharpe, Cornwell's Napoleonic war hero, takes to the high seas in this great book set during the Battle of Trafalgar.Sharpe is on his way home to join the newly formed Rifles battalion only to find himself entrenched in one of the most significant naval battles in history.If you have read anything Cornwell has written, you will see the same similar formula; however, Cornwell mixed things up a little by placing Sharpe on the high seas. Through Sharpe's good fortune, he is able to meet Lord Nelson and play an integral part in securing a victory for the ship he is traveling on.Of course, you also have to have the token love affair and the \\"enemy\\" who makes the mistake of crossing Sharpe only to find himself on the wrong end of Sharpe's anger.Mr. Cornwell's writing is very engaging, very interesting, and always a page turner.

It follows the third immediately, so please start at the beginning if you have not done so. For those of you who have read the previous Sharpe books, review follows.On his way home to England, Sharpe sails with one Captain Peculiar Cromwell, and meets up with his old cordial enemy, Pohlmann. He also begins an affair with an aristocrat's wife. But traitors have sold the ship to the French, and he is captured. Once Sharpe and the crew are rescued, the hunt is on, which leads them to meet Nelson and fight in the Battle of Trafalgar. This is another very good entry in the series, even though I don't care for nautical fiction as much as I do reading of land battles. As always, the historical details of ships, battles, dress and speech are mostly meticulously rendered, mixed in with a perhaps more modern action-hero sensibility (perhaps some of Sharpe's actions, as a mere ensign, might have been frowned upon in reality). It is true that the characters in this entry are painted in broader strokes than in the previous ones (thus the 3 rather than 4 stars): the heroes are all brave, good and dependable and the villains are all duplicitous and craven. Still, it's a swashbuckling yarn, and great reading fun. Recommended."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Richard Sharpe, the heroic rifleman, was created by Bernard Cornwell as a way of following the career of the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsular war.When that proved a roaring success Cornwell embarked on the production of some Prequels to show how Sharpe had risen from the ranks in India, and to show the early career of Wellesley at Seringapatam and Assaye.But Sharpe had to be moved from India to Spain, and Cornwell cheekily hijacked this opportunity to introduce his diamond in the rough to the other great British war hero of the Napoleonic era, Admiral Nelson. In the process Cornwell slips another ship of the line into the battle of Trafalgar on either side.Sharpes Trafalgar is a great swashbuckling novel in the best tradition of Hornblower. It moves from Conmen in India to Pirates on the high seas. There follows a nailbiting sea chase between two 74 gunners, culminating in the Battle of Trafalgar.Along the way is a love story, deception, blackmail and revenge, all the usual depth and richness of Cornwells back plots.

Richard Sharpe is the author's heroic army officer who boards a ship expecting a noneventful return trip to England after staving off rebellion against the British government in India. Instead, he finds himself involved in the Battle of Trafalger.The action never stops as Sharpe fights for the rights of outbound ship passengers, fights for the love of a beautiful woman and fights for his country. The patriotic fervor and courage of navymen is palpable as Corwnell writes of the daily rigors and dangers of serving on the ships of the day. But, at the same time, the brutality and goriness of war is described exquisitely. I was lifted by small victories and winced at death and injury.Most impressive in this novel is Cornwell's attention to historical detail. He even, much to his credit, includes a postscript at the end of the book to explain which parts of the book are fact and which are fiction. The characters are consistent and honestly portrayed. Sharpe, though heroic, is far from a saint. He breaks rules and laws to get what he wants just as he learned to get along as a homeless child. The wealthy in the book take advantage of the less fortunate to advance their desires. There is no adaptation of modern values and experience to distract from the time period here.But this is an adventure novel first and foremost. I had a difficult time putting this book down and was left wanting more when it ended. This is, unfortunately, the first book I have read in Cornwell's Sharpe series.

That does not stop him from being in the middle of the battle of Trafalgar, however. The author is to be congratulated for getting Sharpe to be present at this historic fight, and also to be able to have a few moments of private conversation with Admiral Nelson on the eve of the battle. Cornwell writes quite knowingly about ships and sailors, and his account of the fight drips with authenticity. Sharpe, as usual, overcomes great obstacles, and aquits himself bravely. There's a love sub-plot, which adds spice to the story, and just the touch of class-consciousness that Sharpe has been experiencing since he became an officer.

Sharpe's Trafalgar is a hybrid novel of unlikely Romance and unlikely happenstance adventure wherein we are asked to suspend our disbelief that an army officer just happens to stumble upon the greatest naval battle since Actium. I did so grudgingly. After all can't Cornwall come up with his own interesting premises to drive a plot--or will we have Sharpe ricocheting across Europe in the Napoleonic Wars.Not only does our hero stumble into the battle at Trafalgar but he is introduced to Nelson who (naturally) takes a shine to Sharpe offering sage advice about being unnecessarily modest. Sadly, this is the plausible part of our tale with a seedy and wholly unconvincing affair between a baroness and the ensign taking center stage. Apparently aristocrats in the 19th century risked all--wealth, status and comfort for a roll in the hay. Why? They are bored. And realize how disagreeable an arranged marriage can be.Even if one assumes the Lady Grace is indifferent to class mores and proprieties, are we supposed to believe she is too horny to restrain herself in a venue that all but ensures discovery. Does it bother her 19th century sensibilities that she is an adulterous? Of course not. That her lover commits murder to silence blackmail? Whatever. It is all too absurd for words. Cornwall's strength was never character development but surely an editor could have pointed out that 21st century morality is inappropriate in a story taking place 200 years ago. I have no doubt adultery happened. I also have no doubt it didn't happen as described in ST.What saves this from being a silly stinker is the genuinely interesting description of 19th century naval tactics and life above and below deck. The battle of Trafalgar is rousing and the devotion Nelson inspires is well done. However, Cornwall seems to have ventured into the realm of romance with this one, and that isn't, in my opinion, a good thing."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"If you like Sharpe add a star.

He was awarded an ensign's commission due to his heroism in battle. Because he has not been schooled as a gentleman, he is looked down upon by his fellow officers. The enlisted men do not respect him because he was once like them. Sharpe is determined to make his own way. He is brave and treacherous. He does not suffer fools. And when someone has treated him unfairly, he holds a grudge, and takes his revenge when the opportunity comes.In this installment of the series it is 1805. England, France, and Spain are battling for supremacy of the ocean. In the seas around India, the French warship Revenant has been been harassing English shipping. The English warship Pucelle has been assigned to stop the Revenant. Sharpe is on his way home to England. Before leaving India, he helps the Pucelle's captain to regain some purloined goods.Sharpe has booked passage on the Calliope, an East India cargo ship. Traveling with him are several well to do merchants, Lord William Hale and his beautiful young wife Lady Grace.As the Calliope sails eastward, Sharpe and Lady Grace become attracted to each other. Soon they are conducting a clandestine affair. Unfortunately, fate intervenes. The captain of the Calliope believes that England is doomed to lose the war. He arranges to have his ship captured by the Revenant. In doing so, he steals his passengers prized possessions, including Sharpe's valuable collection of gemstones. Also, Sharpe and Grace's affair has been discovered by Lord Hale's personal secretary. The secretary attempts to blackmail Sharpe and Grace.Eventually, Sharpe, Grace, Lord William and his secretary are saved by the Pucelle. The Pucelle is pursuing the Revenant. As they chase the Revenant around the Cape of Good Hope and north toward Europe, Sharpe and Grace continue their affair. Just as they catch up to the Revenant, they find the British, French and Spanish fleets gathered for what will become the Battle of Trafalgar.As the battle rages around the ship, Sharpe fights for his life. Deep in the bowels of the ship, Grace also fights to survive. Lord William reveals to Grace that he knows about the affair. The climax of the novel reveals who will survive this day of terror and treachery.The last 60 pages of the novel describe the terrible sea battle that was Trafalgar. The pages fly by as Cornwell's description of the fighting draws you into the battle. You are there with Sharpe as he participates in the desperate struggle. Sea battles of this time were not fought as they are today. In this era ships fought side by side. Sharpe battles in a hailstorm of musket balls, grape shot and cannon balls. Cornwell's prose keeps you reading to learn the fates of Sharpe, his shipmates, and his lover.In my opinion, \\"a real page turner\\" is an often overused phrase used in book reviews. For me, I found that this description of Cornwell's novel was literally true.I enjoyed this book. It was a real page turner.

Killing off the opposition comes a little too easily in this tale, and the adulterous, implausible hookup of Sharpe and his new romantic interest are far too rank for good entertainment. Sharpe is no angel in other Corwell novels, but in this one, he appears more the bad guy, full of deceit, passion, and revenge.Meanwhile, the battle scenes and nautical information are great.

I find this to be the most immersive Sharpe novel yet.There is a significant amount of the novel dedicated to the actual engagement at Trafalgar as you would expect from a Sharpe. It is terrifically paced and remarkably well explained at the same time. No mean feat. The movements of the vessels and the ebb and flow of the battle are easily understood. It's probably the best description of a battle I have ever read, including textbooks on the subject.Objectively I should only give the book 4 stars because Trafalgar is not where Richard Sharpe belongs.

I really enjoyed the little details in this story, such as the ship's cats looking curiously at where the stove used to be that was dismantled and stored below the waterline. Cornwell is a superstar in this genre and I have yet to read a bad work by him."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"The 17th Richard Sharpe book finds author Cornwell touched with a bit of \\"Flashman\\" syndrome&#65533;that is, the desire to place a swashbuckling title character on the scene of every major event of their lifetime, meeting all manner of historical personages. In George McDonald Fraser's Flashman series, this is acceptable, as the whole enterprise is comedic. However, the Sharpe series is a much more serious and realistic effort at historical fiction, and it detracts from it to have Sharpe shoehorned into the defining naval engagement in the history of the British empire. That said, the book is still fairly entertaining stuff sure to please any fan of the series.The gist of it is that Sharpe is making his way from service in India to join the 95th Rifles, the green-jacketed regiment that is his home for most of the series. Loaded down with jewels looted from the Sultan Tipoo, he books passage on an East India Company ship. There's the usual cast of characters here, a bluff Englishman or two who like Sharpe, a Lord who very much doesn't, a pretty young woman to fall in love with, and a few people who aren't what they seem. Intertwined with various shipboard skulking and skullduggery is a plot involving a French raider. This eventually leads to Sharpe's transfer to British naval ship. a lengthy cat and mouse game with the raider, and ultimately a meeting with the legendary Admiral Nelson and finally the great battle.The shipboard fighting is all extremely well described, and one gets a full sense of the terror and horror of naval warfare of the era. Similarly the shipboard deceit and treachery is ingenious and nasty. Less interesting is the love affair of Sharpe's, and given the intensity and outcome, it doesn't dovetail with the earlier written, though chronologically later Sharpe books. All in all, it's wonderful to have another Sharpe book, but one wonders how the series can continue without Cornwell having to shoehorn him into more and more unlikely venues."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"The year is 1805 and Ensign Richard Sharpe is preparing to return to England in order to join the newly formed 95th Rifle Regiment. In the course of his preparations , he encounters Captain Joel Chase of HMS Pucelle at the home of a slimy Indian merchant who is attempting to cheat the two officers. The two officers become friends in spite of the vast disparity in rank , and their fortunes are intertwined in the course of this somewhat contrived tale.Sharpe sails on the East India Company's ship Calliope , has an affair with the lovely young wife of an aristocratic English lord , encounters Anthony Pohlmann (who we remember from &quot;Sharpe's Triumph&quot; as the leader of the Mahratta confederation armies) , and falls prey to a French warship , the Revenant. In order for Sharpe to be present at Trafalgar , Cornwell has the Calliope recaptured by Joel Chase and the Pucelle and young Sharpe joins in the sea chase for the Revenant which culminates at the battle of Trafalgar.The saving grace of the entire tale is Cornwell's description of the epic battle at sea! Even tho' some of the other writing is not up to the standard we expect from the author , it is more than compensated by the battle scene.I personally believe this novel to be a bit of a &quot;fill-in&quot; novel in order to get Sharpe to another theater of activity. Not one of my favorites in the series , but still three stars-plus."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"I've marched with Sharpe since the very beginning. I've delighted in his exploits with Harper in Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, and South America; I sweated with young Sharpe along the dust and elephant-dunged trails of India.Now, we have Sharpe all at sea with a beautiful woman, a blackguard or two, enough brio for a battalion of Bonds, and one of the most decisive and important sea-battles in history.What more could a Sharpe fan want?"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"After a gap of two years from FORTRESS, here we contemplate Richard Sharpe at his leisure on a pleasant sea voyage back to England: fighting Indian thugs, befriending an amusing naval captain, stiffing a lord, smelling treason, and falling into yearning love with Lady Grace. She utters the best capsule description of Sharpe: \\"You're like a weed, Richard. You can grow anywhere.\\" Also, there's reminiscing of his orphan childhood, ignominious capture, rescue and pursuing the traitors, breakfasting with an admiral, and becoming a Marine for a crucial month. This is Sharpe \\"off-duty?\\"There are lots of interesting tidbits about fighting a sailing man-o-war, but little of the complex and esoteric business of sailing her that would confuse a lubberly admirer of the Sharpe series. The endpapers display a highly useful cutaway diagram of the type of ship in which Sharpe goes to battle. The description of ship-board battle during the crucial encounter off Trafalgar is better and bloodier than anything I've read in standard naval fare, focusing as Cornwell does on the stinking and bloodied men and not the cool captain as series hero. The French & Spanish line of battle was \\"capping the T,\\" normally the decisive maneuver in sea battle, but Nelson smashed it with his audacity and firepower. The relative casualties of the French & Spanish vs. the British, given in Cornwell's historical note, are simply astonishing, given the mutual slaughter described here. Note: there has got to be at least one more book to get Sharpe into his Rifles and then to Spain (yeah!)."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"This book centers around how Richard Sharpe left India and eventually found himself in the middle of the Battle of Trafalgar, the most defining naval battle during the Napoleonic Wars. The book is predictable though, the side plot of Sharpe and a prominent female character is filler to an otherwise muindane journey. The author though describes a good picture of how its like to be on a ship two hundred years ago. He describes the parts of a ship pretty well and the sounds and smells of the ship pretty well. The interactions between the characters in the book were pretty predictable, you just knew that the characters would now do anything surprising, the heroes would behave heroic, the aristocrats would behave like snobs, and the cicophants would behave cowardly. Despite it all, the book was pretty enjoyable and would probably be good for younger readers more than older readers. The book reminds me of a hollywood movie that uses a recycled plot with high profile actors. But despite all of the mediocre shortcomings of this particular book, I got out of it a good impression of a slice of life in the 19th century where all the evolution of today's world came."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Sharpe's Trafalgar brought the naval battle to life, even more than going through the wax work museum thirty years ago. Then I was impressed by the noise and the graphic details.

But he does, and it's a highly entertaining read.Sharpe's Trafalgar is set at the conclusion of the trilogy of novels in India in which he obtains some treasure, gets promoted to be an officer after saving the life of General Wellesley (the future Duke of Wellington), and deals with the traitor Dodd. Shipping home to join the 95th Rifles, Sharpe initially takes passage on an East Indiaman, and finds an old opponent as one of the passengers. Treachery follows and the ship is captured by the French.However, as the story is about Sharpe's Trafalgar, we know that he will not remain a prisoner of war for long. And sure enough, after an involved series of events, including the obligatory rescue of a lady in distress, Sharpe and his fellow passengers find themselves guests on a Royal Navy 74 gun ship of the line, chasing a French battleship half-way round the world. Until both ships arrive off Cape Trafalgar on 21st October 1805 ...As usual Bernard Cornwell has done a great deal of research so that the Napoleonic era battles he describe seem real, and in the historical note at the end he explains that many of the events described during the battle of Trafalgar were based on things which really happened.The next novel after this in the chronological sequence is \\"Sharpe's Prey,\\" the main action of which is set two years later in 1807 when Napoleon's continental blockade results in war between Britain and Denmark. That book also tells you what happens to Sharpe's relationship with Grace, the heroine of \\"Sharpe's Trafalgar\\".If you liked the other Sharpe books, you will like this one."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"A must read if you like history told with a little extra excitement.

The battle scenes are riveting and horrendous - it is utterly amazing what these sea warriors lived through. Sharpe is his usual indestructible self, which strains imagination after awhile. I was disturbed by Sharpe's willingness to cold bloodedly murder a pathetic antagonist who tries to blackmail him. It took some of the sheen off his heroic character, and doesn't ring true. Still a great read if you're into this genre."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"As a General Rule I adore Bernard Cornwell's books. I've read all but one of his Sharpe and Starbuck books and have all of the Sharpe movies as well. As a big Hornblower fan I welcomed Sharpe's Trafalgar but found myself left wanting.The book opened well (the first scenes in India were first rate) I found the characters enjoyable sans a few minor flaws such as the pressing of East India men (forbidden by law) without hesitation and repeating it to Nelson. The willingness of at British Capt to try to break a blockade in a French SOL, (Given the realities quite a stretch but in keeping with the captians name.) The fights were not as inspiring as normal. (I think Cornwel may be out of his element here as was Sharpe.) These were small and wouldn't mean much if fact these at might not occur to people unfamilar with Forester's Hornblower books. But there was one scene which stopped the book for me cold.During one vital scene the Sharpe confronted a foe armed with a pistol in the dark bowels of a ship foils him by dashing the oil lantern to the floor now forcing his for to confront him in a darkened room with only one shot. A proper re-write of the page would be someting like this:'...Sharpe realized his mistake just as the lantern left his hand shattering on the dry wood, in a moment the dry deck fed by the oil and flame leapped to a firey life as the most feared foe of all wooden ships made itself plain. His foe screemed as the fire began to consume him, his struggles feeding the flames and spreading them to the baggage...'Cornwell could have made Sharpe come above decks, pretend he heard the shouts and alert the crew in time to save the ship but not in time to save the clumsey fool who dropped the lantern, but he didn't. Perhaps the book deserved another star or a half but I can't give it."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"In the series beginning with Sharpe's Rifles, Bernard Cornwell took his hero Richard Sharpe through the battles of the Peninsula Campaign against Napoleon's armies, and on to Waterloo. Then, after backgrounding Sharpe's rise to officerdom in India with a four book series, Cornwell was faced with transitioning Sharpe from India back to England, and then to Spain. He starts this series of adventures by putting Richard in the middle of a major sea battle (move over, Hornblower!). We last left Richard Sharpe after the Siege of Gawilghur, where he revenged himself on the renegade officer he was pursuing, but his colonel decided that Richard was just not going to fit in the Officers' Mess. The colonel persuades Richard to accept a transfer to one of these new fangled rifle regiments that are being formed back in England. After all, that isn't the real army and maybe there will be a place for someone who isn't a real officer. After the merchant ship on which Richard, and a snooty Lord and his beautiful wife, are traveling becomes separated from their convoy, they are captured by a French ship of the line-under suspicious circumstances. The captain of the merchant ship sails away with the Frenchman, and takes Richard's poke of jewels with him. Sailing under a prize crew and as captives, Richard and his traveling companions are rescued by a ship of the Royal Navy that is chasing the Frenchman. Joining the navy vessel, and working as an honorary Royal Marine, Richard and the Royal Navy pursue the Frenchman around the Cape of Good Hope and almost to Spain. Just as they might catch up, they run right into the French fleet being chased by Lord Nelson on the way to the Battle of Trafalgar. Both ships join up with their respective fleets and participate in the historic battle. By a quirk of fate, of course, the two ships end up in battle and Richard gets his jewels back, and the girl, of course. Richard Sharpe is for the army what C. S. Forrester's Hornblower was to the navy - and I think the stories and the character are better. We still don't know how Ensign Richard Sharpe, with his poke of jewels and the girl, ends up as an impoverished quartermaster lieutenant in a beaten British army in Spain. There must be several more exciting tales to come, and I am looking forward to them."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Bernard Cornwell once again out does himself with Shape's latest adventure in the era of the French Revoloution.

Bernard Cornwell has now sent young Ensign Richard Sharpe on the high seas, and no matter what the situation, Sharpe does the only thing he's good at, killing. The book colorfully describes the Battle of Trafalgar with rich and flowing detail. Placing the book down for a nights sleep will keep you in suspense and longing for the next day to hurriedly arrive. In no movie theater on the face of this planet can excitement be as influential as in this epic. Bernard Cornwell has truly out done himself now by placing a young army officer in the middle of a boiling naval battle. French cannons are not the only aspect of danger to tear at Sharpe's heart, but love as well. An aristocrat married to another has done what no Indian warlord was capable of doing, subjugating Richard Sharpe. The callused heart and war torn body soon gave yield to love.

Well, here he does both and the result is truly satisfying. In the best tradition of the Sharpe's series, the odds against are enormous, but Sharpe wins through with a combination of brass nerves, lightning fast steel and a golden lady ready for the winning. Pay attention, another class will be in session to teach us Colonials one more lesson from the English book of battle history as horrifying chaos of Trafalgar unfolds as only Richard Sharpe could have seen it.I can end this with only one thought: sit back and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Like some of the reviewers, I felt that it started much too slowly for a Sharp's adventure and I also felt that it had far too much on his love(?) interest. The last 1/3 or so was equal to his other books but I get the feeling that Cornwell has generated a book to prove to his agent or to his publishers that he can write &quot;sea stories&quot; to take up the Patrick O'Brian flag.

It is fun, entertaining and very readable. Cornwell's research is as excellent as usual. He takes some licenses for the shake of the story and continuity, but this is OK. Some people are outraged by the portrait of some of the real historical characters, but historical characters are rarely depicted accurately in historical fiction, so I think this can be forgiven. Besides, usually a more serious account of these characters is given at the end of the book on the Historical Note.Many people insist in compare this series with Patrick O'Brian's Master and Commander. I don't think this is fair for any of the series, they are different entities. What they have in common is that once you start you may get hooked and devour one book after another...And in the literary world today that is a rare and marvelous thing."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Really enjoyed this as I do all of Bernard Cornwells books, Sharpe is on board ship and gets involved with a married woman. She and her husband are gentry but of course, she falls for Sharpe's good looks and rough demeanor. I found this a little hard to believe, especially taking place aboard ship with little opportunity for quiet and intimate meetings to develop the relationship. In the end, Sharpe has to handle the complications of keeping his affair a secret, and oh yes, the Battle of Trafalgar intervenes. Actually, the battle scene is handled well as is typical for Cornwell."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"The best series I've ever read - can't wait for the next book"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Bernard Cornwell and his Richard Sharpe series are some of the most exciting historical fiction around.

The battle scene is one of the longest I've ever read, and every word is worth it.Pre-battle, the book is enjoyable, though marred with a continuity error here and there. Sharpe needs to get home from India. The ship he's on gets taken by the French (in circumstances I didn't find absolutely believable, but let that be), and he ends up on a man-of-war. Of course, as in every Sharpe book, he ends up in a love affair. It's about as believable as they always are. Some of the secondary characters, particularly Captain Chase and the merchant Fairley, stand out.The battle is wonderful, appalling, graphic, gory, exhausting, vivid and terrifying. No, Cornwell's no Shakespeare (and he's no O'Brian, either) but he writes a mean battle scene, and this is one of his best. As a non-specialist in the period, I didn't find many errors; and, again as a non-specialist, I found his characterization of Nelson especially vivid.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the period and in non-stop, no-holds-barred battle scenes."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Richard Sharpe, fresh from the wars in India, is on his way hometo England, to sign up for a company that is called the \\"green jacket.\\" He is young, carries stolen jewels, falls in love with a woman that he cannot have named Lady Grace Hale, he becomes involved in a piracy, and he becomes involved in the death of Lady Grace Hale's husband!

After helping the captain get some money back, Sharpe finds out that his shipmates aboard the ship home include a former enemy, a member of parliament accompanied by his aloof wife Grace. Filled with stirring battles, suspense and passionate love, Sharpe's Trafalger is a rolicking adventure yarn where Sharpe meets the great Admiral Nelson in a battle to save England from invasion. This is a fun book, but it is not one of my favorites. I have no problems with it except that sometimes the story is overdramatic.

Cornwall is one of my favorite authors but I was disapointed. Instead of the normal two three or more battles in a Sharpe book, there was one. The battle although good was not spectacular, I have read better in books by CS Forester, Dewey Lambdin, and Alexander Kent.

He's still trying to get as much money out of the &quot;Sharpe&quot; character as possible. To do this, he puts Sharpe in just about every battle of the Napoleanic Wars. If you've read the previous Sharpe books, or watched the films, you'll be disappointed with this book. There are even some rumors that Sharpe will see action at New Orleans in 1815 (Sharpe's 'Gator) which is a MAJOR stretch. What next Mr. Cornwell; Sharpe Goes to the Alamo ?

Sorority rush has changed tremendously in the past few years. While this book gives some good advice to future rushees and is able to familiarize young women with the rush process, the authors get away from the whole point of sororities. A sorority is a place where women can be themselves; young women should not feel as if they need to go out and get a manicure or buy a new wardrobe in order to receive a bid from a sorority. This is not the type of message the Panhellenic Council wants to portray. However, unlike most publicity these days, this book does promote many positive sides of Greek life and that is definitely something that deserves merit."},{"Title":"Ready for Rush: The Must-have Manual for Sorority Rushees!","review":"I'm submitting this review on behalf of the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), which is a conference of 26 national sororities, including the sororities to which the authors belong.In certain respects, Ready for Rush is the book we've dreamed of - a straightforward, positive account of the benefits of sorority membership, both during college and in the years beyond. Of particular note are the wonderful testimonials from sorority alumnae from all walks of life, which speak of shared values and lifelong friendships. The authors are also to be commended for stressing the importance of being one's self during the formal recruitment process, and of the focus on and desirability of good grades, a commitment to community service, and active participation in sorority affairs.Other aspects of the book pose some concern. The book contains one brief mention of &quot;no frills Rush&quot; (a term used to describe various recommendations adopted by NPC in 1991 geared at re-focusing sorority recruitment toward personal interaction and conversation, rather than on the various &quot;trappings&quot; with which sorority rush has long been associated (i.e., matching outfits, decorations, skits and routines)); however, the authors' advice clearly presupposes a recruitment environment that is &quot;full frills&quot; and, as such, may not (and, we hope, does not) accurately reflect the changing sorority recruitment process. Also of concern is the &quot;Stop, Look and Sniff&quot; chapter, which attempts to categorize sororities and their members into various stereotypes, all of which seems rather superficial and more along the lines of what we would expect to see from non-greek authors.Given the book's target audience, however, the greatest concern from NPC's perspective lies with the authors' advice on the preparation necessary for formal recruitment. Although it is certainly important to present oneself well in any social situation where one is to meet new people, women intent on pledging a sorority need not purchase an entirely new wardrobe, go on a diet, get a professional manicure, change to a particular hairstyle, purchase tea cards or do any &quot;homework&quot; about the sororities they'll meet. Rather, they should simply appear as they generally would for any interactive situation, dressed in a manner they consider appropriate for the weather and region (suggestions from the formal recruitment handbook and panhellenic officers are usually available and helpful, particularly insofar as dress norms for formal recruitment can differ greatly from region to region), and be ready to meet and converse with new people! By going into formal recruitment with an open mind and presenting herself as she really is, albeit in the best light possible, a young woman will be most likely to find a place in the sorority that suits her best, so that she can enjoy all the wonderful benefits of membership that the authors rightfully tout as being part and parcel of sorority life."},{"Title":"Ready for Rush: The Must-have Manual for Sorority Rushees!","review":"This book made is all so much simplier.

However, preparing yourself like this book recommends will only create more problems. If you aren't yourself you can easily end up in the &quot;wrong&quot; house."},{"Title":"Ready for Rush: The Must-have Manual for Sorority Rushees!","review":"I found this book after much searching on how to be ready for college. It had so much useful advice and not coming from a family with sorority members, it really helped me prepare. While it is politically incorrect to say that there are certain type of houses, the reality is that there are, and this book helps to point that out in a fun way. It also stresses the importance of grades, getting involved, and being yourself. I would recommend this to anyone heading off to college and thinking of joining a sorority..it helped me!"},{"Title":"Ready for Rush: The Must-have Manual for Sorority Rushees!","review":"My parents were weary about me becoming a part of the Greek system. There has been so much bad press on sororities and fraternities, and this book dispells all those notions and brings into light not only the good times and sisterhood that a sorority offers up, but also the spiritial and social values a young woman can receive through sorority life. The book was not dated at all, but it does tell how the first chapters were started and their original goals and interests. Perhaps old fashtioned into today's fast paced world, but a sense of service and a home away from are still very important. It was very helpful to me and I would highly recommend this book to anyone contemplating going through rush."},{"Title":"Ready for Rush: The Must-have Manual for Sorority Rushees!","review":"Great for anybody going through RUSH. I head off to college in just two weeks and to be honest, this book has given me that added bit of knowledge that I was missing. There's always a book or a documentary to inform you about science or medicine, but rarely do you find a book about handling yourself in a social envirnment that doesn't take itself too seriously."},{"Title":"Wanted: Perfect Partner (Yours Truly #1) (Silhouette Yours Truly)","review":"Only 150 pages and easily read in a few hours, this book packs a lot of punch. With its many hilarious moments, I'd almost categorize it as chick-lit rather than a run-of-the-mill romance novel. Family dynamics (mother-daughter between Meg and Lindsey and sister-brother between Steve and Nancy, as well as the friendship between Lindsey and Brenda) give this story additional depth.Fifteen year old Lindsey decides that her divorced mom has been single and lonely for far too long. Problem is, Meg isn't interested in dating again. With the help of her friend, Lindsey concocts an elaborate plan to change Meg's mind, starting with a diet, exercise and fashion makover. Pretending to be Meg, they place a personal ad and carry on a correspondence with Steve. However, it isn't Steve replying to their letters, it's his meddlesome sister Nancy who is likewise trying to fix him up.The chemistry is electrifying when Meg and Steve meet, but they are so furious at the way they've been manipulated by their families that they decide to teach them a lesson. Meg pretends to be a trashy woman of ill-repute when she meets Nancy, and Steve pretends to be an ex-con when he meets Lindsey. This all backfires when Meg and Steve fall in love and cannot convince their families that they aren't really the raunchy characters they presented themselves as. Establishing trust and gaining the acceptance of their families is further complicated by some very funny mishaps."},{"Title":"Wanted: Perfect Partner (Yours Truly #1) (Silhouette Yours Truly)","review":"I enjoyed this book, I just hated the daughter in this book because she was too much into her mothers business. I can't give this a 5, but a 4 is what I think it is. Good book if you have nothing to do. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Opera; or, The Undoing of Women","review":"What has Opera done to Women? is the focus of Clement's thougths, short essays on the oppressive emotive cauldron Divas inhabit. The world of Opera scholarship is only (within the last ten years) has seen the vigours of social and political perspectives discussed. Writers like Susan McClary, Linda Hutcheon,Tom Sutchliffe,and Anthony Arblaster have deeply thought works scouring the social dimensions of Opera left unattended since its inception. Clement brings a wealth of intellectual sensibilities as well, a Lacanian, feminist who traverses inside the singers mind while she is singing it seems. And saying, &quot;this is not a nice place to sing.&quot; And what does Opera grant it's women always fated for death and domesitication,or prison . Clement's readings traverse the traditional operatic repertoire giving you the opera's narrative as she comments and reflects. The section &quot;Tetralogy of the Ring&quot; incites the chauvinistic world of Wagner,how all gods have power, but the Man-Gods can strip the Woman-Gods of their power when they choose to rebel, as Wotan does to Brunnhilde in Wagner's &quot;Die Walkure&quot; in the &quot;Ring&quot;. Songs of Lunatics is what women in opera potray as in Donizetti's &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; Girls who leap into space, Tosca and Melisande. Or in Bizet's &quot;Carmen&quot; who has no fixed place, her lightness is always in darkness away from lechery and exploitation. You will feel Clement's compassion for Opera's oppressed cadre,and her wrath in speaking of opera's deeply prejudiced phallocentricism. Indeed this has been the most profound book on opera. It makes you rethink all you have ever known, or didn't know on this most cloistered self-preserved realm of music drama. I had wished Clement had ventured into this century for there are profound examples of positive even rebellious roles of women, as in Alexander Goehr's &quot;Behold The Sun&quot; set in Anabaptist Germany of the 1500's, or Luigi Nono's &quot;Like a Burgeoning Light of Love&quot; with a text by Louise Michel ,where three women visit the war fields of this century and comment."},{"Title":"Opera; or, The Undoing of Women","review":"I have trouble liking this because I (never been a fanof Dworkin and MacKinnon writin together or I just don't get 'em..)Opera?

I confess that it was a struggle to make it to the end. The author did a good job of portraying the characters and making them real, but it was difficult to sort through all of the other mumbo-jumbo and get to the crux of the story."},{"Title":"Sylvia and Ted","review":"The reviews below giving Emma Tennant's lyrical and lovely novel of the lives of Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes low scores are clearly from Slyviaphiles with axes to grind. Yes, Emma Tennant dated Ted Hughes in the 1970s, but that doesn't make a whit of difference in her beautiful rendering of one of the last century's most celebrated love triangles. I savored every word and can't wait for the movie to come out."},{"Title":"Sylvia and Ted","review":"Emma Tennant was one of Ted Hughes' mistresses in the 1970s; she published Burnt Diaries, her memoirs about Hughes, not long after his death. Now she has published a 'fictionalized' account of Sylvia, Ted and Assia.I have been reading and studying about Plath for many years, and thus know quite a bit about her, and find the fictional portrait of her to be off, overripe. I don't know how much 'fiction' there is in the book, for instance are all statements made in quotation marks for real? Because this novel relies *heavily* on the actual events in Plath's and then the Hugheses' lives, any fiction will either be garishly out of place (the whole Kate Hands episode) or will be vulgar, such as the idea that Plath found out that Assia was pregnant and that *this* is what drove her to suicide...Plath (who is the main subject of the book; Assia is much less thought-out and is dispensed with in a perfunctory way) is done a disservice here; in Burnt Diaries she asks Hughes what she was like, and he won't say a word. Maybe it was because of books like this.I am giving it one star for the the cover, for its merciful brevity and because it reminded me to get some red lipstick."},{"Title":"Sylvia and Ted","review":"Unconvincing novel about Sylvia and Ted.She was a suicidal neurotic,he was a male chauvinist.End of story. To re-phrase Oscar Wilde,'To lose one wife by suicide may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose two looks like carelessness.'"},{"Title":"Sylvia and Ted","review":"SYLVIA AND TED, a strangely designed blue-gray book with a flower whose petals are grasped by fish hooks on the cover, a short novel by one Emma Tennant, sat with multiple copies on the table of \\"drastically reduced books for sale\\" at a local bookstore. Interest in the poetry of Ted Hughes and also that of the last works of Sylvia Plath made me curious enough to buy it without much thought. And it sat on my desk for months until one rainy evening it served to usurp my time for about three hours of reading. It is a strange book.Emma Tennant (despite her apparent connections with Ted Hughes) is a curious writer. In SYLVIA AND TED she seems more intent on creating an atmosphere for the odd love story between two poets than in committing a biography to paper. In doing so she succeeds on some levels. The book is divided into years of importance in the lives of Sylvia Plath, Ted Hughes and Assia Wevill - and in this manner she seems to be in awe of Michael Cunningham's THE HOURS, so intense is her exploration into the dark moods of each of these moments in time. And had she remained focused in this style then this book would have had a better chance at succeeding.Tennant's problem is her self-indulgent verbiage, waxing literary in mythology and in symbolism that is more of a distraction than a significant modifier to the tale of two suicides over a single poet. To her credit she does manage a style of reportage that constantly keeps her in a position of close observer to the creative mind of Sylvia Plath. There is enough information about the disintegration of Plath's mind to make her suicide seem credible, no mean feat for a writer. But why include Assia Wevill from the very first of the book, weaving her in and out of the story at will as though setting Assia up a trope for all of Ted Hughes' well-documented assignations?Quibbling? Perhaps. This is not the book to read for a biography of these well known subjects: this is a theme and variations on the lives of artists heavily weighted with poetically inclined diversions. It has its moments. Grady Harp, March 2005"},{"Title":"Sylvia and Ted","review":"A mesmerizing, fragmented novel of unique and bereft characters. These compulsive, creative souls feed off each other, competing furiously for their art and their personal space.A lesson here for artists and authors: ground your work in self care - not obsession and compulsion."},{"Title":"Sylvia and Ted","review":"All these one-star reviews are dead on. Oddly, though, from a mathematical perspective, if you add them all up, they only amount to about a half a star. That's how awful even the mere conception of this book is. If you have any doubts, let me offer one thought that I don't see presented so far: Do you really think it's just happenstance that this book only exists now that the three principals are dead? Tennant would have had her tail sued off had she tried something like this in Hughes' lifetime."},{"Title":"Sylvia and Ted","review":"This book is in spectacularly bad taste. The &quot;fictionalizations&quot; is spiteful, jealous, transparently vindictive, and very badly written. So much so it is almost laughable in places.The author does not appear to understand that slandering someone is rhetorically very difficult-- usually the reader will see through the attempt, and end up sympathizing with the one being slandered.She particularly loses credibility in her portrayal of Clarissa Roche-- presented in this book as an almost angelic presence in Plath's life, with no gray areas. By golly, look at that! The book is dedicated to Roche! Uhmmm.. just how stupid does she think her readers are?My benefit of the doubt points for both Plath and Hughes have skyrocketted."},{"Title":"Sylvia and Ted","review":"I found this novel disappointing, even somewhat offensive. The liberties taken with the lives of Sylvia, Ted, and Assia seemed in poor taste, and much of the &quot;poetic language&quot; of the book was forced and overwritten. I'm as much of a Hughes/Plath fan as anyone, and I enjoy reading biographical and analytical books about their relationship and respective poems, but this quasi-fictional rendition of their lives (especially so soon after Hughes's death) left me uncomfortable; the early sections describing Assia's &quot;coquettish&quot; youth were the most troublesome in this regard. Interested in Sylvia and Ted (the poets)? My advice is to buy Birthday Letters, the new Plath unabridged journals, or Rough Magic instead."},{"Title":"Sylvia and Ted","review":"This is the story of the lives of temperamental poets and writers Sylvia Plath and her husband Ted Hughes.Sylvia committed suicide in 1963, after a series of jealous outrages due to her husband's infamous infidelities; firstly with their 15 year-old baby-sitter and then with a rival poet and magnificent Russian beauty, Assia Wevill.Tennant reveals the emotions in Plath's life from 1935 when she was a two-year-old, continuously separated from her German parents and cared for by her grandparents in America. A gifted student, Sylvia wrote at an early age. At twenty-one she moved to England after she failed to be admitted to Harvard University.In England, Sylvia strives for two goals, one to produce children and another to produce brilliant writing. She fails in both for a long time, and with great anguish, until the two goals converge at the same time. The stress of the two creative forces and the competing pressures for priority take their toll. At a time when she should be fulfilled, she fails at her marriage.The writing tries to link Sylvia's relationships with her father and grandfather to her relationship with her husband, intermittently overlaying references to her poetry. It only partly achieves this while falling short of detailing the complexities of the tortured lives of ambitious artists. The novel is primarily for Plath devotees as the poetry references are rather tenuous. As a story it leaves many unanswered questions for the general reader, yet it's worth a read.Martina Nicolls, Author of \\"The Sudan Curse\\" and \\"Kashmir on a Knife-Edge\\""},{"Title":"Sylvia and Ted","review":"Since only real names are used and some chapters seem to follow Guardian articles beat for beat this novel really blurs fiction and non-fiction.Tennant writes beautifully, and it's best to think of this as rather heated, dreamy character studies since the plot is often difficult to track. You won't learn much here if you've seen the movie \\"Sylvia.\\" But still, some of the imagined childhood of Assia, and certainly the dinner with her sad child, were effective. Ted largely remains a cipher, but perhaps he was; images of him as a killer are haunting.Not a lot of suspense and forward-motion, but lovely writing."},{"Title":"Sylvia and Ted","review":"This is one of the most gorgeously written books I have ever read. Emma Tennant is a poet, like the late Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes were. As a result, she may take a scene with Ted Hughes at a restaurant and describe in poetic detail how he eats, watches, moves. To many this might seem ridiculous. To a poet, even Bob Dylan (who said something about - a wise man looking at a blade of grass), it can mean a great deal. Bottomline here is this. Ms. Tennant is not interested in her role and brief relationship with Ted Hughes. As a female poet who faced the same sex discrimination in the arts which Plath did, she wants to set the record straight for Sylvia Plath. And she does this with such style, panache, page-turning fascination - that if you have anything like a poet-at-heart within, you will simply adore the book."},{"Title":"Lease Cars: How to Get One","review":"I enjoyed reading Lease Cars because it was different from any other car buying book I have read. The author made it enjoyable because he constructed a play that guided the car buying and negotiating process from start to finish. It was easy to understand and had useful and very practical tips from a person who himself was a car dealer. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"PERCY THE SMALL ENGINE TAKES T (Little Pops)","review":"I ate Thomas the Tank ngine, but any junior fans will like this pop-up book.The morality is Victorian - the censorious and vindictive Fat Controller is an example of middle-class Victorian values.

The book theme is about a boy and a dog that fallowed the boy home one day.The authors writing style is slow and calm. The main characters in Shiloh are Marty, Shiloh, Becky, Daralyn, Ma, and Dad. My favorite character in this book is Shiloh because Shiloh is a dog and I love animals.The background information about Shiloh is that Shiloh has been abused by Judd Travers. That is why Shiloh ran away. The exciting and important scene in the beginning of this book is that Shiloh fallows Marty home.A summary of the book Shiloh is one day Marty was walking in the woods and suddenly a dog was fallowing him home. Marty found out that the dog belongs to Judd Travers. So Marty and his dad took him back to Judd Travers. Marty learns that Shiloh has been abused by Judd.

The main characters are Shiloh, the parents of Marty, Doc Murphy, Docs Wife, The sisters of Marty, the girl Marty likes and Judd Travers.My backround information came from the book Shiloh. A exiting and important scene from the beginning. The dog finds Marty, and follows him till he gets home. The dog gets adopted by Judd Travers and treats him cruel and hurts him. Shiloh finds a new home for Shiloh when he ran to Marty. I would recommend this book because it's a awarded book and that its got a little bit of action. I like this book because I like nature and country and I like books that don't have a lot of action.This book is about a boy who gets a 22 rifle from his dad.

She also wrote the books The Boys Start the War, Please do Feed the Bears, Patches and Scratches, Reluctantly Alice, Footprints at the Window, Faces in the Water, Bernise Magneder and the Disappearing Bodies, Keeping a Christmas Secret, and Alice Alone. The book theme of the book Shiloh is about a boy named Marty finds a dog one day and names it Shiloh and works his best to keep the dog for himself and from Shiloh's carless owner Judd that lives in Marty's neighborhood.Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's writing style is a story format which is written like a story which is fun to read. The main characters in the book Shiloh are Shiloh and Marty. My favorite character in this book is Marty because he is a caring, loving, and generous to a dog that he will do anything to keep and have that dog away from the enemy of this book Judd, that is the best thing about Marty and my favorite reason.Shiloh is the first of the scenes followed by Shiloh Season and Saving Shiloh. An exciting or important scene from the beginning of the book is when one day Shiloh follows Marty all the way home and Marty ends up keeping Shiloh a secret by not telling anyone and putting him somewhere no one will see him!!!! But soon Marty's mom finds out and gets in a big discussion and finally Marty's mom keeps a secret from her two daughters and her husband but soon everyone knows!! But you will have to read the book to find out how it ends and if Shiloh gets to keep him or has to give him back to Judd.I recommend this book to people who like to read books that are about braveness, love, caring, and want to make you smile, and cry. I like the book Shiloh because it is filled with love and that's what it is all about. The love part about this book is that a boy named Marty that's about 11 or 12 years old will give his life for a beagle that he named Shiloh, by fighting or to shoot him to keep him and have it as his own pet and keep him away from Judd for whatever it takes."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shiloh is better than any other book around!

His family is poor. Marty meets this dog Shiloh and he gets attached to Shiloh. But then Marty notices it is Judd's dog!

The dog follwed Marty home, but wouldn't let him come close enough to touch. Every time he would start walking, the dog would follow, but when he would stop, the dog would stop.

I read it after my 11-year old son suggested it as a change from my usual reading fare of history and biography. It turned out to be much more than just a summertime reading diversion...it became for me a deeply moving reading experience in its own right. I was quickly captivated by Marty and his family, Shiloh, the beagle, and yes, even the despicable Judd Travers.The story is straightforward: Marty Preston is an eleven-year old boy living with his parents and two younger sisters in rural West Virginia. It is a close-knit, loving family with traditional values and a clearly defined set of rules to live by. His father is a mail carrier and his mother a homemaker.One Sunday afternoon, as Marty is walking along a backwoods road, he spies a young beagle hiding under a bush. He calls to it, but the dog doesn't respond. When Marty walks away, the dog follows him. Marty tries to get the dog to come to him several times, but the animal, which has obviously been abused, cowers miserably. Finally, the dog happily comes to Marty when the boy whistles at him. Marty immediately falls in love with the dog, whom he names Shiloh. The little beagle responds with trust and affection. The boy quickly figures out that Shiloh belongs to Judd Travers, a local ne'er-do-well, and a man with an unsavory reputation for dishonesty, a hot temper, and animal abuse. Marty wants to keep Shiloh, to protect him from Judd. However, his parents insist he return the dog to its rightful owner, which Marty begrudgingly does.Shiloh runs away from Judd a second time and finds his way back to Marty's house. This time, Marty vows to keep him. He hides the dog, sneaks food out of the house to feed him, and begins to lie to friends and family when questioned about Shiloh's whereabouts. A tragic accident causes Marty's secret to be found out by his parents. He is forced once again to return Shiloh to his master. Marty, desperate to keep Shiloh, offers to do almost anything to get Judd to give him the dog.I won't give away the ending of the book; suffice it to say, it is a dramatic and compassionate ending, sure to move anyone who reads this book.&quot;Shiloh&quot; is a beautifully and masterfully written in every way. It is written in the first person, from Marty's point of view. The narrative is written in a rural West Virginia dialect that sounds totally natural and unaffected. It seemed almost possible for me to hear Marty speak as I read along. The book's plot is absolutely superb - tightly woven, dramatic, and realistic. Each of the characters come to life with complete believability. All of the situations presented in the narrative are easy to understand and appropriate for young readers.Phyllis Reynolds Naylor proves why she is such a gifted writer of children's books, mainly because she so brilliantly fires the reader's imagination and teaches positive values. In the story, she presents Marty with an ethical dilemma which, at one time or another, all children face. Marty's predicament is this: whether to do what is right in the eyes of a higher authority (his parents) when it is a reasonable certainty that the action will result in a great wrong being done by someone else; or to do what his heart says is right, even though that action is wrong in the eyes of the higher authority (his parents). Marty's dilemma is compounded his conscience, which speaks loudly and often to him, demanding from him both honesty and a sense of fair play. How Marty responds to these challenges is the great lesson taught by this book.&quot;Shiloh&quot; is a winner of the Newbery Medal and a classic of children's literature. I heartily recommend it to kids of all ages...from 9 to 99."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shiloh is a wonderful example of realistic fiction for children. The story revolves around Marty, a small town boy in the hills of West Virginia. There isn't much money, and putting food on the table is difficult and all consuming for the adults of his community.Marty spends his free time roaming the hills with his rifle, until he discovers Shiloh, a dog, whom he learns lives with constant abuse by his owner. Marty determines to rescue Shiloh and care for the dog he immediately becomes attached to. He finds, however, that simply wanting something, is not a determinant of taking possession: he is stunned that the abusive owner has rights, which is confusing and heartbreaking for him.Throughout the story, Marty is confronted by moral issues which he must wrestle with as he focuses his attention on loving Shiloh and finding a way to make life better for the dog. In doing so, his values are questioned and his morality is strengthened. He must learn to solve moral dilemmas by analyzing the choices he has. He realizes that adults don't always do the right thing, nor do they always have the answers to questions. Most, important, he learns to recognize that he has the ability, within himself, to realize the resolve it takes to do the right thing in the face of adversity.Young readers will experience these dilemmas with Marty, and the story provides youngsters with the opportunity to develop their own moral skills along with him."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"To keep Shiloh, a white beagle with brown and black spots, Marty Preston has to do more than keep a water dish filled and train his dog not to go the bathroom indoors. He has to build a special pen, buy food with his own allowance, and even do some odd jobs for extra money. Also, as Shiloh is really someone else's dog, Marty has to lie and keep secrets from his parents and friends. He excuses his actions with the fact that Shiloh is better off with him than with the abusive original owner--which is, I know, justification enough for most readers. The novel is not that simplistic, though: Marty eventually realizes that he will have to come clean, even if it will mean losing his dog.The characters in &quot;Shiloh&quot; are well-drawn and realistic. It was nice to read about complex people who love animals, grow up with guns and occasionally hunt for their own food. Their West Virginian dialect is a pleasure to read. Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's observations, through Marty's eyes, really seem like an eleven-year-old boy's, not a grown woman writer's. Moreover, her pace, like her integrity as a storyteller, never lags.This is a great book for teaching children not just about dogs and other pets, but about right and wrong. Nothing is purely white or purely black in this novel, not even the &quot;villian,&quot; Judd Travers. There is a powerful scene near the climax when Marty starts asking himself questions about what is ethical and what is not--about whether or not the ends justify the means. All the scenes that follow show how a young boy, through his love for his dog, learns life lessons about maturity, responsibility and respect.Despite all this complexity, the lessons of &quot;Shiloh&quot;, like its theme, are very simple. They are the universal values that all children pick up for themselves whenever they truly experience life."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Over the course of 4 nights as I real aloud to my son we took every advantage of this wonderful story to talk about courage, friendship, honesty, and responsibility.The main character, Marty is a wonderful character for children to experience because he has fears, concerns, and has trouble with a problem that is larger than he could every imagine, but he proves himself worthy in the end."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"&quot;Shiloh,&quot; the novel by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, received the 1992 Newbery Medal &quot;for the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children.&quot; While the book is certainly ideal for younger readers, don't be misled by either the award or the publisher's marketing approach: this moving, well-written book is good for adults, too.&quot;Shiloh&quot; takes place in rural West Virginia. It tells the story of Marty, an 11-year old boy who seeks to shelter an abused beagle from his hard-hearted owner. Reynolds lets Marty tell his story in the first person, and her excellent prose captures the rhythms of rural West Virginia speech (and I say this because I spend a lot of time there with my extended family). Reynolds had me hooked with her opening sentence: &quot;The day Shiloh come, we're having us a big Sunday dinner.&quot; Reynold's skill at rendering American vernacular speech evokes, in my mind, favorable comparisons to such authors as Zora Neale Hurston and Alice Walker.&quot;Shiloh&quot; is rich with the details of life in that region: the food, the hunting, and social customs. Reynolds creates a wonderful portrait of a poor but loving family. But the heart of the book is the way she captures the special bond between a boy and his dog.&quot;Shiloh&quot; is an &quot;issue&quot; book in the sense that it deals with animal cruelty, but Reynolds wisely tells a realistic story without overtly preaching at the reader. But the book still raises very relevant issues. Marty's moral dilemma is not presented as an easy &quot;black-and-white&quot; situation. Shiloh's owner, Judd, is not a cardboard villain. Marty's ethical and theological inner struggle is comparable to that of the title character in Mark Twain's &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.&quot; Like Huck, Marty is a compelling hero: courageous, loyal, and thoughtful.In short, &quot;Shiloh&quot; is a contemporary classic, a book with true moral and psychological resonance. Naylor's portrayal of the enduring ties between a child and a beloved animal is comparable to such enduring works as John Steinbeck's &quot;The Red Pony.&quot; This moving book deserves a wide audience."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Naylor, Phyllis Reynolds, Shiloh, New York, New York: Aladdin Paperbacks Publishing, 2000. 137 pages.Have you ever thought to yourself, \\"Why do people abuse their animal(s)?\\" I mean it is just plain wrong. In the book Shiloh there isn't really a main setting in the book because they go all around their town. The main characters are Marty who is a boy, then there is Shiloh who is the dog which is surprisingly the main character but also the title of the book. My favorite part of the book was when Judd got in a truck accident because of drinking to much beer. That night Shiloh snuck out of the house because he had a weird feeling and when Shiloh was looking off the bridge he saw someone which was Judd Travers who was the original owner of Shiloh and still was but Judd was abusing Shiloh, so Shiloh ran away. Well, I don't want to ruin the story but Shiloh started barking like crazy when he found Judd on the side off the bridge. Marty woke up at the loud barking and noticed that Shiloh wasn't there. If it wasn't for Shiloh, Judd would've been dead. I don't really think that you can really judge a book by its cover. If you love animals then you will really love this book. It is really sad because Judd abuses his animals so bad, and it makes me get all teary. This book is the best book I have ever read. I have read this book more then 5 times. I really love to read animal books. I really wouldn't change anything about this book. I would rate this book out of 1-5, with four being that I couldn't put this book down, it was so good and one being that it was hard to stay awake, and I struggled to finish it, I would rate this book a five and beyond."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shiloh by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor is a very good children's novel. &quot;Boy and their dog stories&quot; have been kind of a staple in children's literature since Ouida's A Dog of Flanders, and this is one of the better examples. This book is narrated by Marty, and eleven-year-old from a very poor West Virginia family. He happens upon a dog one day who has noticably been abused. Marty falls for the dog, but he doesn't want to return it to its owner. Ethical questions are raised as to whether he should return the dog or keep it (steal) and lie to his parents. This novel presents a good and well-written story. It also raises some thought provoking questions and teaches some marvelous lessons. My favorite aspect of the novel was the way in which the family was written about. The setting and speech are captured exactly. The situation of a dirt-poor family that loves each other and is working to better itself is presented brilliantly. Children should read Shiloh."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"SHILOHBy: RigoThere was a pour family and they had to find food to eat. They did not have enough money to buy food, clothes, or pets.

During this vacation, she met a female beagle who was abused, and she couldn't get the dog out of her mind. So she created this book. The book became a big success, and the female beagle eventually found a home. In the third book of the trilogy, the back page has a picture of the beagle, looking fat and happy.Shiloh is a fantastic book because it opens the eyes of young readers, on how dogs don't live happy lives like they thought. They may start looking around for dogs living on chains, and when they see that, they think of Shiloh. They grow up and learn more about the plight of abused animals, and they're the people who'll change the world for pets. I am now 17 years old, and I still read the trilogy over and over, and tear up in many parts. I read this book as a young kid, and I grew up with it.

They loved this book! Now they are eager for the sequels; I suggested they read them by themselves."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"I read this book back in elementary school, and it really stuck with me. This is back when animal abuse wasn't as widely recognized or discussed, so this novel was groundbreaking in some ways. The story revolves around a boy who rescues a mistreated dog from a cruel older man. The man wants the dog back, so our protagonist attempts to hide him and keep him safe. This deals with animal abuse in a realistic way, since the abuser sees the dog as his property to do with as he pleases, and while the boy's parents feel bad for him, they must also obey the law, so this is a realistic book that isn't all happy-dappy in the resolution of the conflict. A must-read for any child!"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"What can I say. SHILOH is the book that had my children begging me to continue reading (boy and girl; 8 and 10). 'We don't need TV', they said, 'just don't stop reading, mommy'.And I think they liked it because unlike many of the books we read this one had REAL tension emanating from the pages, and not just 'pretend' drama. The story is about Marty Preston, a 10 year-old living in rural West Virginia. I'm not sure of the timeframe, but Marty's family has a television and a fridge, but not a phone.Marty's a boy, very much like my children, in that he REALLY wants a dog. Unfortunately, his family isn't in a position to afford one. BUT THEN one day he happens upon a lost beagle. The dog is skittish but eventually the two come together and it's more or less love at first sight. Only problem is that the dog belongs to another. A man name Judd, who it turns out abuses his hunting dogs -- much as he himself was abused as a child.Judd takes 'Shiloh' back and Marty is disgusted. But then Shiloh escapes again and this time Marty resolves that he won't give him up, no matter what.TALKING POINTS:::SHILOH might sound like a typical boy-and-dog book, but it's not. And what sets it apart in my view is that in keeping his promise to the dog, Marty crosses all sorts of barriers of right-and-wrong. He lies, for example, even to his family and best friend, and even resorts to blackmail at one point. Something I don't think you see in most of your standard kid books. And it's these decisions, and the threat of being caught, that created the drama that hooked my children. And which served as the basis of more than one serious conversation as we discussed what Marty did that was questionable and what we would do.Recommend this one as a good read.Pam T~(booksforkids-reviews)"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Eleven-year-old Marty Preston lives in West Virginia up in the hills close to the wilds. His family owns a property with some woods growing on it, but they are certainly not rich. The family is not exactly starving, but every cent must be counted and spent wisely on each person's needs. It is summer holidays and Marty is free to spend his time as he likes. One Sunday afternoon, after the family lunch, Marty goes for a walk in his familiar neighborhood. He intends to go into the woods, but as he passes the old Shiloh Schoolhouse, which is now closed, he meets a dog. It is a hunting dog, a beagle, but it is not fierce, as you might expect. If anything the dog is very nervous and almost grovels as it appears to ask for help. Marty calls to the dog, but it does not come. Giving up Marty continues on his way into the woods. The dog follows at a distance, but never answers Marty's calls. Finally the boy whistles and the beagle joyously comes to him. The dog follows him home and Marty begins to fantasize about keeping it. When Marty's father comes home, however, Mr. Preston immediately realizes that this must be Judd Travers' new dog. It must have lost its way. Travers lives not far from the old school. As they drive towards Travers' place the dog begins to shiver with fear. Marty is sure the dog has been mistreated, but there does not seem like anything he can do. When the dog turns up again at the Preston property though, Marty decides to take matters into his own hands. He hides the dog up in the woods. But this surely can't be a long-term solution? What will Marty do to save the dog he names Shiloh? Indeed, can Marty save Shiloh at all?We all think we know right from wrong, but what happens when the situation is complex and there are no easy answers. Is 'right' obeying strictly what the law says? What if the law can't really help, for example, if there is no evidence of a crime? But then, on the other hand, doesn't wrongdoing, like lying, result in harm, even when it is done for the right reasons? Life is not always simple, or easy, and learning to navigate these difficult circumstances is a part of growing up.Marty is the first person narrator of the story, thus we get to see into his character quite deeply. What strikes us most are Marty's good-heartedness and amiability. He is certainly a boy we would be glad to know. As Marty struggles with life and grows in understanding the reader also learns and is expanded.Judd Travers is an excellent 'bad-guy' and we are easily tempted to take Marty's side, even when we suspect that the boy is going wrong. But Travers turns out to have a human side too. Few people are all bad and Naylor refuses to draw Travers like a flat cutout figure.The story is written in a rustic, amiable, conversational style and the reader is easily caught up in the flow of events. The final confrontations between Marty and Travers are interesting and even a little nail-biting, though it could not be said that this story is action packed. This is more a psychological tale than an adventure story.This book won the American Library Association's 1992 Newbery Medal and was a No.1 bestseller. Now, almost twenty years later, this book still seems fresh and relevant and can be enjoyed by our 'computer-age' kids. A boy's love for a dog is a timeless theme. This book is the first in a trilogy. The second book is Shiloh Season and the third is Saving Shiloh. These books have also been made into successful films: The Complete Shiloh Film Collection."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shiloh, by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor is one of those works I classify as a \\"universal cross-over.\\" By that I mean that while it was written for the young boy or girl, it can nevertheless be read and enjoyed by older folks just as well, and indeed, after talking to quite a number of my reading friends, it is!This is the story of an eleven year old boy living in rural West Virginia, a small beagle, a not so nice man who has abuse the dog and a cast of very believable characters. The boy rescues the dog and the entire story is about the young mans quest to same and keep this likable pup.The story plot though is only the tip of the iceberg in this case though. The true charm and strength of this tale is the author's writing ability. The entire story is told in first person, via the little boy and we see the world through his eyes and share his thoughts and his logic. I am not sure how an adult could nail the personality of a kid so well, but she certainly has. The relationship between the small boy and the small dog is a wonder and makes the read worth the small effort it takes.Ms Naylor has also been able to capture the vernacular speech of this area perfectly. Having traveled through that area and spent considerable time there, it was like music to my ears. Our local accent and language use here in the Missouri Ozarks is quite similar so I always feel right at home and when I talk to people, I don't stand out like a sore thumb. Her description of life in that area is perfect from local customs and attitudes to her physical description of the area.Quite a number of ethical problems are presented in this book; some quite simple, some quite complex. This is an excellent work to read with your child; not to your child, but with him or her. There is much to discuss here.The author is also a master at character development and obviously knows people. There was not one character in this book that I have not met face to face, some almost on a daily bases. As I read, I felt like I actually knew the people and was instantly able to put a face to each of them. Even the \\"evil guy\\" in the story was portrayed perfectly. I personally know of at least six men right this day that could step into his shoes and fit perfectly.This is a fast read and you really owe it to yourself to pick up a copy and enjoy a reading treat. While the movie was sort of nice, it simply was no where near the quality of the actual book. Very much recommend this one. There certainly are worse ways to spend a couple of hours! For the life of me I cannot think of a negative thing to say about this work.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shiloh is a very good realistic fiction story. Shiloh's owner Judd Travers mistreats his dogs. Whenever Judd's hunting, Shiloh runs away to Marty Preston's house. Marty tries to keep Shiloh a secret up on their big hill. One night something terrible happens, so the secret slips. Marty needs to make some decisions and some lies.I love this book so much that I would read it a million times. If you want to know more about this book, get it and read it!"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Title: ShilohPublisher: Aladdin PaperbacksAuthor: Phyllis Reynolds NaylorDate: Paperback edition 2000This is a fantastic book for all ages. Shiloh deals with important ethical issues that anyone can relate to. I especially recommend this book for middle school students, as I think they will find its message especially compelling.In 1990, Shiloh won the coveted Newbery Award. It is a quick fiction read, with only 156 pages. According to Scholastic, the book is at a Grade Level equivalent of 4-6, a Lexile Framework of 890, or a 5.6 Reading Level.Shiloh tells the story of Marty, an eleven-year old boy living in rural West Virginia. His family has close relationship and strong values. Living in the country, there is an established set of social norms that all families live by. When Marty stumbles across a young beagle hiding behind a bush, he is forced to grapple with these strict social norms in his quest to define right from wrong.After spotting the Beagle, Marty notices that the dog won't stop following him. The dog is skinny and desperately in need of a meal and some love. After coxing the dog into his arms, Marty quickly falls in love with his new found friend. He names him Shiloh, and because of his owners apparent neglect and abuse, Marty vows to take care of him.Marty quickly discovers that the dog belongs to ornery man by the name of Judd Travers. After taking care of Shiloh for some time, his parents discover the dog and demand that Marty return him to his owner. In spite of his better instincts, Marty returns Shiloh to Judd Travers.Adding to the plot, Shiloh manages to escape again and find his way back to Marty. This time Marty is faced with a difficult ethical dilemma: should he return the dog to his abusive owner, or should he defy his parents to keep and protect Shiloh?After an accident in the woods, Marty's parents once again discover his secret. Despite their growing affection for the dog, his parents demand that he return the dog again to its rightful owner. At this point , Marty is so desperate to keep the dog, he offers to do almost any thing for Judd, so long as he can have Shiloh back.The book is riveting and keeps the reader engaged all the way to the last page. The characters are well developed; the reader truly feels Marty's pain as he grapples with his difficult situation. This book is a must read for all animal lovers or anyone learning to make difficult decisions.As a caveat, children without a rural background may have trouble understanding or relating to Shiloh. The book uses beautiful imagery to describe the scenery of rural West Virginia; however, this may not appeal to someone who grew up in an urban setting."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"An abused beagle runs away from his owner.

It is a sweet way of portraying love for animals. Shiloh is about an 11-year-old boy named Marty that finds a dog by a road. He decides to call him Shiloh because where he found him was near an old Shiloh Church. Later the same evening he finds out that the dog belongs to a neighbor, Judd Travers. Marty then does everything in his power to save his dog, which is one of my favorite elements of the book. This optimistic story lets you realize how much you can really love a dog. I could relate to it very well because I also am very fond of dogs.The reason I took off a star was because it got a bit boring at some moments in the book. The reason I say this is because when Marty decides to keep Shiloh in his back yard, the story starts to become a routine. It's almost like he steals food from the table, feeds Shiloh, and plays with him over and over again. But don't get me wrong, even though moments of the story are dull, it deffinately doesn't ruin the story. Even when it starts to feel like a routine, something happens exciting very quickly after. So in conclusion I give this story 4 stars because even though it gets boring at times, it's overall excellent. I would deffinately recommend this book to all animal lovers.Other titles I would recommend would be Because of Winn-Dixie and The Tale of Despereaux. I would recommend Because of Winn-Dixie because it too is an optimistic story of the amazing things children and adults would do for the love of a dog. The Tale of Despereux would be also suggested becuase it is about determined animal and shows that animals also can have personalities. I go to a middle school in North Carolina. I love to dance and run track."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"This book was a very good book. It is my favorite book ever. I am proud of the author for writing this book.

That is why I like it. I also like the author who is Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. She has also written \\"Maniac Magee\\". \\"Shiloh\\" is about a kid named Marty and his family. Marty was hunting one day and he found an adorable little beagle. He found the dog by the old Shiloh school that is why he named the dog \\"Shiloh\\".

My 11 year old loves it, and she is not an avid reader. I am reading it too and opens up great discussions."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shiloh is a simple story about a boy who falls in love with an abused dog, and a dog who returns his affection. Anybody who has ever gotten a puppy as a child will be able to relate to the adoration Marty shows the dog he names Shiloh. While this is a story for young children, its themes and ethical dilemmas are much more sophisticated than some books written for adults. Naylor asks some very interesting questions for parents to discuss with their kids, and even one another, questions that don't necessarily have a right or wrong answer.This is a great book for younger readers. They will love it because of the friendship between Marty and Shiloh, and parents will love it because it has good values and poses some excellent questions for kids, and adults, to ponder. In considering his own moral code, Marty realizes that it is wrong to lie and to steal, but he feels a stronger obligation to keep a dog from returning to its abusive owner. What makes this conflict so interesting is that adults would likely consider it much differently than children. Adults, whose moral values are more logical and place a stronger foundation on property, would say Marty should mind his own business. If there was proof of extreme abuse or neglect, the law could step in, but a dog fearful of its owner is not proof. At least not to an adult. To a child like Marty, the proof is in the animal's eyes. He couldn't forgive himself for returning an innocent animal to someone who will not treat it with love.Surprisingly, Judd, is very well-developed for being the villain of a young adult novel. Many novels or movies aimed at kids have one-dimensional or very silly villains, but Judd is much more human. I believe many of us have known someone like Judd. How Naylor resolves the conflict between Judd and Marty makes sense, and it sends a positive message. In making her villain human, she shows that though there are bad people in the world, things aren't simply black and white. You don't have to fight fire with fire. In fact, it is more effective to stand by your principles and stand up to people like Judd. Shiloh isn't just a novel about a boy who falls in love with a dog; it is about a boy who learns to be brave."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Book was delivered quickly.

It was along time until Marty saw Shiloh again, though he thought about him every day. Shiloh runs away again when Judd takes his dogs out hunting, and Marty makes a pen for the dog. But that night, a German Shepherd gets loose and jumps into Shiloh's pen, severely cutting Shiloh's ear and leg. I would rate this book a nine out of ten.

Marty found the dog again and made a pen for him. A German Shepherd bit Shiloh on the ear and on the leg. My favorite part is when Marty gets to keep Shiloh.

The thing is, his parents won't let him, so Marty secretly keeps the dog. Marty feeds the dog table scraps, eggs, whatever he can find seeing as how his family doesn't have much money. The young beagle belongs to an abusive owner, Judd Travers, who also happens to be an acholic. This is why Marty refuses to let him go. The book is for all ages, even thought it does say 9-12.

A poor hopeless little beagle named Shiloh is owned by an evil hunter named Judd who treats Shiloh very bad. The neighbor boy, named Marty feels so bad for the dog and try everything to save him.In one of the chapters, it tells how Shiloh gets hurt real bad and almost dies. Shiloh happened to be in an area when another dog attacks him. Marty hears Shiloh yelp and ran out of his house in the middle of the night to see what was happening. Shiloh's right leg was almost torn off. Marty's Dad rushed after him and they took Shiloh to the nearest Vetenarian. A few days later, Shiloh was doing better.My favorite part of the book is when Marty's Sister, Dara Lynn followed him to check on Shiloh. Marty knew his Sister hated snakes, so he made up a story and said there was a twenty-nine foot snake. She believed him and ended up going back home.I chose this book because I love dogs, especially Beagles. Shiloh is such an adorable, cute and fluffy animal.

His parents tell him he has to take the dog back Marty hates the idea of taking the dog back to its cruel owner. That moment Marty secretly decides to keep Shiloh. He named the dog Shiloh.

I realy enjoyed the way she expresses how much Marty loves Shiloh and that he'll do anything to get Shiloh even though he's Judd's dog. You can see this when Marty was willing to stand in front of Judd Travers who is a mean guy who will kill anything that moves and does anything he wants when he wants. When he gets shiloh back he will kill him for running away. Marty made a deal with Judd Travers, Marty wouldn't tell anyone that Judd killed a dear and he would work for him to earn 40$ enough to buy Shiloh."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Reading this book, I had not heard of the author Phyllis Reynolds Naylor before. So I looked her up, thinking she'd probably written a book here and there before \\"Shiloh\\" her masterpiece. To my surprise, she is nothing less than prolific. There were already thirty one children's books to her name by the time \\"Shiloh\\" was written, and undoubtedly many more to come afterwards (the \\"Shiloh\\" sequels alone give one pause). The book itself is good. Not as surprisingly good as I've found her contemporary Katherine Paterson's books to be (yay Gilly Hopkins!) but fine reading just the same. Like many of my kind, I am not a dog book lover. If I hear that there's a book out there somewhere about a boy and his dog, I am probably going to do whatever it takes to avoid reading said book. In this particular case, Naylor has cleverly chosen a breed that is not only sympathetic but adorable. Shiloh is an abused beagle. I suspect that it is not difficult to get kids to identify with a dog that shares its pedigree with Snoopy. What makes the book \\"Shiloh\\" itself stand out, however, is not its cutesy factor. Many lesser books have done similar things and few have garnered Newberrys. No, this book introduces a character that I feel is perhaps one of the most well-developed \\"villains\\" I've read. Judd, the beagle kicker, is basically a transposed Jud from \\"Oklahoma\\" with a little more humanity built into his system. Here we have a man who was undoubtedly abused himself as a child and who now takes this abuse out on the animals he keeps. In time, Judd develops a grudging respect for the boy who wants to own Shiloh so very much. The boy, Marty, is an interesting little devil himself. Here's our protagonist; a kid willing to lie and blackmail in order to get his dog. He lies and blackmails all in the name of that which is good and righteous, of course, but it's interesting to see such dealings from the mouth and head of an eleven-year-old boy. Just the same, this is a worthwhile book to read. Now admittedly, as a woman of 25 years, I'm not about to ever read this book again. No sir. But a book's readability and re-readability do not always have much to do with one another. Read this book for the well drawn characters. Stay for the cute beagle."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"The book \\"Shiloh\\" is a very dramatic book.The book had good images and was very vivid on every subject.The plot stayed together and the ending was very emotional and made sense. I enjoyed the book alot.the best part of the book was the most dramatic in my opinion. it was near the end of the book. When Jed wanted Shiloh back, and Marty refused. But Jed just took him anyway. Then Jed realized that Shiloh liked Marty more. So he opened his truck door and Shiloh took off running towards Marty.Marty ened up keeping Shiloh , and Jed found that he did have a friend, and people did care about him.The most \\"real\\" image of the story was all of the different settings. It describes the country(town) that Marty grew up in. The settings were described and detailed well.

I read it complety and Phills did a charming job.GREAT,GREAT,GREAT BOOK IT IS FILLED WITH SOME LAUGHS AND ALOT OF HOPE AND SADNESS IN THIS BOOK. If there was more than 5 stars for rating I would have rated to the top top. I recommend Because of Winn Dixie and Shiloh GREAT BOOKS."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Although this is a \\"boy loves dog\\" story in the truest sense of the term, \\"Shiloh\\" adds the dimension of animal abuse that is a contemporary concern of all that love animals. Marty is a compassionate soul whose \\"hunting\\" is more of the investigative nature than the actual killing of an animal. This aspect of the boy's character is one of the strengths especially in light of the stereotypical view of all young boys in rural America having a passion for killing. Showing that it is just as \\"manly\\" to have concern for animals, as it to hunt them, is a concept that Ms. Naylor has cleverly presented.By having the characters speak in the language and manner of the West Virginia hills, Naylor has added authenticity to her prose. The conversations between the respective personalities are both insightful and entertaining. As I read the book, I felt as if these were real people speaking to me in their natural manner.Even though the principal is a boy, I am sure that all children, regardless of gender, can relate to this boy's courage and ingenuity. Marty's devotion to the animal is certainly an attribute that all should aspire to have for others.Because of the dog's presence in the family, there are subtle changes in the family. Mother and father discover maturity in their son that hey had not seen before; the boy becomes closer to his younger sisters; and Marty realizes that he possesses perseverance and resourcefulness that would benefit him for the rest of his days. Even an \\"enemy\\" of Marty becomes a respectful acquaintance.When I first began reading the book, I thought that it would take me through familiar territory. However, I was pleasantly surprised at its originality.I cared for this boy and his dog.Children will also have these same feelings."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"The Newbery book Shiloh is a good book because it showed determination and to sacriface his life for an animal. Marty tries to keep the dog that he found but his mom and dad won't let him keep it. The ending would leave you hanging and you wouldn't know what the ending would be about the ending. I think everybody should raed this book."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"The book I have read is called Shilo. It took me 102 minutes and five days to finish. My favorite part was when Marty found a dog by a bridge that the town called Shilo Bridge. When Marty found Shilo he wouldn't go near Marty because the person who had Shilo last didn't treat him well. The part I hated most was when a mean person, who's name was Jud Travis, came to Marty's house and drove off with Shilo. It was so sad I started to cry. Read this book and find out what happens to Shilo and Marty."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Charlie Wiggins English 385 Dr. Martin Sec. 5 3/15/01 Naylor, Phyllis Reynolds. Shiloh. Dell Publishing. 1991. New York. Mills, Claudia. \\"The Structure of the Moral Dilemma In Shiloh\\". Children's Literature Annual. 1999. Vol. 27. p185.When It's Okay To LieThe story begins when eleven year old, Marty Preston, comes across a skinny malnourished beagle. Marty learns that a man who doesn't take good care of his dogs, Judd Travers, owns the Beagle. Marty refuses to return the beagle, names the dog Shiloh, and hides the dog from his parents. Marty is forced to lie, to protect Shiloh.The main theme in Shiloh is the moral dilemma that Marty faces. He comes face to face with a \\"question that professional philosophy literature has been struggling to answer. Is there always a right answer to the question \\"What should I do?\\" (Mills185-186). Marty has to decide between the law and what he feels is right. Phyllis Reynolds Naylor uses Marty and his situation to answer the age-old question \\"What should I do?\\"Marty narrates the story of he and Shiloh. This first person point of view lets us get a better idea of what Marty is going through. We get to see how he feels about each situation in which he is involved. It also allows the reader to side more with him than any other character because the reader do not know what the others are thinking and how they feel about things. With insight into Marty's feelings, the reader becomes concerned with Shiloh's well being; the reader wants to help Marty rescue Shiloh from Judd. Marty lies to Judd to save Shiloh from being kicked. He states that \\"a lie don't seem a lie anymore when it's meant to save a dog, and right and wrong's all mixed up in my head\\" (Naylor 80). We tend to agree with him on this stance because Marty makes Judd out to be such a terrible person, that Marty is made out to be in the right. He realizes that he should not be lying, but he would do anything for Shiloh. Marty feels does what he is the right thing to do; this means Marty must lie.Marty is brought up in a religious household. His mother tries to instill in him what is right and wrong. She believes that lying is wrong and tells Marty this. His mother tells him that the worst thing a person can do, is \\"become separated from God's love\\" (Naylor), and lying will do that. Marty's mother uses religion to show Marty and her other children what to do when faced with a dilemma. Marty uses his mother's beliefs to help him find out what to do with Shiloh. \\"Jesus\\" he whispers \\"'which do you want me to do? Be one hundred percent honest and carry that dog back to Judd so that one of your creatures can be kicked and starved all over again, or keep him here and fatten and glorify your creation?\\"(Naylor 57). He answers his question with his question. Marty feels that it would be better to keep Shiloh and keep him healthy, than to return him to Judd Travers, where Shiloh would be mistreated.Marty is also faced with the problem of obeying the law. By him keeping the dog he is breaking the law, since he basically stole Shiloh from Judd. After a neighbor's dog attacks Shiloh, the family learns that Marty has been lying to them. Marty's father says that Shiloh must be returned. He says that the dog is not Marty's; he belongs to whoever has paid for him. \\"Marty claims that it is love, not money, that should establish ownership\\" (Mills 192). Marty says \\"Mine more than Judd's! . . . . .He only paid money for him. I'm the one who loves him\\" (Naylor 82). Marty also uses the law to get what he needs. One day he comes across Judd shooting a deer, which are out of season. Since Judd has already said that he would not sell Shiloh, Marty bargains with Judd. He ends up convincing Judd to sell Shiloh, but only if Marty works twenty hours at Judd's house (Naylor 125-126).Marty is trying to separate what is right from what is legally and religiously required (Mills 193). Marty's dad tells him, \\"I want you to do what's right\\" to which Marty responds \\"What's right?\\"\\" (Naylor 94). His father has no answer. There is no finite response to the question \\"What should I do?\\" You have to look into yourself and decide what is right; the only thing to do is to go with your gut."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Lately I've been recalling some of the books I read in school, since it will be only a couple of years before I graduate from school.

It won the John Newbery Medal in 1992. It would make a good family read aloud.Shiloh is about an abused dog that keeps running off. The dog, Shiloh, always ends up with a boy named Marty Preston. One time Marty keeps Shiloh and when his owner Judd Travers finds out Shiloh is hurt, he agrees to let Marty keep him for five days. When the time was up, Marty walks to Judd's, and sees him shoot a deer out of season. Marty uses it against him. He tells Judd, \\"Now I'm telling you I mean to keep him, and you expect to keep that deer without a fine, you'll make the trade.\\" Judd agrees to trade Shiloh for 20 hours of work from Marty and the secret.My favorite part of this book is when Marty first finds Shiloh. Marty was walking by the old Shiloh school house when he first saw the dog. The dog followed him home. Marty's Dad came home and made Marty return the dog to Judd.

WAY TO GO, MARTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"This is a powerful, heart-warming story about Marty, an 11-year-old boy who lives with his family in rural West Virginia, where people own hunting dogs and where everybody lives by minding their own business. Through a series of believable incidents, a beagle follows Marty home. It is clear to the boy that the dog has been abused: not by being beaten, but by other means. The dog, whom Marty names Shiloh, belongs to a neighbor, Judd Travers, who trains his hunting dogs by not feeding them if they disobey him. Marty wants to keep Shiloh, but his parents tell him that is against the law because Judd Travers owns Shiloh.Marty and his father return Shiloh to Judd Travers, but the dog runs away again and Marty keeps him hidden. Under Marty's care, Shiloh is attacked by a large German Shepherd and very seriously hurt. In order to save Shiloh's life, Marty and his father rush the doctor to a vet and pay the doctor. The dog will live, but it will have a limp. Nevertheless, Judd wants the dog back. Marty offers to buy the dog, but Judd won't sell.More tension is added to this already-tense situation when Marty observes Judd breaking the law. But in a beautiful twist, showing that people are more complex than they appear on the surface, the author turns the story toward resolution and a happy but very realistic ending. Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"this is on my favor books in and I'm 28. it still makes me a little teary eyed ... it was a really good price and it was delivered on time .

The dog has not run away without good reason; his owner, Judd Travers, disciplines his dogs by kicking them and starving them. The dog is returned to his owner, but when the dog runs away again, Marty can't bear to send the dog, who Marty names Shiloh, back to such a life. Instead, Marty hides Shiloh in the woods behind his house and tells what becomes a nest of lies to his parents, his friends, and the dog's owner.Of course, Marty is soon found out and Judd Travers is determined to have the dog returned to him. But Marty catches Travers hunting deer out of season and at last has a way to obtain Shiloh for his own. As a part of the agreement, Marty goes to work for Travers. The two talk each day and Marty learns more of Travers. Gradually, they forge a relationship that enables them to get along.One of my favorite Newbery winners."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"I read this book in my fourth grade class, about twelve years ago. I loved it in class, and went on to read the rest of the series (it's a trilogy, if I remember correctly). The storyline is compelling, but not confusing.

His evil-hearted neighbor, Judd Travers, starves and kicks his hunting dogs, including Marty's new friend. When Marty finds this dog, he names it Shiloh and keeps him a secret from everyone. Judd goes on a search for Shiloh, and Marty's dad promises to give the dog back if he finds it. Marty knows that giving Shiloh back is technically the right thing to do, but asks himself why doing the right thing feels so wrong. When a German shepherd breaks loose and attacks Shiloh, Shiloh is severely injured and has to be treated. Marty's secret about Shiloh is jeopardized when Shiloh is taken to the vet. Marty eventually comes to the point where he has to confront the person he's most afraid of in the world, Judd, and tells him he's not giving the dog back. The problem is that Judd isn't willing to give Shiloh up that easily.Shiloh is a heart-warming book and definitely a page turner. The book not only highlights the unconditional love a boy can feel for a dog but will also appeal to the reader's emotions. At some points in the book, you will feel sorrow and sympathy while at other points you will feel jubilant and happy for Shiloh. Shiloh is a great book and it is definitely one of my favorites. One lesson I took from the book is that sometimes breaking the rules is the right choice; particularly when the well being of an animal is at stake. People who love pets will love this book with a passion, but even if you don't love pets, I can almost guarantee it will still be a page turner.I recommend Shiloh to anyone, especially those who love a good read. It is an inspiring, heart-warming book that gets you hooked in the first few pages. If I could have, I would have read the book in one sitting. Shiloh made me think about all the animals in the world that are neglected and abused. Was Shiloh given a happy ending and allowed to live with Marty, or was he sent back to being a prisoner? I recommend you read Shiloh and find out for yourself."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"My name is Trevor and I read Shiloh in my 4th grade class. I think Shiloh is an outstanding book. Shiloh is about a boy named Marty who was out wondering around and saw a dog. The dog followed him everywhere. When he got home his parents took the dog to a neighbor named Judd who just got a dog. It was Judds dog. The dog kept coming back to Marty. Marty finally took the dog and kept him in a pen near the woods. The dog got attacked by another dog. He was fine after a few days at the doctor. Judd came to get his dog because he found out they had him. He found out by a friend of his who saw the dog. Did they get the dog back? Read the book and find out.

Shiloh is a young beagle pup, who is owned by a mean man named Judd Travers. Marty feels for the way the dog is treated, and agrees to work for Judd to obtain ownership of Shiloh. However, many challenges face Marty when he is refused the dog for payment. Also after receiving Shiloh as payment, Judd will not leave Marty or Shiloh alone.There were two main key points in the book of Shiloh that Phyllis Reynolds Naylor is trying to stress. One is the devoted love of an eleven-year-old boy to a young beagle pup. This is where Phyllis dwells most on the story, is building the friendship and hidden bond between the boy and the dog. The other main point that the author is trying to stress is the willingness of love and loyalty. For instance, dwelling on Marty working for Judd, to pay him off in exchange for Shiloh. This helps better demonstrate the boy's determination of owning the dog. It also clearly demonstrates the love and caring that Marty has for the dog. It shows the effect of working to pay for a dog, in whom he dearly loves. Overall &quot;Shiloh&quot; is a book anyone should read to better understand the saying of &quot;dog is man's best friend&quot;."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"I think Shiloh is a great book because the book is saying never give up and you'll come out on top.

Well Marty has Marty is an 11 year old boy living in West Virginia. Living there is a mean old grump named Judd Travers. He is a hunter who uses he's dogs for hunting and absolutely nothing else, and when I mean nothing I mean NOTHING.He chains up his dogs, nearly starves them to death, and he even ends up shooting them. If the dog doesn't listen then BAM they get kicked. If you want to know what Marty does then swing on by your nearest library and pick up Shiloh written by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor with 144 pages.Marty takes on many challenges along the way. Some things Marty faces are Judd Travers, a German Sheppard, and even his own mom and dad. His first and biggest challenge was Judd Travers a just plain mean guy. One day on Marty's birthday, Marty goes hunting in the woods and notices a small Beagle walking behind him. He tries to get the Beagle to come closer to him but the Beagle is to shy. That night Marty finds out that the beagle is Judd Travers dog. That's when Marty gets determined to get the Beagle. The reason why Marty wants to get the beagle is because Judd Travers abuses his dogs. After Marty first saw the beagle In the woods, he saw the beagle many more times. At this point all Marty wanted was that shy beagle. And Marty has something on Judd............ something that would give Marty more power, more than Judd could handle. Another thing you might want to know is how the beagle got his name. Well, that's just another mystery waiting to be uncovered by you.My favorite part of the book is when Marty tries to get Shiloh from Judd Travers. The main thing Marty did was that he worked for Judd Travers. Another thing he did was to make a cage to keep Shiloh in. There are many other things he did to get Shiloh. But you won't know until you read the book.The most important thing I've learned from this book is that you have to work hard and never give up to get what you want.Some other books written by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor are Saving Shiloh, and Shiloh Season, these are the remaining books after Shiloh.

It is a decent story about a boy and his dog, and a very short book to. It is about a boy named Marty who has a poor family, and hides their cruel neghbor's dog who is being treated badly. I guess it isn't to bad. It also has horrible grammar."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"The story of an earnest and lovely little eleven year old boy who comes from a VERY REAL po' white trash West Virginia family and who befriends and protects an abused beagle. It's a surprisingly powerful and universal story, as the little beagle really represents not only the boy's wounded inner self who he wished his shut-down parents would protect...but the wounded, neglected and abused inner selves within each of us. The boy's love and protection of the beagle represents the parents we always wished we had had, and perhaps even thought (or still think) we had.Book's weak point: The author sacrificed potential emotional depth for the smiles and hugs of a happy ending. I think a much more realistic ending would have been the father disregarding the feelings of his sensitive son and sending the dog back to the abusive owner, the mother not lifting a finger to protect her son's feelings, and the owner killing the dog as he promised all along. Basically, I think the author didn't have the guts to do it, and thus be able to transmit a real message to the audience about how the world is - essentially how cruel and uncaring parents really can be. The boy becoming aware of such things would have hurt (him and us), but would at least have been REAL and given us the base of potential from which to GROW and not just keep our heads in the sand, leading us further down the path of denial...and ultimately toward perpetuating the same patterns those parents did.

Much of the genius of \\"Shiloh\\" can be found in its simplicity. At its core, this is a tale about love, loyalty, and family. It is perhaps even more relevant today than when it was published, for the financial struggles of the protagonist's family are something that many families are currently dealing with in these difficult times of economic hardship. In the face of these challenges, our characters (and the readers following them) come to understand the necessity of supporting your family, and the values of taking responsibility for the life of another living being (and the empathy that such a thing instills).I strongly recommend \\"Shiloh\\" for children. It's a great book, and relatively short, as well, which should make it more accessible for reluctant readers. Those who have a fondness for dogs will be even more inclined to enjoy it. As far as how adults will perceive it, those who appreciate children's literature will like it, for the author writes in an engaging voice, entertaining voice."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"I live this book I read it ten times and I want to read it againIt is amazing!

I definitely recommend this to whoever loves dogs. This book is sooooooooooooo AWESOME!THE END"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Have you ever faced a time when you know you must do the right thing, even if it seems wrong? The main character in Shiloh, Marty Preston, has a very difficult time trying to figure out what is right and wrong. The first of a three book series, Shiloh is a book mainly about a mistreated dog named Shiloh that runs away from his home to 11-year old boy, Marty Preston. Marty soon falls in love with Shiloh and tries to rescue him from the evil Judd Travers, Shiloh's cruel owner. Even though the Preston family cannot afford a dog, Marty is willing to do whatever it takes to save his tortured friend.Phyllis Reynolds Naylor did an excellent job writing this book. Shiloh mainly goes in chronological order, with a few flashbacks scattered throughout. I think she did this because the book was written in a Southern accent, and it is harder to understand reading an English dialect, unless you are from the South. This realistic fiction book is somewhat similar to Old Yeller. Both books tell two lives of two dogs, but the family perspectives tend to be different. I am guessing the theme of Shiloh is to do whatever it takes to do what you think is right. When Marty first discovers Shiloh, he knows the dog must be kept secret. Marty realized if his family knew his secret, they would instantly tell Judd, and the dog would be mistreated once more. While reading the book, I found it comical at points in the ways he tried to keep Shiloh.Because Phyllis Reynolds Naylor has written over 100 children's books in all sorts of genres, I recommend Shiloh to just about anybody. Dog lovers would probably enjoy it more though. During the book, I found myself laughing and crying because at points, I could relate to how Marty feels about Shiloh. I tried to read it a little slower because of the slang-like terms throughout the whole thing. I hope this book review will encourage you, as well as others, to read the entire Shiloh trilogy: Shiloh, Shiloh Season, and Saving Shiloh."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Phyllis Reynolds Naylors' book Shiloh is not just a book about a boy and his dog.

Marty sees that Shiloh looks abused so this makes Marty want to take care of him. There are many obstacles that Marty goes through to try an save Shiloh. You must read the story to find out how far Marty goes to save him. I like this story because it taught me about integrity and also about standing up for what you believe in even if it's standing up against an adult. I happen to be 11 years-old, the same age as the boy in the story and I like dogs! This is why I think boys my age will especially like it. It has many adventures. I highly recommend you pick it up!

IT'S WHERE MARTY GETS HIS DOG THAT HE DREAMED OF FOR SO LONG, AND WORKED SO HARD FOR. THE END WAS AS GOOD AS THE THE ENTIRE BOOK"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"The children's novel Shiloh is about a young boy, Marty Preston, who encounters a stray dog on one of his summer adventures through the West Virginia countryside. Marty befriends the dog only to find out that he belongs to Judd Travers, a hunter who abuses his dogs. Knowing in his heart that he cannot return the dog he has named Shiloh, Marty cares for the dog himself and eventually ends up working to buy Shiloh from Judd. Throughout this story, the character of eleven-year-old Marty goes through a metamorphosis as he develops from innocence to maturity with an understanding that life is not always just, and adult responsibility is complicated. At the beginning of the story, Marty is just an ordinary child enjoying a summer of frolicking in the hills of West Virginia with his .22 rifle. His moral development begins when he sees Shiloh for the first time and realizes he has been abused because of the dog's reluctant and almost fearful nature. After Marty decides to keep Shiloh, his internal conflicts begin when first he is forced to deal with the issue of legality versus morality. He knows that Shiloh legally belongs to Judd; however, Marty knows that the dog will end up being starved or even killed if he returns to his owner. Secondly, Marty feels anxious for deceiving his family. He has kept Shiloh a secret, and he has used food to feed Shiloh that the family needs. Marty feels great remorse for the pitiful impression he gives others of his family as he asks Mrs. Howard for extra cookies and Mr. Howard for scraps of cheese; however, he feels Shiloh's well-being is worth his family's reputation for being poor. The last &quot;internal conflict&quot; that Marty wrestles with is the issue of whether the dog is worth the hard labor Marty has to give to Judd in order to keep Shiloh. Judd Travers makes him slave away, almost unfairly, to win the legal rights of the dog. Throughout this novel, Marty learns the value of responsibility and all that it entails along with the costs of doing what is morally right. Jeanne Harms and Lucille Lettow propose that, &quot;.. dialoguing with oneself the reader brings different inner audiences into the reading experience, thus expanding the possibilities for creating meaning&quot; (Harms 210). By analyzing Marty's character development, it is evident to the reader that these &quot;internal voices&quot; cause the protagonist to become a strong and successful character, and therefore by reading this book, the reader deals with the &quot;inner voices&quot; along with Marty. This novel forces the reader, child or adult, to battle out similar situations and, in effect, gain far more from the book than just a simple moral. This in turn, causes readers to grow personally by relating to the situations of conflict such as lying to family or doing what is right versus what is legal. By dialoguing with oneself the reader brings different inner audiences into the reading experience (Harms 210). Marty's &quot;internal conflict&quot; is the driving force behind his character development"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"This book isn't a lot of fun, but it is very interesting and has some good things to teach anyone who reads it. Marty's descion about Shiloh will agree or disagree with many readers and spark some good debates. The style of writing, the way it is totally in the present tense and the way Marty talks in his southern way is very original and beautiful. It's a good book for what it is but I wouldn't reccomend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"If you want a book that's a real page-turner that you'll never want to put down. Than read a book that I really enjoyed called Shiloh. You'll love it!The great book that I'm writ ting about is Shiloh the author is Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. I give this book five stars because it was a great page-turner that I enjoyed very much. This book is a great realistic fiction book. This book is 144 pages long and is a great medium-sized book that I loved and I think you'll love it also.My favorite part was when Shiloh followed Marty, the main character home. Then Marty made a pen for Shiloh, which no one knew about. I think they really met at that part, it was great.Shiloh the book is mainly about a dog named Shiloh and a boy named Marty. First a dog just followed Marty home. Marty grew to love the dog so he named him Shiloh then, he made a pen for him up in his father's woods......... no one knew. Then Marty's ma, Lou, found out and promised not to tell. But, that night they heard squealing from the woods.... Shiloh was injured. Bad.So, Dad and Marty took him to Doc Murphy, the doctor, and he helped them by stitching Shiloh up. But by morning the whole family knew. Then Judd, the original Shiloh owner found out and you'll have to read the rest of the book to find out what happens next! A few other great books that are in the Shiloh series are Shiloh Season and Saving Shiloh. Another similar book is called Old Yeller. It is also a great book. Although these are great books they are not for everyone as these books may be a little disturbing and they cuss once or twice. I recommend these books for ages 9 to adult. I recommend this book for kids but it is also great for adults. I think you will absolutely love it. It has great parts, bad parts, sad parts and mad parts. Overall, I thought this was the best book ever."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"11-year-old Marty happens across a pup, obviously injured. He soon grows attached to the pup, naming him Shiloh after where he found him. The pup, however, belongs to Judd, a notorious poacher. Marty is then faced with a difficult choice: Return the pup to Judd where it will be abused, or lie to his parents and keep the pup? Marty chooses the latter and, with a little work, sets out to make Shiloh his own.While the novel relies a bit too heavily on stereotype, it is a well-written tale that displays the complexity of Maty's choice. He is forced to trade one wrong for another, yet in the end, at least to Marty, the ends justify the means. If you like contemporary realistic fiction and animal stories, you will love this one."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"\`Shiloh' was one of my favorite novels as a young boy. I can still remember reading it in school and being fascinated with the concept, with the storyline and underlining morals that forced me to think about things in a way I never had before. The overall plot may seem to be simple enough. A young boy named Marty finds a beagle he names Shiloh (after the place he found him). The dog, as it so happens, is being abused by his master Judd and Marty vows to rescue the dog whatever way he can. The great thing about \`Shiloh' is that it's not that simple.Phyllis Reynolds Naylor beautifully creates a moral battle within this young boy and everyone around him. Ethically taking this dog would be stealing, and stealing is wrong. But on the other hand of ethics there is the fact that bringing this dog back to his owner would mean subjecting a helpless creature to pain and fear. When his parents are telling him the right thing is to return the animal that is not rightly his, but his heart is telling him that returning him is not an option Marty has to decide for himself the right path to take.Children's novels have a history of presenting moral issues subtly, but here the conflict of morality is presented bluntly and left for the reader to learn along with Marty. When Marty becomes determined to keep Shiloh any way that he can he comes up with an idea that may appease both side of the issue. I'll leave that for you to read on your own.Be aware that \`Shiloh' is classic children's literature and will remain in your hearts forever after your first reading. It's the definition of satisfying reading no matter what your age is, boy or girl, man or woman I promise that this is not an experience you'll regret. It's a relatable story because it exposes a principle that all humans, children and adults alike with be tested on in there day to day and despite what you may initially think, there's a lot to be learned from this boy and his dog."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"I purchased this book for my 11 year old grandson. He needed a book to read at school when his work was finished. He is captivated by the story. Everyday he comes home from school telling what is happened in the book. He even told me that his teacher asked him to stop doing his work so fast just so he could read Shiloh. Now that's a great book, one that you can hardly wait to get back to reading!"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"This was my daughters next pick off of the Newberry Awards list. Unfortunately, I am finding that some of the content of some of the books on the Newberry list are not quite appropriate for my daughter yet. I would never censor what she reads, but the subject matter is not appropriate for a seven-year old.Fortunately, this was not one of those books. There were things we had to talk about such as the difference between the south during that era and now. Some of the language I had to explain. Not inappropriate, just not used anymore. As a seven-year old, she would have had trouble reading this book, even though she is an advanced reader. The dialect was best read aloud by an adult or older reader.This is the story of a boy and his dog, or rather a boy and someone elses dog. Marty is an eleven-year old boy that enjoys wandering the wilderness around his family home. One day he finds a small beagle following him around. The beagle is obviously shy, but continues to follow Marty home. Marty gains his trust and they instantly form a bond. Unfortunately when Marty's Father gets home, he insists that they must return the dog to his owner. He suspects the dog belongs to Judd Travers, a local hunter.They drive the dog to Judd Travers' house and he confirms the dog is his and gives him a great big kick for running off. Marty is horrified. He can't understand how anyone could treat a dog that way. His mind will not let him rest. He is continuously thinking of the dog he calls Shiloh.Shiloh runs off again, and Marty finds him. This time he is determined to save him from Judd. He knows it is wrong to lie to his parents and keep the dog even though he belongs to someone else, but he can't let Shiloh go back. The lies eat at him daily. He hates lying.The rest of the story is about the struggle Marty fights within himself. He knows there are wrongs on both sides...but how can he choose? I will leave the ending of the book out so as to not spoil it for you. I would highly recommend this book. It won the Newberry Award in 1992.~Jenn"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"ShilohThe author who wrote this book was Phyllis Naylor. The other book that he wrote was King of the Playground, Roxy and the hooligans, a spy Among the Girls, Saving Shiloh. The genre was non fiction and the book theme is kind of said. The main characters are Marty, Becky, Shiloh, Ma, Dad, and Judd Travers and my favorite character is Marty because he cares for a dog that has came to him and that Marty thinks that Judd should not treat his doges bad because Marty thinks that is wrong and that he should name his dogs like a real name like Shiloh and other names of his dogs.Marty wants to keep Shiloh but he didn't want Judd to keep him or he would beat the daylights out of Shiloh and that was not what Marty to happen to him and when mart first saw him Judd he did not feed him and Judd put him right in front of the other dogs so that will teach him not to run away from him again but Shiloh did and Judd did not find him for a while until the German Sheppard bit him in his leg and part of Shiloh's ear was hanging off of his body and when one of Judd friends found him on the back porch of doc Murphy's porch and then he told Judd and he went over to Marty's house and found him hurt. You would have to read the book to find out the end.I would to like to recommend this book this book to people that like dogs and care for dogs and that does not that like to abuse dogs than this is what the should read.That this book is all about a dog that Marty found at the Shiloh school house and that Marty had fell in love with this dog and he didn't want Judd to have because he always treat his dog wrong and that felt wrong to Marty and that he didn't want Judd to beat him so he Kept it from and made sure that no one found out about him."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"The place where the boy Marty lives was a poor town, and I thawt the beginning was pretty good. But about the middle when the mom says she keeps secrets from her husband. That was a little unrealistic. What I think the writer should have written was that she tells her husband every thing but this time she didn't. I don't realy think the part with Shiloh in the cage and a dog broke in and tore up Shiloh like a toy. That's not that realistic I don't think he would survive. Other than these two things the rest of the story was pretty good.Now they think that was the best in the story was the part when he played with Shiloh it was so good.

Though Marty believes Shiloh came to him for help, his father makes it clear that he must not interfere in their neighbor's business, even if that neighbor is Judd Travers, a thoroughly unlikable man who abuses his dogs. When Shiloh comes to him a second time though, Marty has to choose between his love for Shiloh or obedience to his father. Though I had to do some minor editing while reading aloud to my preschool-aged children, this is a very engaging story full of struggle, devotion, and suspense that had my son (and hubby) begging for more. Naylor expertly reeled us in from the first chapter as we got wrapped up in Marty's concern for Shiloh and she kept us expectantly turning the pages to find out what would happen next.Positive Elements: Marty and his family are very hard-working and ethical. Though they don't appear to attend church regularly, Marty often prays and considers what Jesus would think about his actions. Marty's devotion and loyalty to Shiloh push him into moral dilemmas (some parents may view this as a negative), including blackmail and lying, which I used as a springboard to discuss these issues with my children.Negative Elements: There are scenes that some children will find frightening or disturbing, including the mistreatment of animals and the killing of a deer. There is some mention of alcohol consumption and also some language that I edited out as I read, including vain reference to God."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Have you ever wanted to help an animal who has been mistreated?

Other characters are Shiloh and Judd Travers. Shiloh is a dog who helps Marty learn perservance. Judd is Shiloh's owner who tests Marty's word and devotion for Shiloh.The theme is when you love someone or something you are willing to do anything. In this book Marty loves Shiloh so much, he hides him, lies to his family, steals food and works to earn him.The plot begins when Marty finds a beagle dog in the hills and names him Shiloh. Shiloh belongs to Judd, a drunk who beats his dogs. Marty's dad makes him return Shiloh to Judd. Shiloh runs back to Marty. Marty hides Shiloh, but his parents find out when Shiloh gets attacked by another dog. While Shiloh is healing, Judd tells Marty he will sell Shiloh for $40.00, and he can work over at his place. Marty agrees and starts work, but Judd says he can't have Shiloh. Marty is surprised but continues to work. He returns the next couple of days although Judd tries to make him quit by making his work harder. Marty keeps working because he knows Shiloh needs him. On the last day of work, Judd gives Marty a collar for his new dog.I really liked this book because it made me feel sad, happy, frustrated, relieved, scared, angry, hopeful and triumphant! My favorite part was when Marty's mom snuck up on him and saw Shiloh. It was shock because I wasn't expecting his mom to follow him and when he turned around she was right there. I felt relieved because Marty didn't have to keep secrets anymore.My overall opinion is that it was an excellent book about a boy and his dog. I recommend this book to dog lovers and non dog lovers alike. I will be reading the next two books in this series.A review by Austin 9yrs old."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shiloh, by Phyllis Naylor, is a story of boy and a dog. Marty, the boy, is walking when he sees a hurt, hungry dog by Shiloh School. He becomes attached to it and names it Shiloh (after the school). Only later he is devastated to learn Shiloh belongs to Judd Travis, a mean man who mistreats animals and hunts out of season. Marty is forced to give him back to Judd until one day when Shiloh runs away again, and returns to Marty. Marty hides him at his hill, giving him food and starts building up lies.The idea of this book is that it is better to tell the truth than to build up lies to get something. Marty lies and lies to keep Shiloh, giving hard earned food to him.Shiloh is written in a first person style. You can tell Marty doesn't have much of an education because of his grammar. For example, \\"A lie don't seem a lie anymore when it's meant to save a dog, right and wrongs all mixed up in my head\\". Another example is \\"I figure a dog's the same as a kid. You don't treat a kid right, he'll run off first chance he gets, too\\".Marty's world takes place in the hills behind Friendly, West Virginia. You can tell that Marty lives in an old house and isn't having the easiest time with money. However, the family is still happy, and works hard for their food (which he gives Shiloh) that they eat.Marty is an average 11 year old boy. He is determined to get what he wants, and has a certain way to reach his goal (even if he must lie).Shiloh is a beagle, hungry and tired at first. He never cries and always behaves. He is extremely cute, and as you get to know him throughout the story, you can't help but wish he was your dog.The book Shiloh is based on an event Phyllis Naylor went through, so the book is realistic fiction. When Phyllis Naylor visited West Virginia, she saw the saddest looking dog in her life. So, she wrote a book about it. Later, her friends in West Virginia told her they found the dog, took him in, and named him Clover.Shiloh is a touching story I suggest for all dog lovers, or simply someone who wants a good story. Shiloh is the kind of book that makes you want to continue to read no matter what time or place. You constantly flip the pages."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"I really like this book so I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars. Below I'm going to explain what I like and didn't like about the book.At the beginning of the book I really liked how Shiloh always followed Marty around and tried to become friends. Shiloh would follow Marty across the bridge and to his house when he went outside. When Marty got to know Shiloh really well he would feed and take care of Shiloh. Marty did this because he knew that Judd didn't take care of his hunting dogs very well.In the middle of the book I liked how Marty comes up with many ways to earn money so he can buy Shiloh from Judd. Marty thinks about collecting alumnium cans, recycling glass bottles, baby sitting or delivering catalogs. But finally he decides to work for Judd. At Judd's house Marty has to do all the chores to earn enough money to buy Shiloh.By the time I got to the end of the story there were somethings I didn't like. For example, when Judd threatened to shoot Shiloh because he wasn't a very good hunting dog. There were also some parts of the book that were confusing. Finally, I didn't like it when Shiloh was caught in the hunting trap."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"I gave the book Shiloh four stars because I thought Shiloh was a really good book for those of us who like dogs. The part that really stood out to me was the perserverance he had to keep the dog. For example, when he had to sneak out in the middle of the night to feed Shiloh. The part that was funny to me was when Jud Traverse fell over a rabbit trap and got it caught on his bottom.

Marty struggles with the moral dilemma of his parents being poor and can't afford another mouth to feed, and the knowledge that the owner is abusing the dog.

The central character, Marty, is part of a Christian chain of events. Marty saves the adorable beagle pup's life. He is able to forgive the cruel man who beat and neglected the hound. Marty's parents and sisters are also loving, richly drawn and wonderful characters who add to the story. Mere words do not do this justice. It is and will remain a timeless classic.A salute to the author -- in recent years I adopted a beagle from the shelter. She, like Shiloh, had been beaten and left to roam the streets. Shiloh was loosely based on a dog named \\"Clover\\" who, like Shiloh, was adopted into a loving home. (There is a large female beagle in my neighborhood named Shiloh. She's beautiful).My beagle has been a pet therapy dog for senior citizens in a nearby nursing home. She has been great medicine for the folks there and one nurse said she had gotten a beagle because she liked my dog. She couldn't think of a name for the dog, so I suggested \\"Clover,\\" in honor of the literary Shiloh's real counterpart. \\"Clover, like in a good luck charm,\\" I said at the time. I was delighted to learn days later she named her hound Clover. Shiloh is a continuum of love. It's great."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Crack!

Think before you Newbery -- the Newbery people are notoriously anti-family."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Author Phyllis Reynolds Naylor captures the heart of kindness in her book, Shiloh. The book centers around Marty Preston, an 11-year-old boy with a warm spot in his heart for Shiloh, a shy, skinny, abused beagle who follows Marty home one day.Shiloh is owned by Judd Travers, a dog abuser and mean, illegal hunter who drinks too much alcohol.Ma, Marty's mother, is the first person to find out that Marty was hiding Shiloh. Dad, Marty's father, believes in legal ownership and thinks that Marty should give Shiloh back. Betty, Marty's youngest sibling, annoys Marty throughout the book. Dara Lynn, Marty's middle sister, comforts Marty when he is forced to give back Shiloh.The story takes place in Friendly, a small, rural community in West Virginia.Marty comes upon a dog when he is walking by a creek. The dog is in horrible condition. When Marty finds out it is Judd Travers' dog, he knows he must save him. His dad forces Marty to take the dog back to Judd. The second time the dog comes to Marty, Marty names him Shiloh and secretly keeps the dog in a homemade pen.Shiloh was a secret until Marty's mom found out about him. She tells Marty that if he doesn't run away with the dog, she'll wait to the following day to tell his dad. That night, a German Sheppard jumps over the fence of the pen and attacks Shiloh. Judd finds out that Marty had his lost dog from Doc Murphy who saves Shiloh's life. Judd demands the dog back when he recovers.

He tells Judd he'll tell the game warden if he doesn't make a deal to sell Shiloh to Marty. Judd tells Marty that if he worked 20 hours for him he would give him Shiloh.In the end, Marty teaches Judd to be nicer to animals and gets Shiloh for himself.The theme of the story is to be nicer to creatures big and small, work hard for what you believe in and remember that acts of kindness can make people good.I highly recommend this book to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shiloh's author is Phyllis Reynolds Naylor and I give her marvelous book a four star rating.This book touched me at my heart with all the unintentional love. I only gave it four stars because I couldn't relate all that well to Marty, an eleven-year-old boy who is the main character and will do anything to protect a loving dog. I understood him because he is only one-year younger than me. The time difference confused me; he didn't even have a phone in his house. I also didn't give her that star because there is a flash of gore and that always creeps me out. I did love the other parts. All the surprises made it thrilling. You think that they are going to do one thing but they turn around and do something totaly different. Like Marty's mom, you think she is going to yell at Marty but she has a smile on her face.If you like a lot of love and some adventure you would absolutely like this book called Walk Two Moons.

The book I read was a heartwarming and adventurous book about a boy and a dog called Shiloh. Shiloh was written in 2000 by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. Phyllis Reynolds Naylor has written tons of other books including Jade Green and Blizzard's Wake. Shiloh is a shorter and awesome realistic fiction book that has won the Newberry Medal and is on the ALA booklist. It is definitely a great read.The book Shiloh was very addicting. In the book the main character, Marty, meets a dog one day. When the dog follows Marty home he is not allowed to keep it. But after he finds the same dog again he is not going to let it happen again. Then the dog gets seriously injured and fixed up by a doctor and Shiloh is forced to leave. Marty has to think and work to get the dog back. This shows the boy's love and compassion for the dog.I loved the book Shiloh. I liked it so much because of the heartwarming plot. What made the plot so good was that Marty was so caring to the dog and that's what was so heartwarming. One thing that was caring was I loved how Marty and Shiloh started an instant love as soon as they laid eyes on each other. I thought that it was caring that the doctor, a person doctor, saw Shiloh when he was injured even though it was the middle of the night and he was not a veterinarian. Lastly, I thought that it was loving that Marty went all of that trouble just to get Shiloh for himself. Shiloh is a very heartwarming book.Another thing I liked about the book was the description of the characters. It always described all of the characters feelings, features, and emotions. For example I liked how it always thoroughly described Marty's feelings like when he said \\"I was so scared my stomach turned\\". I also liked how it described the dog's features especially when he was hurt or sad. Also Judd was described so well that it made me scared of him just as much as Marty was. I really liked the descriptions in this book.Overall Shiloh is a great story about a boy and a dog. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a happy, exciting, and heartwarming story. A story so happy that it makes you cheer out loud. I liked the awesome twist at the end of this book. The author of this book is a genius! This book ROCKS!"},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"The book I read was Shiloh by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. She published Shiloh, a fictional book, made in 2000 and it won a Newberry Medal. It was also on the ALA booklist. Other books Phyllis wrote was Achingly Alice, Agony of Alice, Alice in April, and a lot of other books. Overall I thought the book was wonderful. I loved how the author wrote it! If you love dogs you will love Shiloh.The book Shiloh is about a boy named Marty and a dog that follows him home one day. He takes care of the dog and names him Shiloh. He doesn't tell his parents he is hiding a dog. Especially, when he finds out it is Judd Travis's dog, which he beats them. One night a German Shepard attacked Shiloh and the dad finds out that Marty was hiding Judd's dog. The dad takes the dog to a doctor they know. Will the dog die or live? You will have to read the rest of the book to find out.Marty is very caring character, especially when Shiloh followed Marty home. Marty made a little house for Shiloh to sleep in and play in. Marty also brought him breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but his parents didn't know he had a dog on the hill. Marty was also very caring when the German Shepard attacked Shiloh and Shiloh was bleeding half to death. Marty and his dad brought Shiloh to a doctor. Also Marty was caring and loving when Shiloh was at the doctor's because he couldn't stop thinking of Shiloh and how he was doing or if he was died.The author was very descriptive when Marty went to Friendly, the neighborhood, to see his friend David. I visualized David's house well, when the author wrote, \\"There was a huge house on the left and then there was David's house, the largest, beautiful house Marty had ever seen\\". The author was also very descriptive when Marty was making a little house for Shiloh up on the hill. The author told me what Marty used and where he got it from. The author was also very descriptive when the German Shepard attacked Shiloh and the author talked how Shiloh wasn't moving and his leg was bleeding very badly.Overall I thought the book was great, even though there were some emotional parts.

When Marty arrives home his parents ask him where he got the dog from, Marty responded with \`I don't know the dog found me'. Marty's father thought about the dog a little and then remembered that Judd Travers said that he had lost his dog that morning hunting. After Marty and his family ate dinner, Marty and his father left out for Judd Travers house to return Shiloh to Judd Travers.When Marty found out that his dad thought that Shiloh belonged to Judd Travers Marty was about to cry, he didn't want to return Shiloh to Judd Travers because Judd abused his dogs, Judd would kick and yell at his dogs when they weren't obeying him. Marty didn't want to return Shiloh to Judd because Marty and Shiloh had begun to have a friendship, which couldn't be broken.A day or two after Marty and his father returned Shiloh, Shiloh ran away from Judd again, while Judd and his dogs were hunting. When Marty found Shiloh he decided that this time he wouldn't let anyone take him away from him again. So to make sure of this, Marty took Shiloh up to the hill in Marty's backyard and made him a little pen so Shiloh could live up on the hill.About a week or two later in the middle of the night Marty was sleeping on the couch and all of a sudden he heard a cry, but he just thought Shiloh was lonely. But then he heard yelp and he realized that Shiloh was in danger, so he jumped out of bed and ran to the door. Marty's father also got up to check out what was going on; when Marty arrived at Shiloh's pen he saw a German Shepard over Shiloh, and then saw Shiloh bleeding at the neck, ear, and leg. Right then Marty's father realized that Marty had been ling to him and that he lied to Judd Travers about having Shiloh.Marty's father then knew what to do; he took Shiloh to Doc. Murphy. Doc. Murphy didn't know what to do but he said he would try because he saw Marty crying. He said that Shiloh might be better and that Marty and his father could take him home when Shiloh was feeling a little bit better. To find out what happens to Marty and Shiloh read the book by either buying or borrowing from the library.My opinion of Shiloh is that it is very excellent it made me realized how much I care about my dog. Also I realized that my family will always have my back and will always look out for me, even when I do wrong.

In this book he would do anything for Shiloh it didn't matter what he had to do he was going to save him. Most all children love animals to and want to have there own pet. I cried several time while reading this book. I would love to read this to my children in class or have them read it. I thought this book was very well written. While reading this book the children can feel what Marty is feeling. How he don't want Shiloh to go back to Judd's. No child wants the dog to be treated wrong so they to are wanting Marty to keep the dog. They will keep reading to see if he gets to keep it or not. This is a great book in my opinion. Marty is a young boy that lives out in the country. His family is poor and they can't afford much. Marty goes and walks a path everyday down pass an old school in a part that was called Shiloh. On day that he was walking he came up on a little beagle. The dog was very shy and would not come up to him. Marty finally whistled to him and he came running over to him. The dog acted like he had been beaten. He followed Marty all the way home. When Marty dad saw him he said that he bet it was Judd Travers dog that lived down the road. Marty didn't like him he knew that he kicked his dogs. They took him over to his house. Marty had named him Shiloh. Shiloh was Judd's dog. Marty told him that if he saw him anymore that he would bring him back. Marty didn't want to tell him because Judd didn't feed him and he beat him. Well a few days later Shiloh got loose and came back. Marty made him a pen and kept him a secret. Then one night a German shepherd attack Shiloh in his pen and hurt him real bad. Marty dad found out and they took him to the vet. Then a few days later Judd found out that Marty had his dog so he went to get it back. He got mad and told Marty that he wanted his dog back in two days. Well on the day that he was to take Shiloh home to make up his mind that he was not giving him back. He caught Judd killing a deer out of season and made a bet with him if he would sell him he dog then he would not tell on him about the deer. So Judd agreed and gave Marty a job and he worked for twenty hours to pay for him. Judd worked Marty very hard and then they became friends and Marty bought Shiloh. He was finally his own dog."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Shiloh is an outstanding book that tells the story of a young boy living in Friendly, West Virginia who falls in love with an abused beagle pup. Marty Preston, an eleven year old boy, enjoys walking and spending time in the hills. When Marty is walking past the Old Shiloh schoolhouse coming down from the hills he sees and comes across a small abused dog with its head hung in shame. Marty takes the dog he names Shiloh back to his house, but his parents do not approve of pets because they cannot afford them. Preston creates a close bond with Shiloh, but knows he has to return the dog to his owner Judd who lives down the road. The decision that Marty and his family make is troubling because they are returning Shiloh to his cruel owner. After Marty returns Shiloh, he decides he will do anything he can to save the dog that he found, named, and cared for. Later, Marty and his family ask Judd if they could buy Shiloh, but Judd tells them that the dog is not for sale. As time goes by, Marty cannot stand being without Shiloh, nor Shiloh without Marty. Readers who enjoy reading books about how humans and dogs interact should read Shiloh, because it showcases the relationship gained between Marty and Shiloh."},{"Title":"Shiloh","review":"Great book.

The writing is evocative of the simple, upstanding way of life lived by Marty, the main character of the story, who finds a stray dog and strives to keep him from an apparently abusive owner. The story explores the moral issues that arise around that situation, about what is the right and wrong thing to do, in a way that is easy for younger readers to understand. It also explores the responsibilities involved in keeping a pet.

He not only traces much of the genealogy, especially of the Coryell family, but he also persuasively fills in the blanks on a few hitherto historic inconsistencies.He covers the entire period of the town, but to me the most fascinating part of his account involves the Revolutionary War period.For example, he cites and threads into his account, an interesting historical record about Revolutionary war spies -- New Doane Book: Bucks County's Bandittories of the Revolution, Bucks County Historical Society -- regarding one of the key mysteries during that crucial December '76 period. Anyone who has studied the run-up to the Battle of Trenton and also Princeton wonders how was General Washington able to be finally convinced that his bold Christmas crossing plan had not been compromised, before beginning to load the boats and ferry them across at McKonkeys, 7 miles downstream, on that fateful December 25th evening? The story Ed cites involved a young lad of 16, one George Coryell (who would years later be an actual pallbearer at George Washington's funeral), a nephew of Continental Army Captain George Coryell. The speculation was that the young man was a Continental Army spy, who swiftly rode his horse along the New Jersey roadways between the crossing and Trenton in the final hours before the launch, and who was able to re-cross and who personally gave His Excellency, General Washington, an \\"all clear\\" report just prior to the beginning of the crossing.Situated right across the Delaware River from the current New Hope, Pennsylvania, Lambertville has an enormous historical legacy that has curiously faded a bit in recent years due to a number of factors, unfortunately including a reduced emphasis within the educational system on the early history of the Republic.Known on both sides of the river during Revolutionary War times as Coryell's Ferry, both New Hope and Lambertville were key connectors in the crucial crossroads, especially of the American forces, during the first few years of our epic battle for independence. In December of '76, the Delaware River was literally the final and only successful impediment between the advancing British troops and both Washington's significantly diminished, bedraggled and defeated army, and the infant nation's capitol in Philadelphia. But for the retreating Commander-in-Chief having ensured that all the boats from the Lehigh River down to Delaware Bay were gathered in advance, and taken to the Pennsylvania side early that December, where they were hidden behind Malta Island just south of New Hope, the American cause would have likely been lost. Washington's Army utilized and stayed in the crossing area not only in 1776, but in 1777 and 1778 as well.Coryell's Crossing was the connecting link for the Old York Road running between Philadelphia, key locales within New Jersey, and New York City.Originally published in 1999, Ed has had the book reprinted on at least 3 occasions and it is sold locally here in Lambertville."},{"Title":"The Potter's Complete Book of Clay and Glazes: A Comprehensive Guide to Formulating, Mixing, Applying, and Firing Clay Bodies and Glazes","review":"...merely a tool, which definitley involves work on behalf of the reader. There are no pictures or test tiles to rely on; you have to try them yourself... a refreshing change from the results usually included in glaze books because you have to experiment and come up with your own results. I used the 1970's edition of this book as an undergraduate, which included the original recipes - not revised to exclude toxins - and while the revised edition is informative, it lacks the conversions for the &quot;toxic&quot; ingredients which many of us still use for the stunning results they provide. As a result some of the best recipes have been excluded from the new edition, and unfortunatley, the replacements and substitutions produce nowhere near the results gained from earlier editions.

The book definitely urged boys/men to respect and revere the feminine. Courtesy and manners were also addressed, and helped shape my behavior toward women in matters such as holding doors open, walking on the curbside, opening the car door for her, etc. I still think things like that matter in society, and this book helped ingrain those thoughts in me.

Lovecraft's Herbert West - Re-Animator","review":"Lovecraft was a writer for whom I always felt a certain ambivalence, but as I've grown older, I've been able to appreciate his nightmare visions and imagery much more than I did as a callow teen. I believe Lovecraft tended to disavow the Herbert West story as pulp melodrama, but it's always been among my favorite volumes of horror. Although it adheres to a deceptively conventional horror framework in terms of its plot development and living-dead theme, it is profoundly creepier and more disturbing than anything that was being done at the time, or that's been done subsequently. A tale of pseudo-scientific necromancy, Lovecraft charts the degeneration of Herbert West from his early days as a fervent visionary to his final dissolution as an obsessed madman. Forget King or Koontz; Lovecraft is still the only heir apparent to Poe. The story benefits from a restraint (Lovecraft had an unfortunate tendency to be verbose) and descriptive conciseness, but its ultimate efficacy comes from the multitude of disturbing, chilling images that populate the narrative. Unlike the movie version (in which Combs played the title character sublimely), there's little humor here to lessen the miasmic atmosphere of steadily-increasing horror and menace. This CD hasn't been all that easy to obtain, but for me its been well worth the effort I put into acquiring it and has become an indispensable part of my Lovecraft collection. The nightmarish horrors that West (Lovecraft) evokes from the grave will haunt your dreams long after you've listened to this CD."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Combs Reads H. P. Lovecraft's Herbert West - Re-Animator","review":"Lovecraft is an author whose works are inherently ill-suited to film adaptations, and inherently suited to audio adaptations. Much of the thrill of his stories is in his words and in the unseen, something that plays out so much better in the Theater of the Mind.I bought this CD many years ago (thankfully, considering the after-market price tag) and I still listen to it without fail a few times a year. This is an audio book rather than an audio play, with Jeffrey Combs dramatically reading Lovecraft's \\"Herbert West: Reanimator.\\" Combs, of course, made the role infamous with the loose screen adaptationRe-Animator, and it is nice to see him here pay homage to the origin of the cult classic movie. Fans of the film might be surprised at how dissimilar the original is to the film, but I personally enjoy both versions.Lovecraft himself was not fond of \\"Herbert West: Reanimator,\\" calling it \\"stuff done to order for a vulgar magazine, and written down to the herd's level.\\" The world has never agreed with him on that score though, and in this story Lovecraft introduces the concept of the flesh-eating zombie, something that would come to be an entire genre unto itself.Combs has a great voice for reading the story, as seeing as how \\"Herbert West: Reanimator\\" is largely told from a first-person point of view having a single voice works well for the production. There are minimal sound effects or music, and the effects are very subtle. Combs acts the story (more so that simply reading it) in a controlled way, with effective emotion in his voice when appropriate.The cover of this CD is done by artist Dennis Detwiller, who would go on to found Pagan Publishing which produced the modernCall of CthulhusettingDelta Green."},{"Title":"Jeffrey Combs Reads H. P. Lovecraft's Herbert West - Re-Animator","review":"With crisp, clear audio and minimal music or sound FX - sometimes almost unnoticeable in its subtlety - Jeff Combs brings his unique voice and cadence to one of Lovecraft's least favorite yet most popular stories.

It offered the CD for $15.00 with shipping! \\"What a DEAL!\\" I said to myself and bought it right then and there. The story was very complelling but very different to what is portrayed on screen, for example, Dr. Carl Hill isn't even in the book, there is a character call Sergent Clapam Lee in his place and the story follows Herbert West from his college days to his death at the hands of own creations, much like Dr. Frankenstein. But the really cool thing was that Jeffery Combs was reading it, so you got the feel of the films and the voice of Herbert West himself relating the events to you.

At best it's a surface portrait of a complex man and his films. The book is an easy read, but never delves into the complicated world that Lee has created on and off screen."},{"Title":"Spike Lee: That's My Story and I'm Sticking to It","review":"From his childhood and all throughout his film career, Spike Lee, born Shelton Jackson Lee, has been outspoken and opinionated. These solid traits, along with the sense of responsibility one acquires by being the oldest of five siblings, combined with education, talent, hard work, and great timing to produce one of the most recognized African-American film directors and producers to date. In SPIKE LEE: THAT'S MY STORY AND I'M STICKING TO IT, author Kaleem Aftab pens Spike's biography with such dedication and attention to details that readers will know everything one can know being on the outside looking into the life of Spike Lee: his upbringing, his college days, his first movies, his motivations, his financial trials, his political standpoints, his outlook on life, his recent films, and his goals. Although all is not rosy, Aftab still pulls back the cover and exposes details of Spike's life, before, after, and during the making of his films.Starting with his childhood and then arranged by film, Aftab proves to have done excellent research as he provides readers with a plethora of facts about everyone Spike ever spoke to and/or dealt with and about how he started and got to where he is now. Offering insight into the motivations behind Spike's movies and good behind-the-scenes information, Aftab presents a novel that delves not just into Spike's life, but also illuminates certain well-known actors who Spike chose to work with: Bill Nunn, Denzel Washington, Wesley Snipes, Giancarlo Esposito, John Turturro, Danny Aiello, and Laurence Fishburne (to name a few). Readers really get a strong grasp of who Spike Lee is as Aftab talks about some of the filmmaker's classic New York outlooks and his perspectives on African-Americans, not just in film but also in life.Extremely informational, SPIKE LEE, by Aftab, starts out slow and mundane. Aftab's writing style is not very intriguing or captivating for readers, which is a shame for it to be the biography of such an interesting figure. Also jumpy, it is difficult to keep up with what is going on. A section will begin discussing one event and will go off on a tangent about a list of people, who they are, and how they relate to Spike or the movie, and then jump back to the previous event. Transitional aids would help to make section themes flow better. A stronger narrative voice would also make information flow better. Throughout the biography, there are a plethora of quotes. Sometimes, a quote is so long and involved that it is easy for readers to forget that it is a quote, and jumping back to the narrator's voice once again throws off the flow of the text. As readers press on and become adjusted to Aftab's writing style, his composition creates a well-researched look into the life of one of America's prominent African-American directors/producers: Spike Lee.Reviewed by Natasha T.of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Spike Lee: That's My Story and I'm Sticking to It","review":"After reading this book and thinking about it as a whole, I was led to give it a 3-star rating, but it could've been a 5-star rating, if the editing were much stronger.Viewing the reviews listed here, I see various complaints about the book, but none of them address what I consider to be the most glaringly obvious things: the grammatical errors and the cultural fact errors--two things that could have been handled before the book even went to the printer. First, and I must admit that I don't know if England uses a different set of grammatical rules, there is a serious problem with subject verb agreement throughout the entire text, particularly with regard to collective nouns and singular nouns with a plural appearance. Aftab even changes around some of the quotes to fit this very jarring grammatical detour. (For example, \\"40 Acres and a Mule are....\\" While I teach composition, I still know the average reader could pick up on this, whether it's setting a word like \\"jury\\" or committee\\" against the plural verb form or something more complicated like the 40 Acres name.)Next, there are numerous fact errors. Among them is a misquote of Louis Farrakhan (\\"good\\" should be \\"great\\"--and that quote is forever taken out of context, and I say that not to defend the man at all). He also has Tupac dying in 1995 after being shot five times, Carmello Anthony going straight to the pros from high school, alongside LeBron James (as opposed to leading Syracuse to a NCAA championship), and stating that Cash Money Records was Master P's record label (not No Limit).These errors are very glaring, but I can best compare them to enjoying a class where a teacher insists on using screechy chalk on the blackboard, because overall I really liked the book. It took enormous effort to synthesize so much information into a highly readable biography. Don't get me wrong. It is far from perfect, but the linear layout and the quotes from various actors and Spike create a kind of balance so that it's not completely one-sided. And Aftab covers all of the media worthy hot topics that surrounded each of Lee's films so that when you finish the book, you will have gotten a strong glimpse into Lee's professional approach to filmmaking.I'm pretty sure that Spike Lee's own journals from his films will ultimately prove to be more useful for a beginning filmmaker than this book. It does, however, have its merits."},{"Title":"Spike Lee: That's My Story and I'm Sticking to It","review":"Purchased this to read on vacation.

For Spike to allow this biography, he was sending the reader a message. Open up your eyes, and if you read between the lines, you will understand that Spike has been misunderstood for years, by the industry, media and his fans. He is a visionary, who has made his mark on all of us for years, we are just beginning to catch up to his genius finally."},{"Title":"Spike Lee: That's My Story and I'm Sticking to It","review":"I disagree with the reviews left so far. I found this book to be very interesting and informative. I was expecting a first person retelling of Spike's life from his point of view. What I received was an honest account of Lee's movie making history, told from the perspective of the people who were there. That to me is what makes this book special.Most would agree that Spike Lee played an instrumental role in changing the movie industry. He was one of the first AA directors to make films \\"his way\\", he also opened doors for a multitude of African American actors, directors, DPs, sound people etc. This book gives the low down on how he accomplished all of that. What I liked even more about this work is the fact that it doesn't glorify Lee. It seems to be a vehicle for Lee to tell us how he goes about his craft but also allows the people closest to him to express their views on what he has done well and not so well over the course of his career.While I admit to being a fan of this director's prolific work and contributions, I am not such a fan as to believe he doesn't have some personality issues that rub folks the wrong way. Beyond that, he has been a trailblazer and a champion for minorities in an industry that had long ago written them off. I also think that if he wanted to, Mr. Lee is very capable of making outstanding commercial movies, that's just not his thing. Many of us are unaware that he has been a driving force behind some of Black Americas best commercial movies, The Best Man and Love and Basketball for example.For better or worse (depending on the reader)this book reads less like a biography and more like the transcript of a documentary. I recommend it to serious movie buffs, and people with an entrepreneurial spirit."},{"Title":"Spike Lee: That's My Story and I'm Sticking to It","review":"talk about a Cat who fell off in there Creativity??

I had a job interview on the Saturday that this book came out and I was really worried that I would not be able to meet Spike Lee and get this book autographed. Luckily, I made it to the bookstore he was at. When I got to the front of the line, I grinned; said \\"Hello\\"; he saw my name prepared on a post-it; said \\"How do you say this?\\"; I told him; he looked at me like I was stupid; I said \\"Don't look at me like that\\"; he signed the book; and said \\"Here you go\\" without even a glance. No \\"Thanks for the support\\", no \\"Thanks for buying the book\\", no nothing. When people support your product, manners come in handy. That rude behavior spoiled the book for me. I got through about three pages and gave up. I'm not even interested in what the book is about anymore because he was so obnoxious.A month later, I reopened the book because I figured if I went through the trouble to buy the doggone book, I might as well read it. Plus only 2 out of 11 people thought the review above was helpful. I read the book and I realized it's not just me he's obnoxious to, but plenty of people. He got mad at Samuel L. Jackson for wanting more money after doing 4 movies in a row with him. He told Rosario Dawson not to do her other movie because she could \\"do that anytime.\\" He put the dark-skinned people and the light-skinned people in different kinds of hotels (one set nice hotels and the other mice-infested) to show more tension onset, as if the actors weren't good enough to do it without the extra instigation. For this to be an autobiography, Lee comes off as a complete jerk. I'm surprised he allowed so many parts from other actors to be in this book. He was worried about his father being interviewed, but judging from the people he's worked with, it doesn't seem to matter. He'd ask any and everyone for money but says he hates to be asked for money. I could write a list of reasons why he's unlikeable and my top 2 would be that he thanks his daughter for inspiration in the back of this book, but left out his son and he wasn't around to see either of his kids being born because he wanted to go to the Knicks games. What?!I'm so annoyed that I went through all that rushing to buy a book from such an ungrateful man. I still appreciate him for making \\"Malcolm X\\" and \\"School Daze\\", but I don't respect him as a person in the least bit."},{"Title":"Spike Lee: That's My Story and I'm Sticking to It","review":"Spike, you make some great movies, Summer of Sam is one of your best, Do the Right Thing.

I guaranteed you that if this same disaster happened on Long Island or let's say The Hamptons, you would have had an entirley different response from FEMA and his administration.\\"But you should have seen how he said it, it was as if he was staring right into the camera with this smirk on his face. The dude is bold man, I'll give him that and I applaude him.Spike said either black, white, Mexican, or asian.But what he DIDN'T say was Italians!!That dude has been getting flack forever for his dis'n of Italians in his movies, they call him a racist all the time.HERE WAS HIS CHANCE to say something, and he blew it.just didn't happen to say Italians?NOSo HE is a racist too.And so are the Africans in Africa, they never have liked white people either, so what about that Spike? Try going over their and applying for a job!And while I am at, the African Americans in even Baton Rouge don't want the blacks from N.O. coming up their! How come spike never said anything about that?Fkn whiners, so many the world over! give them a mic and let them talk and will put it on TV and let the world see it for the fools they are.And ignoramus white liberals eat it up as its gospel and he is telling Da Truth"},{"Title":"Opal","review":"A good historical novel.

She is a very good writer and we think she makes her books come alive."},{"Title":"Opal","review":"it was a very good book thier is no cussing and it seems very real, like it could happen in right now"},{"Title":"Opal","review":"Opal has had the freedom to enjoy her horse centered life style while growing up on her brother-in-law's ranch but some difficulties come into her life when she is attacked by a stranger. She is rescued by a male friend but later that friend is almost killed by her attacker and another. She has to come to grips with this and her relationship with God. During this time another man enters her life who comes to love her. He is struggling with God's will for his life and a previous sinful decision which leaves a women dead and him with a young son he didn't know about until then While the two of them work out these challenging events and his and her's relationship with God, they then must come to terms with their relationship.Again I am impressed with the characters created and their depth. I am also impressed with Lauraine Snelling's willingness to tackle difficult happenings in a Christian's life. I also like that she doesn't just make lesser characters from previous books in the series just disappear but continues on with their lives in each of these stories. I like this community she has developed and I like the way she integrates the characters growth in personal relations with God and their daily life and the choices to be made. The only thing I had trouble with was Opal's age (14 - 15) and the mature decisions she was being given to deal with but I think Lauraine Snerlling was trying to relate this to the time period and the pioneering lifestyle of the story."},{"Title":"Opal","review":"The good was good but I did not like it as much as the others.

In all four books, a character was running away or trying to find themselves. I liked that in this book, the person who was running away was a man. Sometimes women are the main focus for searching and facing troubles, but all people need to seek the Lord for His plan. I thought it was a good way to tie Opal to the main male character. I did think that she is too young in this book to be the focus of the romance connection, but time plays out nicely in the next book. Remember reader, GOD has HIS great plan for you! Conform to Him and not who or what society may say. He has known best for your life, long before you had life. God bless!!!"},{"Title":"Opal","review":"Great Book! Enjoyed the whole series.

I favor historical western stories with Christian based content since I do not feel erotic sexual trash for the sake of trash is necessary. Having been long married, I do not need the stimulation of that sort of writing although I am far from being prudish. Like another reader, I was a bit curious about how Belle would continue to fare after she was so abruptly dropped from the story in an earlier book. Guess I will just have to make up an ending for her myself after all.... hopefully a good one. As I continue with the 4th book, I hope everything will be tied up completely. Women in those days really had their work cut out for them. Makes me feel lazy !

Ruby's younger sister, Opal, loves ranch life. At 14, she can shoot, rope, train horses and participate in roundup. Unfortunately, a little thing called school keeps getting in her way. One day after leaving school early due to a headache, she decides to take a detour on the way home. It's a decision that changes her life forever. Her friend, Atticus, ends up injured and is taken away from Medora. As she struggles with guilt and uncertainly, she comes to find that she is being shaped by a God who can make her more than a simple ranch hand.In Opal, the author takes us deeper into the character of Opal Torvald than either of the first two books in the series do. I thought she did a remarkable job of demonstrating the difficulties of Opal's situation and her personal growth without losing all of Opal's childhood innocence. The one thing I did not like about the book was that the author never addressed what Belle's reaction to the burning of the Dove House was. Belle was mentioned several times in the book, but never was her reaction noted. Somehow, I kept expecting it to come, but I got to the end and it never did. Other than that, it was a easy, comforting read. The storyline is actually much more complex than the synopsis above, but for sake of brevity, I gave the broad overview. Several new characters were introduced, including one who is extremely interested in Opal. I think the complexity really drew me in and made it all the more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Opal","review":"I felt like this book was sort of choppy. It completely skips Belle's reaction to Dove House burning down, which I thought would be great to see. With all of the different stories that kind of seem to pop out of nowhere, the book seemed more difficult to read. The preacher and his son were kind of interesting, but I didn't think a man that age should be interested in any way with a fourteen year old, even if he thought her a bit older. I do like that Ruby and Rand have a strong faith and show it constantly. I just felt like this book was missing what the first two had."},{"Title":"Opal","review":"I have to say this is a pretty good book. Its not as good as Ruby (the 1st book) but is still a good story. Really the only reason I didn't give this book five stars is because it is kind of weird with Opal being only 14 years old. Lauraine Snelling should have made her 17, then the story would have flowed better. In all it was a fine book, but not one of Lauraine Snelling's best"},{"Title":"Opal","review":"Personnally i really enjoyed this book every bit as much as the first two. i love the ranch setting and Opal being an outdoors person rather than an indoor one like Ruby and Pearl, it gives it its own style thats different from the first two. and i also like that opal is younger, only 14, where the other 2 were already in their twenties. I like all of the challenges she has to face as a youg person and how her character is developped by what happens and how she learns. though why Atticus had to treat her that way i don't know, pride maybe. I love this book and cannot wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"Opal","review":"I loved the first two books, Ruby and Pearl. I have to affirm many of the other reviews. Opal's character grew up quite a bit in this book, but she seemed much older than a 14 year old. I also didn't like the match between Opal and the preacher. Their personalities just never seemed to fit. My biggest grudge with this book was that Belle's story was completely written out. She was such an integral part of the first two books. I have a hard time believing she would have just walked away from all her money (that burned at the end of book 2) and the dove house without some sort of fight. Belle's fire and spark is part of the reason I loved the first two books so much. I also didn't understand why Ruby briefly talked about her savings when everything they had burned in the dove house. Just didn't make sense. I'm not the type to walk away from a series, but I just don't think I go drag my self through the 4th."},{"Title":"Opal","review":"I found this book to be a disappointment after the other two books I had read in this series.Too slow moving and too much repetition.I felt I had to read it to complete the first two but I could just as easily skipped it."},{"Title":"Opal","review":"The author jumped around and I had trouble keeping track of what was going on. Was she introducing new characters where they did not belong just to make them a part of some old gang? Maybe I should have read the author's other books to be able to follow better. I must say, in addition, I was extremely disappointed in the ending which left me empty and feeling as if something was definitely missing! Did she have to cut something out in her revisions? Would not recommend Opal. My daughter read it after me and said the same thing."},{"Title":"Opal","review":"Opal is only 14, so some of her actions seem out of place and much older, but nonetheless, she is very sincere and has suffered tremendous guilt from the unfortunate scene that opens the book. Opal feels guilty because so many other fine people suffer because of her mistake.I had trouble keeping track of the stories the author jumped between until they all sort of became one story. It was rather difficult to introduce new characters and then have them to become part of the old gang, but it turned out ok to do so in that manner.Ruby and Rand continue to be the Christian backbones of this family and lead their extended families and hands to the knowledge of Jesus Christ as Saviour whenever possible.Parts of this book were TOO predictable, others were totally surprising, and all in all, I did enjoy this book 3."},{"Title":"Opal","review":"I love this series!

WOnderful read!!!!"},{"Title":"Opal","review":"I really enjoyed the first 2 books in this series. As Opal started out, I enjoyed it, as well. However, as I got into it, I felt that it dragged. I've been reading it an unheard-of amount of time...a week and a half! and have yet to finish it. Ms. Snelling is a very descriptive author. This is not a bad thing; however, I got a little weary of the cattle drive descriptions. Also, Ruby and Rand's little son, Per, got kind of old. I realize that he should be in the story, because it is exciting that Ruby had a baby. But, his actions would be much cuter in person than written on just about every page of the book. I got tired of his repeating everything the characters said in his baby talk. Then, too, I'm ready for Opal to quit blaming herself for every bad thing that happens or might happen. Ruby finally got over her unforgiveness for Jake, but now we have to deal with Opal's guilt about Atticus...who, I don't know why he treated her the way he did. Hopefully, things will be resolved at the end of this book, but I may never know. I am not one to leave any part of a series unread, but as hard as I have tried, I just can't seem to finish it. Maybe Amethyst will be better, and I will able to catch up on the last 100 pages of Opal in it."},{"Title":"Opal","review":"This is a good series of fiction with history tied in, but I think so much of the focus being on a younger girl made it seem like it didn't tie in that well with the others in the series."},{"Title":"Opal","review":"Lorraine Snelling is one of my favorite Christian authors.

Opal is a strong, western women, and you are always anxious to see what is going to happen to her. She is growing up with her sister and her sister's family and has a true love of the land.

Cutting class, Opal goes swimming in the nearby Little Missouri River with little on when a drifter threatens her. Her friend Atticus Grady fights the stranger.In Pennsylvania, Minister Jacob Chandler feels remorse over Melody who when she arrives at his home ailing informs him she no longer can take care of their seven year old son Joel before leaving the child behind with Jacob. Unable to face his flock Jacob accompanied by Joel head west getting off the train in the Dakotah Territory when they run out of money. He finds work as a ranch hand though he is not very competent at it.Meanwhile the drifter incident has had repercussions with Atticus being beaten badly and a neighbor killed. Opal's sister sends her to attend a New York school where she hopes the tomboy learns to behave more like a lady and to get her away from the drifter. A sad Opal wonders when she will be able to return.Book three in the Dakotah Treasures series, OPAL, is an interesting Americana fiction that brings to life a bygone era. Readers who want a better perspective of two key secondary characters will be better off perusing the first two tales (see RUBY and PEARL) although this novel can stand alone. Opal better at ranching than the average male seems a stretch until the reader compares her to teenage golf and tennis sensations like Wie and Sharapova. Her trouble adapting to New York City and Jacob's to ranching make for a fine taleand sets up another novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Whiz Kids And the 1950 Pennant (Baseball In America)","review":"If you love baseball history-especially the immediate post-war years 1947-50 this gem of a remembrance is for you. Hall-of-famer Robin Roberts has combined with author Paul Rogers to relive those years when baseball,after a decline during WW2,regained its preeminance as America's national game and with integration and night games,embarked upon a 25 year golden era that may never be duplicated in professional sports. Using Roberts near photographic memory,oral history,and excellent research,author Rogers provides a rich fast-paced narrative that culminates with the miracle season of 1950 when a brash group of youngsters know as the Whiz Kids(Roberts,Richie Ashburn,Del Ennis,Granny Hamner,Curt Simmons,Willie Jones,Mike Goliat,and Stan Lopata)combined with a few seasoned veterans(Jim Konstanty,Andy Seminick,Dick Sisler,and Eddie Waitkus to stun the baseball world by defeating the Brooklyn Dodgers on the final day of the season in one of the most dramatic games in the history of baseball. The authors cover the development of the team from 1947 on and do not shy away from the controversies of the period such as the race-baiting of Jackie Robinson during his rookie year(the Phillies were prominently involved and it may have been a big factor in the firing of manager Ben Chapman)and the near fatal shooting of Eddie Waitkus. While the authors admirably document the contributions of every member of the team,skillfully pointing out that every member contributed something that won at least one game,two facts clearly emerge-without Jim Konstanty's record breaking performance as the seasons premier relief pitcher and the job of manager Eddie Sawyer there was no way the Phillies would have one the pennant. In fact it is in some ways the story of Eddie Sawyer(one of baseballs best kept secrets as a gentleman and manager) that drives the narrative to its apex. Read the book and see the unique approach to managing men that Sawyer brought to the game,an approach that is at once so logical and appealing that it seems easy until you try it. Baseball could use some Eddie Sawyers today. As a matter of fact,a few more Robin Roberts wouldn't hurt either. One hopes that Roberts and Rogers will combine their talents and continue the Roberts story after the 1950 season as the great right-hander was an eyewitness to the momentous growth and change that occurred in baseball during his 18 year career. This a truly outstanding addition to the library of anyone who values and loves baseball history."},{"Title":"The Whiz Kids And the 1950 Pennant (Baseball In America)","review":"This is another boonie dog book review by Wolfie and Kansas. We were somewhat amused when we first heard the title of Robin Roberts and C. Paul Rogers III's book, &quot;The Whiz Kids and the 1950 Pennant&quot;. To us dogs, a &quot;whiz kid&quot; is an unhousebroken puppy. However, these Whiz Kids were the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team, and this is a book about humans playing fetch. While this is not a literary gem like Roger Kahn's &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;, it is an above-average baseball book comparable to another recent book by a pitcher from the same era, Don Larsen's &quot;The Perfect Yankee&quot;. We recommend this book to all baseball fans. It is in the must-read category for any Phillies fan.We do have two reservations about &quot;The Whiz Kids and the 1950 Pennant&quot;. The first concerns the portrayal of Jim Konstanty, the relief pitcher who was the 1950 National League MVP. One of our noncanine animal companions of primate derivation (who has loaned us his habit of shameless namedropping for purposes of this review) was a regular customer at Mr. Konstanty's sporting goods store in the mid-1960's. He remembers Mr. Konstanty as being far more personable than one would gather from this book. Of course, the pressures of making a record number of appearances during a tight pennant race could affect one's affability.Also, while not shying away from the issue, Roberts and Rogers do not fully develop the ironic theme that the Whiz Kids, a supposed youth movement and potential future dynasty, were actually the dying embers of a fading era. The 1950 Phillies were the last all-white National League pennant winners, edging out the Jackie Robinson/Roy Campanella/Don Newcombe Dodgers in extra innings on the final day of the season. With the Phillies management dragging its heels as to recruiting and signing the best available ballplayers regardless of race, the remainder of the National League pennants in the 1950's went to the Dodgers, the Giants (with Willie Mays and Monte Irvin) and the Braves (with Hank Aaron). (Given the arguments as to whether the current millenium ends in 1999 or 2000, we should perhaps add the 1960 Pirates with Roberto Clemente to that list.) Not only did this relegate the Phillies to the second division, but it probably also cost author Roberts the chance to win 300 games. It would be interesting to see David Halberstram analyze the 1950 National League pennant race in a manner similar to his analysis of the 1964 World Series in &quot;October 1964&quot;"},{"Title":"The Whiz Kids And the 1950 Pennant (Baseball In America)","review":"This is a very well written account about a team that captured the hearts of an entire city. This is a great account of the surprising achievment of the 1950 Phillies. The excellent interviews of the players involved and the rehashing of the author is great. A very nostalgic and fact filled retelling of an exciting and fun filled year in baseball. A must read for all Phillie and historical baseball buffs."},{"Title":"The Whiz Kids And the 1950 Pennant (Baseball In America)","review":"Robin Roberts and Paul Rodgers have written a terrific book that can be enjoyed by all Phillies and baseball fans. While the focus is on the 1950 Phillies, the authors have spent a fair amount of time (but not too much) explaining how dreadful the Phillies were in the decades leading up to 1950 and how the Phillies organization managed to change from the stodgy, cheap baseball club it had been to a forward thinking and nimble one that won the 1950 NL penant.Robin Roberts' memory for detail is terrific and you very much feel like you are there, through the victories, defeats, fights (on the field) and down times for the young men of the team. Many other players are highlighted and I liked the fact that Roberts did not sugar coat the shameful way Jackie Robinson had been treated by the other players including, regretably, the Phillies.Another enjoyable component of the book are many interviews, mostly done by Dean Rodgers, that are interesting and informative. The use of segments of these interviews throughout the book really confirms the accounts descibed in the book and helped to breath life into the players both on the field and off.I liked the fairly extensive statisitical compilation at the end of the book and think that serious fans will find that very useful to better undertand the team.As memories fade and those who actually remember the 1950 Whiz Kids walk off the field, this is an important book that preserves this moment of American-Philadelphia-Phillies history. It also happens to be a very enjoyable and worthwhile read.The Whiz Kids And the 1950 Pennant (Baseball In America)"},{"Title":"The Whiz Kids And the 1950 Pennant (Baseball In America)","review":"&quot;The Whiz Kids&quot; met my expectations. It is great material for Phillies fans. Having grown up hearing the names of Ennis, Ashburn, Konstanty, Roberts and the rest, I wanted to read a good account of the first Phils pennant since 1915.The ever humble Roberts (with the help of a professional writer) recounts his rise to the major leagues as well as the futile history of Phillies baseball. It's a nice, easy to read story that follows a tried formula: the team has a long history of losing, young players come aboard and develop into a close team, they exceed expectations and go to the World Series. There are plenty of scenes that flesh out the personalities and struggles of the team mates. Plenty of train trips and hotel stays. Tough game situations yeilding exciting victories or close defeats. Those looking for deep insights into the era should look elsewhere. In fact, I see this book aimed primarily at us Phils fans. Our banners are few, so we need to raise them high. These aren't Duke Snyder, Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese and the other &quot;Boys of Summer.&quot; The Phillies of this era had one great year surrounded by several decent years. Only a couple of the names stand out these years later.I give the book four stars because it served its purpose for me. If you are looking for light reading material about a cinderalla team, this could be for you as well."},{"Title":"The Whiz Kids And the 1950 Pennant (Baseball In America)","review":"Authors Paul Rogers and former Whiz Kid pitcher Robin Roberts have done a great job in bringing a memorable team back to life. Baseball books on teams usually involve New York teams and it is refreshing to read a book about a team that will always be remembered, not just by Phillies' fans, but by baseball fans across the country. Many of the names I came across in this book were merely pictures on baseball cards I started buying in the early '50's and this book provided me with some insight into their accomplishments on the ball diamond. There is a story behind each of those players' names I have in my mind, and the authors brought them to life in this book. If there was one drawback, if I may call it that, I found an excessive amount of play-by-play among the pages. However, I can live with that. The names of Robin Roberts, Curt Simmons, and Richie Ashburn are household baseball names, but I was also happy to read about lesser lights like Bubba Church, Mike Goliat, and Stan Lopata who were only pictures on baseball cards to me. Phillies' fan or not, if you like baseball history, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Whiz Kids And the 1950 Pennant (Baseball In America)","review":"I read this book several years ago, and I am looking forward to reading again.

Although, as Luc Sante states in his introduction, Riis' sole purpose for writing this book is to \\"call attention to the horrendous living conditions of the poor in New York City and insist on reform\\" (p ix), Riis also presents another underlying theme by unequivocally proving that the more people isolate themselves from the rest of the world, the better chance there is for gross victimization of those less fortunate: simplistically speaking, the rich get richer; the poor get poorer; the wider the gap grows in between (dispersion of our so-called middle class.)Riis' talent lies in his use of poetically descriptive language, saturated with metaphor and alliteration, alongside contrasting factual accounts of harsh reality. The reader is mesmerized by the rhythmic sound of lines such as \\"Down near the Battery the West Side emerald would be soiled by a dirty stain, spreading rapidly like a splash of ink on a sheet of blotting paper\\" (p 25), but then shocked by the stark conditions of tenement life as given in the form of personal stories, photographs, legislation, statistics, and blueprints. Riis writes about the windowless, airless rooms and the unbelievably filthy crowded living conditions. He recounts stories of bitter violence toward children and between the races, as well as degradation and oppression among women, the old, and the infirm. The reader is sickened with wretched stories of infanticide and mortality rates among the children.Riis unapologetically interjects his novel with stereotypical remarks and his own bigoted opinions of the people inhabiting the various ethnically divided \\"wards.\\" Some of his include those such as \\"between the dull gray of the Jew, his favorite color, and the Italian red, would be seen squeezed in on the map a sharp streak of yellow, marking the narrow boundaries of Chinatown\\" (p 24), and \\"poverty, abuse, and injustice alike the negro accepts with imperturbable cheerfulness...He loves fine clothes and good living a good deal more than he does a bank account\\" (p 117).Through the obviously prejudicial film that covers Riis' novel from beginning to end, the reader is able to perceive a sense of his true passion of wanting to make a positive difference in society. His previous stereotypical remarks about African Americans are somewhat softened when he later comments on the injustice towards them:\\"...when the account is made up between the races, it shall be claimed that he falls short of the result to be expected from twenty-five years of freedom, it may be well to turn to the other side of the ledger and see how much of the blame is borne by the prejudice and greed that have kept him from rising under a burden of responsibility to which he could hardly be equal\\" (p 119).Riis is an example of a pioneer whose work, sacrifice, and commitment have shaped our country and our world. By educating the public through his journalistic indictments, he provided the catalyst for the ensuing slow process of reform. What places Riis on a higher level than others who have written expos&eacute;s is the fact that he not only provided what he thought to be the main causes for the deplorable situation of tenement life, but also provided an outline of a well thought out plan for improvement that included detailed legislation, floor plans for remodeling, and sound economical postulations. Luc Sante states that Riis does not \\"inquire very deeply into the causes of the conditions he describes\\" (p xi), but one can logically infer very plainly many individual causes and effects that ultimately affect the whole, such as greed, gross lack of education of a whole segment of society, a government and society who chose not to care (or may have felt it did not have the time or resource to care,) growth of nation that was infinitely more vast than expected, depression, oppression, and inertia (on both ends of the class spectrum.)Riis' book is not only a ghost from the past, but also a ghost from the present that haunts our country and our world today. One can still see economically imbalanced conditions that contribute to the growing lower class. Insightful remarks made over one hundred years ago make one disgusted to realize that seemingly little has been learned:\\"Nothing is now better understood than that the rescue of the children is the key to the problem of city poverty, as presented for our solution to-day; that a character may be formed where to reform it would be a hopeless task\\" (p 139).This book should be read for the beauty of the prose, the horror of the content, and the insight to be gained from both. Riis succeeds in showing the reader that our world is a unit existing of one: indeed one world. Riis presents an inarguably complete and comprehensive exposition of \\"how the other half lives.\\""},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"How the Other Half Lives, by Jacob Riis, with Introduction by Luc Sante, is a book that paints a picture of tenement neighborhoods in New York City in 1890. Riis, himself an immigrant, made his living as a journalist. It is his gift of words that brings the slums to life, and transports the reader to the very spot that he describes. Riis was the first to include photographs to vividly capture what his words portray. His writing and photographs were forerunners to investigative reporting and documentaries. Sante referred to Riis' agenda as being restricted to the mundane because he wanted immediate achievable results that would better the lives of the other half. Although his plans were simple; proper housing, sanitary conditions, parks, and schools; they were considered revolutionary. When he left the newspaper business in 1901 he became a lecturer speaking on this topic of reform that was so dear to his heart. He made headway and convinced influential people such as Theodore Roosevelt to join his cause.I think Riis was extremely successful in his mission to make people aware of the conditions in the tenements. Since this book was reprinted in 1997 and the introduction was added at that time, I think it would have increased the value of the book to include a section that briefly described the current condition of the tenements in today's light, and review, with a timeline, the reforms achieved since 1890. It would be interesting because Sante says \\"It [the book] haunts us because so much of it remains true\\" (p.xiii). This book created reforms, but if after 116 years, much of it is still true, we must be missing something. Then again, perhaps not, since Riis says the poor will always be with us, and we can never get rid of either the pauper or the tenement (p.xi).Riis was a firm believer that education alone could make \\"the other half's\\" lives better, but he also knew their need to work long hours to have a roof over their head and food to eat made the chance of education a far flung dream (pp.95, 105, 111, 136). Without the ability to speak English they are unable to change careers. Another solution he had was to focus on the children as a way to reduce city poverty (p.139). Riis preached that besides charitable donations there needed to be people willing to step into action (pp.145, 213).I think the book was well written and is very descriptive. At times I thought his words tended to be racial, blunt, and opinionated, but that was his true style, even in his journalistic works (p.xvi). Even though I didn't like to read the racist words, I believe he accurately presented the views of the slums. Just as Walter Isaacson fills his readers with awe at the accomplishments of Ben Franklin in his book Ben Franklin, An American Life, Riis fills us with an ache for the immigrants coming to America to make a better life for themselves and finding it hard to do. I think anyone interested in history or the life of an immigrant would find this an informative book. It isn't one I would find on an educational reading list in terms of contributions to education, but it does give insight into living conditions in the late nineteenth century and gives a plug for a connection between education (or lack of) and living conditions within the largest city in America."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"Like books by Steinbeck, How the other half lives is a eye opening expose of life for the have-nots in the late 19th century.

RiisThis book is a \\"classic\\", most people have heard about it but few have read it. [The word \\"tenement\\" is a legal term for property holdings, usually housing that is not owner-occupied.] Riis was a newspaper reporter, this book was first published in 1890 to document housing in New York city. Riis came from Denmark at age 21. Arriving in NY he first worked as a carpenter, later he became a police reporter for newspapers. He walked down Mulberry Street in the early mornings. Slum housing was the result of \\"public neglect and private greed\\". [The big landowners of New York controlled politics since the 18th century.] Riis believed that education was most important for new immigrants. This book lacks the photographs that illustrated the original book. Riis' \`Introduction' says slum housing causes criminals. They are also a source of epidemics. Was this distress caused by drunkenness? The slums generated a 40% yearly return on the investment!The rapid expansion of NY after the War of 1812 saw the rise of rear houses, tenant-houses built to house the maximum number of people in the smallest area (Chapter 1). The threat of cholera led to a \\"Tenement-House Act\\" in 1867 (Chapter 2). Rooms had to have windows for light and air. Most tenement dwellers were immigrants (Chapter 3). Chapter 4 describes \\"The Down-Town Back Alleys\\" where large houses were subdivided into tiny rooms. Riis describes the living conditions. Chapter 5 tells about the Italians in New York. Chapter 6 tells about \\"The Bend\\" of Mulberry Street near the Five Points, the heart of the slum district. These vile properties are owned by \\"an honored family\\". Chapter 7 tells of a police raid on stale-beer dives (unpasteurized beer). Chapter 8 describes the cheap lodging-houses \\"nurseries of crime\\". Riis describes Chinatown in Chapter 9. Some houses are opium dens with \\"white slaves\\". The Chinaman is \\"as clean as a cat\\".Chapter 10 describes the Hebrew quarter, the most densely populated neighborhood. Most of the ready-made clothes sold in the big stores are sewn here. Chapter 11 tells of the \\"sweaters\\", the middleman or subcontractor, who hires people in the tenements for unregulated labor. They work hard and save to send for their families. Chapter 12 describes the Bohemian cigar-makers who live in tenements owned by their employers. Chapter 13 discusses the \\"Color Line\\", the segregated areas where Negroes are allowed to live at higher prices. Tenement houses do not have a locked front door (Chapter 14). A respectable tenement neighborhood has few saloons. Flowers improve tenements, so too small parks. The heat of July and August create hardship and death for children. Newer buildings with proper sanitation had lower mortality rates. Death from starvation was common. Poverty created madness. Chapter 15 describes \\"The Problem of the Children\\" and what needs to be done to save them.The abandoned children put in the Foundling Asylum do not last long (Chapter 16). The Sisters of Charity have a good record. Worst of all are the \\"baby farms\\". Chapter 17 tells of the \\"Street Arabs\\", homeless boys who live on the street due to poverty at home. The Children's Aid Society provide good housing and character. Trade schools educate the older boys. There are about ten saloons to every church (Chapter 18). Gangs are endemic to New York (Chapter 19). They can terrorize a neighborhood. People walking the street could be robbed, such as a stranger asking for directions. Their \\"social clubs\\" often use blackmail. Chapter 20 tells of the oppression experienced by working girls in NY from low wages. Chapter 21 is about \\"Pauperism\\", families and individuals who applied for relief. Riis suggested setting up a labor bureau to match workers to jobs. Chapter 22 tells about the \\"Wrecks\\" in the workhouse, the almshouse (some are old people abandoned by their children), and the lunatic asylum. The worst tenements do not look bad; they are not old enough (Chapter 23). Chapter 24 tells what has been done to solve tenement-house problems. Chapter 25 lists what can be done with modern tenement-houses. Riis suggested tax rebates or licensing to regulate tenements."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"The overall presentation of the book is fine.

At the same time he drags out all of the tired stereotypes of the day about the different ethnic groups then living in the city (mostly: Jewish, Irish and Italian).Riis' upper-class lifestyle and upbringing are apparent throughout the book, and some of the passages would offend many of our sensibilities today, but the general point of the book is what's important here.

The residents are trying to have a better life in their new country but they soon realized how merciless and unforgiving life can be in a foreign land.While Riis's writings have some obvious prejudice and stereotypes, it is consistent to the times of the 1890s. Despite his own prejudices, he is obviously aware of the grim situation in the tenements.

The evidence that supports that conclusion is embedded in his book, now a classic of muck-raking and a key player in the history of social reform in America. The fascinating thing was the reformers were fought tooth and nail not only by the slum landlords but by the poor themselves. That is just one of many items that make this story compelling reading, especially in view of the official facts and figures displayed and the pictures that go with those facts and figures. Wow! 27 people living in a room with two beds. 28,000 babies abandoned to the Sisters of Charity crib in one year. Massive deaths of children from, of all things, measles. The most common diagnosis made by the Summer Doctors (a corps of physicians from the New York City Department of Health) was \\"improper nourishment\\", none other than our malnutrition, but translated to that place and time meaning starvation. And yet milk was 2 cents a quart, a meal of soup, meat stew, bread, vegetables, and a stein of beer cost 13 cents. Add a cigar and another beer and it's 15 cents. Hence, the poor could have survived on minimal amounts of money, which, unfortunately, they did not have. The past is a different country said LP Hartley. He was right. They did things differently there. A word of caution: Riis in his zeal does protest too much. Some of the pictures are doctored to look worse than the reality. Many pictures are posed and probably paid for. Look at the one on the cover. The boy on the left is awake and smirking. The ash on his right shoulder has been sprinkled there for effect. The boy in the middle is not sleeping either as it is impossible to sleep with your head balanced on your fist like that. Why would he do that anyway when he could rest his head normally like the rest of us? He is posed and in that position so that Riis can get all three boys in the picture. Another example of hyperbole: On page 54 we are told that the child's temperature is 115 F. That is medically impossible as human enzymes and cellular energy systems stop working at 110. By the time a temperature reaches 110, the patient is dead, has to be dead. 115 is possible if and only if they are on fire or heated by a source outside their body and then they still would be dead. As has been pointed out many times, Riis displays remarkable personal and cultural prejudices. His main fault is over generalization based on the assumption that every Jew is alike, every Irishman the same. Not every Italian is a gambler. Nor is every Irishman a drunk. Some Chinese do not smoke opium and at least some Jews are not misers. Because a person is not Christian doesn't automatically make them immoral as Riis would have us believe. Yes, the author has many faults. But most of them in this historical context are trivial. The results of his work are not trivial and speak for themselves: massive reform of wages, hours of work, living conditions, sanitation, social and personal hygiene, Public Health, and most importantly, public supervision of private greed and public modification of private greed by law."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"Although this book, How the Other Half Lives, was originally published in 1890 the images created still haunt the reader today because we sense that much has not changed in the last one hundred years.The author, Jacob Riis was born in 1849 in Denmark, the third of fifteen children. His family was poor, but respectable. (Riis, xiv) For economic reasons, Riis decided to emigrate to the United States. Quickly running out of money, he was forced to take odd jobs, sleep in doorways and accept handouts for food. Eventually finding employment as a journalist, Riis developed his own style of writing. He violated traditional newspaper style by \\"inserting editorial commentary into his stories.\\" (Riis, xvi) This style became known as muckraking.In his writings, Riis focused on issues of housing reform. He found that merely describing the conditions with words was not convincing enough, so he began to use photography. In the Introduction to the book, Luc Sante reports that Riis' \\"flash awoke sleepers and momentarily blinded drinkers and workers and nursing mothers, pinning them in their surroundings and shocking them into submission to the lens.\\" (Riis, xvii)As an immigrant, Riis knew first hand what it was like to live in poverty. When he was younger, out of money and unable to find steady employment, he often spent the night in police station lodging houses to escape from the cold. This book explores the living conditions of the American immigrant in the tenements of New York City. Riis' writing is full of the sights and sounds of the forgotten or ignored people living in the Lower East Side.This writing is unique in that it takes you directly into the tenements. The reader's skin crawls from the thought of the filth, the nose wrinkles from the imagined smells and the feeling of darkness hangs like a cloud from the first page until the last. Rather than providing us with a list of impersonal statistics, Riis gives us a glimpse into the lives of human beings. The reader experiences the sights and sounds of even the most austere little room shared by what seems like multitudes of people. The pictures verify the human condition that Riis describes.Riis writes as if he were talking to the reader as they were walking down the streets and alleys of the tenements. \\"Take a look into this Roosevelt Street alley; just about one step wide, with a five-story house on one side that gets its air and light - God help us for pitiful mockery! - from this slit between the walls,\\" he writes. (Riis, 35)Throughout the book Riis mentions the lack of sunlight, lack of clean air and filth that are part of the everyday lives of those living in the tenements. But, \\"when the sun shines the entire population seeks the street, carrying on its household work, its bargaining, its lovemaking on street or sidewalk, or idling there when it has nothing better to do.\\" (Riis, 47) Unfortunately these rays of sunshine are not often found in Riis' description of life in the tenements.Riis blames the tenement problem on both the rich and the poor. He writes \\"...the vilest and worst tenement property to be found anywhere, stood associated...with the name of an honored family, one of the \`oldest and best', rich in possessions and in influence.\\" (Riis, 53) The rich oppressed the immigrants through high rents, preventing them from climbing the social ladder.But Riis also blames the poor for their plight. He was troubled by the fact that many did not make an effort to learn English and other skills necessary in America. Riis attempts to hold these immigrants to the standards he held for himself. He believed that it was important for immigrants to engage in business and to assimilate into their new surroundings. Riis did not appreciate immigrants who insisted on holding onto their traditional language and culture.Riis walks the reader through the different sections of the tenement, describing the various ethnic groups with his unique editorial commentary: the Italians, Chinese, Jews, Bohemians, Blacks and Arabs. The descriptions are not what the reader would consider politically correct in this day and age. According to Riis he is being candid and reporting what he observes, but these comments are no longer acceptable, regardless of the intent.Riis also describes the plight of children. According to him, many of the children have been put out on the streets by their families who are no longer able to support them. Riis takes the readers into the ten-cent lodging houses where the children often sleep and are introduced to a life of crime, prostitution and drugs as they fall victim to those ready to take advantage of their lack of funds and family support.This book was written and published to garner public support. It accomplished the goal. According to Luc Sante, in his introduction, Riis' book had an immediate impact and reform was undertaken to improve the conditions of the poor in New York City. How the Other Half Lives was instrumental in shining the light on the tenements so that the upper and middle class could no longer ignore the plight of the poor and pretend they did not exist. The book also brought to light the effects the tenement and sweatshop owners were having on these oppressed people.As Riis takes the reader on this journey, which covers a period of time, he tells the readers of the changes that are being made. He mentions the parks that have been built, buildings that have been torn down and replaced by new buildings that have better designs, and the enactment of child-labor laws. Specifically, during the time of Riis' writing the airshaft was introduced into the design of the tenement. This allowed for air to circulate in the buildings, lowering the spread of disease. Through this book the reader actually senses the evolution of the tenement.One can't help but wonder that if Riis were walking the streets of New York City or another major city in America today, if he wouldn't be just as discouraged with what he would still find to write about and photograph. Unfortunately even the sweatshop is still a deplorable condition for immigrants one hundred years later. Fortunately, we still have journalists who are concerned enough to shed light on these conditions and continue to bring the plight of the poor and homeless to the attention of the middle and upper class, lest they be forgotten again."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"In How the Other Half Lives (originally published in 1890), Jacob Riis gives an astounding account of 19th century life in the tenements of New York City, where poverty, filth, disease, alcoholism, theft, and darkness prevail. Through his writing, statistics, and photography, Riis draws attention to unthinkable living conditions ignored too long by those better off than the tenants occupying New York's slums.In Luc Sante's introduction to the book, he summarizes Riis' view as, \\"the poor were victims rather than makers of their fate\\" (Riis, 1997). How this rings true as one reads through the pages. Riis gives the reader a better understanding of why generations of tenement occupants are trapped in a rut of constant strife and struggle, without education or means to rise above. The dense immigrant population of New York's tenements led to a very limited and low-paying job market, typically that of sweatshop labor. With the problems of the tenements came saloons, gangs, thieves, orphaned babies and other societal issues. The conditions of the tenements expanded the divide between New York's classes of citizens.Many of New York City's poor worked from dusk till midnight daily, only to earn starving wages which barely allowed them to feed and clothe their families or pay overpriced rent to wealthy landlords. Their circumstances did not afford them time for learning, particularly the English language. Without learning, financial savings, or often a job, these impoverished families could not escape the tenement properties and their resulting miserable way of life. Riis describes it best as \\"the poor are what the tenements have made them\\" (Riis, 1997).Riis provides several proven recommendations for improving New York's poverty situation caused by the tenements such as remodeling or building new tenements and instituting \\"fair play between landlord and tenant\\" (1997). He cites a few examples of landlords who reformed their properties and worked collaboratively with their tenants to successfully improve their lives.Riis' answer to the problems of the tenements is \\"all a matter of education,\\" education of landlords, of tenant families, of the public and elite, and of politicians (1997). In a more uplifting chapter, Riis describes a successful rescue program through the Children's Aid Society which instilled self-help and effectively educated young, troubled boys, the \\"Street Arabs.\\" Many of these young boys (and girls in other Children's Aid Society programs) learned trades and skills that would help them overcome the entrapping cycle of poverty.By writing this book, Riis played a major role in his plight for education about and of the tenements. According to Sante's introduction, Riis was successful in changing the status and structure of the tenements through publication of How the Other Half Lives. Riis concludes, \\"I know of but one bridge that will carry us over safe, a bridge founded upon justice and built of human hearts (1997).\\"Although this book was written during the industrialization period in the late 1890's to address issues faced by victims of New York's tenements, much of it is still applicable to the cycle of poverty still prevalent in America today, in the 21st century. As Riis believed, education plays an important part of breaking this cycle and closing the gap between the rich and poor. Benjamin Franklin, writing a century before Riis' time that education should not be a privilege only for the elite, would have agreed with his value of education as a resolution for tenement poverty (Isaacson, 2003).This book opened my eyes to just how cyclical poverty is. It can be a downward spiral for many generations. Any one interested in having a better understanding of poverty, especially of immigrants or the uneducated, should read How the Other Half Lives. I have a greater appreciation for the opportunities and fortune many of us have. Riis has inspired me to further my contributions toward education. In support of Franklin and Riis' values of education, I think the opportunity of education should be available for all to help break this cycle. I think Riis is right...until the bridge of justice built of human hearts he speaks of is fully constructed, situations of poverty will continue.ReferencesIsaacson, W. (2003).

This book serves as a Historical context of the conditions of early American immigrants. Riis is a perfect candidate to write this novel because he knows what it is like to be an immigrant, and live in poverty. Riis was the third of Fifteen children and emigrated to the U.S. in 1870. According to his biography on http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAriis.htmRiis \\"was often forced to spend the night in police station lodging houses.\\" due to lack of money. It was not until three years later that Riis found work inside a news bureau.Prehaps because Riis was able to escape proverty, he was easy to critic those that give up with out putting up a fight. Riis clearly blames the slum tenement problem on both the rich and the poor through his harsh racial comments. The rich oppresses the immigrants through high rents to prevent them from moving up in the social ladder while most of the poor do no make an effort to learn English and other skills to survive in America.This is a good book to have but it's not a very relaxing book to read. Most of the pictures are not very high quality, considering the time period it was taken, but it really does not do justice to that era. I also find Riis's writing style very dull and lengthy. (I guess some call that poetic)."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"I'm in agreement with other reviewers on the terrible quality of this edition!

The author speaks with a crusader's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements, these streets, and these people as if they were living today. This is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men, the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of New York City in the late 1800s. He so graphically describes the filth, the sunless and airless rooms, the crowding, and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart. Riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people's plight. His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery. He, for the most part, blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions: \\"How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man.\\" (p. 266). He laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor. Then, after his extensive discourse, he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions, something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers.Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says, \\"If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice, it has served its purpose.\\" The author apparently succeeded with his purpose, because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us: \\"This book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major U. S. cities.\\"How does this book relate to adult education? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s, are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem. \\"Thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education, all the more urgent because these people are poor, miserably poor almost to a man.\\" (p. 147). He does not forget that this \\"education\\" is not only for the poor people, but also for the wealthy landlords. \\"Clearly, it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant.\\" (p. 270). Riis' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity. \\"It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society.\\" (p. 233). The relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society.Although this book was exhaustive in its detail, it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening. I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the different races. In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era. Read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm:Jewtown, Bandit's Roost, Double Alley, The Bowery, The Bloody Sixth Ward, The Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Wards, Blindman's Alley, The Bend, The Battery, Little Italy, The French Quarter, Hell's Kitchen, The West Side, Bottle Alley, Frog Hollow, Poverty Gap, Murderer's Alley, Gotham Court, The Old Brewery, Old Africa, Potter's Field, Blackwell's Island Asylum, Rogues' Gallery, Penitentiary Row, Chinatown. The list goes on. To someone reared in rural America, this chant sounds like a song about another country.Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City:Chinaman (he can't be taught), (Chinese (coolie--laundry business), Polish Jew (coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling), Russian Jew, Jew (money is their God), Bohemian (poor, but thrifty), Blacks (like to gamble, but they are clean), Greek, Hebrews (tailors, all of them), Dutchman, Irish (like to drink and have expensive funerals), German (order loving), Swiss, Pasquales, Russian, Italian (a born gambler; lighthearted and gay), Swamp Angel (thieves), Street Arabs (army of homeless boys), Tramps and Toughs (the world owes them a living),and the Celtics. I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis' comments about every race.I noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day. Riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday. I hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days. Does every generation think that is happening in their time?Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City\`s tenements, but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change. It is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man's greed overrides his concern for human dignity."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"I needed to buy this book for school, and decided to get the kindle edition because it was cheaper.

First, the life of immigrants to New York City in the late 1800s was deplorable while housing for others was splendid. \\"To-day three fourths of its people live in the tenements, and the nineteenth century drift of the population to the cities is sending ever-increasing multitudes to crowd them\\" (Riis, p. 6) Sections of tenement houses were divided by streets and alleys which divided the nationalities. \\"As emigration from east to west follows the latitude, so does the foreign influx in New York distribute itself along certain well-defined lines that waver and break only under the stronger pressure of a more gregarious race or the encroachments of inexorable business.\\" (Riis, p. 21) Each nationality had some very distinct characteristics but they also had some very great differences as well.The next theme to emerge was that of work. In some sections of the city, it was acceptable for everyone to work while in other sections, only the men did physical work while the women \\"kept house\\" or there was even mention of the men just standing in doorways, streets and alleys. \\"The men sit or stand in the streets, on trucks, or in the open doors of the saloons smoking black clay pipes, talking and gesticulating as if forever on the point of coming to blows.\\" (Riis, p. 49) Money was earned, at very small rates throughout the tenements, by someone in the family, if not multiple people. \\"Often there are two, sometimes three, sets of sweaters on the job. They work with the rest when they are not drumming up trade, driving their \`hands' as they drive their machine, for all they are worth, and making a profit on their work, of course, though in most cases not nearly as extravagant a percentage, probably, as is often supposed. If it resolves itself unto a margin of five or six cents, or even less, on a dozen pairs of boys' trousers, for instance, it is nevertheless enough to make the contractor with his thrifty instinct independent. The workman growls, not at the hard labor or poor pay, but over the pennies another is coining out of his sweat, and on the first opportunity turns sweater himself, and takes his revenge by driving an even closer bargain than his rival tyrant, t his reducing his profits.\\" (Riis, p 94)Finally, the third theme centered on bringing about change via real people, real stories and images of real life in the tenements. \\"Riis made maximum use of photographs, however, not only to illustrate six of his books, but also as lantern slides to illustrate lectures he began giving in 1888 and continued until his death.\\" (Riis, p. xvii) People are drawn to real life situations to which they can relate. The accounts, photographs and images of Riis bring real life accounts to the reader, sparking more interest, creating a deeper relationship between the characters in the story and the reader. And by doing so, Riis encourages others to take action to remedy the sad situation.As the previous themes are analyzed, connections can be made between them and education and society of today. It is important to first note that in today's society, there are still sections in certain towns and cities that are divided predominantly by ethnic diversity. Not only is housing situations but also in educational systems the divisions are found, although it is encouraged that the lines be broken down. \\"The many philanthropic efforts that have been made in the last few years to render less intolerable the lot of the tenants in the homes where many of them must continue to live, have undoubtedly had their effect in creating a disposition to accept better things, that will make plainer sailing for the future builders of model tenements., In many ways, as in the \`College Settlement' of courageous girls, the Neighborhood Guilds, through the efforts of The King's Daughters, and numerous other schemes of practical mission work, the poor and the well-to-do have been brought closer together, in an every-day companionship that cannot but be productive of the best results, to the one who gives no less than tto the one who receives.\\" (Riis, p. 207) Obviously different locales call for difference measures of tolerance and defend certain levels of intolerance but the lines exist nonetheless. \\"The experience of this landlord points directly to the remedy which the law failed to supply to the early reformers. It has since been fully demonstrated that a competent agent on the premises, a man of the best and the highest stamp, who knows how to instruct and guide with a firm hand, is a prerequisite to the success of any reform tenement scheme.\\" (Riis, p. 205)Secondly, work was important in this book. Riis did an excellent job of documenting the working conditions and who was responsible for certain jobs in the tenements in each section. Just as Benjamin Franklin valued an honest day's work, so did the people of the tenements. The biggest difference between those two accounts of work was who was actually responsible for the work. Depending upon the culture of the area sometimes it was the men, women or children, or all three, that completed work to earn money or keep house. \\"Men, women and children work together seven days in the week in these cheerless tenements to make a living for the family, from the break of day till far into the nights. Often the wide is the original cigarmaker from the old home, the husband having adopted her trade here as a matter of necessity, because, knowing no word of English, he could get no other work.\\" (Riis, p. 105) But how did people in this situation become educated to work? \\"The old question, what to do with the boy, assumes a new and serious phase in the tenements. Under the best conditions found there, it is not easily answered. In nine cases out of ten he would make an excellent mechanic, if trained early to work at a trade, for he is neither full nor slow, but the short-sighted despotism of the trades unions has practically closed that avenue to him. Trade-schools, however excellent, cannot supply the opportunity thus denied him. Home, the greatest factor of all in the training of the young, means nothing to him but a pigeon-hole in a coop along with so many other human animals. Its influence is scarcely of the elevating kind, if it have any....With no steady hand to guide him, the boy takes naturally to idle ways.\\" (Riis, p. 136)Finally, it is important to note the third theme of bringing reality into the lives of the reader. In education today, it is important to show real life application of concepts and ideas for learning to take place. Riis was a pioneer in bringing photographs, real images and valid data to people to create a felt need for change and response. Most photographs in the book are very dark and only add realism to the stories told. For example, the photographs on pages 93, 104 appear very dark and the subjects unhappy. The fact that Riis was probably standing, himself, in the darkest part of the room and photographing the lightest part of the room, near the windows, only tells the reader that even in the lightest part of the room, the darkness and dreariness ruled over the tenements. \\"Riis's use of photography to point his words and flesh out his anecdotes is no less important, endowing an entire legacy of its own.\\" (Riis, p. xiii)I believe the intent of the author was to simply bring a big picture view to narrow minded people. He very much accomplished his purpose. By using stories of families, shocking details and everyday photographs of real people, he was able to bring people to understand the reality of life in their own city and encourage them to help make changes. It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and Riis is a prime example of this. Not only are his accounts vivid and horrific, but also his images leave nothing to the imagination. The reader can not be left to imagining a rosier picture than was intended. The illustrations both verbal and nonverbal are graphic and moving.The appropriate audience for this book would have to be very broadly, mature, adult citizens of our world. The language used in this book can be, at times, a bit complicated to comprehend; this is why I believe it appropriate for mature adults. I also believe very firmly that adults are sometimes the most difficult to convince to take action to help those less fortunate or those in need. When we read real life accounts and see pictures of people just like us in deplorable conditions, it is difficult for us to sit back and take no action. I also believe it is important for citizens of our world to understand the underlying message of helping those less fortunate or those in need who may be right in our own back yard. This book is a stunning example of one man giving factual accounts of events to produce concerned citizens ready to take action to improve conditions for fellow human beings."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"Yes, the stories in this book are depressing. Yes, they are still happening even today. However, Riis's writing style is quite sensantionalist, it had me rolling my eyes every paragraph or so. And he is quite prejudice against a whole multitude of races and religions. Again, yes I know this was written in 1890, but the sheer volume of his judgement against other cultures, etc. really took me out of the core stories of the conditions of the people detailed in the book.A fair amount of the book had me interested, it's just the way the stories were told made me not be able to disgest their content very well."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"How did our grandfathers and great-grandfathers (and great-great, I suppose) survive immigration and the slums? What was life like on the Lower East Side of New York? For those of us whose family has only been in the US for a few generations, this is a must-read. Whether Irish, Italian, Jewish, Chinese or Polish, German, Russian, hordes of refugees ended up in New York on the promise of a better life.Reading Riis' book reads like the newspaper in some ways; entrepreneurs lured poor people from Eastern Europe and contracted out their labor in sweat shops in the US. Sound familiar? But what is not so familiar are the living conditions in the tenements, dark, unventilated cages in blocks of buildings that rented for a surprising high rent to people who died by the thousands in the unsanitary conditions. Farm animals had it better. Why was rent so high? Supply and demand. Cheaper rent was to be had in Brooklyn and the outlying (as yet unincorporated) boroughs, but the WORK was in Manhattan, where you could get by as a tailor, a seamstress, a peddler or in some illegitimate activity.The conditions will make you cry; the story of foundling babies (abandoned newborns) is astonishing. A cradle was put outside a Catholic Church and instead of a baby each night, racks of babies appeared. The Church had to establish foundling hospitals run by nuns, who persuaded the unwed or impoverished mothers to nurse the baby they gave up, plus another baby (women can usually nurse two, though these malnourished women must have been hard-pressed.) The child mortality rate, especially in the \\"back tenements\\" or buildings built on to the back of others (dark and airless) was incredible.I wish the plates in the book were of better quality; Riis took many photographs, but the reproduction here is poor and they are hard to see. I recommend that if you are interested in this subject from seeing \\"The Gangs of New York\\" or for genealogical reasons, that you visit the Lower East Side Tenement Museum and see the buildings for yourself. Even cleaned up and no longer packed with unwashed people, they are heart-rending."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"This edition of How the Other Half Lives is astoundingly bad.

And this new genre, like the first movies and radio programs, fascinated its audience. Riis' sharp essays are matched only by his sharp eye for photography. I don't know which made more of an impact on me: the text or the pictures of unspeakable misery. But I think it's a safe bet to say that Riis' contemporaries were fixated more on the photographs. (After all, Riis turned to photography AFTER his published essays seemed to have little effect.) In any event, the result, then as now, is a provocative, compassionate, and angry work that exposed to the middle and upper classes of his time the effects of their indifference, at best, or the effects of their roles as slumlords and sweatshop owners, at worst.The only jarring aspect of the book is Riis' use of ethnic stereotyping. He makes several not-nice remarks about Jews, Chinamen, Italians, etc. However, we must not impose our early 21st Century values on a late 19th Century man. These types of remarks were commonplace back in the pre-politically correct times. In any event, Riis' overall intention was to help these people get out of their horrid conditions and not to slur their heritages.One last note, Luc Sante's introduction is brilliant and serves the book very well.Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points Concluded, a Novel"},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"This is an extremely important work that is often difficult to find at local libraries.

He used his writing and photography to publicize the lifestyles of the lower classes in New York City in the late nineteenth through early twentieth centuries. In How the Other Half Lives, Riis described the inherent injustices and terrible living conditions of New York City tenements. He exposed the public to the evils of tenement life, portraying New York City living conditions of the lower classes for what they truly were. He successfully accomplished his goal of attracting attention to a dire situation.Riis wrote How the Other Half Lives to evoke sympathy to awaken the masses to the poverty in their backyards. Through his writings and photographs Riis knew people would become aware and respond to the living conditions in New York slums. Tenements were large buildings that overflowed with families living under miserable conditions. People representing many different nationalities lived in New York City tenements, and the population of immigrants grew incredibly during this time of emigration. It quickly became the most heterogeneous city in the country, and the different Europeans lived together under terrible conditions. Some immigrant groups of the same nationality lived in small separate communities together. Most settled on the East Side of New York, where the New York aristocracy had lived. The contrast between the days when the aristocracy lived on the East Side and when the immigrants moved there is quite apparent.Jacob Riis stated, &quot;Homes had ceased to be sufficiently separate, decent, and desirable to afford what are regarded as ordinary wholesome influences of home and family.&quot; Tenements were overcrowded, dark, and unsanitary. Riis felt nobody should live in these conditions, and he called people to recognize the horrors of immigrant life. The homes of these immigrants were described in this way, &quot;Large rooms were partitioned into several smaller ones, without regard to light or ventilation, the rate of rent being lower in proportion to space or height from the street; and they soon became filled from cellar to garret with a class of tenantry living from hand to mouth, loose in morals, improvident in habits, degraded, and squalid as beggary itself.&quot; One of Riis's photographs, &quot;In Poverty Gap, West Twenty-Fourth Street An English Coal Heaver's Home&quot; depicts a typical poor immigrant family who obviously had very little materially and lived in a dilapidated tenement. The family seems very hardened in emotion, as if they are not even real. The combination of poignant quotes and photographs such as these led people to challenge the status quo.One of Riis's major tasks was to distinguish the difference between the &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot; of New York City by comparing the immigrants with the few rich. There was very little social mobility for tenement immigrants, who made up the majority of the population. He appealed to the consciousness of the rich by saying, &quot;As business increased, and the city grew with rapid strides, the necessities of the poor became the opportunity of their wealthier neighbors.&quot; This points out the exploitation of immigrants by the wealthy class that Riis felt existed. No matter how hard they worked, there seemed to be no way out for the immigrants. &quot;Knee Pants at Forty-Five Cents a Dozen - a Ludlow Street Sweater's Shop&quot; is a photograph that shows an entire family working diligently in their confined tenement. This illustrates that there was no hope for immigrant families; they kept working but reaped no benefits. Riis blamed the tenement living conditions for the crimes and unethical behavior he saw among the immigrants. He blamed their poor standard of living for the abundance of crime and other abuses in immigrant neighborhoods. &quot;A Downtown Morgue&quot; presents us with drinking, one of the vices of the immigrants, but implies that they had nothing to encourage them to stay away from it. The photograph also reinforces the poverty and hopelessness, suggesting the immigrants had nothing to live for so they wasted their lives away on alcohol. Riis took a special interest in children because he saw them as innocent people who had become so jaded by their surroundings that they became criminals. &quot;Prayer Time in the Nursery, Five Points House of Industry&quot; portrays young children praying, probably indicating Riis's dream that all children would be set on the right path and stay there throughout their lives.A major criticism to Riis's work is that he was prejudiced and writing from a biased point of view. Riis reflected the view of the upper classes toward the immigrants and poorer classes, and readers can pick up on this through the biases in his work. He could not fully understand the plight of the people he studied because he was not one of them. Riis used terms that were crude and unflattering to the nationalities of those whom he was describing. He describes the &quot;Chinaman&quot; in the following way, &quot;Ages of senseless idolatry, a mere grub-worship, have left him without the essential qualities for appreciating the gentle teachings of a faith whose motive and unselfish spirit are alike beyond his grasp.&quot; He also referred to the Chinese as a &quot;terrible menace to society&quot; because of their marijuana smoking. Riis wrote that &quot;lower class&quot; Italians were foreign, different, and therefore separate from others. Other examples of vivid language Riis used were, &quot;the tramps, peddlers, hags, rude swains, and the really pretty girls.&quot; Since he was an outsider due to his class, he could not possibly relate to the people he was describing."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"\\"The business of housing the poor, if it is to amount to anything, must be business, as it was business with our fathers to put them where they are. As charity, pastime, or fad, it will miserably fail, always and everywhere\\" (p. 201). Jacob A. Riis, in his book, How the Other Half Lives, vividly describes the human condition of the tenements of New York during the late 1800's. The author provides not only a physical description of the tenement buildings but delves deeper into the people who live there and why they don't leave the pits of filth and despair.Jacob Riis, presents a compelling account of the intricate business of managing the slums of New York and maintaining the status quo among the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who came to America to seek a new and prosperous life. After arriving they found they were trapped in a life of high rents and low wages with little hope for improvement of their circumstances. What little help was available seemed to be in the form of charity that couldn't sustain the prideful immigrants desire to succeed in this country.The reader is taken on a tour of the slums and introduced to the groups of immigrants nationality by nationality and given a full account of the author's stereotypical ideas about their good and bad points. Of the Italian Riis says he only spends time indoors when it's raining or he is sick. When the sun shines the entire population seeks the streets carrying on all facets of life (p. 47). He further says the Italian is a born gambler (p 44) and learns slowly, if at all (p. 42) so that his job of working the ash carts is simply suited for him. On the positive side Riis says the Italian is as honest as he is hot-headed (p. 45).The Chinese are a stealth and secretive group with all activities going on behind closed doors (p75). They are also attributed with stealing the women of the white man and leading them into the grip of opium giving them up only to the Charity Hospital or the Potter's Field (p76). On the positive side the Chinese are noted for their scrupulous neatness (p 78).The Bohemians are an honest group but rumored as being anarchists. They are fond of beer and will live at the highest means available thus they have nothing saved for a rainy day (105). He is caught in a tough position of working for poor wages and facing rising rents with no way out. For if he rebels against low wages and high rent he loses his home and job; the two are connected as cigar making takes place in the home utilizing supplies provided by the landlords.To the Jews money is their God and they work in the tenements crowding the area of Ludlow Street more densely than the crowding of Old London (p 83). They are suited to baking as bread is cheap and their love of money and the saving of it is suited to eating bread. They are also known for their work in the clothing industry. Of the Blacks, Riis stereotypes them as cleaner and better tenants but none-the-less they pay higher rents for no one else will live in a tenement after the black man has. While much of the reading is based on the stereotypes formed by the author it still provides a vivid picture of the human condition including the live's of tramps in stale beer dives and the thugs who cause fear and trouble in the streets. Both tramps and toughs profess that the world owes them a living (p64). The author also relates the degree to which the upper class try to distort the reality of life in the tenements, classifying starvation as \\"improper nourishment\\". In one case starvation led one poor man to thoughts of murdering his own children. In his madness he had only one conscious thought: that the town should not take the children. \\"Better that I take care of them myself ,\\" he repeated to himself as he ground the axe to an edge.(p 127).Due to this book, Riis was able to draw public attention to the horrendous living conditions of the poor in New York City, and to insist on reform. The reforms he recommended were largely undertaken, although it was a very gradual process (p. ix). This may be partially attributed to political factors relating to the fact that political contests were won in the areas with the fully packed lodging houses (p 71). With this writing Riis does not allow the world to forget easily, what it does not like to remember (p196)."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"Riis's work is an amazing picture of life in the New York slums. While the text in itself is quite interesting, the photos are perhaps the most gripping aspect of the book. To see the tiny, crowded rooms populated by unreal numbers of people and the eyes of hungry children that stare out of the picture and are still imploring a century later is a powerful experience; Riis's book allows one to get very close to the misery these people felt. This book is not for the soft-hearted, as it is a very grim depection of life, such as it was for these immigrants."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"Jacob Riis' first and most influential book, How the Other Half Lives details the lives of the impoverished of New York City's slums at the end of the 19th century. His expose was highly influential and brought about a number of reforms within the City, yet the tome is filled with almost comical stereotypes and prejudices about the various races and cultures found within the domain of the tenements, sidestreets and alleyways that the poor called, for lack of a better word, home. Despite this massive shortcoming (a sign of the times Riis lived in), Other Half is an engaging read and showcases the severe plight too many endured during this period in history, moreso than the most depressingly dour of Dickensian prose."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"Few books in American history have had the social impact that Jacob A. Riis's How the Other Half Lives had. Riis spent years crawling through the slums of New York's Lower East Side in the later half of the nineteenth-century, always with a local guide sympathetic to his cause. He hoped, through the evolving technological advances of photography and his published, emotional plea, to rouse the well-to-do citizens of New York into helping the millions of poor and impoverished, native and immigrant alike, which continued to swell the city's population. In order for them to have had the chance of becoming productive American citizens, they must first have been given the opportunity at a fair start, which the abject state of the tenement buildings were unable to provide.The first problem was the tenement itself. Usually a building, four to six stories high, intended for the occupancy of just a few families, soon had over a hundred people packed into every nook that could fill a human body. Most interior rooms never saw the light of day. Fresh air was a rare commodity, leaving most residents to breathe the same stale air day and night. The maze of tight, blind passageways created to fit each family made it impossible for firemen to reach helpless victims trapped on the upper floors, compounded by the fact that most fire escapes were blocked with residents' furniture, trapping more even still. Overall, the filth of the structures proved most offensive to the senses. One such building was so dubbed the \\"Dirty Spoon\\" because the grime on the walls had effectively made it fire proof (Riis 30). Rear tenements, built in empty courts behind the street buildings, were usually worse, little more than dilapidated hovels cut off from light by the surrounding structures.Despite this vision of abject poverty, and indeed starvation was prevalent, many in the tenements were not what would have been considered poor. Some, in fact, earned a decently living for the era. So why didn't they move? The real question to be asked is, to where would they move? Tenement houses were the norm in New York, each as good (or lousy) as the next. Additionally, the rents paid by most of these residents (especially blacks) were very high, often amounting to more than a week's wage. Only the abundantly wealthy could afford better, while the middle and lower classes were left to the stink of places like \\"The Bend\\" on Mulberry Street, which Riis considers the heart of slum depravity.Predictably, these conditions bred all types of criminal activity. Faced with constant hunger and only the streets to call home, many resorted to gang violence or controlled substance dependency. Children, who sometimes never saw beyond their squalid block, with a family that could not provide for their basic needs, soon created gangs of their own, making their way as they could. Other children toiled with their families in the sweatshops, for which the tenements were the main housing. Perhaps the most regrettable victims of the tenements were the infants, who were regularly victims of abandonment, left on wealthy doorsteps with vain hopes by desperate parents, or given up to \\"Baby-farms\\" where they were left to starve to death (Riis 148). These conditions Riis blames squarely on tenements: \\"The product is our own\\" (Riis 171).However, all hope was not lost to Riis. Already airshafts had been implemented in new building designs to allow ventilation (to what effect can be debated) and new windows punched into walls, so that \\"air and sunlight\\" could \\"have a legal claim\\" (Riis 211). Rear tenements, too, were quickly disappearing. He felt that by writing How the Other Half Lives, the wealthy and influential of the city would come to the aid (Riis 131). In this respect he was correct, when through his book he found an ally in Theodore Roosevelt, who began implementing many of the suggestions that Riis proposed. He urged people to look beyond the building facades (which were admittedly nice on some buildings) to the teeming filth that they masked (Riis 209). Perhaps the most intimidating argument for his more fortunate peers was the possibility of spreading disease, for to him public sentiment had \\"slumbered peacefully until... a dreaded epidemic knocked at our door\\" (Riis 212). He called for laws to be imposed against the current tenement conditions, for the buildings to be renovated or new \\"model tenements\\" built in their place (Riis 223). Likewise, tenants should have received the quality accommodations their high rents were entitling them to. Riis endorsed the park system (City-Beautiful influence?) as a way of relieving crime in congested districts, for reasons such as this elegant observation: \\"I have seen an armful of daisies keep the peace of a block better than a policeman and his club, seen instincts awaken under their gentle appeal\\" (Riis 138). Children, Riis felt, were the \\"key\\" to rescuing the city from poverty and corruption (Riis 143).The other contribution for which Riis has been immortalized, and no doubt thanked repeatedly by modern historians, is the treasure trove of photos he took while on his outings, one hundred of which are found in the Dover edition. (His original publication did not include the photos for technological reasons). The impact of the strikingly bleak images caught on film far outweighs any of the emotional condemnations he wrote. The reader, thankfully, is also treated to many of the stories behind these images, adding yet another dimension, such as the young paupers on page 157 who claimed that they \\"Didn't live nowhere.\\" Another, probably unintentional, effective element to the photos is the pained grimace on many faces (like the \\"Street Arab\\" on page 152), as though they are writhing in agony from hunger, although it is no doubt just a reaction from the camera's blinding flash in dark quarters. The street dwellers and criminals, even those presumably embarrassed by their situations, seem willing to have their pictures taken. Perhaps it is the only such opportunity many had.Despite Riis's commendable crusading and fight for the underprivileged, he was still in many ways a man of his time. The modern reader cannot help but be struck by the prejudices running through his commentary. The groups that receive the most of the brunt are the Italians and Polish Jews. The Chinese also pay a price for their differences, and Riis tells us that his \\"senseless idolatry, a mere grub-worship\\" have made nothing strong about him, except his passions when aroused\\" (Riis 77) and speaks of opium addiction as a form of white slavery (Riis 80). At least he commends them for being clean. Surprisingly, however, he looks fondly on African-Americans (along with Bohemians), who he treats with sympathetic respect. He sees their hardships, and the causes (ironically), that \\"the blame is born by prejudice and greed that have kept him from rising under a burden of responsibility to which he could hardly be equal\\" under those circumstances. That after only twenty-five years of freedom, he \\"may be seen to advance much farther and faster than before suspected, and to promise, with fair treatment, quite as well as the rest of us, his white-skinned fellow-citizens\\" (Riis 119). When he wished, it seems, Riis was quite able to see beyond differences.Riis, through How the Other Half Lives, awakened a society that had once turned a blind eye to the hardships prevalent in the tenements. He showed them effectively that the struggle was not theirs alone, but that its reach was felt for many miles in ways not readily apparent. His photographic images, forever capturing the lowest moments in people's lives, begged for intervention. Whatever Riis's shortcomings, future generations in New York and cities around the country would be better off because of what he did, and benefit from the experiences of those who did not live long enough to see those changes occur. Unfortunately, the images in Riis's work are still a common sight in many developing countries, making his century-old ideas of relevant, present power."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"I used this book along with another Riis book for a U.S. History project at school.

(1997). How the Other Half Lives. New York: PenguinIn the distance, the Statue of Liberty echoes the refrain--Give me your poor, your tired, your huddled masses. This invitation was extended to millions of immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries. Men, women, and children of varying nationalities and ethnicities made the journey to America. Consequently, they sought freedom from oppression and new opportunity in the land of plenty. However, the promises of a better life often proved unrealistic. In the late 19th century, a news writer, Jacob Riis investigated and exposed the slums of New York City. In his book, How the Other Half Lives, author Jacob Riis explores New York City's underclass. Furthermore, the graphic portrayal of the worst that life offers begins and ends with a shocking tour of the slums of New York City.Consequently, before starting on a journey through the slums of the Lower East Side of New York City, Riis reminds the reader of the cold, hard truth; the poor will always be with us (Intro-xi). However, the express intention of the author is to reveal the horrendous living conditions of the poor to public attention. The journey begins with visits to tenements. Multi-story, poorly constructed buildings crowd lots. Ethnic groups, with their idiosyncratic characteristics, specifically the Jews, Italians, Irish, Bohemians, Blacks, and Chinese, exist in the squalid, intensely overcrowded, disease ridden, poorly ventilated firetraps. Examples of the living conditions include statistics citing the world's greatest concentration of humans per square mile, an alarming death rate among young children, and the frequent deaths of men and specifically women and children in fires, where there is little chance for escape.Additionally, further trepidations are evident in the lives of the masses of humanity. In the street and alleys of the Bend, the tramps; the skulks of the slums, unclean beasts of dishonest idleness, certify their presence as the dregs of society (46). Moral depravity becomes evident as opium is constantly abused, the evils of rum disenfranchise the slum dweller, and stale beer dives appeal to the prurient interests of the frugally immoral.In addition, the color line in New York City is highlighted by the prejudice of landlords as they bilk the black man out of his hard earned wages. Furthermore, the criminality perpetrated by the gangs infects the slum with fear and lawlessness. Other crimes tear at the heart, specifically, the heinous starving to death of babies. Also, women are disadvantaged at a young age for their propensity to work for the family. They walk a fine line between the rigors of work and the temptations of selling their very body for gain. In all, the journey through the desolation of the slums is not for the faint of heart.At the close of the book, Riis offers his assessment of steps performed to alleviate the problems in the slums. These include tentative solutions involving the wealthy classes, the landlords, and the tenants. Living conditions must be improved, despite the apathy of the wealthy classes, the exorbitant greed of the landlords or the lack of resolve and interest by the tenants. Some improvements have been made, however significant strides need accomplished. The words of Riis literally plead for a call to action and progress, the reform of a city beset with human degradation and suffering.Moreover, How the Other Half Lives, fulfills the purposes of the author. It brings to the light of the public eye, an awareness of life in the slums. By means of his vigilant journey through lives of the poor and forgotten, the stories of thousands are revealed. Additionally, the book achieved a supplementary purpose. It's achievements of muckraking, caused the book to be a forerunner of investigative journalism. Furthermore, the intent of the book is not only to expose the degradation of the slums, but to provide an impetus to appropriate action. The author excelled in touching both the heart and soul of the reader.Furthermore, Jacob Riis, in How the Other Half Lives, transmits a message of Social Reformation. This message seeks relief for the disparaging poor of the slums. Additionally, the book illustrates the disparity of value systems and a defeated spirit of self consciousness. In an 1897 paper, John Dewey, states \\"education is a regulation of a process of coming to share in the social consciousness: and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of reconstruction\\" (Dewey, 1897). The people of the slums: men, women, and children needed the advantages of educational opportunities. Jacob Riis documents the misery of the slums of New York City. Coincidentally, the poor, along with drug dealers, crack whores, the homeless, and gangs still live in the crowded slums of New York City. How do we raise the social consciousness and provide educational initiatives for the slum dwellers of today?Subsequently, the book is a must read for all manners of people. The eye opening, jaw dropping revelations of the New York City slums provoke both anguish and compassion. Yes, as we students sit sipping our second cup of cappuccino, relaxing upon a plush couch, watching our big screen television, we may enjoy reading How the Other Half Lives.ReferencesDewey, J.

Riis gives the reader a front row view of life in the tenements of New York City at the end of the 19th century. Please consider the time period in which Riis wrote his book to put the ethnic, racial, class, and gender biases inherent in his work into the proper historical context. Personally, I found this offensive, but I aimed to not condemn the messenger without hearing the message first.Riis tells the story of millions of lives marked by never-ending hard labor, lack of adequate nourishment and housing, violence, abuse, addiction, and disease. Many of these people living in the tenements were first-generation immigrants from Ireland, Russia, Eastern Europe, and Italy. The push/pull of migration to the United States ends in the New York tenements in a million shattered dreams. Rather than finding the land of opportunity, immigrants were exploited for their cheap labor.Despite Riis' biases as a journalist and observer, he was motivated by charity and goodwill to investigate the living conditions of the poor and expose the harsh reality to the world. By doing so, Riis intended to bring about social change. The reality of his expose is heart wrenching more than a century after its writing. Riis main thesis is an argument for changing the living conditions of the poor. He calls for improved housing and renovated neighborhoods as a means to improve the lives of the tenement dwellers. However, Riis does not directly make a call for educating the poor, but his writing brings the salient absence of education to bear and he does make note of attempts by church groups to educate the poor.Down in the Tenth Ward on Ludlow Street, Riis meets Polish and Russian Jews who manufacture clothing is sweltering, cramped tenements that serve both as home and factory to its inhabitants. In the chapter, entitled The Sweaters of Jewtown, an entire family works eighteen hours a day, in unhealthy, dangerous conditions to produce 1,440 pairs of knickerbockers for a mere $8.40 a week. Sweaters are to clothing manufacturing what slumlords are to housing. These migrants are exploited in many ways. The sweater gets a shocking low price for production because the workers, who rarely speak English, must underbid unions and other immigrant workers just to have work. The landlord, sometimes also the sweater, takes the exploitation one step further down toward hell and charges the highest rent he can, and requires the workers to purchase raw materials and tools. This is textbook exploitation of the disadvantaged. After all that, workers barely earn enough money to keep starvation at bay. The working and living conditions for families who are supported by the work of women fair far worse than families who have a male head of household due to the grotesque inequity in pay between males and females.Riis' story of the family living on Mott Street was far too common and representative of Riis' overall description of life in the tenements. The Mott Street family was worse off than the Jewish family he met on Ludlow Street mostly because they could not work. Without social welfare programs and medical care, they had no alternative but to suffer through their cruel fate. The doctor had been called because the baby was gravely ill. The diagnosis was \\"improper nourishment\\" (Riis, p. 126). In other words, the baby was dying from starvation. The father could no longer work because his hands were deformed from lead poisoning and because the family did not have medical care, an infectious eye condition had nearly blinded the children and the mother.If one is not moved by an ethical responsibility to alleviate the suffering of the poor and work to eradicate poverty, the Mott Street family demonstrates that poverty kills and is contagious; therefore, poverty is a public health issue. In a Jewish community, Riis notes that: \\"Typhus fever and small-pox are bread here, and help solve the question what to do with him.\\" (Riis, p. 85) This statement could be viewed as a rather anti-Semitic notion, but what Riis is really saying is that poverty is a matter of public health and infectious diseases pose a serious health threat. These two examples show how Riis wanted to shock the nation with the truth.While middle class boys were off to school, children in the tenements lived a hard life. Riis also tells us how poor children were exploited and abused. The story of \\"Edward Mulhearn, fourteen years old, had run away from his home in Jersey City\\" (Riis, p. 68) was not an isolated case. Edward was \\"employed\\" by a hustler who forced him to beg for money. To insure that Edward would solicit the most sympathy, thus bring in more money, he was burned with a hot iron and then acid was poured into the open wound.An entire essay could be written on the conditions of women and girls living in the tenements, but there is not time for that here. Let it suffice to say that females were at the very bottom of the social hierarchy and made the perfect victims. So were African Americans. Despite Riis' obvious racism and gender biases, he seems to have a special affinity and genuine fondness for women and African Americans. Riis recognized that the working skills that African Americans had used in the South became obsolete once they migrated to Northern urban areas and that employable skills were needed to promote the advancement of Blacks in society. He blamed bigotry and lack of education for their place in society. Riis recognizes that African Americans needed new job skills in order to gain employment. Today, call that workforce development and community education. At a time when African Americas were the receivers of a lot of racial animosity in the urbanized North, Riis points the finger at those who put the Black man and woman out of work by taking over his and her jobs and preventing entry into other jobs. \\"Even the colored barber is rapidly getting to be a thing of the past.\\" (Riis, p. 114)In the chapter entitled \\"The Street Arab,\\" Riis demonstrates the non-formal education that homeless boys received from the Children's Aid Society. The boys were allowed to help themselves and as long as they followed the rules, they could stay at the Society lodging house. This \\"God helps those who help themselves\\" attitude is evident in the largess bestowed on the street boys. A boy could be outfitted with a black boot kit to work the city streets shining shoes, but the boy has to purchase his trade tools on an installment plan. There were not any formal trades open to these poor kids or to their parents. The tenements of New York needed one of Franklin's free libraries and Junto organizations, but they first would need to be fed and taught to read and write.What ever formal or non-formal education the Society was able to offer these boys was contingent on first convincing the boys that their charity was not a \\"Sunday-school racket,\\" which is a reference to the missionary attempts to teach people to read to better serve God. This long-standing Protestant tradition was the hallmark of early American educational movements and the theoretical basis for literacy. The debate between the religious and secular virtues of education was an inheritance from Colonial times. Riis, like Benjamin Franklin over a century earlier, thought education was important to civil society, rather than a means to glorify God. Walter Isaacson notes in his masterful autobiography Benjamin Franklin: An American Life that the...\\"Great Awakeners sought to recommit America to the anguished spirituality Puritanism, whereas Franklin sought to bring it into an Enlightenment era that exalted tolerance, individual merit, civic virtue, good deeds, and rationality. (Isaacson, p. 109)Riis recognizes the futility in trying to convert people who are starving, homeless, and suffering when he writes: \\"How shall the love of god be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man?\\" (Riis, p.198) Riis calls for civil reformation that involves fair play in everything from controlled housing prices, opening trades and unions to the marginalized, ethical business practices, and laws that promote equal opportunities.Riis shows us that poverty and lack of education go hand in hand: it's a reciprocal process and one influences the other. This book was a hard read for me on several levels, but it is a lesson in compassion and a salient reminder of how lucky most of us truly are. Riis book show us that education was at a crisis stage in the urban U.S. in the late 19th century, and something had to give, or the nation would not survive in a changing world. I am grateful to of had the opportunity to read this book, and I would recommend it for reading to anyone interested in issues of race, class, and gender. Riis' book is a dark window into what life in an American city can be like when education is not an option. This book is of utmost importance to the social historian, child advocate, and social worker."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"This book is a MUST for everybody who is interested in New York City and its history!It is the perfect preparation before a tour of the tenement museum!Read it!"},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"If you read this you'll be done and what's really sad the same game is going on today.

Robin Hood along with his merry men is the most legendary of all those which have called Nottingham their home. The lace and hosiery industries, tobacco manufacturer, Ericsson's telephones and Boots the Chemist all add to the wealthy and prosperous image of this famous city. The multitude of bars, clubs and restaurants coupled with the present property boom accommodate the cosmopolitan urbanites who are attracted to this affluent metropolis.Undeniably the Nottingham that is presented and known to the world is a desirable one. Yet, like all cities Nottingham has pockets of less well-off communities. Sections of society are often ignored and, \\"Not only do people not know how the other half lives; they scarcely know that the other half exists.\\" This quote taken from Poverty: The Forgotten Englishmen, written in the 1970's is just as applicable today. During the mid-late 1960's the authors of this book, Ken Coates and Richard Silburn plus a group of students from the Nottingham University Department of Adult Education and some undergraduates from the Social Sciences department of the same University, conducted an investigation into the \`conditions in Nottingham'. And the result of this social survey is what comprises a large section of the book.The social survey concentrated its focus on the inner city area of St Ann's. Then, as now, places only a few minutes walk from the prosperous city centre presented a dichotomy with this affluence, that was blindingly obvious. The investigation undertaken concentrated on the \\"poor people in Nottingham\\", and St Anns' reputation as \`a slum' was the perfect location to conduct their study.In the section entitled \`How the Poor Live: The case of St Ann's' the social survey began. How many people were poor by modern standards and what percentage of the population did they comprise? And are there any remedies more appropriate than another for this \`group' of people? These questions are answered throughout the course of the book with a flair that renders the theories contained within the answers easily comprehended. The results are interesting and eye opening. Within the area of St Ann's old people formed the largest group of poor people, followed by those households wherein the breadwinner's income is slightly too much to receive help but not enough to live on. Large families and those who are out of work due to sickness or incapacity form two further groups. However, the findings show that poverty in life is not just monetary, \\"poverty is not so much a simple lack of wealth as a more basic lack of power.\\"The authors ask \`What is poverty and how can it be defined'. There is an ambiguity about the meaning of the word \`poverty' and the \`lack' of things, which defines a group as poor, is relative and forever shifting. Poverty could be a lack of numerous things; power, freedom, morale or a loss of equality within society. Causes of poverty, such as low wages, death of the wage earner, sickness, irregular work and the size of a family combine with external causes, such as inadequate housing, poor amenities and facilities, to provide the overall face of poverty.This is the description of St Ann's given with Poverty; \\"At first sight this, then, is St Ann's; a large deteriorated district, geographically distinct, with a certain sense of identity.\\" However, as Coates and Silburn correctly point out, the poor live their lives distinct from their category and when asked by the authors most did not consider themselves as poor in all the ways defined above. A move toward a solution, then, to causes of poverty could be a simple shift in perception. As the book here reviewed points out, the poor, \\"must be seen not simply as isolated individuals, abstracted from society, but as human beings formed in the very society from which they are to a greater or lesser extent excluded.\\"This book encompasses a multitude of questions, answers and problems concerning poverty. It's socio-historical basis causes it be appealing to all and in particular those interested in local history and general sociological concerns. It is a, \\"valuable and important work, any serious student of modern society will require this sort of detailed knowledge and no intelligent discussion of remedies is possible without it.\\""},{"Title":"Naturally Sweet Desserts: The Sugar-Free Dessert Cookbook","review":"Healthy?

Hoey hypothesizes a four-fold model comprising writer, author, audience, and reader, all of whom interact in complex but systematic ways within textual interaction. The thread running through the work is that coherence is a sine qua non for texts, and it is around and against coherence that the most germane questions about interaction - via the threat of incoherence - are posed.Hoey's reader is not overburdened with technical vocabulary, but is lead through the material by the author's enlightened voice, and plenty of illustrative illustrations. While he makes no claim to uncover universals of text reading behaviors, Hoey does succeed in illuminating many aspects of writer signalling and reader expectation in English texts. The approach, I have found, is particularly useful to anyone studying text analysis in order to support the development of educational materials.One section of the book I found fascinating is the chapter titled \\"Interaction in text - the larger perspective,\\" in which Hoey uses a neat little trick molded in the spirit of Objective Hermeneutics. By taking just 2 sentences from a feature article (73 sentences long, on British dormouse ecology) he demonstrates the power of textual signals to set off reader expectations and activate standardized schemas. Hoey presented his 2 sentences to an ecology expert and a classicist, and asked each to anticipate what questions they thought the remainer of the article would probably answer. Surprisingly, both readers anticipated the majority of topics that would be addressed, and still more surprising to me, the classicist anticipated the higher number - 78 percent. This shows the integrity of the text-form, the embeddedness of reader expectations, and perhaps the superior rhetorical ability of the classicist to anticipate where the text is going - irrespective of subject-matter expertise. Hoey also reminds us that \\"the successful predictions of the two informants are a measure of the writer's own success at predicting what his writers will want to know. Either way it would seem that the whole development of the article is already enshrined in embryo in its beginning\\" (p. 43). I have used this test when developing scientific features for the Web, and the questions generated are indispensable in ensuring that the text answers the questions readers really want to know. It also moves us away from traditionally narrow notions of \\"targeting an audience\\" toward more stable generic forms of text, especially for informative discourse.Another central concept presented by Hoey is the idea of the \\"colony\\" text - a theoretical model that is useful in describing texts such as till receipts, phone books, classified ads, and other non-linear, non-narrative texts such as database reports and dynamic Web pages. Colony texts often emerge from multiple authors, or are generated completely automatically, and readers of colony texts know that the \\"metaphysics of presence\\" is suspended, or at least disjunctive with respect to space-time. While the idea cannot be done justice here, the theoretical concept of the colony is an extremely useful one that will become more so as text analysts focus increasingly on dynamically-generated content from systems such as XML-based content- and document-management systems. Coherence, intertextuality, and reader expectations within colony texts are likely to be a growing research area in applied text analysis.Hoey also treats culturally specific and scripted text forms, such as Problem-Solution patterns, Goal-Achievement patterns, and Desire-Arousal-Fulfilment pattern. His treatment here, as well, is erudite and interesting, and fortified all the more by his concise illustrations for support.All in all, a fun book that is likely to inspire research and keep one asking questions. What's more, it's cleverly written, sharp, and self-referentially one step ahead of its critics. What critics?"},{"Title":"Textual Interaction: An Introduction to Written Discourse Analysis","review":"Michael Hoey has written an excellent introductory level book to the method of discourse analysis of written texts. First off, Hoey is an excellent writer--masterfully defining and describing the method in a way that is very accessible and lucid. Further, he chose excellent texts upon which to demonstrate the craft.I appreciate his point of view regarding the separation of author, writer, audience, and reader. Further, his chapters on text as a 'site' for interaction (ch. 2) and Interaction in text (ch. 3) were worth the price of the book for me.I recommend this book to anyone looking for an introductory text to written discourse analysis."},{"Title":"Crude Politics : How Bush's Oil Cronies Hijacked the War on Terrorism","review":"The general theme of the book is that practically every action that has been taken by the United States government since September 11 has been directed toward gaining access to lucrative oil and natural gas rights as opposed to seriously trying to find Osama bin Laden and eliminate the rest of Al Qaeda. This book is exceptionally well documented. The author, Paul Sperry, is a conservative Republican.In the book Sperry introduces us to Zalmay Khalilzad a native Afghan who earned a doctorate in political science from the University of Chicago and ended up working for Paul Wolfowitz at the State Department and later the Department of Defense during the Reagan administration. During the Clinton years Khalilzad worked as a consultant for Unocal and became its principal strategist in trying to facilitate the construction of an oil and natural gas pipeline from Turkmenistan and other countries in Central Asia, through Afghanistan to the Pakistan coast where it could be loaded onto tankers to serve the growing East Asia market.Khalilzad ended up heading the Bush Cheney transition team for the Defense Department and later was appointed special presidential assistant and senior director for Persian Gulf, Southwest Asia, and other regional issues of the National Security Council. He reports directly to Condoleeza Rice. He essentially authored the administration strategy for dealing with Afghanistan and Pakistan after September 11. He directly intervened during the loya jirga that was held after the ouster of the Taliban to ensure that Hamid Karzai was elected the new leader of Afghanistan (two other candidates dropped out of consideration after speaking with him).The strategy that Khalilzad came up with stressed the replacement of the Taliban with a stable government that would be receptive to construction and operation of the pipelines. In addition, despite considerable evidence that the madrassas in Pakistan were the most prolific incubator in the world for terrorists, that Pakistan was winking at the arrival of Osama bin Laden and other senior Al Qaeda leaders into that country after the Tora Bora battle, and had done little to aid in the war against terrorism, Pakistan was to be identified as a strong ally in the war against terrorism and showered with aid. Evidence was also presented that Osama bin Laden was being clandestinely treated for kidney problems in a Pakistani military hospital the night before September 11. The cooperation of Pakistan was also necessary to make the proposed pipelines feasible, of course.After Afghanistan was secured, arrangements for the construction of the pipelines went forward at a rapid pace, with a final deal being signed within a year.The book also quotes Dick Cheney as saying several years ago that military action against Iraq might be justifiable because of Iraq's \\"manipulation of world oil prices\\" by turning the tap on and off. Fast-forward to 2003, when Iraq, which has practically no connection to Al Qaeda, is being invaded in the name of the war against terrorism while Pakistan, the de facto headquarters for Al Qaeda, is being succored.The book makes a compelling case that is oil that is driving the war on terror, and that the destruction of Al Qaeda is not high on the priority list of the Bush administration."},{"Title":"Crude Politics : How Bush's Oil Cronies Hijacked the War on Terrorism","review":"Crude Politics is one of the better books I've read or heard about in this time of political unrest. I was first drawn to it because of the author's position;\\"Paul Sperry is the Washington bureau chief at WorldNetDaily.com, a position he previously held at Investor's Business Daily, where he wrote for 12 years. A Hoover Institution media fellow, his reports on national security issues have been picked up by virtually every major news agency in the world. Sperry's journalistic courage and integrity are backed by years of experience, including extensive reporting and editing on national affairs, economics, manufacturing, real estate, and general business coverage.\\" - WorldNetDaily.com website.For those who haven't visited the site, WorldNetDaily.com website is usually a very right-wing news group, often posting stories that support a right-wing agenda.The position of the author is important because he says in his book that he voted republican in the last few elections and even for now President Bush. The website also reinforces how conservative this reporter is by recounting Sperry's 1999 clash with President Bill Clinton on questions over the \\"Chinagate\\" fund-raising scandal that led him to be banned from the White House for the duration of the presidency.So why then has this author written a book denouncing the Bush administration's agenda on the war on terror? Has he flipped sides? Hardly. He is just one of many who have growing concerns that the legitimate war on terror has been hijacked to serve the personal, economic interests of a few oil barons.Sperry gives a great deal of attention not to Iraq (as this book was being written at the time the US was just about to invade Iraq), but to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia; three countries that have been working to secure an oil and natural gas pipeline in the Caspian Basin for over a decade. Sperry shows how the Bush administration transformed the war on terror as an \\"in\\" to this same pipeline deal that will prove to be one of the world's most wealthy oil and natural gas sources.For those who claim that Bush and his administration are only concerned with the American public's safety, this book will enlighten them that, although they may indeed care about us, they care more about their pocket-books and long-term oil ventures.Why would people like Bush, who comes from a long line of oil men, who have many decades of strong allegiances with Saudi oil men, suddenly stop all pursuits of oil, just to serve the American public for a few years? Why would Vice President Cheney, former CEO of Halliburton, one of the biggest oil contractors in the world, suddenly ignore the prospect of buried oil treasures overseas? And why would national security advisor Condoleezza Rice trash a decade of serving the Chevron Corp (who liked her work so much they named an oil tanker after her) just to fight some terrorists?It doesn't add up. These people have oil coursing through their veins, and to suggest they've given it all up on purely moral grounds is like saying I don't need air to breathe anymore.Sperry's book is a must for those seeking a solid investigation of the war on terror and its obvious ties to oil. Unlike most of the political books littering the shelves today, Paul Sperry presents a thoughtful and non-fanatical approach that asks simple questions to subjects that have been spun by our Commander in Chief and his oil-soaked cronies."},{"Title":"Crude Politics : How Bush's Oil Cronies Hijacked the War on Terrorism","review":"This book was an amazing indictment of the Bush administration's foreign policy. Basically, the book detailed numerous linkages between the oil industry and the administration's war or terror and then made conclusions that the war on terror has really been driven by oil politics rather than by national security policies. This is a fascinating inside look at the politics of power and money.When a book like this makes such an indictment against a present administration, indictments that have largely been ignored by the main-stream media, I think it is important to rigorously check the references and sources listed in the book. As such, I actually followed some of the author's (Paul Sperry) sources and came to the conclusion that he was extremely detailed in his source information and documentation.I would highly recommed this book to anyone who wants to get an inside view of money and power and special interests in the American political scene. I think its best read with a completely non-partisan viewpoint if you can."},{"Title":"Crude Politics : How Bush's Oil Cronies Hijacked the War on Terrorism","review":"Great non-partisan examination about how the Bush administration oil barons have used the power of the military and politics in an attempt to put some stability in governments near the Caspian Sea for its huge untapped oil reserves. The huge oil companies will not make the investments in that region until the governments are more cooperative and trustworthy. The oil reserves are bigger than ever imagined and industrial leaders in China and India are desperate for this supply. The evidence is factual and well documented. I serve in state government so this book has been critical to gain a better understanding of the actual motives for war. This is highly recommended for a business person, government person, or interested citizen"},{"Title":"Crude Politics : How Bush's Oil Cronies Hijacked the War on Terrorism","review":"Like a lot of people all over the world, we wondered why the U.S. needed to go to war (and with the wrong country) when Europe had dealt with its terror problems in the past (I.R.A., E.T.A., Algerian separatists, Red Brigade etc.,) through old-fashioned police-work, choking off finance, intelligence gathering and arrests. We (allies and non-allies alike) also weren't buying the 'WMD's on every corner' and 'links with U.B.L. and terror' thing either. It was all a bit too flimsy, and the reasons for war changed every month as the prior ones got picked to shreds.So rather than being an ill-informed 'Bush-basher', I devoured books by the barrow load (including this one) to try to get to the bottom of it all. The sources all seem to check out (I looked up several) and there doesn't seem to be any 'selective interpretation' of the facts either.But as any good journo would tell you, cross-check your facts! I recommend you also read:Owen Harries - 'Benign or Imperial?'Noam Chomsky - 'Hegemony or survival' (I know his politics are left of centre, but that doesn't entirely invalidate some facts and insights he gives)George Soros - The bubble of American Supremacy'Clyde Prestowitz - 'Rogue Nation'Greg Palast - 'The best democracy money can buy' (requires some filtering - he ocassionally draws too long a bow)Bob Woodward - 'Plan of Attack'Balance these against books from 'the right', but avoid the literary 'Genghis Khan is a wimp' types (I.E. Limbaugh, Hannity, Coulter et al).This president has changed your country from being one of the most sympathised with post 9-11, to THE most hated nation on the planet. If you want to know why, read this book and the others, and don't swallow that rubbish about 'it's because they envy our democracy and freedom' etc. Scandinavia has the same freedoms and an arguably higher standard of living than the U.S. yet doesn't have a tenth the problems.I urge you to read this book and others before you vote - it's a real eye-opener."},{"Title":"Crude Politics : How Bush's Oil Cronies Hijacked the War on Terrorism","review":"On 9/11 America was suddenly and brutally attacked. We sturck back quickly, whipping recalcitrant nations to our side, like Pakistan, and toppling the Taliban in Afghanistan with the help of the N. Alliance. Soon after the Bush admin racheted up the rhetoric against Iraq. This book makes the (not startling or new) argument that the war on terror(a rieghtous war in whcih we confront a new enemy worse then communism) was 'Hijacked' by Bush's oil policy. Kets get this strait, we have already heard the accusations about Bush's invasion of Iraq.1) Bush wants for revenge becaused Saddam tried to kill his dad.2) Bush wants to give the American public something to watch on TV, rather then falling stocks(he learned this from CLinton who bombed Iraq duing Liwinsky).3) Bush wants Iraqs oil.4) The armed forces have nothing better to do and Bush wants to kill some more Muslim kids(since he coulndt kill enough civilians in Afghanistan).These spurious claims are now presented in a new format. This book purports itself to be solidly behind the war on terror but feels bush hasnt been strong enough in pursuing it. Case in point(so goes the argument) is Saudi. Saudis made up most of the hijackers on 9/11 and Saudi finances most of global terror and of course Al-Quaeda is headed by a Saudi. We all know Saudi is a threat to the world(at least now we are waking up to this fact) and that Suadi pretends to be our friend while financing attacks on us.This book is in line with the argument that we arnt doing enough to combat global terror. Now this is probably true, in order to truly confront global terror we need to invade Pakistan, Saudi, the West Bank, Syria and maybe a few more nations(including France too). Now this just isnt possible. Bush's war in Iraq was founght not only to make a peaceful Iraq that will be a loyal oil supplier, but also to rid Suadi of our troops so that Bin laden can no longer claim we are occupying the holy land. Once Iraqs oil is up and running we can wean ourselves of Suadi oil and then we can topple the saudi regime or terror sponsoring. The author just doenst understand that these long term goals will take time. We destroyed the immediate training ground: Afghanistan. Now having taken Iraq the terrorists are coming to us and our soldiers are dying, but thats preferable to having the terrorists attacking our civilians here.THis books conclusions are incorrect. While it is true the Bush regime is pro oil it is not truee that Bush sold us out to get oil, he is merely making long term strategy."},{"Title":"Crude Politics : How Bush's Oil Cronies Hijacked the War on Terrorism","review":"Though I'm somewhat impressed with the author's access to facts, I'm dismayed at his illogical use of them. Anyone in this country who depends on trucks, that transport food and all consumer goods and necessities, ought to be concerned with the price we pay for gasoline in this country. If we allowed the terrorists to control the production of middle eastern oil, I hope anyone who votes against President Bush, will be happy paying somewhere around $6-8.00 per gallon of gasoline. A vote for J. Kerry will do that to us. Remember these words."},{"Title":"Dark Mountain","review":"Richard Laymon is hardcore when it comes to writing horror fiction. \\"Dark Mountain\\" is no exception, and allows him to put together a good mix of character development, blood, gore, sex, humor, twists, and turns that make for an exciting thrill ride.The premise of the novel follows two families camping with one another and how they bond with one another. They end up bringing down a witch's son, and the witch puts a curse on each of them. Returning home from the camping trip, the families begin to experience shocking horrors in their everyday life that give them no choice but to return.This novel is as excellent as the occasion meal at Burger King. Some would call it a guilty pleasure, only I'm not guilty to admit that Richard Laymon was an excellent writer (and it's a shame he died too soon). This novel has just about everything and gets better as it progresses. Laymon's work is light and easy to read, but some will surely enjoy it more than others. With that being said, this is horror fiction that I would surely recommend."},{"Title":"Dark Mountain","review":"I decided to have a go at a Richard Laymon novel after reading many positive reviews of his work here on amazon.com. After finishing DARK MOUNTAIN, I can say this book is a compelling mess of genres: outdoor adventure, teen romance, witchery and mayhem. The end result is kind of like a novelized EC Comic, with its pulp elements and lurid appeal firmly in place. Laymon does have a morbid, juvenile obsession with the female anatomy and rape that seems to carry through his work. At times, it makes for uncomfortable reading, so be warned if you're sensitive to female exploitation. Overall, an exciting page turner, perfect for a cold Winter's night."},{"Title":"Dark Mountain","review":"This was a very summery-fun type of book. It wasn't my favorite of his... The ending felt a little rushed. It was still a fun read, just not his best work. It followed the same lines as _Darkness, Tell Us_. It was a fun, summer thriller set primarily around a fateful camping trip."},{"Title":"Dark Mountain","review":"I bought this book on ebay along with The Woods Are Dark. I tried reading the other first and was disappointed so i never attempted to read this one until much later. I was wrong about Richard Laymon.This book was actually pretty good. It was interesting and well executed. Unlike The Woods Are Dark, this one is not choppy and pointless. It is actually well written and interesting. There isnt much suspense, the only suspense is wondering whether or not the family will survive. It is one of his less vulgar novels, and i like this about the book."},{"Title":"Dark Mountain","review":"&quot;Dark Mountain&quot; was previously published under the title &quot;Tread Softly.&quot; Richard Laymon used the pen name &quot;Richard Kelly&quot; for &quot;Tread Softly&quot; and &quot;Midnight's Lair.&quot;&quot;Dark Mountain&quot; is a very good novel with a great first third. The middle section is just okay. The final third includes a strong finish.The first third is fantastic. There are many likable characters. Although I'm eager for action, I also dreaded it in a way because it would likely result in good characters being injured or killed.The climactic scene that ends the first third of the book is probably the most horrifying scene I have ever read."},{"Title":"Dark Mountain","review":"I'm a big laymon fan, but some of his books are just so lame and boring and not scary. the pages drag on with unimportant random conversations about this and that and here and there while you expect gruesome horror like in \\"The Woods Are Dark.\\" Simply, there is no horror and there's no reason to try and talk good about it because im a fan, im just telling customers how it is. its ok to read if you like to read about people and stories and sceneries and maybe 10 % horror/action..etc.I could not finish this book and will not."},{"Title":"Dark Mountain","review":"Okay, I hope I'm not stepping on anyone's toes but this novel sucks. Laymon wastes soooo much time on mintutia that it leaves me wishing he was an actual HORROR writer. I don't care about \\"little moments,\\" but, dude, get to the friggin point! Should have been about 100 pages, and that would have been pushing the envelope. Peeee-youuuu!"},{"Title":"Dark Mountain","review":"I've had it with the late R. Laymon. I've read four or five of his novels and only one was intriging. Dark Mountain is likely the worst of them I've read. The characters suck, the setting is decent but could have been described better to draw the reader in, the overflowing amount of sex is distasteful (as is most of Laymon's work). I just find Laymon in a 2nd or 3rd tier class of horror writers. He probably fits in the Edward Lee and Jack Ketchum class where the cream of the crop includes King, Simon Clark, Nate Kenyon, and perhaps Peter Straub. Don't waste your time on this or any of Laymon's books."},{"Title":"Dark Mountain","review":"Two families get together to go hiking and camping in the northern California mountains. Unbeknownst to them, they are not alone as a crazy old witch and her son are hiding out there. As the group gets into the mountains, the villainy arises. What we get here is a very good build up that feels a bit likeWrong Turn, which I just love. Events lead to a curse being laid on the families by the witch turning the story into something a little reminiscent of Stephen King'sThinner. This in turn leads to a smaller group returning to the mountains to try and remove the curse. What I always find odd with Laymon, is he introduces some hint of a life changing event in one character's past life but then never really ever expands upon it like you want him to do and you're always left with a nagging \\"what was the point of that sub-story then\\" kind of feeling; in this one, it's Karen's car crash from years before.All in all, I was absorbed into the first portion of the book in the mountains. The next portion when the families return home has to deal with a drastic slowing of action or suspense but there are still a couple solid scenes within. The last part, the return to the woods, picks up again although becomes predictable until the end scenario. Overall, certainly better than some of his other stories but still doesn't contend with theThe Beast Houseseries."},{"Title":"Dark Mountain","review":"I love Mr. Laymon's books. I just wish they were easier to find and more readily available. Once again he takes us on an adventure that we can't resist. What's so scary about going hiking and camping? The great outdoors, fresh air, fresh water, beautiful countryside and good company. No, nothing scary about that. Unless, of course, some weirdo attacks you and rapes you in the middle of the night and your campmate is forced to kill him. Unfortunately, it doesn't end there. The weirdo has an evil witch for a mother and she's not about to let you get away with killing her precious son. Anyone know how to remove a curse?"},{"Title":"Dark Mountain","review":"In Richard Laymon's latest re-released book, Dark Mountain, the reader finds himself (or herself) in familiar territory with a plot that focuses on ordinary people who encounter nasty things in the woods. In fact, many of the elements of Dark Mountain will seem familiar to Laymon fans, but that won't diminish the end result: another nasty yet entertaining book.For the divorced Scott, a camping trip to the mountainous forests of California is a perfect chance to get away with his new girlfriend Karen and have her bond with his kids, Julie and Benny. Julie is a sullen teenager, while Benny is the fantasy-loving pre-teen. Also along for the trip is Scott's friend Flash and Flash's family, including teenage son - and soon to be Julie's love interest - Nick. Unfortunately, the woods they visit are already occupied by an old woman with supernatural powers and her monstrous son who wants to rape and murder every woman he sees; it is an urge that not even his mother can stop.Although you might expect that the story would involve an increasingly desperate battle between the campers and their stalkers, Laymon throws a twist in: by the halfway point, the two families are safely back home. Actually, \\"safe\\" may be overstating things, as new problems beset them and force a return to the woods for a final confrontation.In many ways, this is standard Laymon material, with vicious villains and an obsession with sex (and no end to the descriptions of female anatomy). Yet, in a way, this is almost a kinder, gentler Laymon, with a slightly more restrained level of violence. But only long-time Laymon fans will notice that difference, and even they won't be disappointed in the final result. Dark Mountain may not be for everyone, but horror fans should be pleased with it."},{"Title":"Dark Mountain","review":"Dark Mountain was originally published in the 80's and was re-released by Leisure this month. It tells the story of two families who go camping together in the woods. While there, they get ambushed by a horrible, cave-dwelling pervert who rapes one of the women before getting axed to death by another camper. Unfortunately, this pisses off his curse-throwing mother. At the end of the first part of this book (which is split into three parts) everyone makes it out alive (except for the bad guy). This by itself shocked the Hell out of me. This is Richard Laymon, after all. The second part tells about how the curse affects the two families; this time, almost no one dies, and ironically enough, it's someone who didn't get cursed. This sets up part three, wherein a few members of the original camping group hunt down the witch and kill her. Again, no one dies except the villain. If if weren't for the trademark Laymon Sexual Undertone Overkill (he came soooo close to crossing the line with the pre-teen boy's attraction to his father's girlfriend it was more uncomfortable than the parts where they faced the witch), I'd think it was someone else's book.This is Laymon Lite, compared to everything else of his I've read. Nevertheless, I enjoyed Dark Mountain and passed it to a friend, who immediately began enjoying it as well. 7.9/10"},{"Title":"Dark Mountain","review":"I really liked the structure of this novel. It's broken down into three different acts.In the first segment, two families go out camping together in the woods, where they run afoul of an old woman and her very large, strange son, who happens to be a homicidal killer and rapist. The woman doesn't seem to be so evil. She spends most of her time trying to keep her son from hurting others, which he does uncontrollably. They are hiding out in the wilderness after he had killed someone in Fresno and they had to flee their home. When the son tries to attack the camping families, they kill him with a hatchet, setting his mother off on a mission of revenge. There's a really good sequence where the group wakes up in the middle of the night to find their tents slashed with a sharp blade and each of them has been cut across the forehead and a lock of hair taken. Suddenly the old woman appears on a rock, informing them that she's put a death curse on them all. Of course, they don't believe her. After dealing with the authorities about the killing (self defense), they go home.The second chunk of the story deals with the two families after their return from the mountains. One of the kids in paranoid, as he believes in the curse, but everybody else has forgotten about it, until things begin to happen. Nightmares, ghostly apparitions, dog attacks, near drownings, all manner of nastiness begins and does not let up. It becomes obvious that something nefarious is happening. The curse is at work! Everything gets worse, leading up to a terrible auto accident, which is the last straw, and the group decides they must find the old witch and end the curse by ending her!The third and final act has a few characters from each family (the ones still up and around, who have not yet been too badly injured) heading back into the mountains. There's a pretty satisfying final confrontation, with a lot of suspense. The climactic scenes take place almost completely in and underwater, and they are really suspenseful scenes.This is fast, easy reading, and the last third is a real page-turner. There's a few gripping sequences and a couple characters I really liked. Richard Laymon is skilled at writing good, strong female characters, and there's always at least one in each novel.I liked the tone of this book. It's not really horror. It reads more like adventure/suspense, and the bad guys are not so over the top bad, which is a refreshing change of pace. The good guys are just really normal middle class people that you can understand and relate to. They aren't Rambo's or James Bond's or trained fighter's or anything exciting, which makes their trip back into the woods more frightening and a possible suicide mission."},{"Title":"Dark Mountain","review":"As a fan of such 1980's classic slashers \\"Don't Go in the Woods....Alone!\\", \\"Madman\\", \\"Just Before Dawn\\" and of course \\"Friday the 13th\\" campers fighting off a stabby lunatic is one of my favorite horror sub-genres. \\"Dark Mountain\\" starts off as if it were a novelization of one of those classic films. Two families out for fun week of camping, hiking and swimming in cold lakes draws the attention of a homicidal maniac and his backwoodsy mother. The set up is perfect, we get to know the families quite a bit so we come to care for the characters much more than usual in this type of story. The setting is picture perfect and Laymon does such a great job describing the setting you can smell the woodsmoke and taste the mountain stream water. The story slowly builds and you just know some awful things are about to happen and things start clicking into place...and then wham...halfway thru the story everything shifts gears from a slasher tale to a goofy witchcraft tale.The second half of the novel where the protagonists are dealing with a curse is simply dull. We get one minor calamity after another..all suspense is lost, and Laymon begins adding additional sub-plots which resemble just so much filler. Almost the entire second half of the novel feels like it's just padding until Laymon can find an excuse to get his characters back into the woods.Normally Laymon's novels are filled to the brim with blood, monsters, sex, gore, suspense and horror, but \\"Dark Mountain\\" while it sets the stage....simply fails to deliver any of the author's usual trademarks."},{"Title":"Dark Mountain","review":"I have read quite a few Laymon books and this book is very different. The characters are good, but the story was slow at times. I skimmed past many pages because they dragged on and lacked the suspense and fast paced style of other Richard Laymon books.

The book really takes off though once the families return home and find that they may be dealing with a curse.Laymon does his usual outstanding job creating memorable characters and scenes. Maybe more so in this novel than some of his others, the major characters are truly believable. There are plenty of plot twists that will keep even the most inveterate Laymon fan guessing. Laymon adds his usual amounts of violence, sex, and uncomfortable situations to a story, though somewhat understated for him, will leave readers turning pages with gusto.Recommended for all horror enthusiasts and especially Laymon fans!(Originally titled, \\"Tread Softly\\" under Laymon's pseudonym, \\"Richard Kelly\\" in 1987)"},{"Title":"Dark Mountain","review":"I had never before read any of Laymon's work but I am a fan of C.J.

Laymon provides wonderful imagery in the California wilderness and spins a very creepy tale of two families brought together and forced to try to survive a brutal attack and subsequent satanic curse. The \\"marked\\" members of the group begin to experience strange freak accidents and near misses, and not everyone will survive. Though the ending was sort of predictable, it was by no means boring, and was still a fun read. There are twists and mysteries aplenty in-store!

One wolverine is dangerous enough, but five live in this valley...and they're out for blood.This book had me gripped from page one. Be it the passages told from the wolverine's viewpoint, the time endless arguements between man and woman, the beautiful descriptions of the wilderness, the struggles for survival, the spine-tingling terror of being hunted by an unseen enemy, the warmth and recklessness of love, and the violent confrontations between man and animal. All this combined with cliff-hanger pauses made this a book that just had to be read in one sitting.And that's not all, David Thompson still manages to inject hints of what is to come, maybe, in further entries to the series; just what lives in the lake? Why do the Indians fear the glacier? And will Zach ever realise what Louisa was talking about?I don't know how David Thompson does it but this series just goes from strength to strength.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Red Pocket Book of Spanish Verbs","review":"Because I already own The Red Pocket Book of Spanish Verbs in hardcopy I didn't bother to sample it first. That was a mistake I'll never make again. The hardcopy book is a wonderful and useful reference, but the Kindle version is so poorly formatted that it is virtually unusable.

Rudy Rucker is an accomplished science fiction author and popularizer of mathematics and computer science. In this book he seems to bring together everything he has written in the past while playing with constructing a coherent world-view and philosophy of life. It works quite well. (Rucker is such a fascinating writer that my son was going to apply to San Jose State just to take classes from him. The book's revelation that Rucker is retiring disappointed my college-bound son and left him scrambling for other schools.)Any description of this book with less complexity than the book itself will do the book an injustice. If you're a fan of Rudy Rucker, of infinity, or of mathematical and speculative philosophy, you MUST read this book. Students of the social sciences may have some difficulty wrapping their minds around the computational science ideas, but this book is an essential part of understanding what it means to be human.Rucker has structured the book well. Each chapter is prefaced with a piece of microfiction that illustrates the concepts to come. The chapters begin with an annotated outline that relates the concepts discussed. Ideas are reconnected with earlier mentions in the book as well as preceding ideas.Rucker is not afraid to make novel combinations of philosophy, psychology, math, computer science, quantum physics, science fiction, and personal anectdotes. This is one of the best books produced for handling notes well. Turning to the back of the book for a note is generally rewarded with insights or speculations related to the text. Only occasionally is a note simply a bibliographic or web reference.The book itself is a gnarly computation as well as a gnarly program for gnarled minds. It should be required reading for everybody who things they have a grip on life, the universe, or anything. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would."},{"Title":"Lifebox, the Seashell, and the Soul: What Gnarly Computation Taught Me About Ultimate Reality, the Meaning of Life, and How to Be Happy","review":"I found Rudy Rucker on a road trip. Or at least, I found part of his lifebox. If you haven't yet read this book, you probably don't know that the lifebox is a fictional invention into which a person speaks, and eventually it gets to know him well enough to tell his stories, and perform more menial conversational duties. That was Wetware, the first of his books that I read. Since then, I've read everything of his I could get my hands on, and I anxiously awaited the arrival of my pre-ordered copy of The Lifebox, the Seashell, and the Soul.I had a bad experience with submitting a snarky review about A New Kind of Science after I'd only read 200 pages, so I decided to actually read this whole book before trying to draw any conclusions. I believe that is something the crappy reviewer from Publishers Weekly just didn't do. My conclusions after the first read:1. This is the most phenomenal, approachable, and thorough introduction (certainly leaves Fredkin and Wolfram in the dust for approachability) to cellular automata and computation that I've ever met.2. This book, true to its title, has soul. It's wacky, interesting, fun, deep, and self-critical of the so-called \\"Universal Automatist\\" philosophy.3. The illustrations, stories, personal anecdotes, and tables (yes, he loves his tables) are what makes the book work- it would have been possible to write this book (and probably to read it) without them all, but it would have been less fun, less interesting, and less illuminating.4. Rucker obviously spent a tremendous amount of time in actual experimentation- doing it himself. He articulates a better \\"feel\\" for the field than anything else I've read.I'm sending this book to my dad and my brothers for Christmas. I got them all A New Kind of Science year before last, but none of them got past the first chapter. I can't wait to hear what they think of this one!"},{"Title":"Lifebox, the Seashell, and the Soul: What Gnarly Computation Taught Me About Ultimate Reality, the Meaning of Life, and How to Be Happy","review":"Genius SF writer Rudy Rucker's new book is fantastic, and just in time, too! He writes, among other things, that we arepresently in the midst of a third global intellectual revolution. Thefirst came with Isaac Newton: the planets obey physical laws. The secondcame with Charles Darwin: biology obeys genetic laws. In today's thirdrevolution, says Rucker, we are coming to realize that even minds and societiesemerge from interacting laws that can be regarded as computations.Everything is a computation. Cool!Does this, then, mean that the world is dull? Far from it. Thenaturally-occurring computations that surround us are richly complex.For example, a tree's growth, the changes in the weather, the flow of daily news, aperson's ever-changing moods --- all of these computations share thecrucial property of being gnarly. Although lawlike and deterministic,gnarly computations are --- and this is a key point --- inherentlyunpredictable. The world's mystery is preserved.Mixing together anecdotes, graphics, and fables, Rucker teases out theimplications of his new worldview, which he calls \\"universalautomatism.\\" His analysis reveals startling aspects of the everydayworld, touching upon such topics as chaos, the Internet, fame, freewill, and the pursuit of happiness. More than a popular science book,this book is a philosophicalentertainment that teaches us how to enjoy our daily lives to thefullest possible extent."},{"Title":"Lifebox, the Seashell, and the Soul: What Gnarly Computation Taught Me About Ultimate Reality, the Meaning of Life, and How to Be Happy","review":"This book is Rudy Rucker's latest mind-child, and incorporates all the many threads of his very active and acute intellect. For those who have read some of his earlier books on math (esp. the superb Infinity and the Mind), this latest work builds on the vital importance of approaching the cosmos from the perspective of computability. Rucker's thinking on this is precise and playful, a rare and valuable combination. He extends the ideas toward applications of how to view your own \\"lifebox,\\" and offers great suggestions for booting up an expanded appreciation of your reality. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lifebox, the Seashell, and the Soul: What Gnarly Computation Taught Me About Ultimate Reality, the Meaning of Life, and How to Be Happy","review":"As a disiple of the Stephen Wolfram's universal automaton paradigm this book does a good job of looking at the different areas of science to see how they work with such a view. Taking on issues like free-will, quantum mechanics, and psychology he attempts to demonstrate there compatibility with his thesis that the world consists of computations. I recommend this book to anyone how has interests in determinism, aritificial intelligence, and/or Wolframs \\"new science\\" as this book has something of value to offer on all this areas."},{"Title":"Lifebox, the Seashell, and the Soul: What Gnarly Computation Taught Me About Ultimate Reality, the Meaning of Life, and How to Be Happy","review":"It's been at least six months since I finished reading The Lifebox, The Seashell & The Soul, and I just ran across it today while pawing through my collection searching for a copy of Orwell's Homage to Catalonia, and realized I'd forgotten to write a review.I'm not much of a math or technical reader, so to get through this tome, that I had repeatedly opened without making much headway, I set aside an hour every morning to read, using a little discipline to combat my tendency to avoid intense thought about things with which I'm unfamiliar. I was well-rewarded for the effort. Rucker's patiently-constructed explanations of von Nuemann machines and cellular automata laid a good foundation for further discussions, and helped me to understand what I'd been missing when I read Stephenson's The Diamond Age. It also helped me appreciate Rucker's flatland musings in Mathematicians In Love and the Singularity series.I even thought I understood his explanation of quantum computing. But all thought of quantum computing is evanescent. I can't retain it very well. It's a discourse I can comprehend as long as I stick to the thread of the discourse, but when I step back it's a tangle. C'est la vie.For me, the test of learning is what you retain without effort, like the chords a guitarist will never forget. I will remember that Rucker's core proposition is that all appearances are computations, that the world is therefore deterministic, but that determinism doesn't mean predictability, because living patterns are gnarly patterns, poised between repetitive mechanistic patterns and the ooze of creeping crud (I think of these as the \\"three states of computation\\"). I also remember that all computation is translatable to any other form of computation. So for example, a tree is a sufficiently complex shape, with its myriad forkings and potential alternative positions, to model something as complex as, say, the positions of all the planets in the solar system. If you could decode its language. Rucker's proposition made me more comfortable with my own deterministic inclinations, that I have encapsulated in a five-minute video to which I gave the title of \\"Randomness Is A Myth Created By Scientists To Simulate Ignorance\\" (google it if you're curious).I've shared Rucker's \\"three states of computation\\" concept with a fair number of folks, and everyone seems to vibe to the idea that our world is gnarly.The only impediments to understanding were a couple of pagination errors at pages 236 - 240 and 369 - 372 (the second one is real hard to figure out if you don't know it's there). But maybe Rucker put these little mind-twisters in there deliberately to see if his friends had really read the book.I hear Rucker's working on an autobiography. His Wikipedia says he's Hegel's great-great-great grandson. Maybe he'll tell us what that feels like. Probably pretty gnarly."},{"Title":"Sigmund Freud: Explorer of the unconscious","review":"This is a extraordinarily clear biography of Freud. The author Muckenhoupt was faced with a real challenge: how do you describe Freud's theories and the controversies surrounding them to an 8th grade readership? She handles this challenge perfectly. And I'm not just saying this because I'm a close personal friend of Muckenhoupt, and she gave me a copy of the book free for my 30th birthday, inscribed with inside jokes at the start of each chapter. I guarantee you she knows her subject too--riding on a subway with her I got to hear all the details about Freud's jaw operation and who his kids were named after. So in conclusion, this is a fact-filled book that deals straightforwardly and clearly with such controversial topics as penis envy, antisemitism, the Oedipus complex, etc., and I'm not just saying this cause I'm biased."},{"Title":"Sigmund Freud: Explorer of the unconscious","review":"If you are looking for a in depth book showing and explaining Freuds' views or summaries of the Unconscious state, and how he saw human kind this is not it. :) This is a brief insights of the alter ego ed and so on, it is a good book. I would say it does it fair on the topic of exploring yes exactly that just exploring and giving brief summaries of certain subject.

I loved how he (Pratchett) could hint at complex issues by saying so little. And I have to admit I was really intrigued by the Carrot/Angua situation. Even more, I just loved Carrot (that combination of innocence and strength gets me every time!). Have also read Guards! Guards!, which introduces Carrot (as you can see I'm a bit obsessed here) and Feet of Clay which goes further into the Carrot/Angua thing. Anybody else who likes Carrot, please drop me a line. Also if you know of other Discworld books with Carrot in it. Apart from Carrot, this is definitely a book to read!"},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Why is the publisher setting the price for the Kindle version the same as the paperback? Apparently they live in some fantasy world where either paper is free, or duplicating bytes is expensive."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Now, I know a lot of people like Carrot, but the fact is, I've never liked typcial hero characters, they always come off too flat for me, and Carrot is a generic hero character. The worst thing is, he was a pretty good character in &quot;Guards Guards!&quot;, but he loses the innocent touch that made him endearing in GG!, and turns into a generic hero here. This shouldn't be a problem, due to the prescence of Vimes and the return of Gaspode (who is even funnier here than he was in Moving Pictures, his first appearance), and a slew of new characters, and other characters getting new dimensions to their character (like Detritus), and Nobby, but most of the book focuses on Carrot and Carrot only, and I can't say I liked that.It's a shame, because otherwise, this is a really good book. Someone gets his hands on a strange new weapon and is killing people with it. the Night Watch follows the case, with new members Cuddy, Angua, and Detritus, in addition to the older members, Carrot, Colon, Nobby, and Captain Vimes. Vimes, however, is going to be married to Lady Ramkin, Carrot follows the case. The other members tag along for good measure (although there are some good sequences with Cuddy and Detritus). Gaspode the Wonderdog shows up to help.The plot runs along smoothly for the most part, except when Carrot gets seriously involved, and the whole clown thing was kind of contrived. This is a mystery story, which is good. I like mysteries.Overall, if you can get over the prescence of Carrot (or better ye, if you end up liking Carrot, which many people did), you'll enjoy this book a lot. And that's all I can say, so have a nice day."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"O.K., some of the discworld novels are better than others, and I can't write a review on every single one. This one is my favourite Discworld novel.I loved the way the whole thing got something of amystery novel, (naturally in this point Feet of Clay is more rewarding). I don't know why, but only Terry Pratchett seems to be able to managethis kind of fantasy. The few other examples of funny fantasy I tried weren't hardly very funny at all.Other authors just steal from Tolkien, or (directly or via Tolkien) from some mythology.Well, Pratchett also does, the world being carried on the back of a turtle isn't his very own idea, but his way of using other sources is far more elegant than those of any other author I've ever read (except Tolkien perhaps, but you hardly can really compare other authors with Tolkien).Other authors steal, Pratchett hints.And within all the books there's a vast amount of moral, sometimes more, sometimes less, that would be boring with any other author, but with Pratchett it's just more fun.If the man's been able to write about 20 novels in the last years, that are that good, I'm quite confident, that he'll manage this some more years, and I'm always eagerly awaiting the next one.Yes, naturally, close up to Men at Arms there isGuards! Guards! on my favourite list."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Meet Carrot, Angua, Vimes and the other watchmen in their debut performance as they leap into the Discworld. This is the first of the \\"Vimes\\" stories, so it is important for a basic knowledge of people you\`ll be seeing a lot more of(depending on the humour of old man Pratchett). It\`s no less funny than the others, while at the same time introducing detective work into the series as Vimes and his crew bumble along on a sinister case. They are, after all, policemen(no offense to policemen in general). Read it and love it. It\`s different, but at least as good as the other Rincewind and Death books."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Pratchett at his worst is light-years beyond Piers Anthony, Robert Asprin, or even the dearly departed Douglas Adams at their best. And this is hardly Pratchett's worst (that would probably be Soul Music or Maskerade). But, this book doesn't crackle and fizz with the subversive humor, satire, and insight into the human condition of his other books. This book is kind of, well, dull in parts.I have to confess that much of that might be my fault... this is a cop's story, a mystery, beyond all else. And, try as I might, I just can't care about mystery stories.However, Carrot and Vimes, two of the Night Watch's finest, are certainly engaging characters and Pratchett does manage to bring his wild humor into a rather mundane mystery story. He is still a sharp-eyed philosopher with a keen understanding of human nature. But I just can't help thinking that this could have been a better book. Maybe the Librarian wasn't in it enough... he can save even the WORST Pratchett book (as Soul Music demonstrates)."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"I've listened to \\"Lords and Ladies\\" in the abridged and unabridged versions and can only recommend the unabridged.The person who did the abridging seems to have gone about it by discarding every other chapter from the unabridged book. The story jerked along so confusingly, I wasn't sure at the end what the plot had been about other than Elves coming back from exile. Tony Robinson's reading only added to the confusion, his store of \\"voices\\" consisted of \\"regular voice\\", \\"low volume hissed voice\\", \\"loud voice\\". LVHV was used for the Elf Queen and several other characters and was so hard to hear that I often had to back up the track, set the iPod's volume to max and repeat so I could figure out what the dialog was.Then I got the unabridged version that Nigel Planer reads and realized that \\"Lords and Ladies\\" is another triumph for Pratchett! Nigel Planer is a wonder! The witches have voices that sound elderly, female and distinctly individual. Dwarfs have deep gravelly voices and Trolls sound dimwitted and slow. Wizards, the Librarian, every character has his own voice. Planer's only flaw is that young women always sound adenoidal, but it's not jarring and I soon got used to it. Best of all, Planer's reading is always clearly audible.So, avoid the unabridged versions! I can't imagine what Terry Pratchett was thinking when he greenlighted these travesties. Maybe the publishers told him that people who demand books that can be listened to in one long setting don't care if the stories suck?"},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"I love Pratchett's Discworld so much that I wrote four paragraphs before I realized I hadn't even started talking about this book. I have spared you all and started from scratch...no thanks necessary.Although this is the second book in the Watch series, to me it is the defining moment for the Watch and Ankh Morpork in general. Pratchett is very funny, witty, and has creatd a universe filled with characters I love to visit again and again. If you're just starting with Pratchett, this is a great place to get your feet wet."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"I've read most of Pratchett's novels, in publication order, up to the most recent handful, and this is by far my favorite, along with INTERESTING TIMES. The City Guard of Ankh-Morpork is a happy concept, and all the books about the Guards are way above Pratchett's average.Imagine a police procedural in which very few of the policemen are human. Comic book writer Alan Moore currently has a series which takes this to the n-th degree... none of the policemen are human, and no two are alike: TOP TEN. If you want to try a Pratchett novel, try GUARDS, GUARDS! or MEN AT ARMS or FEET OF CLAY. Excellent introductions to his &quot;cosmos&quot; and to his unique style of wit. &quot;DON'T SALUTE!!!&quot; (You'll learn why.)"},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"This is a warning to other Pratchett-lovers out there looking for audiobooks. This is an abridgment of the original book, and a bad one. A lot of the best word jokes and philosophical humor is missing, many scenes are in pieces, and the whole thing simply does not convey the sense of fun and insight of the original novel. As well, in my opinion, Tony Robinson is a horribly bad voice actor, but that may simply be a personal preference.

Guards!.Vimes is preparing for his impending retirement, and the life change it will engender. As he works to disentangle himself from the watch, Carrot winds up shouldering most of the burden Vimes leaves behind.Meanwhile, Edward d'Eath - an accomplished assassin - has gotten it into his head that what the city really needs is a move away from the amoral but practical management of Vetinari back to the good old days of relentlessly insane monarchs. Will Vimes and the rest of the watch be able to stop d'Eath? Or, should d'Eath prevail, will the new monarch be up for the job?Like the rest of the discworld books, this is an easy, pleasant read. I enjoyed getting to learn more about Carrot Ironfoundersson (a charismatic two meter tall dwarf) and the aura which surrounds him.Is it a great book? No. I didn't like it as much asGuards!

This one follows the City Watch, which is basically the police, as they try to unravel the mysterious murders that are suddenly happening in Ankh-Morpork. They are an organization in decline, without much real work to do or skills to practice, until now. Many colorful characters are enountered, and there are a surprising number of relevant and keen observations about the life of law enforcement personnel in general. One particular character, Carrot, is a fine example of that rare person who attracts and inspires people, without seeming to try. The book is witty, fun, and funny. There are a lot of different types of characters, including dwarfs, trolls, dogs, werewolves, thieves and assassins, and it makes for a story that is never slow or dull. One minor distraction for me was the often-encountered passages where I could not readily identify the character who was speaking. It required a little sorting out at times.

Guards!)The Watch features the crew from the previous book (Vimes, Carrot, Colon and Nobby) and some new recruits. Someone is murdered in a most mysterious way, and it's up to the Watch to get to the bottom of it.What I love about Pratchett is he doesn't settle to just write a witty satire. It's actually a great mystery/fantasy story with great characters who have excellent believable relationships.Men at Arms even has some scenes that I found emotionally stirring. I loved Guards!

She has just joined the Night Watch under the Equal Species Act, along with Detritus the Troll and Cuddy the Dwarf.No wonder Sam, who is a bit of a male chauvinist speciesist is going to retire.Not since Stephen King's \\"It\\" have clowns gotten such bad press as in \\"Men at Arms.\\" They seem to be the saddest creatures on Discworld. One of them, Beano is murdered and ends up playing 'Knock Knock - Who's There?' with Death, who is trying to develop a sense of humor.Humor will never be the strong suite of a hooded, seven-foot skeleton with glowing blue eyes, but Death does get in one inadvertently funny line. He tells Beano to think of his newly deceased state as being 'DIMENSIONALLY DISADVANTAGED.'Meanwhile back in the world of the living and undead, Captain Sam Vimes and his command investigate the circumstances of Beano's death. Sam is also under orders from his wife-to-be to find a missing swamp dragon, which is likely to explode if it comes under stress.When a large hole is blown in the headquarters of the Assassin's Guild, Sam has a pretty good notion of what caused the explosion. What he really wants to know is whether this latest calamity has something to do the Beano's death. After all, the Assassins are right next door to the Guild of Fools and Clowns.What he does not yet know is that mad genius, Leonard of Quirm's deadliest invention has fallen into the hands of a rabid monarchist who will do everything in his power to restore Ankh-Morpork's rightful king---and that king is a member of his own Night Watch.\\"Men at Arms\\" (1993) is another great slapstick-with-a-message adventure in the Sam Vimes/Night Watch Discworld novels.

Plus, if you listen in your car on the way to work, you can keep your job and your spouse."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Of all Pratchett's brilliantly drawn characters, Samuel Vimes stands unique in providing a realistic role model for the rest of us. He's honest, forthright, deeply suspicious of aristocracy, and best of all, despises the idea of kings. The last is important here, for someone wishes the return of the Ankh-Morpork monarchy. And Sam Vimes' remote ancestor, Old Stoneface, executed the last one.Edward d'Eath [how does PTerry come up with these names?!], an impoverished aristocrat, seeks fulfillment of his destiny by restoring the monarchy. Recruiting fellow lords to his cause proves difficult. It's been a long time since the last king, and the Patrician runs the city with commendable, if frightening, efficiency. So Edward embarks on a solitary campaign.Pratchett's inventive mind takes us from the &quot;fantasy&quot; genre into the murder mystery domain. Murder isn't a common event on the Discworld, and its occurrence here creates an intensity of feeling rarely evoked by Pratchett's works. Vimes is particularly irritated by such abhorrent events as murder. Assassination is bad enough, although carefully regulated by its Guild. For Vimes, murder is too arbitrary. It reflects the one aspect of society he resents the most, the exercise of absolute power. He's affronted both as a copper and a man.Partly inspired by Corporal Carrot, Vimes is no longer content having the Watch &quot;let things lie anymore&quot;. Forces that used to push a drunken Vimes into the gutter are forces he now resists, even struggles to overcome. It's an inspiring read watching Pratchett give Vimes a new sense of dedication. Vimes has always sought justice, and his recent rise in society and the Watch has given him fresh impetus, and clout, to gain it. However, first he must survive. He's up against a new force. A force of absolute power, without soul or pity - the Gonne.There are other aspects in this book beyond the new Old Stoneface trying to catch a murderer. Pratchett pays homage to the struggle for women's and immigrants' rights in Britain [and elsewhere]. The Watch has been compelled to recruit dwarves, trolls and, um, a woman. Sergeant Colon's attempts to reconcile size, attitudes and anatomy with a traditional human, male, role must bring tears to the eyes of all recruiting sergeants reading it. Pratchett's sympathetic view of Angua pays homage to the efforts of women striving to enter men's realms. But for a novel view of the world we all inhabit, there's few that can out-express Gaspode, one of Pratchett's finest creations.Pratchett possesses a superior ability to create timeless works. Nestled in this library since its publication, this book is taken up as an old friend for repeated enjoyment. There's nothing lost in re-reading Men At Arms - the issues remain timely, the characters worth noting - sometimes emulating, and the wit undiminished. If you're new to Pratchett, this is a fine place to start. If you're coming along in the Discworld sequence, be prepared for an item of exceptional value, something beyond the humorous fantasy of wizards, witches and Mort's employer."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"I've decided he's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time I read one of his books. Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat \\"Bite me!\\"I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Edward D'Eath by chance becomes obsessed with the royal line of Anhk Morpork, the city watch enjoys the benefits of several directions of integration, Sam Vimes of the Night Watch prepares to retire to a life of comfort and other torments, the harsh and serious nature of clowns is considered, the genteel and sophisticated nature of Assassins is considered, and the fruits of allowing a certifiable genius to run loose with tools are sown.As an obsessed Assassin works behind the scenes to restore the heir to the royal family of Anhk Morpork to the throne, the unsuspecting presumed heir walks the streets of Anhk Morpork commanding the respect of the crimenal element of the city. This is most unusual as he is a junior Watchman.An invention of Leonard of Quirm is loose in the city, and as the inventions of madmen and geniuses (and Leonard is both in his own special fashion) are wont to do, it is making mischief.Sam Vimes is about to marry the wealthiest woman in the city, and the clash of cultures is brilliant social commentary.And the dogs of A-MP have a leader with a dark vision of the supremacy of canines over bipeds...This is Terry Pratchett at his best! Discworld is in fine form, reflecting the obsession with royals, gun control, affirmative action, political action, and the dark side of clowns. One of the best of DIscworld."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Captain Sam Vimes is about to become wealthy, married, and retired from his career in the City Watch. When a strange explosion occurs in the Assassins Guild, it really isn't his business--especially when Vetinari, the Patrician, specifically orders him to stay clear. Vimes's common sense wars with his self-defined duty and duty wins--at least until Vetinari calls him in for a second appointment (nobody wants a second appointment with the city's strange and nearly omnicient leader). For Vimes, the bottle is the way out. But Corporal Carrot isn't about to let a little thing like Vetinari's orders keep him from donig the right thing (Carrot always does the right thing) and pushes on in Vimes's absence.MEN AT ARMS tells the story of the fundamental reshaping of the City Watch under the combined influence of Vetinari, Vimes, and Carrot. The Watch is expanded from all-human to include dwarves, trolls, and a beautiful werewolf. Vetinari's policy of constructive anarchy may allow the city to work after a fashion, but a watch made up of misfits from all walks of life can certainly help. The novel is a near-continuation of the very fine GUARDS! GUARDS!Author Terry Pratchett combines puns, outrageous and over-the-top action, and real insights into humanity in ways that keep the reader laughing and thinking at the same time. Both Vetinari and Carrot are admirable, but both are also beyond most of our reach. Vimes, in contrast, is every-man. His dilemmas are those that all of us must face. That Vimes can rise (and sometimes fall) to the occasion brings some hope that any of us could do so too. Pratchett's work is at its best when it uses Discworld as a backdrop for the actions and decisions of its all-too-human sapients, and MEN AT ARMS is a fine example of exactly this."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Captain Samuel Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Guard is about to be married to Lady Sybil Ramkin, an incredibly rich woman who is totally into Dragons. Because Lady Ramkin finds the current job of her fianc&eacute; too dangerous -clearly forgetting that being blown to smithereens by a sick dragon is not commonly known as a \`safe' job opportunity- Captain Vimes decides to retire and dedicate his life to Dragons and other so-called \`nobilities'. Subsequently, a new league of City Guards has to be found and trained. In these modern times it is fashionable to be ethnically correct and in the true spirit of this trend: Lance-constable Detrius (a troll who hits himself unconscious if he salutes), Lance-constable Cuddy (a \`short'-tempered dwarf) and Lance-constable Angua (most of the time a woman) become the new recruits. When a series of murders leads to a strange theft of an even weirder weapon, their first ordeal is about to start. To make matters worse, the culprit seems to be a troll and... not everyone is happy about this.Men at Arms is the second Discworld novel to feature the Night Watch (Vimes, Colon, Carrot and Nobby); the first one is Guards! Guards! These two books certainly belong to the highlights of the Discworld series. Their characters are so colourfully rich and funny, that actually they do not need a strong plot to entertain the reader. Nevertheless Terry Pratchett has delivered with Men at Arms one of his strongest story-lines. It reads like a good suspense novel where you can actually try to find out actually who did it - you won't succeed, of course, but that's part of the fun, isn't it. It's not without reason that Captain Vines sometimes sounds like Inspector Columbo. A lot of funny sidekicks make their appearance: Death tries to become a more \`complete' person, Leonard de Quirm has problems naming his numerous inventions, the speaking dog Gaspode finds a girlfriend, Captain Quirke of the Day Watch shows what the word stupid really means and many, many others. Ever wondered why trolls count like this: one, two, many, many-one, many-two, many-many? Then you simply must read this book!"},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"I loved this book! Men at Arms is the second Pratchett Novel I have read the first being Feet of Clay. I found everything in this book to be creative and hilarious the dog talking dog Gaspode especially. Prattchett and his wonderful creation discworld teach people that a story can be entertaing without dirty words and sex."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"\\"Men at Arms\\" is the fifteenth novel in Terry Pratchett's hugely popular Discworld series and the second to focus on Sam Vimes and Ankh-Morpork's City Guard. Although its reputation may have raised very slightly, having rescused the City from a large and angry dragon, it's still not the fine and noble profession it once was.Sam is the Captain of the Night Watch, though he is on the verge of retiring and will soon marry Lady Ramkin, the noted dragon-fancier. It isn't entirely clear, however, whether or not he's entirely happy about either the retirement or his impending life of marital bliss. It's fair to say he's not your typical hero : he hates the Undead (some of my best friends are werewolves), Assassins (a perfectly respectable profession) and - in keeping with an old family tradition - Kings (not an ideal musketeer then). Sam's also trying to quit drinking and has taken up smoking cigars to soften the blow.The Night Watch has had a couple of new recruits since \\"Guards! Guards!\\" - largely at the insistence if the Patrician, the city's ruler. The recruits - Lance-Constables Cuddy (a dwarf), Detritus (a troll) and Angua (a woman, for most of the month) - have been selected to reflect Ankh-Morpork's \`ethnic makeup'. Although Sergeant Colon and Corporal Nobbs are Sam's most experienced officers, the most capable is Carrot. Although born human, Carrot was raised as a dwarf and is an incredibly innocent character - he still hasn't figured out what seamstresses do for a living. He has, however, figured out how Ankh-Morpork works and has stopped trying to arrest the President of the Thieves Guild. The trouble begins when Edward d'Eath suspects that Carrot may be the rightful king of Ankh-Morpork.Edward is the latest Lord d'Eath, albeit a very poor one, following the recent death of his father. He was educated at the Guild of Assassins, where he became the first student to gain full marks at postgraduate level. His suspicions about Carrot are a little worrying, given that he wants to restore the monarchy. This will, of course, see the Patrician \`removed' from office - something that should be easier now that he has acquired a weapon that shouldn't exist.Pratchett's books are always very funny and this one is no exception. Despite being the second book to focus on the Night Watch, there's no real requirement to have read the first - the newcomer won't feel \`left out'. (However, I would recommend reading it, all the same !). Another big plus is Gaspode, Ankh-Morporks finest talking dog. Like Carrot, he's also devoted to Angua - though he's a lot less innocent ! Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Men at Arms reunites us with the stalwart defenders of our beloved Ankh-Morpork: the Night Watch. Along the way we also meet up with some of the Discworld's most distinctive secondary characters (including Foul Ole Ron and Big Fido), get a glimpse of affirmative action Ankh-Morpork-style, discover the identity of the rightful king (if Ankh-Morpork still had a king, which it doesn't, which isn't the fault of the shady characters in this book trying to replace the Patrician with the aforementioned heir to the throne, who doesn't want the job anyway), converse once more with Gaspode the talking dog, and - if that's not enough - make ready for the wedding of the year between Captain Samuel Vimes of the Night Watch and Lady Sybil Ramkin, proprietor of the Sunshine Sanctuary for Sick Dragons and the richest woman in Ankh-Morpork. Captain Vimes is in fact retiring from the Watch, but his retirement involves much more than the traditional gift watch presentation from his men. A washed-up aristocrat named Edward D'eath takes it upon himself to restore the long-lost monarchy, a circumstance that can only come about over the Patrician's dead body. Even clowns aren't safe from this deadly conspiracy.The trouble begins with an explosion and robbery at the Guild of Assassins. Someone has stolen nothing less than the only \\"gonne\\" on Discworld, and a series of murders shock the town. OK, nothing's really going to shock the people of Ankh-Morpork, but the fact that people keep turning up full of holes where guts should be definitely stirs up the Watchmen. The Patrician is also less than happy about things, so he makes sure the Watch gets to the bottom of things by forbidding Captain Vimes to investigate. The Watch itself is growing; thanks to some new laws pushed through by the Silicon Anti-Defamation League, it has ethnically balanced itself with the addition of a dwarf, a troll, and a woman to the force. The woman, Angua, also happens to be a werewolf, and I don't have to tell you that dwarfs and trolls are natural enemies. Luckily, Constable Carrot, the 6'6\\" dwarf (he was adopted, you know) who is just so doggoned nice that people will actually listen to him and do as he requests, is there to keep the Watch united and performing its duty the way Carrot (alone) thinks it should be done. After a dwarf is killed and a troll arrested by the Day Watch (on the basis that any troll is surely guilty of something), there's an ever-present danger that the city's trolls and dwarfs will have a go at each other (and it won't be like last time, when both groups somehow managed to ambush one another at the same time).Constable Detritus really steals the show here. Watching a troll think is always entertaining, but Detritus really comes into his own as this story progresses. At first, he can't salute without knocking himself out, but by the end he's recruiting and training fellow trolls (in his own endearing way) and warming up quite well to his dwarf partner. He also manages to show us that, in the right conditions (such as the kind of very cold temperature you find in a pork futures market), trolls can be brilliant thinkers.People always die in Discworld novels, but there was one death in Men at Arms that really took me by surprise. A bit sad, it was. Don't be sad about Captain Vimes leaving the Night Watch, though. Furthermore, don't worry about the future of the City Guard, as it does not fall into the hands of Sergeant Colon or Corporal Nobbs (who, as we all know, has already been disqualified from the human race for shoving). I'm sure the men and women and dwarfs and trolls and werewolf of the Night Watch will be as ready as ever for the next threat that rears its ugly head in Ankh-Morpork; after all, Carrot's still on the job."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Men at Arms, the second A-M Night Watch book, is most likely the best Watch book of all.

This book deal with some very serious historical delima regarding the classic case of the stranger hero who is the long lost king of some kingdom.This book is one of the latter in Terry Pratchett writing career when he has fully develop his Discworld story structure. All of Pratchett's latter books deal with some major social issue that exist in historical or modern time. He deal with them in a highly intellectual manner using extremely complex humourous satirical technique.All of the latter books are very funny, and intellectually charllenging. To the reader with some historical knowledge of the jokes and anecdote provided by Pratchett, his book is intriging. I would advise anyone with interest in the real world as well as those looking for a great piece of literature to read Pratchett.This is a great book about a young copdude who would be king, little dragons, and a world where science, magic, fantasy, and who know what else is mixed. The story line is interesting and funny, character very well developed. Books rarely come better than this. Pratchett is underappreciated because virtually no American (beside myself) know of his work, not even well read english professors!"},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"I love the Night Watch novels, I am reading the third at the moment, I can't stop!

Much more subtle and interesting. Great little plot (with a very unexpected villain), and the characters just keep getting more interesting and complex as the series progresses."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"I just finished re-reading this novel, which remains high in my esteem. My review will contain some spoilers, so avoid it id you don't like those. Its main theme is the final success of integrating city minorities, starting with a dwarf, a troll and a woman, into the all-male Watch. Dwarfs and trolls are ancient enemies from the mountains, now moving in droves into Discworld's biggest city, Ankh-Morpork. Putting two of them together as a police team seems insoluble, and would be but for Corporal Carrot. The new watchwoman is also a werewolf (actually werewolfhound), and her kind of minority is shunned by just about everyone--except Carrot--but Angua no longer bites people and is trying to be a vegetarian! There are numerous subplots, skilfully woven into the main story--the insanity of extreme royalist snobbery; the growing affection between Sam Vimes and Sibyl Ramkin, his temporary backslide into alcoholism, Sibyl's steadfastness and (at the end of the book) a happy beginning; the reluctantly heroic talking mutt, Gaspode, who reminds me of Huckleberry Finn (he refused to be &#34;sivilized&#34;). Most relevant to our own problems is the &#34;gonne&#34; (the earliest English spelling of &#34;gun&#34;) invented by Leonard of Quirm. Supposedly it was destroyed, but instead was put away in a private museum and stolen. Like our own guns, it has a murderous personality of its own that infects its users, but Discworld is luckier than our world. At the story's end the gonne is destroyed by Carrot--and there are no others in existence."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Terry Pratchett is a fantastic author.

His use of footnotes to make a joke that had no bearing upon the story was...lame, for lack of a better term.The jokes, reeked of \\"ho ho ho see how clever I am!\\" rather than actually being funny. The characters struck me as pale shadows of characters who only grow and change in set and sadly predictiable ways so that they can advance the plot and story rather than being changed by the plot and story.I can't even say the story was silly lame. It wasn't. It was just lame."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Pratchett once again shows his ability to use comedy to make a social statement. I love his disc world books and Men at Arms was not a disappointment. If you have been unfortunate enough to not visit this wonderful world filled with magic, wizards, and an occasional god then take the opportunity. The books don't need to be read in order but some of the characters make multiple appearances. You will fall in love with the place and the people. I find myself a little sad each time I finish a book. Pratchett has the ability to give you a well written story that mixes humor with drama and even an occasional love story. His books would fall under fantasy and can be read by teenagers as well as adults. I highly recommend this book as well as others."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"This story was a bit slow at the beginning, but once it got started, it was an excellent read. Perhaps my second favorite Pratchett book behind Good Omens."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"When last we left our intrepid Ankh-Morpork Night Watch, things were looking up. This is a nice change from the gutter's-eye-view we had at the beginning of Guards! Guards!. Things have changed in the time between books. The Watch has a new headquarters, much nicer than its old one, thanks to Lady Sibyl Ramkin, the fiance of Captain Sam Vimes. She comes from an ancient and respectable family, has more money than anyone else in the city, and loves Vimes despite his deep-seated curmudgeonliness, if that is a word.What's more, the Watch is taking on new recruits, as ordered by the Patrician. Ankh-Morpork is a city with a very diverse population, and the Patrician believes that the Watch should reflect that diversity. Now we have a Watch open to anyone - trolls, dwarfs, the undead, apes, women - who wants to join, or who doesn't want to get their heads beaten in. Carrot Ironfoundersson has become a beloved figure in the city - he knows everyone and everyone knows him. All in all, things are looking up.But there are those who are of a mind that things would be better if only Ankh-Morpork had a king....This is a recurring theme in the early Watch books - the irrational need for royalty. Although, that's not entirely accurate. Pratchett is a British writer, of course, and he's got the Queen to look up to, but she doesn't have all that much real power. Certain people in Ankh-Morpork are looking for a sovereign - not to wave at them and make a Hogswatch speech, but to actually take over their city. They hope, in their hearts, that a king will solve everything. In that way, this recurring theme is not so much about royalty versus populism, but rather the ability to control one's own life versus allowing someone else to control it for you. The idea that one has responsibility for one's own actions and well-being is dominant in the Guards books, no more so than in this one.There is a man named Edward d'Eath, and he has a vision. He is the last of an aristocratic line whose power has declined in this age of guilds and merchants. He looks to the past and sees it as better, brighter than the future. He knows that, if he can just do one little thing, Ankh-Morpork - and he - will be restored to glory. That one little thing, of course, is to put a king on the throne.Not just any king, of course. The fools who thought to use a dragon to set up a puppet king showed how ineffectual that would be. No, this would only work with a real king, a descendant of the ancient kings of Ankh-Morpork. Find him, put him on the throne, and everything will finally be set straight.Of course, that doesn't work out nearly as well as Edward hopes. He steals a mysterious artifact to set his plan in motion - a weapon of such power and danger that the Assassins refuse to use it, and keep it on display as a message: beware things such as this. It is the Gonne, and the man who wields it has the power to change the world.Like I said, this book is all about making choices in life. Vimes is engaged to be married to Sybil Ramkin, and thus his days as the Captain of the Watch are numbered. He may be in a better position than he was in the last book - having someone try to kill you is always refreshing, after all - but he knows that the life he's giving up, with all of its pain and trouble and heartache, is the life that he needs to live.Corporal Carrot needs to choose how best to serve the city of Ankh-Morpork. He is an excellent policeman, probably the only man on the Disc who could get in the middle of an incipient troll/dwarf race riot and shame them out of killing each other. People do what he says - he is, in his own words, \\"good at being obeyed.\\" If he wanted to, he could run the city and the city would be glad to let him do it. But is that the best thing for the city?The troll Detritus and the dwarf Cuddy both have choices - will they conform to the ancient animosity that stands between their two races, or will they overcome it for the common good?And then there's the Gonne itself. As a weapon, it is frighteningly powerful - much more so than the standard-issue crossbow - and as a firearm, however primitive, it represents a vast escalation in the way violence is done. What's more, since this is a fantasy novel, the Gonne has something of a mind of its own. Its wielders hear it talking to them, convincing them that the only thing standing between them and what they want are a few simple deaths - something the Gonne can easily provide. It even uses the old NRA saw verbatim - Gonnes don't kill people. People kill people.But people have a choice, perhaps more of a choice than the characters of these books do. The Gonne controls them, the trigger practically pulls itself, and when you're holding it, you can easily understand how a simple shot, one simple thing, could change the world. For the better, of course - always for the better.Pratchett's views on guns and their efficacy aside, it's a very gripping book. There's the mystery of it, of course - who has the Gonne, and why are they using it - but it's also a story about characters and the choices they make for themselves. My absolute favorites in this are Detritus and Cuddy. Trolls and dwarfs have a famous antagonism, stretching back to the ancient battle of Koom Valley (the only battle in the multiverse where both sides ambushed each other) and it would be very easy for them to fall into simple, culturally conditioned roles.While it may be a cliche to say that they found common ground, learned to look past their own prejudices and learned to respect - nay, to like one another, that's exactly what they did. It is due to Pratchett's skill as a writer and as a creator of characters that we come to deeply care for this relationship, investing a lot of hope in it. We know that if Cuddy and Detritus can become friends, then maybe there's hope for everyone. This emotional investment pays off, and Pratchett reaches deep into our hearts at the end, showing that just because you start with a cliche, it doesn't mean it can't have depth.Of course, if you're not quite as analytical as I am, you can still enjoy it as a good murder mystery. Watching Vimes and company piece together the crime is always fun, because there's always a twist somewhere that you never saw coming. And Vimes really is one of my favorite Discworld characters - he's cynical and world-weary, but he still has enough idealism within him to carry him through those times that look like they're trying to kill him.All in all, a great book and one that's highly recommended. The earlier Discworld books are largely stand-alone, so if you've never read any of the series before, don't worry - you can pick this one up and you won't really miss anything. You may, however, find yourself driving back to the bookstore to get as many other Discworld books as you can. I'm just saying....---------------------------------------------------\\"Generally, I meet people before they're buried. The ones I meet after they've been buried tend to be a bit over-excited and disinclined to discuss things.\\"- Death, Men at Arms---------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"The Night Watch is called into action to investigate a long distance killing machine and along the way we are reminded under what circumstances trolls can be geniuses, the ways of talking dogs and werewolves, and the true king of Ankh-Morpork. Like most of the Nightwatch stories in Pratchett's series, MEN AT ARMS is a great time for all; where we find the gruff and angry Vimes preparing to retire and then being thrust into what might prove to be his last investigation. This one has enough action, comedy and even the death of a copper to add a bit of pathos (Not too much however, as the deceased's responses to DEATH's inquiries are very funny) to satisfy any fan of the series."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"I've been working my way through the Discworld series in the order of publication, and I must admit the City Watch novels are among my favorites. In \\"Men at Arms\\", Pratchett does a great job of transforming the rag-tag group of night watchmen into another Ankh-Morpork institution. I really enjoyed following Vimes and Carrot as they conducted their investigation, and the introduction of our new watch... people... promises more enjoyment in future installments.Above all, I enjoy Pratchett's ability to blend humorous fiction with poignant social commentary. Though some of these books are over a decade or two old, and perhaps written to juxtapose some then-current event or social dilemma, his novels have that lasting quality that makes them apt regardless of today's world issues. Even today we have problems with gun control and violence, and with this novel Pratchett does what he does best - pokes fun at everyone on all sides.This definitely ranks in my top 5 of the series to this point."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"This is probably among the best Diskworld books Pratchett has written. It has it all: rich character development, an intriguing plot that actually kept throwing curves at me, some sarcastic social commentary, and of course, Pratchett's renound rapier-like wit. I'm still laughing at his concept of \\"retro-phrenology.\\"As with any Diskworld novel, this one is best enjoyed if you already have a grip on the setting, but if you're new to the series, you can start here with little problem -- though you'll get the sense you're not privy to a number of inside jokes.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"So many discworld novels, so little time. I love them all, but my favorites, at the moment, are the Watch Novels. Anyone who enjoys humor in their life should read Terry Pratchett. Enough said."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Of course, I've thoroughly enjoyed every Discworld book except the very first, so that wasn't very surprising. However, one thing that made this book especially enjoyable is that it is the introduction of one of my favorite recurring characters, Angua.Men at Arms is a Watch book, and I always particularly enjoy them because the Watch is full of such colorful characters. In this book we are also introduced to Detruis, the troll who's really smart when it's cold and really stupid when it's hot. Unfortunately, Ank-Morpork is almost always hot.As usual for Discworld novels, Men at Arms is full of satire, poking fun at everything from monarchy to violence to racism (or in this case, specism). The thought \\"Guns don't kill people; people kill people\\" is turned on its head when the gonne takes over the mind of it's wielder, making him kill people at random. It talks to whoever is holding it and even fires itself on occasion.The book starts out with new recruits to the watch being trained. Cuddy (a Dwarf), Detrius (a Troll), and Angua (both Werewolf and a woman) provide comic relief throughout the book as they attempt to adjust to the different procedures of the Night Watch.The real story, however, is the gonne that has gone missing just a day before Captain Vimes is scheduled to retire (he's marrying Lady Sibyl). Of course, Vimes has to find the gun and the culprit who is using it. Vetinari tells him not to, but that only makes him more determined. After all, he is a policeman; solving crimes is his job.As with all Discworld books, the best part of Men at Arms is the characters rather than the story. The story itself is all right, but it is the crazy character-extremely literal and valiant Carrot, hulking and slow Detrius, very odd but strangely loveable Nobby, Gaspode the talking dog, and stubborn and determined Vimes-that make the story. Without them, it wouldn't be nearly as funny or enjoyable.Pratchett has a knack for weaving stereotypes into believable, loveable characters, and it shows in this book. Carrot, the long lost king, is brave, valiant, noble, and honest. However, he's also managing to adapt to life in Ank-Morpork. While he doesn't lie, he doesn't ever tell the whole truth. Detrius is big and slow and stupid, but get him in cold weather and he's extremely smart. Every main character personifies a stereotype and then takes it further, turning it around and making it real and comical.This is definitely one of Pratchett's more amusing books. I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a humorous read and all Pratchett fans."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"I have all the Pratchett books, but this by far is the best of the bunch. Humourous, touching, clever, witty and highly readable this seems to be the peak of the discworld books. The Watch works well as a basis for the story, the members are developed into people, (or not as the case may be haha!) along with a few usual suspects, and the whole thing flows. After this i started to feel that the books were very same-ish, and lacked originality, but i have to say that Men at Arms will always be the one i recommend to people."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"This book is the best! It is one of my favorite Discworld books. Terry Pratchett is a brilliant writer and I personally reccomend any of his books. If any book has his name on it, you can be sure it will be one of the best (or funniest) books you have ever read. This book in particular is hilarious!"},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Unlike the Hitchhiker's Trilogy from the late Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett's Discworld books have managed to stay fresh and original through not a mere five, but 27 installments. The reason for this, I think, is that Pratchett uses the format to its fullest potential, creating several groups of characters that he visits time and again, never having any single group act as the star of the entire series, and using it to tackle diverse subjects without ever repeating himself.\\"Men at Arms\\" is the second Discworld book to focus on Captain Vimes and the men -- um... humans... er... beings -- of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch (the first being \\"Guards! Guards!\\") and it has firmly cemented these characters as my favorite recurring heroes in the Discworld universe.Time is running out for Captain Sam Vimes -- because he's getting married. Furthermore, his beloved night watch is being tampered with by higher-ups calling for \\"greater diversity\\" in the hirings, forcing him to welcome trolls, dwarfs and women into the group. To make matters worse, someone has stolen a strange new weapon from the assassin's guild and is using it to kill people. Vimes, Carrot, Nobby and the gang have to find the murderer and save the day.Funny, yes, but also particularly poignant in light of recent events in the Washington D.C. area. I read this book a few months ago, before the unpleasantness began... this may be just the thing to help you cope."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"hollywood take notice!! a movie idea like this only comes along once a century. i have read nearly half of the discworld novels and each one has been better than the last. i would be hard pressed to pick a favorite, but men at arms would be up there among the top. great characters, excellent plot twists, and a host of unforgetable one-liners. but what impressed me the most as i read each page was what a great movie men at arms would make. i could almost see a cgi created acting constable detritus. if you are new to the discworld series make men at arms your next read."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"In my opinion Men at Arms is the best of the Watch novels. It was a great sequel to Guards,Guards and I really looked forward to reading it at the time. I enjoyed the introduction of the new members in the Watch since it gave the book a bit more variety.

Keep up the good work Terry, your doing a great job."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Pratchett's Discworld novels are consistently amusing, often touching, and brilliantly creative. Men At Arms manages to be all these things and more . . .The misfit Night Watch we met in Guards, Guards! Is in danger of becoming almost respectable. Carrot and Sgt. Colon have new recruits of all shapes and sizes. Captain Vimes is retiring to become a respectable gentleman as Sybil Ramkin's husband. What could go wrong . . .Well, this IS Ankh-Morpork, a city so corrupt that if the gods took vengeance on it, no one would notice. Things get complicated when an exploding swamp dragon, a mysterious invention, warring guilds, and an assasin who is NOT killing for pay send the city into more turmoil than usual. Who can save the day? It's up to the flattest of flatfoots in the Night Watch, and their new recruits to set the city right, or at least not so wrong.There is the usual Pratchett wordplay and humor, as well as the thoughtful emotional interplays he has developed over the years. There's also an interesting mystery at the center of the whole piece, and some of his most interesting characters trying to deal with it. There are also some scenes of real poignance and heart that will make you think, and make you feel.If you haven't read Discworld, read Guards, Guards!, and then this novel. You'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Terry Pratchett has done it again! &quot;Men At Arms&quot; offers a laughable look at some of the biggest problems facing our world today. Prejudice, crime, anarchy, and segregation are all addressed in his unique, farcical style. This is what parody is all about!

If there's a way to get to them, I couldn't find it & Pratchett's footnotes are a significant part of the humor. So buy the print version of the Discworld books - and do buy them. Prachett is always entertaining!"},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Captain Sam Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch is retiring and getting married in a few days. But an explosion at the Assassins' Guild attracts his interest, and soon a trail of bodies is forming. The Guilds don't want his help, the Patrician has ordered him to lay off and his fellow Watch members seem more concerned about the new intake of ethnic minorities (Lance-Corporal Cuddy of the dwarfs and Lance-Corporal Detritus of the trolls) than the mystery. But somewhere in Ankh-Morpork a killer is on the loose with a very powerful new weapon...Men at Arms is the second Discworld novel to focus on the City Watch, introduced in the classic Guards! Guards! As told in that volume, the City Watch saved the city from a marauding dragon and at the end of the book the Watch gained fresh resources from a grateful city government. However, it is still regarded as a joke, as Men at Arms makes clear.Pratchett once again uses the cliches and ideas of police procedurals to generate humour and satire, although this volume is much more of a hard-bitten (in some cases, literally) mystery novel. Sam Vimes is portrayed as the cynical, weathered old cop doggedly pursuing his case in the face of all opposition, whilst Corporal Carrot is his enthusiastic young sidekick. Of course, that would be a bit too cheesy, so Pratchett subverts this idea earlier on and takes the story in a more interesting and original direction.The city of Ankh-Morpork comes to life in this book more successfully than in any prior volume, to the extent that Pratchett's playwright and friend Stephen Briggs was able to use information in this book (and the prior ones) to map the city so everything tracked and made sense (the results can be found in the spin-off product, The Streets of Ankh-Morpork). The city's ethnic make-up, the political structure of the guilds and the office of the Patrician are all portrayed convincingly. In addition, Pratchett aims high with his characterisation, with the most affecting death of a Discworld character to date and some brilliant development for Carrot and Vimes. There is even a reasonably well-portrayed romance and some (tastefully off-screen) sex, a first for the series. Men at Arms is Discworld aimed at a slightly maturer level than arguably any of the previous books bar Small Gods.Which isn't to say that Pratchett doesn't bring the funny. The Colon/Nobbs double-act is excellent, the return of Gaspode the Wonder Dog (from Moving Pictures, but much better-utilised here) is genuinely funny and there is some fantastic material to be mined from the Cuddy/Detritus relationship.Men at Arms (*****) is Pratchett yet again firing on all cylinders, delivering a novel that is by turns brilliantly funny, genuinely thought-provoking and consistently entertaining. The novel is available now in the UK and USA."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"There's something to be said for reading a series in chronological order, but it seems somehow more in the spirit of Discworld to just read them however they come to hand. This one features the Night Watch (my favorite sub-series) on the cusp of becoming the reorganized and expanded City Watch. Carrot is presently a corporal and trolls and dwarfs are just being added to the roster in the spirit of affirmative action. Captain Sam Vimes is facing both imminent retirement and imminent marriage to Lady Sybil Ramkin, both of which have put him into a strange state of mind. And on top of all that, there has been a mysterious series of murders of guild members, committed with an unknown weapon. Carrot, a six-foot-tall adopted dwarf, gets a lot of play this time, with special attention to his special talent: Everyone likes Carrot because he truly thinks everyone is basically decent underneath it all. As always, Pratchett, a master of stealth philosophy, combines off-the-wall humor and bent puns with thoughtful and humane digressions on the nature of right and good vs. wrong and evil, and what makes a good copper."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"The discworld series is by far one of the most hilarious series I have ever had the privlege to experience. I have read pretty much all of the books in this series, and I love them all to death. If your new to the series, you dont have to read the books in order, but it does help in order to fully experience some of the character ties, growths, and extremely bizzare happenings.Men at Arms is the second book featuring the Watch, the first being Guards!

I can say it in one word: Carrot! He is one of my favorite heroes on the Discworld (only Rincewind and Nanny Ogg compare with Death a close third). As usual, Carrot comes through with flying colors. There are just so many interesting things in this book: the plot about the \\"gonne,\\" Leonard de Quirm (and the way he acts with the Patrician), Cuddy the dwarf and Detritus the troll, the silly guildsand their ridiculous presidents, Carrot and Angua, I could just go on.Especially good was the troll-dwarf issue, the way they had to work together to interview the guilds without making complete fools of themselves and just basically get along. Also, it is funny how intelligent trolls get in low temperatures.The plot alos makes for a nice mystery story. Pratchett really worked on this one. We start out with a 4-man watch and end up with one over 60 people! The Watch really grows up and will add many laughs to future stories.

As a quick synopsis, the Ankh-Morpork City Guard (Night Watch) are having to deal with a very new and very, very nasty weapon. And this is a Bad Thing (TM) because the Night Watch in its entirety consists of a human who was raised as a dwarf, a dwarf with a nasty temper, a werewolf who holds long conversations with dogs, a really fat idiot, a recovering drunk, a troll who knocks himself unconscious whenever he tries to salute, and a.. well, we haven't quite worked out *what* Nobby is yet.This isn't exactly a *mystery*, per se, not in the same way that, say, The Fifth Elephant or Feet of Clay are, because we have a fair idea pretty early on of what the weapon we're facing actually is, even if the Night Watch don't. My personal favorite scene is the one starting in the sewers where Vimes gets the.. um.. probably shouldn't say it here.. anyway. I also like the bits with Leonard, especially when Vetinari's talking to him about the Watch and starts comparing people to clockwork (&quot;And sometimes you have to wind the spring as tight as it will go, and pray it doesn't break.&quot;) That was actually a bit creepy, really.."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"I have read every Terry Pratchett book in the Disc book series.

Men at Arms, though, surpasses even that.First of all, the ranks of the City Watch are expanded, with Detritus -DON'T SALUTE, the Troll, Cuddy, the Dwarf, and Angua, a woman who's not all she appears to be. Dwarves and Trolls don't get along, which provides the meat to some very funny scenes between Detritus and Cuddy, including a great scene where Cuddy is teaching Detritus how to count. There are even more jokes in this one then there were in Guards Guards (or at least, I laughed at more of them).Captain Vimes is retiring in a few days, which doesn't give the watch much time to figure out who's responsible for all the strange murders happening. Never fear, though, Corporal Carrot is here! The character development in this book makes this so much more than just a funny fantasy. Vimes is really starting to second guess his life. Carrot is maturing greatly, even if he still is plain, simple Carrot. Even Nobbs and Colon grow as characters.In Vimes, you see a character agonizing over who he is and what he is becoming. He's not sure he wants to live the life that's staring him in the face. Yet he's still the take-charge guy he became in the first book. He's the emotional centre of the book and while he's not always involved, his presence is always being felt.All of this sounds dreadfully serious, but it's wrapped in a plot that goes from one hilarious event to another. There were three or four straight pages where I couldn't stop laughing as I read, and every other page had a treat (I just managed to stifle the laughter in order to not disturb my wife's sleep). The mix of comedy and character development is made perfectly. If you have no interest in serious stuff, you can ignore that aspect of the book and just revel in the jokes.I'm moving on to Feet of Clay now, and I'm optimistic. Pratchett hasn't missed with me so far. Do yourself a favour and try this series."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"A well-crafted, sharp-witted tale that will be especially appealing to anyone who has ever read Tolkien and his ilk.

So what ? &quot;Men At Arms&quot; sees Pratchett back with a vengeance, &quot;extracting the urine&quot; again with the style and wit he's gotten us used to. Shrewd as ever, he manages yet again to make the reader think twice ( or thrice, for that matter ) about the pool of cliches we wallow in, as well as to make us laugh like we did with Reaper Man or Witches Abroad. Pratchett also tears to shreds that silly notion that guns are something to be desired - hey, even the Guild of Assassins hate them ! - and, as always, pulls off a funny/teary eyed ending he's known for. A great book for those facial muscles you haven't exercised in so long - read it before someone else does and starts quoting from it."},{"Title":"MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Yet another really funny and original book by Terry Pratchett.He takes us back yet again to Diskworld and the saga of Corp.

Not only is there a continuation of characters, but new ones are added, and further developed. Terry Pratchett shows he is a REAL writer by his ability to interweave a funny, uplifting book, with true drama, a plot, and a mystery type story, of whodunnit? If you like &quot;buddy flicks&quot; and enjoy excellent humor, this is a must read. Even though it is a continuation from a previous book, the reader does not need to read Guards Guards! to fully understand the characters, for Pratchett's writing style allows the new reader to become comfortable with the characters within a few pages. The only warning i give to the reader is, not all books are completely happy go lucky, for drama is truly woven in with surprising occurences. Enjoy this book!

I bought this book on the strength of reading about Capt. Herndon's sacrifice in Gary Kinder's &quot;Ship of Gold...&quot;. He seemed to epitomise the old-style captain, caring about his passengers, crew and above all his ship, and I was interested to read more about the man.I was not disappointed; what could have been a dusty tome full of only facts and figures, emerges as a rivetting account of the trials endured during the trip, and vivid descriptions of a land that was as yet virtually unknown to the 'civilised' world, told as a very readable narrative. This easy style is what captured the hearts and minds of the Anmerican (and European) public in a book which went into several reprints of 10,000s (as opposed to the usual Congress print run of 100+!).It also captured the imagination of a certain Samuel Clemens, who, after reading the book, immediately took steamer from St.Louis to New Orleans to get a boat to the Amazon. Imagine his disappointment when he found no passage ... sitting, bemoaning his ill luck, he hears the cries of the steamers &quot;Mark twain!&quot; - the rest is history.I have one reservation (hence only ****); during his editing &amp; research for the book, Mr.Kinder deletes a lot of sections that I personally would have found very interesting, such as crops grown, goods &amp; minerals available and costs of trade items. If these had been included as an appendix, I think it would have added to the charm of the book.Nevertheless, one of the best pieces of historical travel writing I have ever read."},{"Title":"Exploration of the valley of the Amazon,","review":"Captain William Lewis Herndon gives a very well written narrative of what it was like to explore South America in 1851-1852. He took the first United States' expedition from the west side of the Peruvian Andes,then over and through the Brazilian Amazon to the Atlantic Ocean. His desriptions of the local people and their cultures, along with how they survived, their agricultural methods and practices are fascinating. He also includes geological, botanical and zoological observations all along the way. He describes how difficult it was to cross the Andes at elevations above 17,000 feet, the mining industries in the mountains, what kinds of plants grow here and there, the animals they encounter. A few unbelievable (but verifiable?) accounts were of the tailed people who lived up the Jurua tributary, the three and a half foot people, blue mud, etc. These were all enjoyable to read. The only drawback was the overall purpose of the expedition. It was a way to exploit the Andes Mountains and Amazon of their natural resources, from the gold, silver, etc in the mountains to harvesting the forests for commercial use. Just like Gary Kinder said in his foreword to the book, if Herndon was alive today, he may have a different opinion. A very good read though if you enjoy exploration."},{"Title":"Exploration of the valley of the Amazon,","review":"This is only volume 2 of the two volume report about the amazon, and vol 1 was written by Herndon, and vol 2 by another army officer on the expedition. not as promised"},{"Title":"Exploration of the valley of the Amazon,","review":"Before I comment further on this book I must say I quite agree with another reviewer who wrote. \\"I have one reservation (hence only ****); during his editing & research for the book, Mr. Kinder deletes a lot of sections that I personally would have found very interesting, such as crops grown, goods & minerals available and costs of trade items.

These new illustrations seem too cartoonish. But, we're here for the story, not the pretty pictures!! Buy this book."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"We're coming down to the end of Stephen King's lifetime seminal work, the seven-book Dark Tower series, featuring Roland the Gunslinger and his companions, in their quest to reach the Dark Tower and save the world. These books are not typical King horror -- rather an epic saga thousands of pages long set in a multi-world fantasy land where almost anything imaginable can happen. 2003's entry \\"Wolves\\" is Book 5, leading to a whole book published earlier this year about companion Susannah (#6), with the final work to come late this year according to the author. The books have been spaced out since the early 1980's, so thankfully a rather long introductory section serves as a bit of a review/synopsis for those of us whose memories are no longer that stout!King's writing is as fine as usual; we particularly enjoyed the scene setting in the early part of the book and the action of the latter part of the book -- most of which is dedicated to the main plot of how the gunslinging quartet of Roland, Jake, Eddie, and Susannah save a little town (\\"Calla\\") from some \\"wolves\\" that attack every generation or so, robbing the town of half its offspring, then sending the kids home mentally deranged. The fight with the wolves had the predictable outcome, yet it was still anxiously awaited and satisfying.Unfortunately, the mid-section of the book suffers from bloated background story-telling, much of it about Father Callahan, the priest from \\"Salem's Lot\\" who goes on to become a drunk and a vampire killer among other wanderings through time and space. Especially he and Jake slip back to modern times in New York City to help a bookseller stave off some bad guys in yet another side tale that caught our interest. Moreover, quite a few of King's other characters (such as the \\"Regulators\\" and the \\"Low Men\\") from other novels got brief mention. Like his movies, even the author himself got a quick cameo!We enjoyed the positioning of this book and its main storyline, not that it moved our fearless quartet much closer to the tower. Even the middle part had some interest, and we found ourselves turning pages at a pretty good clip. We suppose King's efforts are long since beyond much editing, but it seems a little crisper story told in about 200 pages less would just about been perfect. But -- not bad as is! Enjoy."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"First of all, I have to say that I finished this book in two days. Something about Stephen King's writing just pulls me into his world and won't let me out. That said, I was a bit disappointed with this episode of the Dark Tower series. It's hard to put my finger on, but if you read any of King's prefaces, he talks about this series being an American answer to the, European, Lord of the Rings, and I think he's getting farther from that mark. Don't get me wrong, Wolves of the Calla is a very good piece. It's only when I reflect on its place in the series that I begin to have concerns. For instance, Eddie's observations about the \\"Wolves\\" relation to our world, made me a bit queasy. It is almost as though, in his haste to finish the series, Mr. King is returning to more \\"cheesy\\" supernatural explanations. I really hope the series doesn't turn into \\"Pet Semetary.\\" All in all this book was definitely enjoyable and I would recommend it, although with some reservations."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I realized when reading the opening pages of the third book in the series, The Wastelands, that Stephen King was not going to deliver the mind-blowing story that I had expected after reading The Gunslinger. I was disappointed, but--with lowered expectations--I read on. While not being the end all, be all fantasy series that I had hoped would take my imagination to a level beyond anything else, The Dark Tower series is actually pretty good as far as fiction is concerned. It is more skillfully written than the majority of books currently being published.Having said that--now that I am over my disappointment and am just letting the story be what it is, I actually very much enjoyed Wolves of the Calla, particularly Father Callahan's tale. I'm looking forward to finishing the series with the hope that it will be very good (and a lingering hope that it will be profound)."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Again, King has the skill to develop his characters into breathing, thinking, 3D personalities, and once again he has done this in Wolves of the Calla. I loved this book. King takes his time, which some don't have patience for, but for me is essential in devoloping the story, the tension, and the life of these people. I just finished it today, and have already opened up Dark Tower VI to begin the next step in the journey.King has matured greatly as a writer and storyteller, and he doesn't rely on just scares, plot twists and gimmicks anymore; his vision and goals, it seems to me, is to truly build another world and people who we must care about. And he has done so in this exceptional series. I look forward to the two final parts, even though I'll be sad when it ends.Also, I'd recommend these books to non-King fans: it is truly above par to even his own works, which, in my opinion, are fantastic...!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The Wolves of the Calla is a good book and essentially has two stories. One story is the staying on the track of the Dark Tower and what the ka-tet needs to do to get there and the other story is their defending the people of Calla Bryn Sturgis. A lot of the book is figuring out what the ka-tet needs to do to get to the tower and a lot of it has to do with Calvin Tower and the vacant lot on 2nd and 46th. We also meet a new character to the Tower series but a familiar one to King in Salem's Lot, Father Callahan. This book will frustrate some Tower fans as it doesn't really solve too much from beginning to end but it does give you more information on what lies ahead for the ka-tet and the transformation of the characters. I liked the story but it shouldn't have been as long as it was."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I have to admit that a lengthy amount of time passed for me before picking up the series again on a flight from CO to FL with Wizard and Glass. I was at once sucked in and rejuvinated to see how the Tower series ended. Since reading Wolves of Calla I'm starting to wonder just what happened in the world of Steven King to change the series layout. The story was good and there were the elements there that were wholly Mid-World therefore wholly engrossing. I was disappointed in the necessity to lend from so many other resources outside of Mid-World. Cross referencing King's other books and popular fiction. I'm hoping that there is some deeper purpose for this other than a desire to just finish up the series. I've come too far now to NOT know how the story is resolved or if Roland will finally ascend into the room at the top of the Tower.

So now, they run into a town called Calla Burynes and we meet again Father Callahan (the runaway Preist from Salems' Lot) and the towns folk. They then tell Roland that Wolves to the town every 25 years to take their children. So now the ka-tet get ready to fight the wolves and stop them taking their kids once and for all. Now Father Callahan tells his tale of getting out of Salems' Lot and coming to New York City. There he see's vampires there, and the Low Men wanting to get him (To see who the Low men are, read Hearts In Atlantis). So now we then come back to Calvin Tower; a book store owner who Jake brought a riddle book back in Dark Tower 3: The Wastelands. He is now in danger, and he has connections to the Tower, and he is being harrased about this empty lot where the rose lay's. So now the rose is in danger of being destroyed so now they have to get Calvin Tower out of New York City and somewhere safe away from men who want to convince Calvin to sell the lot. So now, we then come back to the ka-tet and now as the time gets closer to the Wolves, Jake then discovers a secret. One of the town's men and Andy; a robot the kids like to play with is involved with the Wolves taking their children. Then Eddie kills Andy and so now the time of the Wolves come and they kill the Wolves with plates and with the ka-tet's weapons.Now when Susannah disappears, it is then that the demon-child is close to being born, and now he is taking control of her with Mia Daughter of None.If you want to understand the Dark Tower, dont start with this novel, go back to Dark Tower 1: The Gunslinger and work your way through.

Even though it was pretty off track, Wolves of the Calla succeeds at being a wholly engaging and entertaining side quest of Roland and his ka-tet. The mystery surrounding the wolves and why they are nabbing a single twin from each pair from the Calla Bryn Sturgis is answered throughout the course of the novel, but there is much left to ponder when all is said and done. The story of Don Callahan, the priest from Salem's Lot, who died and found him self in the world that Roland is questing through is absolutely the high point of this novel for me. Especially the last couple of pages when some pretty interesting, or insane depending on how you view it, revelations about what this world might be come to light. Not much is done in this book concerning the groups main quest of the tower, and events at the end set up another side quest that may very well take center stage in the next book. Even though there was little to push the main story along, this has been my favorite book in the Dark Tower series up to this point."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I've been a Stephen King fan for nearly 20 years, and have only recently began to read The Dark Tower books.

I couldn't be more in love with these stories and rave about them to everyone I meet. Roland and his ka-tet have captured my heart. Not since litle Jacky Sawyer have I felt so strongly for a character's fate, and I praise Mr. King for his undying devotion to his life's greatest writing accomplishment.

King does not stop scaring you either, as always their is enough of the dark side in this book to make you glad that Roland is ever faithfully by your side."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"One of my favorite Novels of the highly acclaimed Dark Tower series.I loved the gang's stay at the Calla, I feel like this built up the last two novels very well, esp. with Father Callahan's presence with the Ka-tet.&lt;3 SK"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Let me start by saying I have really enjoyed the Dark Tower series up to this point. And for that matter, almost all of King's books: The Eyes of the Dragon, The Talisman and the Stand being my favorites. Yet this is the first book of his that I felt strongly enough about to write a review. Why, you may ask? Because of the excruciating boredom I am currently experiencing while listening to yet another of Father Callahan's tangents. I call it a tangent because it is exactly that. It has absolutely no relevance to the main story arc and on top of that fails to pique my interest in any way.Allow me to elaborate on my frustrations. The main story arc follows Roland and company in their relentless pursuit of the Dark Tower. It is interesting and compelling and has kept me going strong through 4 long novels. Roland is resolute and cutthroat in that endeavor. Even so much as to allow a young boy, whom he had loved, fall to his death when forced to decide between saving him and getting information about the tower. That alone should show the sense of urgency Roland, as well as questionable moral standing Roland has. So to veer off the path, there better be a reason more compelling than the life of someone he loves. Yet the only reason given to give \\"aid and succor\\" to the folk of the Calla is a weak reference to the code of the gunslingers that somehow forces them to help people who may or may not want or even need help. That same code didn't do much to save a young boy from falling to his death. But when it comes down to it, I could forgive that because the story of the wolves, andy the robot,and the politics of the Calla are pretty interesting. Yet King decided for some reason that one tangent was not quite enough, no! He would instead insert many, MANY other tangents into the original tangent until one day you look up and you're in the middle of nowhere. I would compare it to someone inviting you to watch a Star Wars marathon with them...only halfway through they decide to throw in another DVD, then randomly stop that DVD and play parts of another DVD. I came over to watch Star Wars!!!But the fact remains that I do really enjoy the main story arc and there are occasional points of interest in this book. Of course this is the crux of the problem, if I didn't like the story I'd have already moved on from the tireless tangent tirade. But I do, and I just want to get back to the real story but have to wade through the murk to get there. I wonder if after reading the whole series, could this entire book have been cut out?The most appropriate moment in the story is that of Roland, twirling his fingers impatiently at Father Callahan as if saying \\"hurry the story up already\\". Advice Mr. King would have done well to heed."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I love the Dark Tower series and had gotten all the books but this one. Thank goodness I found it here used. It was delivered very quickly and in perfect condition. And now I can finish it and start the next book which I bought last year but didn't want to read until I found this one!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The Wolves of the Calla, the antepenultimate volume of Stephen King's Dark Tower series brings the ka-tet to Calla Bryn Sturgis, a small farming community on the outskirts of Thunderclap. The town, which births twins and only rarely \\"singletons\\", is plagued every few decades by the wolves, riders from Thunderclap who steal one child from each set of twins. The children then come back, years later, roont - dumb, and continuously growing until they die much younger than their other half.The ka-tet, as gunslingers, have the duty to protect the Calla from the wolves, which are set to come in roughly thirty days as the ka-tet passes through. In the Calla, they are introduced to Father Callahan - a man from \\"our\\" side who had been brought to the Calla in a similar way as Eddie, Jake and Susannah. A large portion of the book is spent on his back-story and he becomes a main player in the Tower quest. (Many King fans will know him from King's second novel, Salem's Lot).The majority of the book covers the thirty days of the ka-tet analyzing and preparing for the wolves to come, and on Callahan's interesting back-story which is complete with vampires and travel through the different worlds. Although it only covers roughly thirty days, the book is lengthy in pages (this edition has 736 pages) - longer even than the previous volume. However, unlike the previous volume, the story stays relevant to the Tower quest and the ka-tet, and provides further background of the characters - and further growth, especially in the boy (man, now?) Jake.As with the other volumes, King transitions smoothly and easily into the next volume - and with interesting twists. Wolves of the Calla is an entertaining expansion on the Tower quest and the blend of Roland's world with \\"ours\\", and should not be missed for even casual fans of King or the series, as it makes up for the previous, lackluster fourth volume (Wizard and Glass) and leaves the reader quickly grabbing for the next volume."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The book itself was in perfect condition and shipped in record time. The story is one of the greatest ever written. In this installment Roland and his Katet are fighting in Calla Brin Sturgis.

It had quite a few surprises in it and only made me even more anxious to read books 6 and 7!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"In my opinion, (though decent) This is probably the worst book in the series. The whole novel is one huge build up to the battle with the mechanical wolves at the end. I felt as though wolves of the calla tryed in every way possible to side step the outcome of itself for as long as it possibly could til it got there, and god knows it took long enough. It's a good thing it's a central piece of a great and grand story because otherwise i don't see it making it on it's own merit. Calla lives for the ending, and nothing more."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I have a mixture of feelings for I've waited the end of this series for so long. And this is the beginning of it. First, I must give in that this is a complementary book. Perhaps it was a bit too unnecessary long, but hey.. Tower junkies like me don't want this story ever to end, and that's why I can forgive him those 'mistakes' or 'liberties' if you like.Long story short, the story is lineal, with no huge surprises, the mithological subjects about the Tower keep growing. And we've waited so long for this story to move on (and finish), that I think we can all see that this is the beginning of the end, and we'll read this book with that in mind.I liked this book, and I know I'll looooove books 6 &amp; 7."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Before I start let me say that I am not, on the whole, a Stephen King fan but my mother is. It was from her that I got the copy of &quot;\`Salem's Lot&quot; that was the first of his novels I read. &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; was the second. I read it and &quot;The Drawing of the Three&quot; just in time for &quot;The Waste Lands&quot;. Then I waited. And waited, like most of you did. Somewhere in there I read &quot;The Stand.&quot; Enjoyed it a bit, say thankya. Then &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot;.I was, at least, mildly disappointed with &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot;, though I read it basically in a single sitting. The story was fine, especially as concerning the adventures of young Roland in Meijis and his love of Susan Delgado. I could get past the obvious references to &quot;The Stand&quot; and even the extended nonsense of the &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;. My bone to pick then was that the Tower seemed little closer than it had at the beginning of the book, scant reward for ten hours of my time.Finally &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot;, illustrated by Bernie Wrightson (and me an old Swamp Thing fan!). Again, decent story. I didn't cringe too much when Pere Callahan proved to be from &quot;\`Salem's Lot&quot;. Something like this was bound to happen as Mr. King tells us, in the afterword to Wizard and Glass, that there is a place in the Roland's world for character from his other novels. Callahan is mentioned by name.But, dammit, there was the sneetch (snitch?). And the wolves themselves. And even the typeface used in the chapter headings. And the mentions of Mr. King within the novel himself.Here's what I think- the room at the top of the Dark Tower is not empty; its occupant is Stephen King (pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, he is a good man but a bad wizard). C.S. Lewis once wrote that he had a hard time believing in Jesus as he thought that God interacting with creation was a little like Shakespeare talking to Hamlet. It couldn't be done; they were of different planes (levels of the Tower?). But Shakespeare could write himself into the play and, thus, have palaver with his creation. This is how Lewis saw Jesus, and how I see Mr. King playing out his story.Further, though I am not the first to suggest this, Stephen King is the author of the Harry Potter novels (if page 683 isn't enough, look at the typeface, especially the headings, and look at the New York Times review for the fourth HP book). Just the mention of Harry Potter (and Star Wars and Marvel comics), let alone the substantial inclusion of elements from these sources is a disappointment. Borrowing from other sources for your stories is a good thing; it has been suggested that all fiction is a variation on Homer. Hell, using other people's characters can be done well, witness Alan Moore's &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; (another Swamp Thing connection. Coincidence?). Let's just say that here it feels like filling a creative void.This last I say with no joy: Stephen King is a coward. The Dark Tower was (in my limited exposure to his oeuvre) Mr. King's finest creation. It was apart from his other works and worlds, a different species of tale. Mr. King realized this, I think, and was scared by it. What did he do? He brought in characters that had worked before. The hints of it were in Wizard and Glass. It comes to fruition in Wolves of the Calla. Roland and his ka-tet may not have strayed from the Path of the Beam, but Mr. King surely has."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"For those who will read anything that Stephen King writes, I am sure this review will not be taken to heart. However, I just have to say that this is the worst part of the Gunslinger series so far.King drones on making trivial points and teasing the reader with silly clues while trying to impress us with his ability to write a western for 600 pages before actually getting to the point of anything. The language of the characters became really annoying after the first few hundred pages, and King appears to be just going nowhere for most of the story. He makes a point of shamelessly ripping off Star Wars, Harry Potter and a number of really good western authors. The end of the tale is extremely predictable with the ending leaving you wondering about the point. The most infuriating part of this is King's need to appear in this book as an author. Seems he just can't get over the need to remind people that he is the real star of the show, not the characters that should be the actual focus of the story. At the end of the book I just wanted to throw it at the wall and tell him to just get over himself!I would suggest that you read Salem's Lot before delving into this trial of patience if you absolutely MUST read it since it will make a whole lot more sense once you figure out that King has decided to recycle one of his characters for some stupid reason. I guess it is easier to recycle than to have to invent something new. OR, just read the last 200 pages and save yourself some pain.I hope the remaining two books are better than this one. If this were my first exposure to his work I would not read another since it was predictable, immature, dry, and overy long for the story that was eventually delivered after a very painful extraction."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Let me start off by saying that I love Stephen King, and especially The Dark Tower series. I started reading the series 15 years ago when I was still a teenager, and I was hooked.In 2003 my life became incredibly busy, and as a result I stopped reading books. But in 2004, Wolves of the Calla came out, which inspired me to pick up reading again. I couldn't wait to get to the conclusion of the series and finally find out if Roland ever reached the dark tower!Unfortunately, after a few hundred pages, I became dreadfully bored. Every day I would read less and less, until eventually I just stopped reading altogether. In 2005 I tried picking it up again. To refresh my memory I started from the beginning again. I didn't even make it as far as I did in 2004 before I got bored and stopped again. 2006 rolled around, and we had a gigantic snowstorm which knocked out my power for a week. I decided it was the perfect time to try to pick up Wolves again... only to become bored even sooner than I was in 2005. 2007? Same story.Finally, 2008 rolled around and I vowed to finally complete this book. I'm a little obsessive-compulsive; once I start reading something I have to finish it before I allow myself to move onto anything else. So my inability to finish this book was driving me crazy and making me incapable of even reading any other books. This time, I decided to maybe just skip the beginning that I've read 4 times now, and start where I stopped back in 2004...Well that didn't work. I made it about 50 pages further before I got sick of it again and stopped. In 2009 and 2010 I didn't even bother attempting to read it anymore.Then 2011 comes along and I hear that Ron Howard is turning the series into films. Since I hate reading the book after watching the film (I feel it taints my interpretation of the work), I decided I'd give it one last shot; if I couldn't finish it this time, I never would, and I'd just give up on the series forever. Luckily... I finished it. I forced myself through all the boring and pointless flashbacks and palavers, and finally, finally, finally after nearly 8 years, and 6 attempts... I make it all the way to the end. Where the action of the book takes an entire 10 pages.What the. 700 pages of flashbacks, flashsideways, flashforwards, flashupsidedowns, and meaningless inconsequential dialog, for a grand total of 10 pages of plot progression. I will never be reading this book again. And now I am dreadful about reading the next two as well.King, what happened? You used to be able to capture my attention so thoroughly."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"SK did a great job with Father Callahan and the new characters of the town.

It feels just a little to pat in its execution. Things that held no significance in original novels are now cropping up in the DTS as pivotals points. Roland and his Ka-Tet are still the bomb. Susannah has developed a new skill and Eddie is getting more and more like Roland everyday. Jake finds some time to be real little boy but that is shortlived as he is thrust back into his role as a Gunslinger."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"WOLVES OF THE CALLA is my second favorite book in the Dark Tower series. Book III, the WASTELANDS, for its wildly inventive storytelling gusto, is at the top of the heap, in my view. But WOLVES OF THE CALLA, a pretty amazing tour-de-force in its own right, isn't far behind.The fifth book in King's DARK TOWER series actually works more as a literal continuation of the third book, with the fourth, WIZARD AND GLASS, serving as a long romantic interlude.WOLVES OF THE CALLA is the book that starts to give you glimpes of light at the end of tunnel. King makes some strong hints in this book about where he'll finally take the series that he's been working on all of his publishing life. It promised to be a mind-bending ride that, if executed just right, might be the most profound thing he's ever written.Either way, WOLVES OF THE CALLA is a wonderful stop along the way. It finds King very near the top of his game. King writes with an inventive assurance in this novel in a way that makes you glad to be a Stephen King reader. If the last two books of the DARK TOWER series (both due later this year) are written on the same creative cloth as this book, I'm confident it'll be a terrific ending to a terrific series.Stephen King fans rest assured, this is one of the good ones."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"this was an awesome book if you have read the other ones"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I was never much of a reader before i started reading King's works. I only read when I had to and no more. Then about 2 years ago my friend loaned me his copy of the Gunslinger. I have to say that the first version of that book started off kinda slow, and i almost lost interest. But I know this for a fact know that if you can make it to at least 50-60 pages into the book, you will be hooked. This can be compared to great stories like Lord of the Rings, and shows many simularity to it. It will suprise you at how much little details tie in to the story's whole.As far as this book goes, it's not my favorite (mine would be The Wastelands), but it brings in some of his other works and brings in some more exciting plot twists. I totally recommend this book."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This book would have been great if it was the length of the original gunslinger. it was a long, long book that seemed even longer than it was. it was actually much shorter than his last book, however the flashbacks were quite useless and added nothing to the story.lets make everyone happy and cut the whole summary chunk in the middle of the book down to about 30-40 pages, keep the intro, and keep the last 20% of the book. the whole thing could be about 300 pages of top-notch writing. instead, it's a wordy tale that does little to gain your interest.oh, and another thing, he relies on alcoholism far too much as a character flaw. it's pretty ridiculous."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Loved this portion of the story.

Whenever a new book is released I don't sleep until I am done reading it. Like I said I am a tower junkie. I am a huge fan of Wizard and Glass, even though it has little to do with the journey and more to do with Roland's the past. The Drawing of Three and The Waste Lands, by far, have the most to do with following the path of the beam. That is unarguable fact. When it comes to writing a review of this book I have debated, redebated, changed my mind in both directions and still have a tough time coming up with the right thing to say. I guess as a junkie this book gave me a fix, but left me wanting more. Wizard and Glass just stands out to me as the best pure story in the series, which Wolves of the Calla definitely was not. Don't get me wrong Wolves is a great book and I will not share any plot details because that is just unfair to future readers. This book is a must read for anyone looking to read the best series of books ever written, but I have to say that out of the five, it may be the one most lacking. The Gunslinger sets up the entire story, The Drawing of Three and The Wastelands develop the plot, Wizard and Glass is a great shot into Rolands past(and it finishes The Wastelands), but where does Wolves of the Calla fit. Maybe it will make more sense to me after I have read the final two books. I still would list this book as a must read. To all Tower Junkies it is the fix you are looking for, but if you are a Tower Junkie you have already read it at least once."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"&quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot; was okay, but I was not really moved by it. In my opinion, it suffered from the same problems as &quot;Wizard and Glass,&quot; which were too much backstory and it being too long.While I know that Stephen King can go on for a few more pages than necessary, I really think this story could've been told with a hundred or even two hundred less pages. I don't think the extra pages, or the story as a whole, really contributed to the reader knowing much more about the Dark Tower than we did in &quot;The Waste Lands,&quot; which in my opinion is the best book in the series.While I am looking forward to the next book in the series, I hope it's better than this one."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Why is this book so much more expensive than the rest of the series?

The Stand was an absolute work of genius, 'IT' was fantastic, and 'Everything's Eventual was a dare I say, gripping and eerie read.I have also forced myself through the seemingly endless pages of the Dark Tower series. While being able to stomach the books 1-3, I have had definite trouble getting through the yawns of 'Wizard and Glass', and found the same was true in 'Wolves of the Calla'.I feel that I should reiterate some of the points written in &quot;ohnjayjdp's&quot; review: the whole idea of Detroit not facing Lake Michigan and then just writing it off, using the excuse of a different universe. That idea has gotten stale and could be construed as a little lazy. Also, using the references of past stand alone books has gotten boring:maybe a fun little way of boosting sales of other books,i.e Salem's Lot, Hearts in Atlantis, and Desperation, etc.The trick's were interesting at first, but come on.

He turns to shameless self promotion of his other writings and the same digression that we see in so many of them. Instead of expanding on a truly great work in progress he tries to tie several of his other works into this story, Salem's Lot is the most obvious and does not belong. The story no longer flows well and we have 700 pages of crap to digest, hard to eat, painful to read. This book clearly does not belong in the series and is not part of the story that Steven King set out to create."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"wolves of the calla is by far the worst of the series.as mentioned by others, there is over 100 pages dedicated to father callahans past, which could have been surmised in a short paragraph.personally, i think the entire plotline of the rose in new york is superfluous. everything about our world is just a waste of ink, nothing in new york is a challenge. its just sort of a menial task they have to take care of, and as such, instantly makes the reader (such as myself) apathetic to it. if it isnt challenging to the katet, its hardly interesting. what is uninteresting should not be written at all. at least it contributes to his page quota, though. very sly, that Mr King.a minor complaint: the people of the calla dont speak with the same charm that was present in volume 4 (the &quot;aye&quot; and &quot;ye&quot; just have a way of creating atmosphere. expressions like &quot;big-big&quot;, &quot;camalla&quot;, and &quot;babbies&quot; just to give you a few examples of what has taken their place (more on this later)let me say King mentions himself no less than 3 times. read the last page before you decide to buy this. i might have rated as high as 3 stars, but this is such an atrocious error on kings part it must not go unpunished. (like i said, mr king is quite clever)you probably want to know what happens to susannahs suspected pregnancy, the pieces of maerlyns rainbow, what happened to roland after he killed his mother.. but remember, king likes to disappoint his readers, so you wont find out with any real satisfaction what happens to any of these questionseven questions about the connection of thundercap to the calla are left unanswered (who slightman was reporting to, andys programming, things of this nature). you spend hours reading, and nothing to show for it at all. this is how king hopes to get us hooked up and ready to spend more money on volume 6, since volume 5 does almost nothing to progress the story.this might sound like kings ineptitude to entertain, but you have to think: it must be damn hard to write a 700 page book, and leave the reader just as unfulfilled as when he/she picked it up.it leaves you with the feeling of impotent rage. it really does.oh yes, dont forget about the sly references and allusions to harry potter, star wars, marvel comics, charles dickens, and websters dictionary (might have been oxford, i cant remember).yes, King, we know what &quot;run&quot; means. most of us Readers can understand the written language.starting as far back as volume 3 we could tell King was relying more and more heavily on cutting and pasting ideas.its become obvious that king feels he needs to complete the series out of obligation, but he lacks the will power or imagination to deliver. oh yea, if you do decide to buy the book. tear out the pictures and burn them. they are thick and glossy, and act like giant bookmarks. so if you inadverdently flip to one, you might get ahead of yourself and ruin what little suspense there is. dont worry though, the pictures are so grotesque and inaccurate that this shouldnt be much of a problem.in case you were wondering, the front cover is supposed to be susannah. yes, i know. susannah is supposed to be black. yes, it is strange that she appears to be quite naked, but if things like that bother you, count on a migraine somewhere between the cammala crap and the abominable illustration of roland.apparently, it was decided that shoddy writing should be matched with shoddy illustrations in a package deal. we waited over 5 years, so we fans deserve at least that much"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"When I think about \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" I am reminded of fetishes and repeated rephrases that inhabit the disturbed mind. \\"Nineteen\\" is going to be one and \\"The Forbidden Planet\\" and the \\"Magnificent Seven\\" is another.

Stephen King himself will be at the top of the Dark Tower waiting for Roland, or something like that will happen making Roland realize that the world he traverses is a mishmash of fictional places and characters. How else can the series end, without the Tower itself being the focus of an anticlimax? When I thought of this, I also thought of how many silly fans would hate the idea and spend oodles of their time complaining about it. So after reading book five and its great final five pages, it looks as if my guess might come true. Of course, as soon as I start reading the reviews on Amazon, I see the initial protests of the silly fanboys. King placing himself in the series is not an act of hubris and it's not pompous, it's ka. This book is my second favorite in the series (behind The Waste Lands) and my only complaint is that there's an awful lot of buildup for such a short payoff. But the characters are why we all love this series, and their development is what makes this installment worth reading. The ending leaves hope for the potential brilliance of the last two.

I found myself often imitating Roland and rolling my fingers - &quot;Let's move along...&quot;. Seven hundred pages was a long way to go for the limited action throughout the novel. Jake shooting thrown dishes and a plate tossing competition didn't excite me to the edge of my seat. Earlier in the series the occasional parallels to our world or other worlds served to heighten the excitement of the story. Now it feels like these coincidences are becoming the foundation for the story - similar to Jostein Gaarder's &quot;Sophie's World&quot; where the world within the book serves as an introduction to philosophy.If I want philosophy I'll pick up a philosophy book.

It is also filled with surprises, including an old character from another story.

With the addition of Mia in Wolves, King continues to build upon his characters in a dazzling way. I reccommend these books to everyone but just make sure you have the free time for these some 900 pages because it sucks you in!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"With the world's most popular genre-fiction author now on the verge of self-proclaimed retirement, I'd say it is far past time for a serious re-examination of the literary status of Stephen King: specifically, the influence of his prolific oeuvre, and his eventual place in the hierarchy of the creative-bent.The Facts: King has mastered the structural patterns of the novel - the build of tension, the interweaving of multiple subplot and character, the satisfaction of climax - over the course of his forty-odd novels. But prolificacy alone does not make one great: King's genius lies in his assimilation and use of the symbols, simulacra and master-tropes of the late 20th century; and although this does *date* his work, no author can truly transcend their era or experiences: \\"write what you know.\\" Few modern authors have succeeded so well in depicting our just-past century in all its increasingly self-conscious existence: its trend-mania and buzzword fever, its silent Cold War post-trauma, the uncertain edge of information-age eruption - metaphorical monsters reflecting the deeper corruptions of the real and hyper-real.Thus, I feel that Stephen King will, in hindsight, stand among the giants of the literary arena, particular those poets and pen-prophets who devoted their talent to the description and drama of their selected period: Balzac, Dickens, Austen, Pasternak, etc. Despite some sub-par work and a penchant for the vulgar (not a negative, for the vulgar is, after all, a purely human characteristic, wholly divorced from the cold, clinical pontifications of many of this era's so-called 'serious' authors), King's undisputable canonical status of *primal influence* is practically assured on the basis of sheer print-count alone. Come Apocalypse, the few remaining literary artifacts for our consequence-blasted survivors to pick over shall, in a number's game, include the Bible, Tolkien, Rowling, and that little horror-fiction writer who could, Stephen King.For close examination of King's talent and artistic tenacity, one need look no further than *The Dark Tower*, his three-decade in the making, seven-volume sci-fi gunslingers vs. entropy saga, the unifying thread - frayed and salt-stained as it may be - that strings all of his previous work together. *The Dark Tower* is King's masterwork, his opus, the culmination of all his creative energies focused into one massive over-arching storyline. For a saga, however, the devil is in the details, and King has made no secret of the fact that he is, in effect, making it up as he goes, drawing his inspiration from certain core influences: T.S. Eliot's \\"The Waste Lands,\\" Browning's \\"Child Roland to the Dark Tower Came,\\" spagetti-western serials. I don't doubt that certain pivotal events were planned out beforehand, but the bulk of this 3000 page epic seems to have emerged intuitively, shaped from the supraconscious ether. Thus, mistakes have been made, and changes wrought mid-epic: a recent re-write has helped to rectify most of these inconsistencies and make the Dark Tower flow as a continuous, solid work rather than, in reality, a patchwork albatross that has shadowed King and his creative output for the past twenty-five years.Wolves of the Calla is both the smoothest and the most self-conscious of the Dark Tower volumes to date. Taking up the hoary 'rough-hewn heroes protect the villagers' myth-motif, the bulk of the novel builds on the underlying resistance and fear that often accompany acts of desperate bravery. Roland and company must navigate treachery amongst the townsfolk of the Calla in order to protect the township's children, half of whom are in the danger of kidnapping, brainjuice exploitation, and the subsequent retardation by the minions of the Crimson King. Worse, a different but no less dangerous treachery has formed within the feminine core of the ka-tet: Susanna has manifested a mysterious new personality, an alter-ego by the name of 'Mia' (nice, Stephen, nice) with hideous dining habits and a one-track mind about childrearing.Throughout Wotc, and especially at the end, King overtly acknowledges how 20th century icons have permeated his work, and popularized it therein: name-dropped pop-modern sigils include Harry Potter, Star Wars, Dr. Doom's tech-minions, and a not-subtle inclusion of a certain author penning a certain saga. Speculations now abound upon rumor's virtual breeding-ground: a comparison of the \\"coincidental\\" numbers prevalent throughout WotC with certain recent events in King's life gives the casual reader an insight to where this epic is heading, beyond the usual metaphysical hints and forebodings. If King does choose to complete The Dark Tower in such a manner, this saga may become the biggest mainstream-oriented post-modern joke in history... and it might even work.We shall see. And soon, thankfully. 2004 heralds both volume 6, Song of Susanna, and volume 7, The Dark Tower. What is in that room at the top? Is it empty? Or does it give us a view - a very _special_ view - of the man behind the scenes...?Rating note: I've taken one star off my rating for two reasons. Like many, I don't care for the paintings. Out of all the talented artists who could give a Dark Tower volume some true justice, King seems inexplicably content on attracting dull and/or inappropriate visualists to define his opus (Whelan was the only decent choice out of the lot). Secondly, the stream-of-conscious manner in which King has chosen to write this epic has splintered a number of flaws in the foundation; not a damaging point, given the main antagonist seems to be the force of entropy itself - however, I did not care for the constant \\"reminders\\" of what had happened in the series before. King urged virgin readers to seek book one after the opening summation: he should have left it at that and done without the needless rehash of events. Thus, four stars."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I've read all the others, and everything else SK has written, and although this book was good it was no where near as inspired as the others. It won't stop me from reading him though because although it was not the greatest or anywhere near the greatest, I still ache to know what happens next.I agree with another reviewer about the illustrations which the book would have been better without. The pictures vaguely followed the storyline, and you know who the characters were supposed to be as depicted in the illustrations, but they all fall flat as if the artist wasn't really interested and King maybe knew he needed money? The drawings were much too flat for even a really good comic. Sussanah looks absolutely nothing like a black woman... I mean, where would she be getting her hair straightened in Roland's world?, and I'm sure her character wouldn't even consider it.As for the story, the inspiration is lacking, but the mystery and tie ins with his other books and stories keep digging deeper and becoming more intertwined into one huge universe, and like it or not, good or bad I will be there at the end."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"So far, this is one of very few stories to ever captivate me.

Well, after a few years of waiting, I got another candy bar, savoring this one a bit more than the last. This story is a must read.

And while i was a bit put off by the million and one references to other works of literature and movies, etc, I know I'll be waiting for the next one for too long, probably building it up too high in my head, because this fifth book has again managed to be more intrigueing than the last."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I've just finished &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot; and I have to say I loved the book. I have read soooo many negative reviews here and I find that a shame. Maybe those who reviewed this book with less than two stars had different expectations, but please enjoy the book for what it is, which is, I feel, a sort of bridge to the next installment. Maybe &quot;Wolves&quot; doesn't get our ka-tet any closer to the tower, but it does develop the characters further and lets us know how fundamentally they've changed since joining up with Roland. This story in and of itself is beautifully written.

However, since then I have been reminded of why I don't read too much Stephen King anymore. When King is original, he usually weaves brilliant spine-tingling masterpieces. When he rehashes stuff, his novels are excruciatingly laborious and just plain dull.Do we really need a two page side-story metaphor for an ultimately trivial moment in the story. It would be one thing if these lengthy side-story metaphors in some way advanced the plot or contribute to the resolution, but the book is full of these and they just waste my time, even taking away from the rest of the story's momentum.And has Mr. King just plain lost his imagination? The plot was stolen from Seven Samurai (Magnificent Seven), characters were taken from some of his other novels (Salem's Lot), imagery from Marvel Comics and Star Wars...even HARRY FRICKIN POTTER gets plagiarized in this one! What will I find in book 6? Pokemon??? Frodo the Hobbit?? Michael Jackson??? Let me guess, their ka-tet picks up a magic talking sponge that wears pants. Yeah, thats original.I'm committed to finishing out the series but I wasted valuable time the past two days reading this one."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Most of the reviewers are right on. I cannot imagine anyone being able to stomach this unless they read the first four.I feel kind of mad that I'm hooked on this. I wish I would have read this one first. I probably would have avoided the previous four and not gotten hooked. As it stands now, I will have to force myself to finish the journey and read 1,500 more pages of this drivel.The dialect of the Calla people is beyond annoying.The smartass tone that is typical of the one or two other King books I read outside of this series could not be more grating in this effort. It sounds like all four of the ka-tet are Larry from The Stand. Terms such as \\"The Chap\\" and \\"Sug\\" REALLY get on my nerves.To boil it down, it feels that King didn't put a lot of heart into this. It has a first draft feel. I may feel different after I finish VII, but right now, I feel used."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Stephen King, Wolves of the Calla (Grant, 2003)I have been of the tacit understanding, over the past two decades, that when Stephen King uncorked the typewriter for the first Dark Tower story, he had an idea of where he was going to go with the series. Granted, as we all know, this runs counter to everything King has ever said in interviews about how he writes, but this is an epic series, one he had no idea how long it would be when he started. You don't go into something like that without planning.Well, okay, maybe you do if you're Stephen King. Wolves of the Calla was definitely not in the cards when he wrote the first story. There's too much in here that smacks of obvious attempts to tie in things that have come in between (and hints of tying in other stuff, as well).Wolves of the Calla continues the adventures of Roland and co., slipping back and forth between Mid-World and our world at three different times. Roland, Eddie, Susannah, Jake, and Oy are on the border between Mid-World and Out-World, about to cross over, when they're approached by a priest from the small town of Calla Bryn Sturgis. The Calla has a problem; every twenty-three years or so, it's raided by masked riders called Wolves, who take one child from every pair of twins between the ages of three and fourteen. (Giving birth to twins is the norm in Calla Bryn Sturgis.) The priest asks Roland and friends to help with the problem of the wolves, and thus a novel is born. Along with this come subplots involving pieces of the other books (Black Thirteen from Wizard and Glass, the vacant lot in New York containing the rose from The Drawing of the Three, etc.). King is beginning the long process of tying it all together. There are even hints of the Low Men in Yellow Coats, the brimstone-filled alternate world from Black House, and various other ties to the other books that touch on the series. (The \\"other works by\\" page at the beginning finally gives us the comprehensive list of which books are Tower-related and which aren't.)I had read all the reviews and knew all the spoilers beforehand, and honestly I walked into this expecting a major disappointment. What I had forgotten is the sheer delight in reading Stephen King's prose, which is as strong as always. When he's talking about nothing, which is often, or going off on a tangent, which is even more often, the prose itself is so simply readable that getting through the book's seven-hundred-plus pages is a pleasure. He never fails to tie in the more odd elements of life in Mid-World to something we earthbound humans can understand, giving us a much clearer picture of what's going on than we might have had otherwise.And yes, the ending is a pain. No surprise there, if you've read any spoilers about the novel. But there's enough there to keep going, especially if you've got twenty years invested in the Tower already, as most people reading this review already do. We'll keep following the Path of the Beam wherever it leads us till the bitter end. (Which, after twenty years, is finally in sight.) ***"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"After getting through &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot; five years ago, I was very worried that the Dark Tower series was heading right down the toilet. While not horrible, Roland's flashback takes up far too much time and progresses us forward very little. The story was necissary, but the point is obvious almsot from the very begining and wastes too much time with Steve's (at the low point of his career - it took a car accident to smash him back to his former glory) very lackluster writing. But here comes &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot; which I had been anticipating/dreading for a few years now. Boy was I wrong to ever doubt you, Mr. King, you've put your epic right back on the map with a BANG! As hard as it was to wait seven years after reading &quot;The Waste Lands&quot; and its cliffhanger ending, I don't know how I'm going to make it through the next six months waiting for &quot;Song Of Susannah&quot; So many questions are floating around in my head, brought up by this wonderful book. What is Nineteen? Where did Mia go? What is the connection between &quot;Calla&quot; &quot;Callahan&quot; &quot;Calvin&quot; etc. How is the ending of this book going to fit into the next two? I can't wait.

So Stephen King puts himself in the book. It doesn't take away from the story one iota. And two: yeah, ok, so it's long. What Stephen King book isn't? Some say it was the worse of the whole series. Excuse me? The Gunslinger (Book one) put me to sleep. The only reason I read it is because I actually started the series with &quot;The Drawing of the Three.&quot; And if you don't read the first book, &quot;The Wastelands&quot; makes little sense.

Finli o' Tego?&quot;"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Ok, if your a fan of the Gunslinger novels you realize how King relates the majority of his books to this series. It's actually kinda sick how over a 30 year career King can interelate the majority of his books to this series. (Being a Gunsliner fan but not a King fan as a whole, I'll tell you that this book makes me waht to read 2 or 3 King books from the past due to the interconnections)While this book is extremely limited in it's storlyine it is an EXCELLENT story that continues the gunslinger experience and does a tremendous job of foreshawdowing the future. By the end of the book you realize that Roland and the gang are inches away from the Dark Tower in the entire scheme.The only problem is that until this point, the series has taken too long to develop and King is a little behind in the times. He makes current pop culture references in each novel, but it seems to be for shock value/coolness/relativity instead of fitting the era of the past novels here. The Gunslinger began about 10-15 years ago and stays with the eras introduced there (which is great to keep the storyline) but at the same time King tries to include recent literature phenomenom that doesn't fit the bill. (sorry, when a series takes this long to be published it's hard to keep with the times and King incorporates technology that was cutting edge in book 3 but is now lame in book 5 but at the same time appears to have made last second changes to incorporate modern culture) It's great, but at the same time unfortunate, that a series that in the end will define KING, took too many years to finish and when he releases the last 3 out of 7 books in the series, over a year and a half makes (KING says the 6th and final book will be realesed next year) the first 4 books dated and the last 3 books (assuming the last two hit on current tech and lit) vastly different. Regardless, KING sticks to the original beauty of all the characters and &quot;The Wolves of the Calla&quot; makes you want to re-read the entire series.

It's the Ka tet that keeps me enthralled. This book doesn't disappoint in this aspect. It is always good to be among these friends that I have grown to love through out this series.Only complaint that I would give this book is that it does start to have a been there done that feel.

For every step forward you take, its like taking two steps backwards. Book 5 and where is my Tower? Sigh.Not my favorite entry in the Dark Tower series. In Wolves of the Calla, the Ka-tet takes a detour to Calla Sturgis, home of such zingers as thankee, big big, which we get to hear repeated umpteenth million times over the course of the book. I don't think it's a nitpick because it happens sooo many times. But, esentially, Calla is a detour by the gang to save a town of people from an invasion of deadly, brainsucking wolves that ride in to snag away the wee ones and bring them back as giant, blundering idiots. (I swear, I couldn't make it up if I tried.)I would give this book 5 stars without the constant thankee-big bigs peppering every chapter, but I just really want King to make progress at getting to the Dark Tower, and I felt this book was too long not to have made nary a step towards the goal. Not that Calla Sturgis wasn't pretty interesting, but I felt like there was a whole lot of time spent there.Despite being a very long sidetrip, I admit that it was successful in its buildup to the ultimate shootout, Tet and town versus wolves.(Something that was mildly annoying was the identity of the wolves, which is a bit comic bookish. Also, I didn't think he needed to use Sneethces from Harry Potter as weapons, as Stephen King is so much more creative than that!) Definately some good old, John Wayne, spaghetti western action going on there however, albeit in a sort of supernatural, otherworldly sort of way. Also, I enjoyed Roland's little dance performed for the Calla people immensely. (Comalla Commalla, rice and beans, say commalla!) I was humming along with the lyrics for a week afterwards, and it's flashing back to me now as I write this. I have such a clear image of Roland doing that dance. There's some nice character development for our Ka-tet here too. Little Jakie is really growing up, going through numerous trials and stress. I felt bad for him. Also, Roland's beginning to feel the weight of the years, proving that, yes, the gunslinger is human too.Enjoyable sidestep on the journey, though I'm getting antsy for the tower!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Some people have marked this as the beginning of a downturn in the series.

There are a ton of small plot holes here, and quite a few things that happen are pretty convenient. King tries to create suspense by hiding the main characters' knowledge from the reader for hundreds of pages. But this is just tiresome and amateurish.This book takes about five hundred pages to get going. It's bogged down by a large amount of back-story and general farting around, much of this having to do with the homoerotic vagabond adventures of Father Callahan, who makes his first appearance since \`Salem's Lot, the second book King ever published. And Callahan is written inconsistently. He really doesn't believe in God much, if at all, yet he staunchly holds to Catholic positions (seemingly for no other reason than the sake of the plot).King continues his highly derivative, winking-at-the-reader \\"homages\\" to various other sources: this time it's Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvel Comics, and even King himself. When you combine these (Doctor Doom in the wilderness with the lightsaber and the exploding Harry Potter ball - it sounds like ridiculous Clue), the effect is exponentially worse.If this were a stand-alone novel, there would be no compelling reason to read it. Unfortunately those committed to reading the Dark Tower series through don't have a choice."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Wolves of the Calla was the true beginning of the end for the series in not only the fact it was the first of the last three but also it was a major dip in quality. It seems very forced. It is also very short in comparison to the earlier books in the series."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"It took a long time but it was worth the wait and in hard cover too. This book picks up the story quickly and I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Long-time King fans like myself have eagerly awaited this sequel for many years, and for the most part, the master storyteller does not disappoint. After focusing on Roland's past in the previous installment, Wizard and Glass, in Wolves of the Calla, King returns to the present-day challenges facing Roland and his companions, Eddie, Susannah, Jake, and Oy. Much like in The Wastelands (the third book of the series), Wolves of the Calla tells the story not only of the ongoing quest for the Dark Tower but also of a more immediate predicament--in this case, the plight of the town of Calla Byrn Sturgis. King tantalizes the reader through brief returns to the New York City setting as well as glimpses of the tasks which lie ahead of the gunslingers in the future. In addition, dedicated King followers will appreciate the tie-ins with other King works, namely 'Salem's Lot. Although not quite as captivating as the second two books in the series, Wolves of the Calla is a satisfying continuation of this fascinating saga which will whet the reader's appetite for the two remaining Dark Tower novels, both of which are scheduled to be published in 2004."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Even though, as a mother of a 3 year old and a 1 year old - I value sleep more than gold - I gave up many hours of slumber to read this book. I listened to Books 1-4 on tape - this was the first Dark Tower book I actually READ - and I loved it.I assume that's partly because I found Book 4 to be an absolute SNORE (can anyone say backstory - dull and unnecessary backstory), but this book was riveting. Sure - it was plot driven - but that's exactly what I wanted! The characters of Roland, Eddie, Susannah and Jake are so different and interesting - and then to add a character from another Stephen King book - I was in heaven! (Won't tell you which book but you'd NEVER expect it.) And then his use of that book at the end - oh man - the worst thing about the book was getting to the end and realizing that I'd have to wait for #6!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Wolves of the Calla was an excellent addition to the DT saga. And, like some of the reviewers here, I am shocked at the reasoning behind some of the bad reviews. Most notably, the issue of the author's self-insertion. (Especially in the novel's ending)I don't want to give away too much here, but this very issue is the HEART of the Dark Tower quest. The clues are there (in other Stephen King books, in interviews, and ESPECIALLY in parts of Wolves of the Calla).Ask yourself this... Who is the &quot;Crimson&quot; King? Why is the Dark Tower's upper room supposed to be empty? And if it ISN'T empty, who do you suppose is there? Also, check out the Stephen King short story from Nightmares and Dreamscapes about the Raymond Chandler-type detective who one day meets his &quot;maker&quot;.I think criticism of &quot;Wolves's&quot; plot twist should be saved til the last DT book is out. If you don't like how things went down, then fine. But just wait it out. It might just be something unexpected and great."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I was concerned that King would lose the style he used in the previous Dark Tower books, but it seems that that is not the case. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as I have the previous four, and am pleased to say that it was right on par with what I hoped for and expected. I feel that he picked right up where he had left the story previously, and filled the book with the characteristic drama of the gunslingers, coupled with just enough humor. I can't wait for the next book in the series!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"The charachters in this book are really brought to life, this includes many new characters and then of course the gunslingers themselves. Oy takes a C3PO-like entertainment position in this book. In ways this book tells four stories. One story is about susanna, one story is about a new character called Callahan, one story is about the wolves that the book is named after, and finally the larger story of the journey to the Rose. The way he wrote the book was to mix the four so that you had to keep reading to get to the book's resolution of them. It is deffinetly a page turner.Without the epilogue the book is easily four smileys/stars. I wasn't to found of the epilogue, mostly because it is about Salem's Lot. I have no interest in Salem's Lot and hope the final books in the series will not go into further depth about his older book. Since this only became blatently noticeable, and thus annoying, in the epilogue I can't hold it against the book."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Wolves of the Calla is, in a word, outstanding, both as a stand alone novel, and as the fifth book in the Dark Tower series. I'll try to express my opinions of the book without spoiling the book for anyone who hasn't read it yet (I hate it when people do that).I loved the character development in this book. We finally see what being a gunslinger really means and Roland, Eddie, Sue and Jake really live up to the title in a gripping ending. The old style Western feel of the book (with a few differences) really appealed to me also. King has created a world where things are almost normal, with subtle and some not-so-subtle differences that make this book my favourite of the series. I could write a lot more but I'd probably give too much away.And look out for characters from King's other books (I just love the way he interweaves different stories). Read this book; you will not be disappointed, and keep an eye out for his next in the series, which I hope will be out soon."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I started reading DT when there were just two of them. Since then I have waited years for new DT books, waited with frustration at times. So now DT 5 comes out and I purchase it right away. Less than a week later I am finished and ready for the next one. But first I would like to list just a few things I found lacking in this edition, not all of them among the hashed and rehashed reviews before this one.First of all, as the book got closer and closer to the end I kept asking myself when the wolves would arrive. I couldn't believe how little is dedicated to the wolves. And when the do finally arrive it is over way too quickly. I asked myself &quot;Is that it?&quot; when it was finished.Father Callahan's back story was interesting, especially when compared to the adventures of Ralph Roberts in &quot;Insomnia&quot;. But it was a little long at times. It needed to be there but not in such excess.I have no problems with Stephen putting himself in the series. That has been rumored since around the time DT II came out. At the time I didn't think much of the rumor but now I see it just might be so. I'm still waiting for an appearance of Jack Sawyer, the kid at the end of &quot;Insomnia&quot; (I forget his name), Speedy Parker, Dinky Burnshaw (&quot;Everything's Eventual&quot; King said he was a part of the series), Pennywise the Clown (He dies in &quot;IT&quot;, but mention must be made that in &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; someone seems to think that he is not dead after all), Brautigan (He's free again according to &quot;Bleak House&quot; but that doesn't mean he's in our world. He might be in New York '77, who knows), and maybe even the little bald doctors featured so oddly in &quot;Insomnia&quot;.DT 5 isn't the best of the lot (I give that honor to &quot;Drawing of the Three&quot; although &quot;Gunslinger Revised&quot; comes close), but it's not the worst. After &quot;The Wastelands&quot; I was sick and tired of cliff hangers in this series so the ending was kind of frustrating but at least I won't have seven darned years to wait for the resolution of this one. If anyone wants to comment on this review, e-mail me at Tyladeena007@aol.com. Title the e-mail, Dark Tower, and I'll be sure to read it and respond in return. Thanx, Tyler."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"As a bona fide King junkie, I can tell all DT fans that they are going to enjoy this latest edition. That being said, you really have to wonder how SK is going to pull everything together in just two more volumes. The latest version returns us from Roland's youth (DT4: Wizard and Glass) and back into the present storyline, with the gang coming across an old Western-style town similar to that of the River Crossing (from DT3: The Wastelands). Confronted with a crisis in the town--and another one in a version of New York with the Rose--the gunslinger gang meets up with a past character from 'Salem's Lot to battle past and present evil. Pretty damn compelling, especially if you enjoyed Father Callahan from Salem's Lot, one of King's great fallen heroes! This installment promted me to go back and read the entire series. Can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"What can possibly be said about this book that every Stephen King fan doesn't already know. You could talk about this book or any other book written by Stephen King every day of the week and either you are a Stephen King fan or you're not. This book comes out of the mind of a real King of writing and only the mind of Stephen King could bring you a book like this one. Once you pick up any of Stephen Kings books you just can't put them down, your mind turns into a movie screen and with the talent of Stephen King you live the story through his eyes as if you too lived within the dark tower of the Stephen King mind. The book is a must read and if you are a King fan know one needs to say more."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"For the first time, a Dark Tower book FEELS as though it's part of a series, probably due to King writing the last three at one stretch. And I think I'm getting an inkling of where he's going with this, as he introduces himself as a character (as yet unseen) near the end of the book. It makes perfect sense, after all. King is the creator of the world of the Dark Tower, and all the other worlds bound to it, so it wouldn't surprise me a bit if he's the one sitting up there in the top level. From another author, this would seem a lame device, but assuming I'm right about this, I'll bet King can pull it off. Can't wait to see how he portrays himself!The only downside? Bernie Wrightson's illustrations are easily the worst of any book in the series. The guy is overrated."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Much time was spent waiting for the tale to resume, and I must say I was mostly disappointed with the result. The end of part five was pretty strong, but it took way too long to get going.WIthout giving away the book for those that have not yet had the chance to read it, it seems King put this in as a throwaway book in the series. The story goes off on a side road that I am not sure we needed to follow."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I have been into the Dark Tower books from the start. They have been with me from college thru fatherhood, almost like my own saga. Ka. Any way King had the magic for these books for a long time, did he get bored along the way, sure, I did too sometimes. Wizard and Glass was hard work to read. Most of Kings work is from his own experience's and life. I am sure you all have read Bag of Bones. Somewhere in Boston or New York or maybe even Bangor there is a safety deposit box."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I wasn't sure about the Dark Tower series when I began reading it years ago. The first book, &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; seemed to be a little slow-paced and it took me a while to get into it. However, because it was Stephen King, I pushed on and finished that first book. After that, there was no looking back!The books that followed sucked me right in immediately. It's definitely a series that you will lose yourself in. I had a hard time picking up any other books after finishing &quot;Wolves&quot; because I didn't want it to end.I would highly suggest reading the series from the start before reading this book. You will be doing yourself a great disservice by starting with Wolves. The backstory on all the characters is important, and you will not regret doing it this way.This is Stephen King's masterpiece epic, and it could stand against any other famous series (Lord of the Rings anyone?). I'm convinced this will be required reading someday."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Yes, Stephen King has done it again! He has provided us with another gripping, incredible book. This book is so wonderful, it is hard to put down. I read the entire novel in 3 days..and then, I was wanting more! I can not wait until the next novel in this series. I was not the least bit disturbed by Stephen King showing up in the novel, at the end. Although, I hope that he does not become a main character in the next novel. I also hope that the characters stay &quot;real&quot; and are not the product of Stephen King's character's imagination. Now, THAT would be disappointing.If anyone has any hesitation about buying this book, don't hesitate BUT I strongly suggest that you buy and read the other books in this series, starting from the beginning. If you don't, you will be confused.I am a hopeless Dark Tower junkie! If you start reading this series, chances are you will be too! I am definately following along the path of the beam to the very end. I wonder where King will take us?"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Oops! You were expecting the end of the series! Sorry, this is only book FIVE out of SEVEN, so don't get upset that the story doesn't \\"go anywhere\\".This book was great, no, not as a stand-alone, but as a part of the epic quest of Roland of Gilead and his ka-tet. For you Tower Junkies and Constant Readers out there, if you haven't read this book, stop whatever you're doing and buy it (you're already on Amazon.com, how easy could it be) and express ship that puppy straight to your house.The story gives a lot of good information that we've been waiting to hear. Okay, that I've been waiting to hear. But, I think I represent most of humanity. Except women. And the intellegent crowd. I digress.There are a lot of throwbacks to the Great Old Ones, which are always welcome, there is a good tidbit (that might make you cry) about Cuthbert and the battle at Jericho Hill, and the lead-ins to the next two books don't stop, with The Stephen setting up our gunslingers mosey into Thunderclap, their battle against Legion, and their imminent soire to Out-World.And if you are a sadomasochist you'll love this book, that is to say that our band of pals has a few new problems to deal with. Like Susannah pulling a Ripley and Roland pulling a The-Guy-From-The-Ben-Gay-Commercials. How exciting!Stephen King delivers a great story, neverminding the inane (not insane) linguistic quirks of the locals (say thankya), and an ending that's going to leave you with a case of the What-the-Hecks. This book is a great vehicle for the story, and will leave you with the inevitable feeling of worthlessness that comes with not having any more pages to read until the next one comes out. Go get it. Go. Go now."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"If you've read the other four &quot;Dark Tower&quot; books, this is pretty much a must-have. If you intend to read this one, the other four are pretty much a must-read. That being said, I think this is the best one since &quot;The Drawing Of The Three.&quot; Only two more to go in the &quot;Tower&quot; series, and this installment is a terrific chapter of the decades old story."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"WOW! That's my first reaction. I just finished voraciously reading number five in this series. I read the first four in preparation. As always, it's not typical Stephen King, but its style is consistent with the rest of The Dark Tower series. I love how snatches of his other works weave in and out of these stories, it makes me want to re-read everything he's written looking for other clues (like in Hearts in Atlantis, where we meet the low men).I have been holding my breath for King to finish this series, as he wrote in the early novels that it may never happen because he was only able to write about Roland when the story would surface again in his mind. I am thrilled to know that the final two will be within my grasp this year.I was surprised that the entire volume contained only their adventures in Calla Bryn Sturgis, but have realized it was necessary for the story to come alive in full detail, the way it deserves to be told. This is not a story that can be read independently. A review of King's 'Salem's Lot wouldn't hurt either. Read and enjoy (but be prepared to be drawn into the story)!...the Dark Tower is ever closermel"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Few authors can instill a sense of awe and wonder within their audience especially in a series, sometimes the author writes to quickly and the series begins to lose its power (Wheel of time) and sometimes the author just keeps putting out the same material but changing the names and faces (Shannara Series). However, King's DT series remains invigorating and interesting to say the least and is a testament to Kings skill as a writer. I have read many comments on how the climax of the final battle with the wolves was too short, but King stays true, the DT series is not focused on battling the wolves but on reaching the Dark Tower, the battle is one tiny step in a great journey and who could forget Roland's quote &quot;five minutes of blood and stupidity.&quot;Wolves of the Calla is an excellent edition to the DT series and after I read it I was inspired to write my very own series, look for it appearing soon..NOT! Anyways King continues to impress me, and remember no one is a flawless writer, least of the the reviewer. ONWARD TO THE DARK TOWER..."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I liked this book but I had issues with it. For example, I have no problem with Father Callahan being involved in the final push, I just didn't care about his character enough for the incredibly long flashback story. Also, the end battle was over way too quickly and easily. Totally anticlimatic. I don't know what King is planning but I do hope his intention is not to write himself into the story in any significant way. However, I'm concerned that IS where he's going because of the strong emphasis on the numbers &quot;19&quot; and &quot;99&quot;. I haven't seen anyone else mention it so I'm bringing it up: 1999 is the year that King was hit by the truck while he was out walking. I don't think its a coincidence that 1999 is obviously where Susannah/Mia took off too and where the remaining ka-tet undoubtedly will follow her. But whatever, I'm in this until the end. I just hope my tears when its over aren't out of frustration and anger because I love King and this series!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"Farther along the path of the Beam is a smallish town called Calla Bryn Sturgis. It hovers at the edge of Mid-World, the final step along the road to End-World, and so to the Dark Tower. It is a farming community, the people grow rice and corn there.And once every generation, the Wolves come to steal their children.It is to this place that Roland and his band of gunslingers have come. To some, they are a welcome salvation... to others, a dangerous change from the way things are. In Calla Bryn Sturgis they meet many memorable new characters, and at least one that we may recognize from an even older story. As the story progresses, Roland will dance, Jake will make a new friend, a new life grows within Susannah, and the bond of ka-tet is threatened even as it gains a new member.\\"Wolves of the Calla\\" continues King's tale of Roland's quest for the Dark Tower by strengthening the bonds between characters and offering up tantalizing new hints to what is to come. King's gift for portraying ordinary people in extraordinary situations is as strong as it ever was in this book, but what sets the \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" apart from King's other recent work is the power and breadth of his vision. King is telling an ambitious tale here, and this part of it is full of nobility, courage, and above all, simple human frailty.The Dark Tower series is shaping up to be Stephen King's broadest tale in scope. The last 20 pages of \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" yield at least a couple serious shocks that may leave the reader wondering about what they've just read, and anxious to read it over again to pick up details they might have missed. But of course, like any skilled writer, King also leaves the reader wanting more. In a good way. In the best way.If I'm right about where King is going with this long tale, the ending should be absolutely astounding. Even if I'm wrong, however, the rest of the story should be interesting, at the very least."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"There're plenty of reviews on this story but I have to wtite and tell you how terrible the \\"new\\" format from Pocket Books is to me. I just purchased books 5,6,and 7 in the series( which I love) Pocket Books raised the price $2 and made it narrower and taller. It no longer matches the previous books of the series (or much of anything else for that matter-please readjust your shelves) but worse, the new dimensions are unwieldy in the hand when reading. Did the people at Pocket Books not pick up this new format and try to read from it before putting it to market? I'm heading out to the used bookstore to try and find these last three in the standard size and then Amazon will get these three back. $30 for an uncomfortable reading experience? I don't think so."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"With The Wolves of Calla, Stephen King continues his Dark Tower epic, the one story he's been working on since the beginning of his career (as a matter of fact, his WHOLE body of work seems to have been crafted with the series in mind). And the good news is, the book is great. Amazing even. The sad news is, this book only means that the end of the series is coming soon. Too soon.In Wolves of the Calla, we find Roland, Jake, Susan and Eddie continuing their trek following the events at the end of Wizard and Glass. Their journey brings them to the town of Calla. The citizens of the Calla are looking for help; every twenty years or so, wolf-like creatures come into the town and steal many of the children. When they are returned, the children come back brain dead and completely empty. Now that they've learn the wolves will soon be coming, they ask Roland and his ka-tet for help and protection.It is in Calla that they encounter Father Callahan, a character that was first featured in King's Salem's Lot. The Father joins them in their misison and gives them a very useful but dangerous tool that will help them travel through the different worlds. This tool comes in handy when they realize they will have to go back to New York circa 1976 to protect the rose that stands on that empty lot, a rose that could in fact be the tower itself.Full of imagination and great wit, Wolves of the Calla shows that King hasn't lost his touch. The book is rich in ideas, and borrows freely from pop culture; Harry Potter, Star Wars, DC Comics, The Wizard of Oz and Stephen King himself are all featured prominently in the novel. All of it only makes this book greater than it already is. The pacing is quick, the writing tight, and the story very suspenseful. There is never a dull moment in Wolves (the parts where Father Callahan recalls his story might very well be some of King's finest writing).This installment in the Dark Tower series will not disappoint. It can easily be read as a sole effort, but will be better understood as a part of this amazing ongoing series. I can't wait to read the next installment, but dread the day when I will turn the last page of the last Dark Tower book. That might very well be the saddest moment of my life."},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"This is one series that I hope never ends, although I know, because Mr. King has stated, that there are only two more books to go until we reach the Dark Tower. I've read all of Mr. King's works, since I chanced upon his first by accident when it was first published. The books have grown in length, and often they cry out for some editing, but this series could be twice as long, and I would have no complaints about length. It's great to get wrapped up in another type of world, and to see how many of the author's books blend into the story line of the Tower. When a new Gunslinger book comes out, I just open the cover, and go along for the ride with Roland, Eddie, Suzannah, Jake and Oy!"},{"Title":"Wolves of the Calla: Dark Tower V","review":"I am a big fan of the Dark Tower series but this book really stumbles from start to finish. The 1st 3 books in the series closely followed the progress of the gunslingers and advanced the story at an entertaining pace (\\"The Waste Lands\\" being the best of those). Then came \\"Wizard and Glass\\" which did nothing for the series as it was a 600+ page tangent into a back story that really slogged on and on. While I'm sure that King will reference the specifics of that story mercilessly, it slowed down the amazing pace of the story of the quest for the Dark Tower.And now we have \\"The Wolves of Calla\\" which brings the whole thing to a screeching halt. This book could be a stand-alone story in itself because it bears little resemblance to the other Dark Tower novels (except for the characters). While this could be a good approach for a 7-novel series in order to keep things fresh, King piles on many of the worst attributes of his writing style that make this story very irritating. The novel's characters talk in the very annoying Calla dialect from start to finish, and I had trouble believing that the main characters would so completely change their way of speaking (\\"thankya big-big!\\") in a matter of a few days. The ridiculous portrayal of Eddie Dean's \\"mean-streets\\", New York-guy attitude is really cranked up here, and I just wanted to skip all passages involving him. Susannah and Jake are fairly interesting in this book because their personal stories do in fact advance. The Father Callahan story is utterly preposterous and whole-heartedly uninteresting. I didn't personally find that subplot to be too long, just not very good. Since this book is nothing but a subplot, I guess that Callahan's story is a subplot within a subplot. Viola! A new literary genre is born!It sometimes seems like, while writing, Stephen King commits to paper the first thing that comes to his mind, which eventually makes it into the final published version. Certain things that he writes make no sense, and he often hints that some items will be explained later but they never are. In my opinion, \\"The Wolves of Calla\\" is by far the worst in the series. I will read them all, but I really hope that the next one is better.A couple of other quick observations...* Stephen King has said in many interviews that this series will be \\"over 10,000 pages long\\". For 7 books that is about 1428 pages each on the average. Since the 1st 5 total about 3000 pages, I can only conclude that the last 2 books will each be 3500 pages in length.* Detroit does not border Lake Michigan. But the cop-out explanation is that it DOES border Lake Michigan in one of King's 18 million universes!* Does it seem like he is struggling very hard to connect this series to many of his past stand-alone books? I don't know if anyone agrees with me, but that approach is really robbing the magic away from these older books by over-explaining.* My predictions -- Cujo and Gage Creed are characters in book 6. Jack Torrance makes an appearance by book#7!(That's good because I've been wondering what Cujo has been up to lately).* Did you buy the 1st four illustrated volumes in the large softcover versions like I did (about $15 each)? Now they switch to a $27 hardcover and aren't selling the softcovers to go with the rest of the collection. Of course, you can now BUY the older books in the hardcover.
