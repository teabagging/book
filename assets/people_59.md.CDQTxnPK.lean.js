No stress, just buy this book and read it softly.I read the book. Learnt all things said in it. used em as principles. quickly changed my views about it the third or the fourth time I read it. First, I thought it was only a fairy tale with a lot of magic and the regular &quot;They lived happily ever after&quot;. Then, I concentrated much more on the stuff the people said. I was just amazed! I never get tired of reading it.To be able to enjoy it fully, you'll have while reading to have the same mentality as yours when you were a young person. You must see the elephant eaten by the snake, not the hat. Just let the book mate you, like the fox would do.If I may make a comment in French, my native language :Ce livre est d'une telle richesse, qu'on dirait qu'il &eacute;mane son histoire &agrave; travers les pages. Plus on avance au cours de l'histoire, plus on se rend compte &agrave; quel point ce r&eacute;cit pour enfants est le fruit de nombreuses ann&eacute;es de pens&eacute;es solitaires et d'&eacute;tude des principes de la vie de la part de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry. Plus vous le lirez, plus vous serez convaincu que toute la v&eacute;rit&eacute; s'y cache. Ce n'est pas un bouquin &agrave; feuilleter, vous savez, juste pour voir le chapeau. Non, il faut que vous soyez attentifs et capable de comprendre que l'&eacute;l&eacute;phant est entour&eacute; par le serpent boa. Il faut que vous vous transportiez dans l'histoire, et que vous r&eacute;&eacute;pousiez la mentalit&eacute; de jeune personne qui vous a jadis si bien repr&eacute;sent&eacute;, et qui, j'en suis sur, vous repr&eacute;sente toujours aussi bien.Laissez donc ce livre, comme le renard, vous apprivoiser jusqu'&agrave; ce que vous ne puissiez vous en s&eacute;parer.

The French actors reading the various parts use expression and make the story come alive. They read fast but it is fun to read along with them and hear the correct pronunciation of the words if you already own a copy of the book in French. It is inspiring to hear such confident native speakers. I think this is an excellent learning tool for studying and learning French. If you are a beginning or intermediate student of French, you will know most of the vocabulary but may not how to say the words in seamless sentences like this. After hearing this read a few times, I think you will have learned the French pronunciation and want to hear other French stories on CD as it is much more entertaining to hear the story than just reading the story by yourself. I ordered this CD from the Librairie Franaise in New York and got really fast personal service. The agent walked my order to the post office the same day as my order and I got it the next day."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"The book itself is beautiful, and you're willing to pay the price because of the audio CD purportedly included; forget it, then, because i've ordered the book twice, had it delivered twice, and neither delivery included the promised audio CD.

Having read the book as a child (in English, of course), I can rant and rave about the storyline, the message, the fact that it can be enjoyed on different levels by children and adults.What stands out to me about this version is that it's in the original French, and what seemed bizzare in English works well in the author's native tongue. This is one of the best books ever written, and if the option exists, reading it in French would be the best option."},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"I have the French copy of &quot;Le Petit Prince&quot; and have been using it to improve my vocabulary. I was disappointed to find out after receiving this audio tape that it is only 40 minutes long, and thus quite a bit of the text is cut out. Roughly the original text is 15,000 words and the transcription (included with the tape) is under 6,000 words. I understand that the use of different voices for different characters can replace some descriptive phrases, but entire dialogs are missing, and some are changed. For example, when the Prince first asks for the drawing of a sheep, the pilot draws a picture of an elephant inside a boa constrictor (which had baffled his parents when he was young) and the Prince immediately recognizes it. This was one of the funniest parts, but it is left out.The voices are fine, sometimes a bit fast for a beginner, and the music is nice.

Le Collier had simple grammar (it was made for young French readers), and La Loi was simple as well. But, the vocabulary and grammar in this book was just right for pushing me forward with my French.The story itself is short but revealing, and makes the reader reflect on his own life.

What we do not understand is that life is full of those things we are looking for and they can be found anywhere from the ant on our sugar to the sun who no matter what is shinning for us everyday.

I, in turn, recommended Le Petit Prince, which can be read in an hour and is far less taxing on the brain.If you have already perfected the simple way of life put forth in this book, then you have every right to condemn my previous statement- but I don't think that very many people have attained that level of &quot;Zen&quot;- or whatever you want to call it.A l'elite restreinte"},{"Title":"Le Petit Prince","review":"This version did not work with my Mirriam-Webster's French-English dictionary on my kindle.

As an example, on page 49, the author advises us the MBT's had been reworked to allow them to run on diesel, gasoline or aviation fuel. Hmm, not real sure I would want to be in the vehicle with 22-1 compression ratio needed to run diesel fuel, when avgas was dumped in. Pieces of your vehicle the size of your fist would be found in the next county. You....would be vaporized.He also discusses his Air Force which is made up of P-51 Mustangs. Let's get real here, North American Aviation's Mustangs were the finest of the last prop-driven fighters, but that would have been 7 decades before Raines' time.Movements of large armored formation just doesn't seem real in a world of very limited manufacturing of fuel and material'.But in his defense, Johnstone keeps the action going for a fast-paced survivalist novel.

The author did a great job detailing the details of Hope's career, specifically his work with the USO and his work in film. Faith also did a great job in detailing Hope's early career on the road working for next to nothing in small comedy clubs.My biggest hangup with the book is Faith didn't detail or analyze Hope's personal relations to the degree he should have. Infedility in his marriage and strain with his four adopted children are often referenced but there is no real in depth analysis of how this effected Hope. There is also no judgement passed which suggests to me that Faith may have been too close to Hope personally and didn't want to pass judgement while Hope was still alive.The biggest shortcoming in the book was Faith's lack of commitment when it came to Hope's philandering. It was suggested that Hope wasn't unfaithful to Delores throughout the book and that Delores didn't mind but just how wide spread was it and who was it with. There was only one time where Faith suggests a specific woman that Hope may have had a relationship with. I wasn't looking for some Hollywood tell-all but I was looking for more of a definite stance on just how much Hope played around. For instance, I read a bio of John Wayne and it did detail Wayne's relationships but did so in a way that said... this is what the guy did and here is who he \\"messed around with\\" and it was wrong.Again, not looking for Faith to muck rake but to me it was just vague when it came to Hope's personal relationships. It also talked about how several of his kids had issues with Hope and his constant travel or his celebrity. The book didn't really talk about what this was all caused by and how it effected Hope. It just mentioned \\"strain\\" with his kids.To an extent, the book was almost a very long wikipedia article that detailed Hope's life's work and his love of the military and the USO but didn't really offer the sort of in depth analysis that you normally get from a bio."},{"Title":"Bob Hope a life in Comedy","review":"This was the best bio I have read since Grant's two volume bio.

A reading of Grant Morrison's &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; is highly recommended as each of the chapters in Shaviro's work draws from Morrison's complex superhero saga; cursory knowledge of some of the other sources may help too, as they are numerous and vital to understanding how gross Shaviro's effort truly is.

Rather than sit back and presume to parse the postmodern world from the standpoint of a sort of objective, third-person narrator (in the mold of a Mailer, Bellow, or Kirkus) who remains ultimately &quot;disinterested&quot; in his subject matter, Shaviro dives in and swims with the strange fish populating his _Patrols_. How could one write about postmodernism without referring to postmodernists? Shaviro does so with perfect synthesis, and discusses relevant issues with poetic prose that becomes its own complex, ambiguous, challenging artifact. Look no further than _Doom Patrols_ for incisive chapters on race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, class, money--and all the other topics the high modernists would have us forget in the name of Kultur."},{"Title":"Punisher: An Eye For An Eye","review":"This graphic novel collecting the first three issues of the punisher war journal, the iconic vigilante comic book series from marvel, is great!

However, even as I read and enjoyed Bell's book, I came away feeling that there was something sinister about Leonard, as if he had some hidden agenda. Therefore, when I came across Coats' book, I was extremely intrigued, but having read it I am instead extremely disappointed.Rather than presenting, or at least attempting to present, a balanced, lucid, objective case that Leonard was not the saint he appeared, her book is an unremitting demonizing of Leonard Woolf. Coats has presented the known events and existing letters by interpreting all as proof of Leonard's malicious intent and devious manipulation. I find this an extremist viewpoint that works against good biographical writing.In addition, the book comes with the most appalling index: a name index where each name is followed by lines and lines AND LINES of undifferentiated locators making it totally useless to the reader. This is definitely an example of no index being better than a bad one."},{"Title":"Who's afraid of Leonard Woolf?: A case for the sanity of Virginia Woolf","review":"I have always thought that Edward Albee's offhand use of Virginia Woolf's name in the title of his play singlehandedly revived Virginia's reputation. Mrs. Coates provides not even a footnote to justify her wild accusations against Leonard Woolf. Neverthelesss, there is such a black hole of information about Leonard, the book is worth a look.Leonard is a member of the Souls at Cambridge who comes home with Virginia's brother Thoby to enrich after dinner converstation at a London address that would become known as Bloomsbury.Mrs. Coates says Leonard attached himself like a barnicle to the Stephens sisters, Vanessa and Virginia, in order to further his own interests. Leonard fails at writing novels, fails at running for Commons, fails at writing great books about politics, fails at making love and producing a child with Virginia, fails at running the Hogarth Press.In addition, Mrs. Coates would have us believe Leonard denied Virginia the use of her own inheritance and the money she earned as an author. Leonard used the money for his own comforts, says Mrs. Coates, and the car was &quot;Leonard's, not Virginia's.&quot;Leonard propagandized that Virginia was a schizophrenic invalid; colluded with Eminent Victorians author Lytton Strachey and Virginia's sister 'Nessa Bell to keep the author of Mrs. Dalloway and To The Lighthouse a misfit in need of special handling within the Bloomsbury Group and Society.Leonard aggressively competed with Virginia. When he saw she was becoming more successful than he, Mrs. Coates says, Leonard attempted to stop Virginia from writing Literature. Mrs. Coates' most outrageous claim: that with his own ambitions thwarted, Leonard spent the thirties trying to drive his wife to suicide.Mrs. Coates has almost no evidence for these assertions. Nevertheless, this book is food for thought. Leonard Woolf's role in Bloomsbury and Virginia's life is not well understood.Maybe this book will provoke a real Boswell to take another look at the Bloomsbury Enigma Leonard Woolf.Mike Ricemrice@elroynet.com."},{"Title":"Who's afraid of Leonard Woolf?: A case for the sanity of Virginia Woolf","review":"This is going to be the harshest review I've ever written, but sadly this muddled, neurotic and inaccurate book warrants panning.I'm quite the fan of biographies, and have read more than a few. I think most are familiar with the biographer who loves his or her subject so dearly that he or she invests that person with every admirable attribute, thereby presenting an unbalanced view of the subject. Then there is the biographer seeking to stir controversy by suggesting some heretofore unheard of scandal in the life of the subject. The biographer looking to cash in simply by saying something new, and thereby sell more books.Bizarrely Irene Coates' book doesn't qualify as either. Coates truly seems to believe her theories, and her unsubstantiated paranoia regarding Leonard Woolf. It's difficult to even make it through the forward without laughing at Coates a bit. She fancies herself a real-life Miss Marple, hot on the case. Unfortunately Coates is simply flinging about rather serious accusations with very little to back them up other than her fevered imagination.The truth about Leonard Woolf likely lies somewhere between the authorized biography's saintly portrayal, and Coates frankly sinister treatment of him. Where the authorized version nearly deifies, Coates demonizes. Truthfully, she makes Leonard Woolf out to be a villain more worthy of Lemony Snicket than of a serious consideration in a biographical context. Coates frequently lets her imagination run away with her, and becomes laughable in doing so.Take her insistence that Leonard caused Virginia's first suicide attempt by leaving a box of Veronal out in the open. Coates argues that Virgina was not mentally ill, yet condemns Leonard for leaving the drug where Virginia can have access to it. This is only one instance of Coates' rather deluded logic. Either Virginia Woolf was in need of constant supervision, or she was not. Coates simultaneously argues that she was not, yet that Leonard needed to lock away all drugs, as if he was dealing with a small child.Not worth the time it takes to read, or the money required for purchase this is quite simply an awful book that fails to even make sense. I eventually checked the publisher of this mess to see if perhaps it wasn't a vanity press. Often almost amusingly ludicrous, I gained no further insight into either Leonard or Virginia Woolf by reading this. It isn't even useful as a feminist undertaking, examining the Patriarchy as an influence because whereas Coates clearly did research this book, she is seemingly unaware that her conclusions are her own invention.Coates doesn't seem to be aware that she is engaging in historical fiction, not biography. Clearly Coates admires Virgina Woolf tremendously, but that fails to make this a worthwhile read. Save your money, and your time. This is a book without merit that only serves to make Irene Coates appear rather pitiable and provides no insight into the Woolfs."},{"Title":"Who's afraid of Leonard Woolf?: A case for the sanity of Virginia Woolf","review":"This is an incoherent, jargon-laden tract which purports to show that Virginia Woolf was not manic depressive and that her husband Leonard Woolf, who lovingly protected and nurtured his difficult wife for thirty years, was a monstrous specimen of the patriarchy, etc. etc. who, in effect, facilitated her murder. Irene Coates is no more capable of analyzing Virginia Woolf than spelling her name, her ignorance of basic information is stunning, is and Soho Press, whatever that is, should be sanctioned for publishing this mountain of drivel."},{"Title":"Who's afraid of Leonard Woolf?: A case for the sanity of Virginia Woolf","review":"Over the years, many readers have been cynical about the despair and rage expressed in Virginia Woolf's feminist works, such as &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot;. After all, wasn't Virginia a wealthy upper middle-class woman who never worked a day in her life? Wasn't she petted and cared for by an adoring husband? Didn't she have a beautiful home (which is now a tourist spot?)and a circle of stimulating and enlightened intellectual friends? &quot;What the heck did she have to complain about?&quot;, those overloaded with children and dreary jobs have often wondered bitterly.Well, according to Coates, the answer is - quite a bit. Coates gives us an entirely new view of Virginia's life and marriage, one which seems straight out of a Victorian Gothic novel by Wilkie Collins or Sheridan LeFanu. Virginia is seen as the heroine entrapped by a cruel husband, who presents to the outside world the face of kindness and care, while viciously tyrannizing and silencing his wife, who can appeal for help only in carefully coded letters and diaries. Coates presents Virginia Stephens as an isolated and sheltered young girl, manipulated cleverly into marriage to an ambitious and greedy man. Leonard Woolf gained access to her social set as a college friend of her adored brother, who died young. Woolf is here portrayed as a man willing to stop at nothing to get ahead, a Jew who abandoned and rejected his own religion and family to strive for upward mobility in the English middle class. His marriage to Virginia was pushed by her sister Vanessa, who wanted her younger sibling off her hands, and by Leonard's friends, who wanted him to marry a rich wife as a way of remaining in England, rather than return to a civil service job in Ceylon. Virginia allowed her initial resistance to be worn down, with disastrous results - having married the rich Gentile wife he wanted, Leonard then despised and exploited her. (But he might not have been happy with any woman - most of his Cambridge friends were gay, and while Leonard considered himself heterosexual, he obviously shared many of their views on women - Coates quotes a letter to Lytton Strachey in which Woolf describes male sexuality as &quot;noble&quot; and female as &quot;vile&quot;.) Their early married life was a disaster, and Coates goes so far as to suggest that Virginia's first suicide attempt was, in fact, attempted murder. Her husband insisted she see a doctor of his choosing, who told her that she was too disturbed to become a mother (Leonard detested children). He then left her distraught, with an open box of sleeping pills beside her, and gave himself the alibi of a visit to her sister Vanessa. As he had hoped, she took an overdose, and was saved only through the unexpected visit of a woman friend, who promptly summoned help from a medical student living in the building. The long-term result was the total destruction of Virginia's independent existence. Leonard refused to let her see her family physician (who considered her perfectly healthy and capable of motherhood) only allowing her to consult his tame specialists. To have had her certified as a lunatic would have deprived Leonard of money or of a divorce, so he chose to have her declared incompetent - giving him, as her guardian, total control of her money, and preventing her from applying for a divorce, while he could still divorce her. He now had what he wanted, total control, and any protests against her sexual and financial exploitation could be seen as the ravings of a madwoman. And sadly, there is no suggestion anywhere in the book that Virginia ever tried to seek outside legal, medical, or spiritual advice.Virginia's only escape came through writing, and through her one love affair, with Vita Sackville-West, a strong, independent woman. Vita balanced not only an &quot;open&quot; marriage, but a whirl of children, travel, gardens, and dogs. Through her relationship with Vita, Virginia realized bitterly how constricted her own life had become. Their homes had been bought with her money, but chosen and organized by Leonard - she hated their country house, which he had remodeled to his own taste, giving himself a huge studio, while she was relegated to a hut in the garden. Her money had paid for their business, the Hogarth Press, which gave Leonard editorial control of all her books, and for a car, which she wasn't allowed to drive. In the Woolf family, even the gardens and dogs belonged to Leonard - when Vita gave her a spaniel puppy, Leonard promptly annexed it as his own. It was this bitterness and rage that finally burned through in &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot;, which was first given as a lecture, with Vita at her side.But the affair did not last - they remained friends, but Vita sought other lovers - and Virginia was once more trapped without support, and her husband's increasing hostility and disrespect. She was offered speaking engagements and American lecture tours, but Leonard insisted she turn them all down. He was furiously jealous of the increased sales of her work. As WWII began, daily life grew harder and harder - Leonard interfered with the servants, forcing Virginia to do the cooking and cleaning herself, and refusing to let her visit friends. Finally, in despair, she killed herself - or did she? Coates thinks that Leonard deliberately drove her to it - at the very least knowing that she was suicidal and not helping her - and at the worst, she hints that he may actually have killed her. If so, he got away with it, and his punishment was this - to always be known as &quot;Virginia's husband&quot;.This is sure to be a controversial book. But is it accurate? This reviewer, who is not particularly expert on - or enthusiastic about - Bloomsbury, finds it to ring psychologically true. The ambitious poor man who marries a rich wife and then despises her is all too familiar. The legal position of both women and the mentally ill was such at the time that the trap set for Virginia was almost inescapable. And this account well explains the bitterness and despair in her works, in a way that pictures of her as a cosseted and loved wife fail to do."},{"Title":"Who's afraid of Leonard Woolf?: A case for the sanity of Virginia Woolf","review":"I am a graduate student who has spent the last four months learning everything I can for a class project about Leonard -- which is QUITE A LOT.

Author Coates is completely off her rocker. She tries to argue that Leonard Woolf was responsible for his wife's supposed madness. Her argument falls apart in the first few pages when Coates notes that Virginia Woolf had two nervous breakdowns (with hallucinations) even before she met Leonard. But it's worth a look for those who have a shelf or two full of Virginia Woolf biographies, diaries, novels, and critical essays. But wow, what a nut (the author, that is)."},{"Title":"Who's afraid of Leonard Woolf?: A case for the sanity of Virginia Woolf","review":"Those , like me, who have absolutely glued ourselves to the study of VW and have read all we could get our hands on, including things written by others who knew the W's, can see that Leonard probably was a bad boy. He admits that. He had an extremely dark, deep, scary side to him. He was very good at making everyone around him feel that he was an extremely good husband, nice guy. He'd perfected the technique. When I'd read the biographies and so much about the w's, I always felt that something was missing. There's something going on behind the scenes, between the lines, in the dark. Thus I was very excited to discover this book. Bought it used, thru amazon. Read it immediately. Highly recommended for those who really care. I always gave L the benefit of the doubt, even after reading the diaries, since what is said between husband and wife can be taken the wrong way if read by strangers. But there were some things that just couldn't be defended under that principle. I agree completely with Donna Seaman's review above , under editorial reviews.

Charles Doughty was a prototype for these wanderers, and he spawned the devotion of others. For those who must tackle this book, and there are valid reasons if you are truly interested, the best news is that this is an abridgment (yes, \\"passages from...\\") of what must have been around 1500 solid pages. Edward Garnett was the one who lobbed off four-fifths of the book, and I suppose one should take it on faith that the best fifth survived. Figure that a one week blinding sandstorm, sans provisions, would have been more pleasant than covering the whole 1500. Doughty undertook his almost two year journey of northern Arabia in the late 1880's, and this book may have languished in obscurity save for the promotional work of none other than T.E. Lawrence, who knew a few things about promotional activities. Lawrence's own \\"exploits\\" have been proven to be greatly embroidered, by historians such as David Fromkin. And from Lawrence, yet another strange character, Wilfred Thesiger, also championed Doughty's work. The biggest question is: Why?Doughty traveled from Damascus, along the Haj caravan route, to the ancient Nabatean ruins at Madain Saleh. From there he went to nearby Tayma (Teyma), then on to Hail (Hayil), Kheybar, then Qasim (Buraydah and Unayzah), before leaving via Taif (Tayif) and Jeddah. For sure, the austere beauty of the desert eluded Doughty. His outlook was uniformly dyspeptic, and the reader must wonder why did he continue? He clearly did not like the people, and he seemed to relish the hardships, and many of us have had the personal experience of an acquaintance recounting his/her travels: their essential outlook being that the aspects of another culture that are different are, by definition, inferior, and are a suitable topic of ridicule. Referring to a Bedouin group, Doughty says: \\"...and for things within their rat-like understanding, Arabians tell me, it were of them that a man may best inquire.\\" Or in another section, the author says: \\"I was startled from my weariness by the abhorred voice of their barbaric religion!... Those hyenas responded, with a sort of smothered derision, \`Would I not pray along with them...'\\". Doughty was not a good prognosticator either, in commenting on the Haj: \\"How great is that yearly suffering and sacrifice of human flesh, and all lost labour, for a vain opinion, a little salt of science would dissolve all their religion!\\" He manages to convey his observations in an archaic, leaden literary style that was not even palatable to his fellow Victorians.So, Doughty spends almost two years in the heartland of Islam, all the while boldly and obnoxiously proclaiming his moral superiority as a Christian. Even Thesiger commented that it was analogous to someone going around England during World War II professing his faith in the Nazi ideology. It is a wonder that he completed his trip, and certainly at some level a testimony to the tolerance of the hosts he imposed upon. What is missing, and is fruitful grounds for speculation: What did his hosts really think of this eccentric, contrarian \\"ugly Brit\\"?Though I've been uniformly negative myself, I have given the book a 3-star for a couple of reasons: Doughty never could see the desert of Gertrude Bell'sThe Desert and the Sown: The Syrian Adventures of the Female Lawrence of Arabiabut he did have his moments, like when he described the \\"wothybi\\", the \\"wild cow,\\" which is an oryx. And he did give some sort of backhanded compliment to the people of Unayzah, by saying that is where he enjoyed the ONE good day during his entire travels. But mainly it is worth reading for theOrientalismthat outlook as famously defined by Edward Said, which holds the cultures of those somewhat different from our own, in the Middle East, up for ridicule and scorn. Then it is also worthwhile to contemplate the linkage from Doughty to Lawrence to Thesiger to Fox News.

She was, indeed, a married woman now in every sense of the word--not a spinster left on the self after six years of mourning with no prospects.Julian Declouet, Amalie's husband, has her dressed in the latest styles and proudly displays her for all to see.

Only the overseer Patrick Dye is disrespectful and makes suggestive, crude remarks to her every chance he gets. Julian and Sophia tell Amalie to ignore him, but refuse to consider firing him--hm!Julian has no interest in the day by day running of the plantation, he just enjoys the money it affords him so he can pursue his pleasures. His cousin Robert, whom Sophia reared with love from age five, can be depended on to see that Belle Grove prospers just as he sees to the well-being of his own plantation, The Willows.The secondary characters like Chloe (Sophia's goddaughter) and George the Englishman gardener; Madame Callot, the gossiper; Violet, somewhat of a mystery woman; Lally, Tige, and little Isa (all slaves), add sub-plots and emotional involvements that intrigue as they propel the story of the Declouets along its troubled way with its undercurrents of secrets and fears that surface from time to time keeping the reader tantalized with foreshadowing, clues, back stories, and glimpses of secret, deep-seated needs of the characters--so much to enjoy.Jennifer Blake creates a story full of mystery, misery, and magic of love. Her narrative of the unique styles of homes gives the reader a vicarious experience of feeling the cross breeze circulation through the house on a hot, humid summer night. Her description of the flood on Bayou Teche and the aftermath engages the reader's senses and emotions as she brings to life the mud and misery of aching weariness as all work to save and revive Belle Grove. Another mind-shattering event comes alive as she describes the hurricane on Isle Derniere when winds, rain, and raging waters of the hurricane roar in like a mad beast killing and destroying without mercy. Ms. Blake takes one's breath away with the realness of it all. She ramps up the anxiety with the antagonist surprises presence that threatens to destroy all that the hurricane had not. However, the crown jewel of the story is the love story that threads through it all like the golden thread in a tapestry that enriches its warmth and sparkle as it reveals a surprise, or maybe not-so-surprising, soul mate connect.Midnight Waltz suggests darkness and sensuality and it delivers in spades--super good reading!Originally posted at The Long and Short of It Romance Reviews"},{"Title":"Midnight Waltz","review":"&quot;Midnight Waltz&quot; is not your usual romance novel; there are some surprising twists and turns. First off, let me say that I love romance novels and if they are set in Louisiana, that's a big plus.Amalie, the heroine, is in an arranged marriage to Julien Declouet. They live on a plantation named Belle Grove, with Julien's mother and sleep in separate bedrooms, as was the custom in those times. Julien's cousin, the handsome Robert Farnum, lives hereby and is a frequent visitor to Belle Grove. He respects his aunt, Julien's mother, and will do anything for her.Julien and Amalie have been married for three months, but still the marriage has not been consumated, although he has tried once or twice. One night, Amalie is visited by a man who she thinks is her husband. Their interlude is wonderfully sexual and romantic, but it's so dark that she can't see his face and assumes it is her husband. At breakfast the next morning, Julien acts as if nothing transpired between himself and Amalie the night before which puzzles Amalie. But that night again, and the night after that, she is visited by her lover and they spend rapturous hours together-- and that is the setup for the rest of the story!Jennifer Blake transports the reader to the bayous of Louisiana and the streets of New Orleans. &quot;Midnight Waltz&quot; has an intriguing, very dark side in addition to the romance. The story takes some surprising twists and turns which the reader really doesn't expect. The secondary characters are as vital to the story as the Amalie, Robert and Julien.This is the first book by Jennifer Blake that I have read and it won't be my last. If you're in the mood for some romantic suspense and intrigue set in the steamy, sexy bayous, read this book."},{"Title":"Midnight Waltz","review":"I have read this book over and over again throughout the years, and it never ceases to touch me. I recently re-read it, just for the fun of it. You will come to think of Amalie and Robert as your friends--they will stay in your mind--you'll find yourself thinking: let me go back to New Orleans and spend some time with them...One of the things that I liked the most about this book is the strength of its heroine, Amalie, ...she is not prone to faints spells or weeping and so on, but is a &quot;take action&quot; kind of heroine. Robert is so passionate and sweet that you cannot help but to root for him and Amalie to be together once and for all. (The secondary characters are interesting too!)I absolutely love this book, this is one of Ms. Blake's best.Please read this book and then write what you think of it here!"},{"Title":"Midnight Waltz","review":"I've loved every Jennifer Blake book I've read. MIDNIGHT WALTZ is no exception.In antebellum Louisiana, young wife Amalie settles into marriage with her new husband, Julien. Handsome, rich and charming, Julien is everything a woman could ask for, but slightly distant--until he comes to her bed at night. Then he turns into the wildly passionate lover of every woman's dreams.The difference confuses and alarms Amalie, especially when attraction develops between her and Julien's newly arrived cousin, Robert. Secrets abound in a society that owes its existence to strict conformity, and Amalie's placid life ruptures when long-hidden truths surface.Vivid descriptions and lush storytelling rocket you through this vibrant and compelling historical romance. Ms. Blake's extensive research and detailed descriptions insert you firmly into 1850's Louisiana plantation life. As a product of her time, Amalie starts out as a bit of a doormat, but her difficult situation rapidly transforms her into a woman capable of directing her own course, even if society disapproves. The hero (and I won't tell you who he is) is again my favorite type, the decent man.While MIDNIGHT WALTZ is everything a romance novel should be, the story is also a sad commentary on the futility and the tragedy of obeying society's precepts at any cost.First published in 1984, MIDNIGHT WALTZ remains a winner.ARC provided by Sourcebooks"},{"Title":"Midnight Waltz","review":"Amalie Peschier was almost permanently on the old-maid shelf when her family arranges a too good to be true marriage to Julian Declouet. Julian is very kind to his young bride, almost too kind as he seems unwilling (or perhaps unable?) to consummate the marriage. Just when Amalie is ready to give up hope of children, her husband visits her room in the dark of night (so dark she can't see him) and makes wild passionate love to her, but come daylight her passionate lover is gone and Julian's amiable (and somewhat petulant) persona returns. Since there's no other way into Amalie's bedroom except through Julian's rooms it couldn't possibly be anyone else, could it?\\"Such things did not happen to well-brought-up young ladies. How had it come about that they happened to her?\\"So's not to spoil, I'm not taking that plot line any further, although you will figure it out lickety split. But don't give up the ship and send the book flying, because after the big ta-dah is revealed things heat up and start cooking. There's a mysterious disappearance, a murder (or is it an accident?), the obligatory evil slave abusing overseer with a secret agenda of his own, and of course Julian's deep dark secret (yep, you'll guess it). All kidding aside, I did enjoy this and despite the predictable beginning Blake does finish it off quite nicely. Amalie and he-who-shall-not-be-named have sex and plenty of it and it really is rather well done. Despite its original 1980's publication date, you won't find heaving bosoms, ripped bodices (well there was one time with the bad guy...), or weeping vulvas here. The biggest plus for this history geek is the seamless way Blake portrays the period and Creole society, from the food, buildings, what's involved in running a large plantation (from the female side of course), the social mores and most especially the clothes (loved watching Amalie and you-know-who taking them off I might add).\\"Belle Grove had been built during the early years of the nineteenth century when every closet, chimney, and enclosed staircase was taxed. As a result, the house and two outside staircases, one in back and one in front, but none inside; only two enclosed chimneys, but four fireplaces; and armoires instead of closets.\\"That was a new factoid for me.\\"Women in the Creole portion of Louisiana did not attend burials, though they might be present at the mass for the should of the dead. They could give birth in a welter of gore, tend the incontinent elderly in their last days, and witness, not to mention clean up after, the bodily degradation caused by most illnesses; but they were, of course, far too delicate to sustain the sight of their loved ones being lowered into the grave.\\"Sigh. All in all a good solid read and a nice bit of brain candy for when you're in the mood for something lighter. As noted earlier, there is quite a bit of sex in this one, but compared to what you'll see in today's books (or those OTT old school bodice rippers), it is quite tame and tastefully done IMHO. Just not for the kiddos.Thanks to Sourcebooks for an advance review copy."},{"Title":"Midnight Waltz","review":"I loved this book. I couldn't put it down.

Big problems with it though. The idea to make it about rap music seemed a bit contrived, don't get me wrong I love hip-hop, but when reading it the rapping just seemed silly. This book was okay give it a try if you liked the Spellsinger series, maybe one of these days Mr. Foster will write a better sequel (don't get me started on Chorus Skating...._"},{"Title":"Son of Spellsinger","review":"Whilst the plot of the book is perfectly passable, the problem with this book is very simple.Alan Dean Foster knows, fundamentally, nothing about rap. Whilst in the previous books the musical connection was obviously based on things that he knew about, this attempts to update itself by changing the musical style used from rock and roll to rap. Unfortunately, the attempts to create convincing rap lyrics fall completely flat. This results in a book which continually shoots itself in the foot by juddering to an awkward halt each time this occurs.For heaven's sake -- I've read better parodies of rap music in Mad magazine.."},{"Title":"Son of Spellsinger","review":"\\"Son of Spellsinger\\" is the seventh volume in the Spellsinger series, this time with the son of Jon-Tom alongside the two otter cubs of colleague Mudge.Back cover of book:Call Him - Spellmaster BMuch to Clothahump the Wizard's distress, ex-hippie Jon-Tom and otherworldly Talea's son Buncan wants to be a questing hero, but not a spellsinger. Instead, he forms a band with Mudge's kids, otters Nocter and Squill, one that creates a wild, unpredictable magic - based on rap!Then an anteater arrives with rumors about a dangerous legend. Soon the young rappers, aided by a drunk rhino, are off on an odyssey to a fortress where evil sorcerers threaten the world. And where only the unknown power of Buncan's beat can stop the hordes of hideous hybrids.Son of SpellsingerThe next generation of mayhem and magic begins...End back cover of book.Even though at the end of \\"The Time of the Transference\\" Mudge had more than two cubs, it is understood he has only two. Also Nocter on the back cover is called Neena throughout the novel yet in the next volume \\"Chorus Skating\\" is back to Nocter. Such inconsistencies are unforgivable.Overall I believe the story would have been more enjoyable had the author stuck with what worked, Jon-Tom and Mudge. Any offspring of the great duo does not seem proper when one is a cheap clone of the parent with the equivalent idiosyncrasies. It is the same brand of humor and problems but different individuals.Other new characters are likable and the object of the quest is very witty. The nature of otherworldly devices in a magical world continues to amaze but having the rapping offspring tackle the adventure grew tiresome.Thank you."},{"Title":"Son of Spellsinger","review":"Most of the Spellsinger books concern the adventures of idealistic Los Angeles native Jon-Tom as he struggles to cope with being lost in the Wizard's World, a dimension of high magic and talking humanoid animals. Each time, the machinations of the phlegmatic wizard Clothahump or Jon-Tom's desires to help people and return home get him involved in some kind of quest to the back-end of nowhere -- sometimes literally.In Son of Spellsinger, Jon-Tom is married and settled down. Rumors of a thingie called the Grand Veritable turn up, but Jon-Tom's not interested in a treasure hunt. Instead, his son Buncan teams up with the children of his otter sidekick Mudge to form a rap band and take off after the treasure.Jon-Tom casts spells by performing rock and metal songs, and it's obvious that Foster is an encyclopedia on the subject. It's a cool image. Buncan and his friends, however, cast spells by making up kindergarten-level rap lyrics vaguely appropriate to the situation that coincidentally parody real rap songs.Buncan and his friends are not very likeable compared to Jon-Tom and Mudge. The music-magic is painful instead of cool, and the reliance on puns and dumb sight gags calls to mind Piers Anthony ... except that Anthony's BETTER at it. And the overall plot just meanders from place to place; it's less a grand quest and more a haphazard stroll. It almost feels like Foster had only a germ of an idea to start with, and was writing for the page count.Gah.

Love Howard!!!"},{"Title":"Community planning & zoning for groundwater protection in Michigan: A guidebook for local officials","review":"This book was released (inflicted) on an unsuspecting public in 1985, while Cosell's take on sporting matters, for inexplicable reasons, still mattered to many. It could also be entitled 'Name Drop Central'. Mr. Cosell, who came to fame on the coat tails of Muhammad Ali let his in-your-face, smash mouth, tell it like it is style of broadcasting go to his head and fester. There is an impressive number of characters in this book, prominent members of the sporting world to be sure. However, it's all about Cosell and his decrees concerning their involvement in the games of their choice, not opinions, which would invite disagreement and suggest inaccuracy, but final, absolute determinations according to Mr. Last Word himself. The people and their actions are absolutely subject to final, expert praise or, more often, damnation of Cosell.His opinion of himself is simple; he's the greatest broadcaster in the history of sports. On the question of racism, Howard asserts \\"Nobody in the histroy of sports in this country has served the cause of black athletes as I have.\\" I wonder if the NAACP knows about this wonderful hero.\\"Arrogant, pompous, obnoxious, vain, cruel, verbose, a showoff. I have been called all of these. Of course, I am.\\" This is a self assessment of the man spoke by himself.\\"Tell it like it is,\\" was easily his most famous quote. Well, Sir, you didn't necessarily tell it like it was. You expressed your opinions, you told it as you thought things were was and there was adequate room for dissent, to say the least. They were no more valid than those of anyone else and you were often wrong. Joe Namath said it best many years ago on the Tonight Show, when asked by Johnny Carson, how much Cosell knew about football. \\"Nothing,\\" was Broadway Joe's reply.Amen.The professional opinion of a psychologist, assuming he could be bothered reading this book, would be interesting. Amazon in the USA and Canada have it for sale in the 'used' category for 1 cent, which seems to be about right. I got ripped off because I paid a buck at a Sally Ann store. If you plan to read this book, brace yourself. If you weren't around at the height of the Cosell era, you'll scratch your head in wonderment at the naivete of his worshippers. In fact, he was a one-trick pony whose act eventually, mercifully wore thin. He claimed, in his waning years, that withdrew from sports because because of a continually diminishing interest in them. It was really the other way around.Larry WoodBowmanville, Ontario"},{"Title":"Community planning & zoning for groundwater protection in Michigan: A guidebook for local officials","review":"Sportscaster Howard Cosell (1920-1995) was so annoying and obnoxious that millions of fans would turn off the sound on their TV sets. But away from the microphone Cosell was a capable print journalist who often wrote with great clarity and perspective. Here at his retirement Cosell writes about sports franchises relocating, problems within the NFL and boxing, sports announcers and Monday Night Football. Cosell makes several interesting points, but unfortunately his arrogance and ceaseless criticisms for his coworkers (and bragging about himself) was such a turnoff that I never finished these pages. If you found Cosell as perfect as he apparently did, you'll probably enjoy this book and the author's unbounded egotism."},{"Title":"Community planning & zoning for groundwater protection in Michigan: A guidebook for local officials","review":"I have this thing about men with toupees.

But it makes you wonder right?"},{"Title":"Community planning & zoning for groundwater protection in Michigan: A guidebook for local officials","review":"After recently watching the Howard Cosell HBO documentary, I felt compelled to read of Howard in Howard's words. I graduated from high school in 71 and my interest in sports overlaid Cosell's rise to prominence.This book is good and bad. The bad part is that Howard writes it and therefore Howard covers only what he wants. He picks out about 5 themes and covers the story from his perspective while overlaying his importance and how these events may have led to his eventually leaving network sports. For example, the first quarter of the book is an in-depth analysis of the Raiders leaving Los Angeles and Al Davis' fight with the NFL. Howard does a good job covering this issue from an intelligent standpoint but feels compelled to consistently drop names and inform you of his importance in the story. The most compelling part of this subject, which is further covered later with the section on the Jets and Giants leaving New York, is how it plays out in today's culture of sports franchises still successfully blackmailing cities and states. At least in that perspective, Howard was correct.In addition to NFL franchise moves, the other big story is NFL Monday Night Football. Fans today have no idea how big this was for football to be carried on the weeknight. Howard Cosell was perfect for the role. He was clearly the most hated man in America. Brass, cocky, controversial but always wanting to open his mouth and have everyone listens to him. My fondest memories of Monday Night Football is Don Meredith and his comedy. It was worth watching just to listen to Don. Frank Gifford was the ballast, the middleman compromise between Frank and Don who made everything run smoothly. Howard was like the nerd who never fit in but felt like he needed to lead the show. And actually he was pretty good at it at times. Eventually Howard self-implodes. Struggling because all the print media hates him, his partners don't like him, but self-delusionally believing it's everyone else's fault, he asks to be removed from the show. And with this change, Howard leaves the spotlight but doesn't seem to ever get comfortable without the light on him.Howard was an intelligent, complex man who had a huge desire to be loved. Probably what he should be known for most is his complete devotion to his wife. When she died in the mid-90s, Howard was just lost. Basically his life was over except for dying.Other stories covered in this book are his reason for walking away from boxing coverage as well as his personal history with Ali, Ray Leonard and O.J. Simpson. In summary, this is a book of stories that are interesting to Howard, not a biography. But it does give good insight into the man. I recommend this book for anyone with interest in sports, the 70s, or television history."},{"Title":"Community planning & zoning for groundwater protection in Michigan: A guidebook for local officials","review":"Howard Cosell was a national treasure. In reading this book I believe I have begun to understand why it was that the golden age for sports entertainment is long in the past. I hardly knew Howard Cosell in the media, since I was born in the early '70's. I missed out. Yet, I have been able to view the sports media and journalism business without him, and it is only a shadow of its former greatness. In &quot;I Never Played the Game,&quot; Mr. Cosell pulls no punches. He &quot;tells it like it is&quot; all of things that are wrong in sports...or what were wrong in sports in the late 1970's early '80's (in retrospect: nothing has changed). He tees off on team-owners who carpet-bag to other cities (then it was a big deal if the Rams moved from LA to Anaheim!); he jabs deliberately at the &quot;sport&quot; of professional boxing. He also lets looses a few dingers on professional baseball, but not before sacking his former fellow announcers in the Monday Night Football booth. Are you tired of the sports analogies? In reading this book I began to weary of Cosell's whippings (probably it's main flaw), but believe it, he has something to say! He saw professional sports in a way that is non-apologetic. He does not excuse ANYONE. He criticized the fascination with &quot;Jock-ocracy,&quot; or the praising of former athletes as being the &quot;authorities&quot; of the sports. I found it humorous when he took on John Madden as being a &quot;caricature&quot; of himself, and Frank Gifford as &quot;boring.&quot; You can't help but think of these praised members of the today's sports media and smile, realizing that Howard was right. Today, Monday Night Football's ratings drop due to boring games and simply a pop-culture identity crisis--it can't figure out if they are sports or entertainment. We cry out when team owners threaten to move if they don't get a new stadium with elite luxary boxes; and we're sickened by greedy promoters that exploit boxers and the sport in terribly overrated matchups on pay-per-view, all for the almighty dollar. Nothing has changed in 20 years, people. Howard prophecied most everything that is a &quot;concern&quot; in sports today. We have not come far at all. ESPN's Chris Berman is close, but we need Howard back...or someone willing to take the risks and actually tell us everything as it is. If you are sports fan and if you can find this book (mine was a gift several years ago), it is a treat to read."},{"Title":"Community planning & zoning for groundwater protection in Michigan: A guidebook for local officials","review":"Howard Cosell takes on a variety of topics in 1985's bitter memoir \\"I Never Played The Game\\" but only really warms to one: Himself.The voice of televised sports through the 1960s and especially the 1970s, Cosell was an original who with his characteristic staccato pontificating and taste for the jugular made even humdrum contests into events. Unfortunately by the 1980s his act had grown tired. Cosell lost interest in sports, especially boxing, where he shone brightest. That boxing was a dangerous sport was nothing new, but suddenly in 1982 Cosell discovered it caused serious injury, and not only walked away from the sport but urged it be banned outright. If he no longer enjoyed it, why should anyone else?All this is covered in \\"I Never Played The Game\\" at sententious, self-important length. Cosell has a point he beats into the ground, and it's not so much the danger of boxing but how the sport's luminaries were shocked at his brave stand and how congressmen like Jim Florio and Bill Richardson listened attentively to Cosell's words.Earlier in the book, Cosell details walking away from his other key perch, the broadcast booth of \\"Monday Night Football\\" in even more self-serving terms. He claims the players are no longer interesting (huh?), that the league is corrupt (especially when their leadership doesn't listen to him), that too many broadcasters are of what Cosell likes to call \\"the jockocracy,\\" whose ability to call the game is compromised by the fact they once played it, unlike him.\\"Anyone over the age of two knows that football is basically a sport without any mysteries,\\" he writes, and his acid contempt for the game is matched only by that for his boothmates, Don Meredith and Frank Gifford, whom he describes as uninteresting morons who rode Cosell's grand wake.This may be the book of Cosell's I heard Al Michaels once describe as \\"cruelty disguised as candor.\\" If so, it fits. Cosell wants you to know how low he regards people like NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, New York Jets owner Leon Hess, and John Madden, but instead of making his points he keeps hammering at the people, noting such details as their failed marriages as he uses this book to burn some bridges and settle scores in a way that made me feel a little like he must have watching Larry Holmes pummel poor Tex Cobb. As another boxer famously cried: \\"No Mas!\\"The only good part of the book is a chapter on the rise of Sugar Ray Leonard, a young boxer who gave Cosell a new star to light upon after the decline of Muhummad Ali, his most famous interview subject. Cosell's commentary here is relatively bile-free, and while he still pretty much promotes himself, he also writes knowledgeably about Leonard's growth as a boxer through a series of professional matches culminating in a memorable pair of bouts with Roberto Duran.It's a shame that Cosell's writing doesn't rise to this level elsewhere in this book. He attacks newspaper critics for not recognizing his brilliance, takes credit not only for the success of \\"Monday Night Football\\" but pro football overall, and uses the controversy surrounding his description of a black football player as \\"a little monkey\\" (which was definitely overblown and if anything revealed Cosell's essential colorblindness rather than any hidden racism) as an excuse to trot out his credentials as Mr. NAACP, the best thing to happen to black people since the Emancipation Proclamation.Cosell was a great thing to happen to sports broadcasting, and in his prime, when he took delight in himself and his place in pop culture, he was more of a pleasure to be around than any of us who were there at the time really knew. But it wasn't his time anymore when he wrote this, and instead of taking stock gracefully, he lets his bile run free. The result is a book that diminishes Cosell more than his critics ever could."},{"Title":"Community planning & zoning for groundwater protection in Michigan: A guidebook for local officials","review":"Howard Cosell is a legend in the sports broadcasting business. If he wasn't a sports broadcaster, he could have easily been a terrific writer of fiction or non-fiction. It's easy to read this book if you are not a sports fan like myself. This book is about how he covered football including a chapter on MOnday Night Football. I enjoyed reading about his relationship with O.J. Simpson and how O.J. cried when he thought he lost his friendship. Cosell was like a mentor or second father figure to him. He writes about the strained relationship based on tabloid journalism. Monday Night Football is not the same without Cosell even now. His legendary stature as a sports broadcaster waves heavily on sports broadcasting today. He was one of the pioneers. Of course, there are other chapters about boxing, baseball, and football and stadium politics like when the New York Jets and New York Giants moved only few miles away to the Meadowlands in New Jersey that it was more like crossing the border into a foreign land. The book is well-written and you grow to like Cosell after awhile. You can't imagine him without his beloved wife, Emmy, or Mary Edith Abrams, who traveled with him all over the place. He couldn't imagine doing it without her."},{"Title":"Community planning & zoning for groundwater protection in Michigan: A guidebook for local officials","review":"Howard Cosell rose to fame talking mainly about boxing and football, and the bulk of this book is devoted to documenting his disenchantment with those sports. The lack of regulations protecting the safety of boxers seems to be behind his disenchantment with that sport. As for pro football, he recounts with considerable disgust the removal of franchises from cities that have supported them, and their transfer to more lucrative sites. The Colts went to Indianapolis (under cover of night), the Jets across the river to New Jersey (in fact he called them the \\"New Jersey Jets\\"), the Rams to Anaheim, and of course the Raiders went to Los Angeles after beating the pants off the NFL in the celebrated anti-trust case.It is this latter case which I think is the pivotal point of Cosell's hot-and-cold relationship with pro football. He is dead-set against this type of blatant profiteering from a moral standpoint. He feels that the franchises owe something to the cities which have supported them, and he has testified before Congress in support of legislation that would require franchises to show good cause before moving.At the same time, his former training as a lawyer required that he support the legal right of the Raiders to move. The legal issue in the case involved section 4.3 of the NFL By-Laws, which required the approval of 3/4 of the owners in the league for any franchise move. The owners could block a move without giving any reason whatsoever, and Cosell understood that this was a clear violation of the anti-trust laws. Despite this clear reality, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle stubbornly dug in his heels and fought, instead of simply modifying the rule so that it would no longer violate anti-trust standards. Rozelle, one of the most over-rated characters in modern history, refused to accept Cosell's support of the Raiders' legal right to move, and it caused a rift in their personal relationship.Another factor in Cosell's disenchantment with football is what he called the \\"jockocracy\\", meaning the use of ex-ballplayers in the telecasts. He blasts the talents of former colleagues Don Meredith and Frank Gifford, and it is these comments which became the focal point of most of the reaction to this book. That is not, however, the main thrust of the book.I always liked Howard Cosell and appreciated his special brand of sports journalism, a phrase that was basically an oxymoron before Cosell came along. It is clear now that this book represents the start of the deterioration which he went through in his later years. He starts trashing others, a habit which grew and grew as he grew old. He decided he now liked baseball after all, after trashing it severely earlier. However, his efforts to broadcast baseball were excruciatingly awful. I have to cringe when I think of his horrible effort as part of the ABC telecast of the 1979 World Series between the Pirates and the Orioles. He was temperamentally unsuited for baseball, and this was painfully obvious to the listener. In his last years Cosell burned many bridges behind him, and he no doubt died with the love of his family intact, but perhaps not many others."},{"Title":"Community planning & zoning for groundwater protection in Michigan: A guidebook for local officials","review":"Cosell's \\"I Never Played the Game\\" is not a biography as much as it is a series of stories and essays by the famed sportscaster. Howard Cosell WAS sports in the 70s. In an era before cable and sports shows on every channel, Howard was a one-man network. He is best known as the face and voice of ABCs Monday Night Football, Wide World of Sports and Sportsbeat. Cosell was loved and hated during his career, gathering hate mail as well as a deep respect from fans, broadcasters, newspapers and sports figures alike. The praise and respect, unfortunately, came in the form of private conversations and compliments on his skills. The public criticisms of Howard were plentiful, more so than he deserved.Cosell was a brilliant man, and he's quick to remind us that he has a law background. The first segments of this book reveal Howard's insightful thoughts regarding the NFL and its policies when it comes to allowing teams to move from city to city. Cosell's problem is the fact that the fans shouldn't have to suffer their team to move by an arbitrary decision by the owner or the city. Cosell proceeds to talk out of both sides of his mouth, and comes out on the side of governmental intervention. (I initially wrote three long paragraphs going into detail on this, including the reasons I think Cosell was wrong. My review ended up being over 2000 words long, so I can't comment on the specifics of my disagreement with Cosell on this issue.)Anyway, Cosell also goes into some detail regarding his Monday Night Football days. These passages are fascinating if you know the players involved. Howard's behind-the-scenes conversations with Roone Arledge and his criticisms of Frank Gifford, Don Meredith and OJ Simpson etc. are a lot of fun to read. Howard does not go overboard with his criticisms. All of it in regard to his sportscasting colleagues centers on what Cosell calls the \\"Jockocracy\\", wherein TV and radio sports were (are) increasingly dominated by ex-jocks. Howard thinks they are a detriment to broadcasting, as their inexperience makes for a boring broadcast. I tend to agree. Even today, there are some excellent ex-jocks in broadcasting, but there are a LOT of mediocre ex-jock broadcasters out there.Also included in this excellent book of essays is an outstanding look back at Sugar Ray Leonard and Cosell's relationship with him. Cosell uses this opportunity to talk about boxing in general, and his reasons for walking away from professional boxing. Again, Cosell loves big government solutions; he advocates a boxing commission in order to keep fighters \\"safe\\" and prevent the underhanded dealings of the promoters. Since there already ARE boxing commissions, why not let those with a gripe take them to court instead of making all sorts of new commissions and wasting tax dollars.Cosell loves to talk about himself and his role in the world of sports politics, but I can't help but question some of his affiliations. Cosell effortlessly lambastes those who deserve it, but at the same time he always seems to \\"pal around\\" with these people (owners, politicians, sneaky network executives, \\"unqualified\\" colleagues) whom he claims to despise. That's the journalist in him (also the lawyer in him), digging for the scoop instead of standing up for his own personal beliefs. If I thought Joe Owner was a crook, I wouldn't associate with him as a matter of principle; Cosell seems to associate with his ideological enemies MORE than his friends.As disagreeable as I find his politics to be, I have always liked Howard Cosell. He was the Voice of sports in the United States all through the 60s, 70s and into the 80s. When Howard brought his thoughts to the table, he was always outspoken and forceful in his opinions. Cosell never got his just rewards while he was still a public figure, but if you go back and ask anyone from that era who the highest profile broadcaster was, they would say Cosell.Cosell is sorely missed. I am not old enough to remember him in all his glory, but the few years I was still able to hear his Monday Night Football broadcasts brings back fond memories. Howard comes across like an opinionated friend to me. I would love to sit with a drink in one hand, a cigar in the other, and Howard Cosell to have a long conversation with. In the sports world, there is nobody I would have liked to meet more than Howard Cosell."},{"Title":"Community planning & zoning for groundwater protection in Michigan: A guidebook for local officials","review":"After seeing Monday Night Mayhem I bought the Hardcover version of the book. I bought it used, but it was in like new condition.It was a good read. Cosell was at a point in his life where he could afford to be especially candid. The title &quot;I never played the game&quot; incidentally refers to both that he never played sports but also he never played the game with ABC executives or the sports hype.Cosell is right in that he never got the respect he deserved from the public and the other sports commentators. Cosell was just the type of guy people loved to hate, but deep down I think most people loved cosell. He always brought out the emotion in any sporting event. He always had the uncanny ability to draw people in without hyping. Monday Night Football was never better when Cosell was the announcer in the early 70's."},{"Title":"Community planning & zoning for groundwater protection in Michigan: A guidebook for local officials","review":"I never heard Howard Cosell do a broadcast. If it is anything like he reads this book, then I truly missed out! This is an excellent addition, especially for anyone who enjoyed the recent film &quot;Monday Night Mayhem&quot;, depicting the rise of Monday Night Football and Cosell. This fills in much of what the movie may have been unable to cover. Plenty of signature Cosell lines, said by the man himself!"},{"Title":"Community planning & zoning for groundwater protection in Michigan: A guidebook for local officials","review":"This blunt analysis of sports on television is just as relevant today as it was when published 25 years ago. Cosell lifts up the rock that the creepy pro team owners live under and watches them scatter. He skewers NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle. Then he takes on his own network and slams his Monday Night Football partners. It all makes for incredibly entertaining reading and is told in Cosell's staccato \\"voice,\\" so you feel like he's talking to you.The only negative about the book is that at almost 400 pages it's too verbose, like Cosell himself. He uses the first 125 pages to explain how owners moving teams to new cities destroyed pro sports. He makes a valid case that Pete Rozelle wasn't the great savior of football that his legend allows, but instead he single-handedly melded sports and media into an entertainment enterprise.Eventually he gets to his booth partners--and attempts to do an objective analysis of their lack of skills. He has respect for Gifford but is absolutely right on that Frank's broadcast skills were limited. Cosell has no love for Don Meredith, a hick out of the Gomer Pyle playbook who was there for amusement but who had a gigantic ego that couldn't live in the same room with Howard's.After this was published the sports and TV world turned against Howard--yet everyone else was wrong and 25 years later we can now see that Cosell was right. Look beyond his hairpiece, cigar and distinctive voice and you'll find a true journalist with a heart for serving the public interest. Here he uses his journalistic skills to expose the falsehoods of sports and media.This book blows all the stereotypes and rips down the curtain that allowed pro leagues and broadcast networks to scheme to make money off what once was pure sport. Instead it became entertainment. Cosell admits making a mint off of it, but here (at the end of his career) correctly summarizes the problems. Even today most of what he writes is sadly still true."},{"Title":"Community planning & zoning for groundwater protection in Michigan: A guidebook for local officials","review":"I am old enough to remember when, in the mid-1950's, Howard Cosell gave up his job as a successful New York lawyer and began his radio show, \\"Speaking of Sports\\". At the time he seemed like a breath of fresh air, trying hard to bring some real journalism to the world of sports. Prior to Cosell, \\"sports journalism\\" was an oxymoron, as there was no effort among reporters to be objective and avoid hero worship of the athletes they covered. Cosell later switched to television, and when ABC landed the \\"Monday Night Football\\" contract, Cosell was instrumental in making MNF the institution it became.Cosell had a running feud with the print reporters, and the title of this book comes from the frequent criticism leveled at Cosell by the writers that he didn't understand sports because \\"he never played the game\\". When this book came out in 1985, Cosell was already in a steep downhill slide toward irrelevancy. He had become completely disenchanted with his favorite sports, boxing and football, for reasons he details in the book. In 1982 he announced he would never cover another boxing match because of boxing/s inherent brutality, and in 1983 he left Monday Night Football, saying the games all looked the same to him.As ABC had acquired rights to some major league games, Cosell switched to baseball and was part of ABC's world series announcing team in 1979, 1981, and 1983. I watched those telecasts and Cosell was just awful. He had no feel for baseball, and in his two earlier books he had made it abundantly clear that he thought baseball was boring and worthless, destroying any credibility he might otherwise have had as a baseball announcer. Mercifully to viewers, ABC took him off baseball in 1985 after this book came out, and replaced him with Tim McCarver, a wonderful announcer who has since become a superstar and is now in the Baseball Hall of Fame for his great broadcasting.Cosell's shtick was that he felt that \\"what happened on the field\\" was not all that interesting. Rather, he prided himself on getting the \\"stories behind the stories\\", i.e., talking about what was going on in the players' lives. How ironic, then, that his replacement, Tim McCarver, along with Tim's longtime broadcast parnter Joe Buck, has shown us that what happens on the field can be terrible interesting. There is a saying that \\"baseball is only dull to dull minds\\", and by his brilliant success McCarver has demonstrated the truth of this aphorism.I recall an interview with Barbara Walters that Cosell did toward the end of his life. Barbara asked him \\"How do you want to be remembered.\\" Cosell answered, \\"That's easy, as a good husband, a good father, and a good grandfather.\\" Barbara: \\"Nothing about career\\". Cosell: \\"No, it's not important.\\"This odd statement really seems contradictory to all the pompous pronouncements Cosell made during his career about how important what he was doing was for the development of sports journalism. If what he was doing was ultimately unimportant, then why did he make such a big fuss about it?Cosell died in 1995, a recluse during his last years, which seems odd for a person who always prided himself on what a close relationship he had, or at least claimed to have, with some of the people he covered. Sadly, he seems to have revealed himself in his later years to be a complete fraud. One suspects he would have been happier in life had he stuck with his original choice of profession."},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"Not the greatest of the Oz books. True, we get the return of the Wizard, but it lacks the excitement and intrigue of the other books. It's not until the gang reaches Emerald City that the book gets really exciting. I did like the idea behind the Kingdom of the Vegetables, but the way it came out, and the journey before it and after just fell really really flat. The new characters, Jim and Zeb, also added absolutely nothing to the plot that we didn't already . But still, it's L. Frank Baum, so I can't rate it all that badly.

I just didn't see it anywhere. This review is based on the Del Rey edition.Dorothy and the Wizard In Oz is the 4th book in The Wizard of Oz series.In this story, Dorothy and Zebediah (Zeb), her second cousin, fell into the middle of the earth though a crack. When they landed, they were in a city. The rest of the story is the trying to get out of the middle of the earth.There is one really neat thing that happens in this book. As many of you remember, whether you read the book or saw the movie, the Wizard of Oz floated away in a hot-air balloon. Well, in this book, the Wizard lands in the city where Dorothy and Zeb are. He must have been floating for a really long time!As I have for all of the books in this series, I suggest this book for those who like to read for fun and don't mind a little major fantasy. (Like when Dorothy and Zeb fall through the earthquake to the center of the earth, they could've never survived!)"},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"L. Frank Baum, who wrote the Wizard of Oz, a little before WWI, the famous tale of Dorothy and her delightful friends that was immortalized in the 1939 film starring Judy Garland, did not stop writing the adventures of Dorothy. In later years, he wrote further exploits, as Dorothy returns to the magical realm time and again, meeting with her old friends the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, etc but encountering newer evils, i.e. Mombi the witch. The only other film drawn from these later novels is the 1980's film &quot;Return to Oz&quot; starring Faureza Balk as Dorothy, a less popular film. I highly recommend the Oz books, all of them, though you might want to check their chronological and consecutive order, for they are excellent works of fiction and fantasy, and in fact, the very first &quot;fantasy&quot; series of its time. Baum did what Tolkien would later do in his extensive Lord of the Rings novels and what C.S. Lewis did in his Narnia Chronicles, the first book being the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. These works of fantasy are excellent. In this particular story, we again meet Dorothy (formerly Pip, a young Kansas boy, a sort of male counterpart to Dorothy, had adventures in Oz) who has been living with her cousin Zeb in California. While riding on a buggy, an eathquake takes Dorothy and Zeb deep underground and they are transported back to Oz. We are introduced to characters that will appear in other Oz novels, including the benevolent enchantress and ruler of Oz, Ozma, who took over the land after the incident involving the phony Wizard in The Wizard of Oz. The rest is history. Dorothy will forever live in our hearts, and the Oz will forever be linked with innocence, with magic, and with childhood. I still enjoy reading these novels, and everyone should also, and be caught up once again in L. Frank Baum's immortal epic."},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"The book \\"Dorothy and the Wizard of OZ,\\" is a great book,and should be recommended for anyone who likes to read. It starts out when Dorothy and Zeb are riding in a buggy, and then this huge earthquake comes, causing a big crack in the earth to form. they fall inside the earth, and end up landing in what we know as \\"munchkin City\\", but in the book it is called \\"The Glass City\\". They meet the munchkins, and then take off for the wizard. They get there, and then this sorcerer comes out, and starts talking them, as he turns into a funny looking thorny man. the wizard finds the sorcerer and cuts him in half. They take the cut in half sorcerer, and barry him in the vegetable garden. The prince of the vegetable kingdom, tells Dorothy to go and find him a princess. So she does. One night while the wizard and Dorothy are sleeping, they get a visit from the evil Mangaboos. They wernt goin to let them go, but then they did. They then went through a mountain, and came put on the other side, which was the Mangaboos's kingdom. While they were there, they ran into a man they called The Braided Man of Pyramid Mountain. The man then lead them to the Wooden gargoyles. They then made a great escape from them. After a few more stunts took place, all the old friends reunited. The wizard then did another trick, and then Zeb went back to the ranch, and after Dorothy gave them a kiss, and said goodbye, she was gone in a madder of seconds.In this book the three main characters are, Dorothy, the wizard, adn Zeb. Dorothy was a little girl, who liked to take risk, and liked to have fun, but be careful about it at the same time. In this book, she was about eleven years old, she had blonde hair, and wore a shirt little white dress. instead of a dog, she onwned a cat named Eureka. The cat isn't mentioned very much, until the very end. Zeb is Dorothy's cousin, and he is pretty quite during the book. He is mentioned, and helps take care od buisness, and helps them get out of situations when they are in danger, or are trapped by somebody bad. In this book he is about thirteen, or so and does not talk very much. The wizard is very very talkitive. He likes to help people through times, and he likes to be in charge over everything. He knows alot about the land, and what is there, and what can happen. He is about in his fortys, but still is a great wizard, he helped out Dorothy from the funny looking thorney sorcerer by cutting him in half.

The original O'Neill illustrations are so wonderful in the other ones."},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"While all of Baum's books are great, overall I think this was the one that I enjoyed the most. Like the very first book, the plot is simple. Dorothy gets pulled into a magical world against her will, and she wants to get home. She then goes through a series of adventures trying to achieve her goal. Although the book has \\"In Oz\\" in the title, Dorothy and the Wizard spend very little time actually in Oz. But don't let this put you off. The underground lands that they pass through are every bit as exciting and magical as the different lands actually in Oz. The ending (how they escape the underground world) is a bit weak, but the imaginative countries that they pass through and the adventures they have in each more than make up for this. Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz is a book that you will want to start reading again as soon as you finish, but don't. Go on to the next Oz book and then the next. While I believe that this was the best of the 14 original books in the series, they are all wonderful and I would recommend that everyone read the entire series from beginning to end. And then try the books written by some of the other authors. While none are as inspired as those written by Baum, many of them are very good.And if you've read all the Oz books and are looking for other titles that are just as magical and just as inspired, try the Chronicles of Narnia, King Fortis the Brave or Abarat. All will introduce you to other magical worlds that are every bit as fun to visit as Oz."},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"This is one of my favorite Oz books. We see Dorothy and the Wizard reunite, of course, but there are some interesting things going on. The Wizard has become a grand character; Baum has thrown his own nature into him and has made him real to us. The Wizard is now a resourceful, sometimes devious, sardonic, yet compassionate man. The story delves into the bizarre with the Glass City and its vegetable people (and their gruesome demise). The Gargoyles are quite disturbing in their emotionally hollow, wooden world. The Braided Man of Pyramid Mountain provides dry humor (here we see Baum's love of puns). Esentially this is one of the more original works of Baum, with quixotic new characters, and further development of those we already knew. I think perhaps Ozma comes into her own in this novel; she is what a queen should be, loyal to her subjects, but not above the law; she is regal, kind yet firm, passionate and loving. Baum has created a fearsome yet beautiful per! sonage in Ozma. This is a great read; I would suggest it to non-Ozophiles so that the MGM movie can be challenged, and the true Oz can be appreciated in its majesty of fantasy, humor, horror, and splendor."},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"While not quite as compelling or dramatic as other installments in the Oz series, \\"Dororthy and the Wizard in Oz\\" is a pleasant follow up to \\"Ozma of Oz\\" (the strongest of all the early Oz entries). Baum doesn't try to accomplish too much in this tale--his main intent seems to get that humbug of a wizard back to Oz. Along the way there are some amusing adventures, populated with wonderful new creatures and characters. As a child, I especially enjoyed the scene (and illustration) in which the Wizard slices the vegetable king cleanly in half, though the escape from the gargoyles is also quite engaging. I think girls will love this book for the return of Dorothy and for the rascal, Eureka the kitten, while the boys will love the Wizard's dastardly sword and slights-of-hand that he performs throughout the book."},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"In this Oz adventure the wizard is reintroduced to the storyline in the darkest of Lyman Frank Baum's books about Oz. It starts with an earthquake and progresses through dark sectors of the earth. From the Glass city to the dragon layer near the crust of the Earth the whole story reminds me of Dante and his rungs of Hell, each layer having inhabitants that are queer and creepy. This dark adventure eventually concludes on a happy note but not before introducing us to exciting new characters and broadening the Oz universe. Dorthy and the Wizard of Oz is one of the stories I most cherish from L. Frank Baum because it is slightly creepy and dark. Amazingly creative and brilliantly written a book everyone will enjoy."},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"I think Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz is a exciteing book which is funny and intresting in a lot of ways.I read all the Oz books but I think this one is one of his best!I definetly rate this a 5 star book! From Hallie McPherson"},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"I have to admit I was very skeptical of how they were going to pull this one off.Dorothy and the Wizard, along with Road and Emerald City are the three Baum books that seemed like they'd be hardest to pull off in graphic novel format.Dorothy and the Wizard's problem arises because of the journey they take that is actually quite dark and exciting but then ends abruptly with a deus ex machina.Though that still does happen and in a way totally faithful to Baum's intentions, the rescue is made much more agreeable since it comes as no surprise and the travelers are actually waiting for it while trying to survive in the meantime.This has me so excited for Road to Oz, so I can see how they handle Baum's little plot hiccups in that story.In other words, they have actually taken an enjoyable story and made it better.The expressions are just so much fun, and though I didn't care for the Wizard much in the first book, this version fits him. His tricks against the Mangaboos are so much fun and Eureka is hilarious! She's actually more likeable in this version though her character is unaltered...I laughed at the crazy Wogglebug and the antics of the characters once the travelers reach Oz and you get to feel their urgency in the underground lands...though my childhood images of the Gargoyles were more frightening in my opinion, the land they live in is portrayed so surreal here! Each land is vastly different!If you love Oz you have to have this book...I don't know if I can wait until next year to read book 5...I may have to subscribe!Let's show Marvel this series has staying power and hope they continue it through Baum's Oz and possibly beyond!"},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"For the third time, Dorothy is swept up by terrifying events, this time falling through the earth in a California quake accompanied by a kid named Zeb, a horse called Jim, and Eureka the cat, who has replaced Toto. They all fall past weird, colored suns and land in the domain of the Mangaboos, who are vegetable people. True to nineteenth century plots (OK, this one was written in 1908), the natives are hostile, but the intrepid American kids and their animals defeat all the baddies. The kids are now accompanied by the Wizard, who, in his balloon, has also fallen through a crack. They fight with invisible bears and with flying wooden gargoyles before they reach Oz via a classic deus ex machina turn of events. The first three-quarters of the book is vintage Oz adventure stuff---kids will love it and so will you, no matter what age you are. I have loved this book ever since I first read it well over half a century ago. I remember how dark and dangerous it seemed to me then. The impressions of the underground scenes lasted in my mind for decades. Even when I read the end of Zola's \\"Germinal\\", I remembered DOROTHY AND THE WIZARD IN OZ--not perhaps so sophisticated a comment, but true anyhow. The last quarter is a kind of reunion, where we say hello to all the old characters and see how they are doing. It's like Baum ran out of ideas, but since he wrote a book every year, millions of kids were probably waiting for an update (similar to the Harry Potter series.) They would have been happy to read about their favorite characters again. I know I was.This volume in Baum's series may not be the most exciting or well-written, but it had a special atmosphere, very threatening, with more violence than normal in Oz books---cutting, shooting, burning, etc. The reunion and party scenes at the end, including the bad behavior of the American animals, and their return home, are probably too long. Still, if you are an Oz fan, or want to be, you can't miss DOROTHY AND THE WIZARD IN OZ."},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"Published in June 1908, Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz is the fourth book of L. Frank Baum's Oz series. Baum, the self-proclaimed Royal Historian of Oz, opens with a playful complaint to his \\"loving tyrants\\" that he has plenty of stories about other fantasy lands that he'd love to share, but he'll dutifully detail the latest of adventures of their favorite farmgirl Dorothy Gale.Fresh off the trip from Australia, the high-spirited heroine is on her way to join Uncle Henry at a California ranch before heading back home to Kansas. With her kitten Eureka (yes, as in \\"I found it!\\") in tow, the girl is picked up by her second cousin and new friend Zeb and his old cab horse Jim when a violent earthquake opens up the ground and swallows them all. After a lengthy tumble and the realization that both Jim and Eureka can now speak, the travelers find themselves in the strange land of the Mangaboos, cruel vegatable people who blame them for the Rain of Stones and sentence them all to death.Just then the humbug Wizard himself appears in a hot air balloon much like the one that blew him out of Oz so long ago. With his help, the others are able to escape these uncaring creatures and embark on an adventurous, many times dangeorus, journey back to the earth's surface. They travel through the Valley of Voe (a beautiful country where the people are invisible as well as the gruesome bears that eat them) and battle monstrous-looking Gargoyles (or Gurgles as Dorothy calls them), and climb the Pyramid Mountain before reaching the land of Oz.Mr. Baum crafted another winner to the series with this one. First of all, the Wizard (whose real name is Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkel Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs) is back and we get a deeper look at his life before and after his reign over the Emerald City. Jim is a no-nonsense, at times gruff, character who gets a bit of a big head when he gets to Oz, but he's brought back down to size by some of the inhabitants. I loved that part. Eureka, Eureka, Eureka. How deliciously mischievous and unapologetic she is. There are several moments when she speaks openly about wanting to eat at least one the Wizard's nine pet piglets and never demures when the others scold her for it. Once in Oz, she's put on trial after one of them goes missing and never once does the obstinant kitten break a sweat.The rest of the characters are enjoyable. Even the side ones like the Braided Man, an inventor who once lived above ground but fell into a hole of his own creation (he mostly manufactured holes for Swiss Cheese) and made his home halfway up Pyramid Mountain. He bides his time manufacturing rustles for silk skirts and uses colored ribbons to braid his long white hair and beard. He looks like a white Busta Rhymes or Lil' John. No lie. Lovely artwork as always by John R. Neill. His interpretation of the Wizard is less Mr. Magoo and more Robin Williams.The downside of this installment is how much darker and more scary it is than the first three books. The hair raising encounter with the invisible bears in particular. I was also annoyed that Dorothy gets the \\"damsel in distress\\" treatment this time around. She's not exactly helpless, but she's not as headstrong as before and mostly relies on the Wizard for help. A small gripe that doesn't take away from the story. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"Baum wrote a number of books about Oz. He called himself the \\"Royal Historian of Oz.\\" He wrote that he would have liked to compose other books, in addition to those on Oz, but \\"dear children\\" have flooded him with letters clamoring for more and more Oz books, so he is complying with their requests. This volume written in 1908 and still interesting today contains twenty tales. He tells about Princess Ozma, Jim the cab-horse, the nine piglets, Eureka the kitten, and Dorothy and the humbug wizard, of course. He promises to write about Dorothy's dog in his next book.His books are written in simple English with occasional near hard words that children should learn. His descriptions are vivid and are the kind that children delight in reading. For example, Baum describes a train \\"puffed and groaned and moved slowly away from the track.\\" Another examplle is Dorothy explaining why she called her cat Eureka. \\"I named my kitten that because I found it,\\" she explained. \\"Uncle Henry says 'Eureka' means 'I have found it.'\\" Another example is when a boy tried to get the horse to move, \\"Dorothy thought he just wiggled one of his drooping ears, but that was all.\\""},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"Up until our heros get to Oz, this is a fine book. It is nice to see the Wizard again. Jim, Zeb, and Eureka are interesting additions to the series. The underground lands of the Mangaboos, the Valley of Voe, the Braided Man, the Gargoyles, and the Dragonettes are all interesting places with interesting problems for our heros.Sadly, it falls apart when the character reach a dead end and must employ a Deus ex Machina (i.e. Ozma's magic mirror and the Nome King's wishing belt) to get themselves out of the jam and to Oz. (One problem, grasped immediately by my 5 y.o. is why Dorothy doesn't signal to Ozma, who checks in on her daily at a set time, much earlier and avoid a great deal of hardship and danger.)Having reached Oz, Zeb is somewhat lost in the re-introduction of old characters and a large dump of expository dialog between Ozma and the Wizard. Jim suddenly becomes a jerk, a troubling change in his characterization, and is pitted against the Sawhorse and the Hungry Tiger. Eureka likewise and inexplicably becomes a more sinister character, apparently deciding to kill and eat Ozma's pet piglet (although meat and fish are in ample supply when offered to Jim), prevented from doing so only by an accident. This leads to a nonsensical trial - although again the problem could have been readily solved by looking for the piglet with Ozma's mirror, or using the Nome King's belt to wish the piglet to appear, or by the piglet having called for help as it was searched for. (It may be that the piglets lose their voice in Oz even though they could speak while underground, although that does not seem to have been established.)At least for my daughter, the sudden change in characterization of Jim and Eureka was troubling, the trial and the threat of the Woodsman killing Eureka if she was guilty, and the revlation that she was almost guilty, led to an unsatisfactory end to a previously enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"Another fantastic novel by Mr. Baum. He is a great author, and to anyone reading this, I recommend all of his other books if you enjoyed this one. To anyone thinking about getting this book, do so! A fantastic book for any time! Plus, it's free! Try this book, and you will surely fall in love with Mr. Baum' s writings. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"I never knew there were more books than the \\"Wizard of Oz\\",but I'm so happy I've found them. This is one of my favorites by far; so very detailed that you can picture exactly what Baum is describing. What a magical, imaginative read! I didn't want it to end!"},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"Ever day-dream about falling into a crack in the earth and finding strange communities of people living underground? Me neither! Nor did I ever imagine that I'd read about a kitty on trial for murder! This one is strictly for those who can approach it as a child . . .Sorry. I confess right up front that I'm being completely uncritical here. If I were critical about the preposterous concepts, the lack of development of the new worlds visited, the flake-outs of the continuity of the series, or the shape of the plot, this one would not fare too well. Yet, I enjoyed it. I delighted in the wildly imaginative creatures, even if they were underdeveloped. I loved the unpredictability of what happens next and then what happens after that. Most of the book was a wacky \\"on the road\\" journey through cultures that exist underground. Near the end of the book, the cast arrives in Oz and has warm-fuzzy reunions with old friends-for the most part. Suffice it to say, some of the new members of the cast don't play well with others. Lastly there is court-room drama where a kitten is put on trial for murder. It's absurd, but if you can approach the book with the innocence of a child with wide surprised eyes, it's fun!"},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"Just bought this as a b-day gift for someone and received it yesterday (9/11/2012) and was surprised to see that the original publishing date was Sep 26, 2012 on the website and Sept 12, 2012 on the Marvel site..."},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is one of my favorite books, and the Oz series is one of my favorite series. I really enjoyed the 2 books that followed the first one, the Marvelous Land of Oz and Ozma of Oz. So by the time I got to this one, my expectations were high. I was incredibly disappointed.The plot is terrible. It is just a boring, rehash of what's already happened. I enjoy the similarity in the Oz books, but this is just an excuse to make money. Nothing important happens, nothing worthwhile is discovered, and the whole time I was sitting there waiting for excitement.The new characters are even worse. Eureka the Kitten, Zeb, and Jim the Horse. They add nothing new except annoyance. None of them beocome Oz regulars, and I didn't want them to. They all complain about how Oz is different and unusual, and Eureka even tries to murder some pigs they've befriended. Usually there are a few good, new characters in each book (Shaggy Man in Road to Oz; Tik-tok in Ozma of Oz; etc.), but not this time.The villains/antagonists are worse still. There are vegetable people who want to plant the heroes, wooden gargolyes who hate noise, and invisible bears that probably aren't really there at all.One of the worst parts is how much of the story was pointless (some SPOILERS may follow, if you still plan on reading this). For instance, Dorothy meets an old man. She is kind to him, so he give sher some supplies. I was thinking, \\"Well, later on those will come in handy.\\" Nope! They're never mentioned again. That whole part could be easily removed, and the story would either be the same or better. Then there's a part where \\"dragonettes\\" warn the heroes of their mother dragon. I was thinking, \\"Uh-oh, they'll surely run into that full-grown dragon prety soon.\\" Nope! It's never a concern. A dragon certainly would have been a better villain than a walking piece of food. Then there was a trial that was put on, because everyone thought Eureka killed a pig. This trial took up so many pages, and when Eureka is finally found guilty, she just shows them where the pig is, alive and well. Why didn't she do that right when they accused her? What was the point of the trial?! About 80% of the book is pointless.The main positive was that many great characters from the past returned at the end, though very briefly.But don't let this book stop you from reading the others. The Road to Oz and the Emerald City of Oz are really good. They are the next 2 books in the series. If you read the first 3, you might want to skip this one, or just read it for the full Oz story.So while I recommend this if you want to read them all, this really isn't that good of a book. Certainly don't start the series here, becuase it will give the wrong message. If it didn't relate to Oz (it barely did) and use familiar charcters (there were hardly any), then I would not like this book at all. If this book were a standalone, and not part of a series, I would not recommend it to anyone.5.5/10 (generous score)"},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"Yes, the story didn't end with 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'. I read the whole Gregory McGuire series on Oz and it's an interesting take. However, I wanted to know the back story and Amazon makes that any by making digital copies of out of print books available. Here we see Dorthy meeting up with the Wizard of Oz once more. We see Dorthy being caught and trying to get out. However, rather than take the easy way out she decides to have an adventure instead. With the help of some friends. In all this is a good story that introduces new characters that will be seen in future books. And some that we won't see again."},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"I read the e-book version of this book and after reading the first couple chapters I remember thinking that almost nothing made sense so far. But, that is what made it interesting, and it caused me to want to continue reading. In this book, Dorothy falls into a crack in the earth with a boy named Zeb and their horse and kitten. They later meet up with the Wizard. They discover some magical worlds, and they also pass through Oz. They have to travel through these worlds to get back to the top of the earth. This book is definately far from boring. It stimulates your imagination. However, there were a few parts which I thought were irrelevant to the story."},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"This is, so far, my favorite book in the series by far. This was a very intersting book and I liked how he brought back the wizard. All of the lands that were traveled to by our adventures were all very exciting to read about. I hope that the books continue to get more and more interesting! I would recommend this book to anyone of any age."},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"Great seller, the book arrived in pleanty of time for Santa to wrap it - Thank You this is one in a set of 16 OZ books Santa delivered"},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"When I was young, I had a collection of almost all the OZ books. But I was confused between \\"Dorothy And the Wizard in OZ\\" and the original \\"Wizard of OZ\\" (which is a much better book than was portrayed in the movie).I finally figured out that I didn't know how the Wizard had gotten back to OZ since he was shown there in the later books, and that it must have occurred in this book. But I never could find it.This book seems to be an on-demand book published as needed from a computer file. It's an okay read and I'm sure youngsters who are fans of the series would enjoy it. But it doesn't show any of the delightful illustrations that helped create the ambience of the series. I'll share it with my granddaughter as part of the series in order, but I think there are others in the series which are better."},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"This is another good yarn for the kiddos. Baum's storytelling holds up well and his little lessons are timeless (e.g. the dragonettes insisting beauty is the eye of the beholder) in this unique take on a center-of-the earth story. The science is a bit poor in this book as we see earthquakes swallowing people whole, California being beset by gaping quakes every half hour, gravity lessening at the earth's core, and so forth. Nonetheless, this is easy to look past when the audience is small children as opposed to teenagers.All said and told, this was the least interesting story so far in my opinion, but fine for my young son and fine enough for me to continue purchasing the series."},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"This is the best Oz story I have read so far! Infact it is one of the best books I have ever read! In the begining Dorothy went to California to visit her cousin.

What happens next find out for your selfes!"},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"\\"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\\" is the fourth Marvel graphic novel by Eric Shanower and Skottie Young, based on L. Frank Baum's \\"Wizard of Oz\\" books. It is another fine adaptation sure to be enjoyed by old and new fans of the series.As the story opens, Dorothy, her cat Eureka, her cousin Zeb, and Zeb's bony old horse Jim drop through an earthquake-caused crack in California and wind up in a land far, far below the earth's surface. Here, gravity is neutralized and Dorothy and Zeb's animals can suddenly talk. Unfortunately, they are not welcome with the locals, animated vegetable people who live in glass houses and dislike so-called meat people. Fortunately, Dorothy and her friends are joined by the former Wizard of Oz, who drops in via his balloon from a fair in California. Thus begins a long journey back to the surface, as Dorothy, Zeb and the Wizard, with a little help from nine piglets and some old friends, surmount a series of obstacles.\\"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\\" is a more complicated story than its predecessors. The dark journey back to the surface requires Dorothy and her friends to think their way past some rather startling creatures. Many of the returning characters have a prior history, including the former Wizard of Oz and Ozma, the present ruler of Oz. Dorothy's and Zeb's chances of getting home will ultimately hang on the wits of the Wizard and the outcome of a trial. This adaptation captures the wonder, drama, and humor of the original story with its excellent pacing and quirky but effective artwork. It is highly recommended to fans of the Marvel series of Oz adaptations and of the original Baum stories."},{"Title":"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,","review":"Marvel went a fourth round with the original Oz books. Based on the L. Frank Baum book of the same name, Eric Shanower returns to adapt it, and Skottie Young comes back to do the enchanting artwork.Dorothy is still in California on her trip with her Uncle along with her kitten Eureka(no mention of where she came from since Ozma Of Oz, and visiting her cousin Zeb. While Zeb's horse Jim pulls them back to Zeb's place, an earthquake occurs, and our heroes fall threw a giant crack in the Earth. Floating softly to the inner world of the Mangaboos, Dorothy is reunited with The Wizard who shows up in his old balloon. After messing with the Mangaboos' monarchy musical chairs game, they enter the Valley of Voe to meet invisible citizens and ghastly gargoyles. One of the more interesting anomalies they run into is a nest of young dragons waiting for their mother to return. Eventually, Ozma uses the Magic Belt to wish all of them to Oz, and makes The Wizard her official Court Wizard, meaning she allows him to use magic. After a very silly trial were Eureka is accused of eating one of the Wizard's piglets he uses in his magic act, Dorothy and Co. are sent back to America.Like the previous three Marvel adaptations, this was pretty close to the original source material. They seemed to not go into the detail that the novel did in regards to some of the Wizard's origins, plus how he spirited Ozma as a baby away to the care of Mombi. The extended cast of Oz gets some good scenes in this too, like the Sawhorse having a race with Zeb, and the Wogglebug in his court wig is especially funny. Even the brief cameo of the Gump's head is welcome.After this, Marvel seemed to discontinue it's standard 8-issue run as their version of The Road To Oz is a 6-issue mini-series. This might be due to to the fact that the story has less content than the other books, or it might be a change in their format.

Having traveled through many of them, I can attest their taste is good. Seeing the majestic Shawnee National Forest is like seeing what Adam and Eve might have enjoyed had Eden been located in southern Illinois.With all of the 120 drives, there are roughly 10-20 stops, each with a descriptive paragraph. Decorating each drive are photos of special sites or animals. Maps with insets demonstrate the context of the drive inside each state.Not every great site has a stop. Illinois' gorgeous Starved Rock Park is missing, but only because so much of America is beautiful. To include every place of beauty would cause this 400 page book to be 40,000 pages.While it makes a nice coffee table book, there is plenty to read. It can help inspire deeper research for your next family adventure.I fully recommend \\"The Most Scenic Drives in America (Most Scenic Drives in America): 120 Spectacular Road Trips\\" by Readers Digest.

Though my preference would be to hop a plane to the UK, of which I never become tired, my wife thinks I'm in a rut in that regard, so we're likely as not to spend 7-10 days traveling U.S. roads by flivver. THE MOST SCENIC DRIVES IN AMERICA is a reminder that there's a lot to see without the need for a passport and, for one as afflicted with insatiable wanderlust as myself, the book represents temptations akin to those in a Godiva shop for a chocoholic.Unlike your standard coffee table book, THE MOST SCENIC DRIVES IN AMERICA is enormously useful. Its 120 scenic drives are divided among four regions: The Western States (24 drives), The Rocky Mountain States (29 drives), The Central States (26 drives), and The Eastern States (41 drives). The volume begins with one-page maps of each region with each drive numbered and drawn-in with a red squiggle in case you want to see their relative positions and combine more than one in a single road adventure.Each numbered drive is sequentially described, 2-6 pages each, and supplemented with gorgeous color photographs - 400 total. Each description includes a route map on which the cities and towns and road numbers are shown and the main attractions along the way pinpointed. Each attraction is summarized. Finally, each drive has its own \\"Trip Tips\\": length in miles, when to go, \\"words to the wise\\", nearby attractions, and where to go for further information. As an example:The Eastern States, Drive #96, Pennsylvania Dutch Country, 2 pages, 2 photos. Listed attractions: Intercourse (a town, tiger, with a quilt museum), Ephrata Cloister (another town, built by the Seventh-Day Baptists), Landis Valley Museum (focusing on the PA Dutch with 80,000 items), Lancaster (a city with an historic Central Market), Marietta (another town, with a preserved silk mill), Hans Herr House (a home dating from 1719), and Strasberg (another town, with the Railroad Museum of PA). Length - 80 miles. Popular year-round. Bring a cooler to store food purchased at roadside stands, which are mostly closed on Sunday. Chocolate World at Hershey is nearby. Address and phone number for the PA Dutch Visitors Bureau.So, I might ask the little woman: \\"Honey, how about a spin along Cape Cod's Sandy Shores (#91), or through the Wisconsin North Woods (#58), or along Devil's Tower Loop (#35), or on the Loneliest Road in America (#16)?\\"But, just between you and me, several days in London and a leisurely exploration of the Devon and Cornwall coasts is my E-ride."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"Me and my wife were able to follow about a dozen out of the 120 sugested road trips, in very diferent locations of USA (Florida, New England and California/Nevada/Arizona).

I'm so thankful my husband likes to drive."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone who loves to drive around and visit scenic areas. It's true that there is plenty of free tourist information about big cities and over-crowded festivals, motels and hotels, and fancy restaurants, but I just love to get into the car or RV and get away from all that. I like to see the deserts, mountains, rivers, lakes, Indian reservations, and small towns - anywhere away from the crowds.This book covers 120 beautiful road trips from one end of the United States to the other and everywhere in between. It has lots of photos and general route maps (though I think I'd take an atlas or more detailed road map along, too). It makes me want to get into my little RV and take a long drive for about a year or two and see everything! I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves road trips."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"This book was such a hit with my family that I ordered one for my sister who loves to travel. Easy maps to follow and great details regarding the sites listed."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"This is a very good book. Very helpful planning trips."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"Exactly the kind of book to plan a trip. It is very informative, and is short and to-the-point. A pleasure to own."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"My husabnd and I have taken MANY of the scenic drives in this book, combining as many as 4 or 5 in one trip. We love this book. It is informative, the maps are easy to read and we have never been disappointed in any of the drives we have taken. I would recommend this book above many other tour books I have purchased. America really is BEAUTIFUL."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"Well worth the money. Liked the book so much I also purchased one for my Dad."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"A wonderful tool for US road trips. See America first and start with this book as your guide."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"This book is a pretty good idea generator if you're in the planning stages of a trip. My wife and I are planning a 25th anniversary trip and decided to see a bit of the US rather than going abroad. The book is helpful to get you thinking about possibilities. I know of some of the trips they recommend and they are nice. It's an excellent coffee table book."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"There are several excellent reasons to invest in this outstanding book. First it's an excellent reference guide that can assist us in getting the most out of our vacation plans and travel decisions. Every one of the 120 highway / road trip covered in this 400 page book includes several stunning and outstanding quality pictures plus a brief synopsis of the area, a map and short descriptions of numerous interesting stops to check out on our jaunts, oh, and trip tips also. This beautiful book would have been tremendously beneficial before our recent 7 state trip because SO MUCH excellent information and insight is given; we would have made far better route choices than our atlas and various web sites had recommended as supposedly \`scenic routes'.Even more importantly, the purchaser will be prone to use and enjoy this beautiful, extremely interesting coffee table book much more than our houseguests or office visitors will (BUT don't let them borrow it!). It's laid out perfectly for reading a little bit during TV commercials or during a quick break from my daily tasks. So with only a short amounts of rare spare time I've been getting to know quite a bit about these awesome area 's of America. And I've already acquired quite a bit more knowledge about these impressive blessings that are scattered all across our little splotch of this awesome mother earth.To address / challenge the first reviewer's unfortunate event of bad Karma. With SO MUCH to see and do all along these 120 awesome road trips, I really doubt if most persons would expect ALL of the flower-fields, buildings, hotels, camp grounds, historic markers or turn-outs to remain unchanged for all of eternity. Change is the only constant in life but these phenomenal highways will STILL remain gorgeous, unforgettable life experiences for a few more centuries; if we can't visit them all, I suggest that we can at least experience them from an excellent books like this one."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"Upon first opening the book I checked to see if someof my favorite drives were included and for the mostpart they were. I do have some favorites that weren'tincluded but I still think that this book is wellworth buying. I will be taking it on future trips."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"I have not yet travelled, but am planning my trip using this marvellous book as a guide! I certainly reccomend it to anyone that does not have a clue what to see, and wishes to plan a trip factoring in a scenic drive to make the best of the trip."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"Wonderful, wonderful book. It gave me details about places that I have never seen but would like to someday. The details are great and they all sound like wonderful places to visit. I fantasize about the places when my day is going bad and transport myself to a better place. Definitely buy it."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"Good Book. Maps & Travel Destination info is well done & helpful in selecting destinations & selecting colorful & interesting routes to get there"},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"I have this book out from the library and am buying it on here tonight. It is fantastic, with great pics and great trip ideas. The only bad thing I see is that sometimes there are some boring parts included to create a loop (US 14 west of Greybull in Wyoming, M-28 Seney to Shingleton in Michigan). Sometimes it would just be nicer to double back, but it is a fantastic book, and $18 is a great value!Steve Lockwood, Inver Grove Heights, MN"},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"My daughter got this book for me for Christmas last year. I love to go on scenic drives and do a lot of driving for my job. This past summer I decided to break out the book and go on a couple of the New England drives as I live in Connecticut. The first and only one we did was a drive to Rhode Island. The directions and the map were not very clear resulting in missed turns, added time and frustration. The description of the drive however was right on the money, which is why I wanted to do it. What was supposed to be a relaxing Sunday turned into a agitated mess because of the directions. Clarity should be key. As I said I drive a lot for my job and have clear concise directions is a key to getting someplace without difficulty."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"Robert Dolezal has produced a spectacular drive guide. It is not just for the armchair traveller, although it fulfill's this role perfectly, but it acts as a pre-hoilday guide for fly-drive travellers visiting new England and unsure of what routes to take. The guide gets you off the beaten track and discovers those parts of new England that you would never stumble across by accident.A book of spectacular drives and worth every penny."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"This is a wonderful book for anyone who enjoys seeing America by car. Great pictures and great suggestions for side trips. Wherever you live or travel this book will list something near you. Also a great gift for those who travel."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"The book has so many beautiful pictures of the picturesque places to drive in the US it made me want to jump in the car and go. Well, I did when I was in Massachusetts. I drove on the historic Mohawk Trail on my way to Williamstown, MA and let me tell you how breathtaking it really was. Take your kids on these drives for historical experience that's not only fun but also awe inspired."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"If you're looking for a great way to spend your vacation time this summer, I'd highly recommend taking a trip listed in The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips.Rather than leading you to a specific place in America, this book focuses on the beauty of the journey as you drive your car along lakes and beaches, hills and mountains, flowers and trees, and a variety of historic sites in the United States.This book provides maps that assist readers with planning a road trip and the gorgeous photographs definitely will entice you to visit these glorious areas of our country. Expect to return from these trips feeling rejuvenated and refreshed.What's especially helpful about this book is that you can plan a cross country adventure or, if you're limited in time, you can enjoy a shorter trip that still lifts your spirits and recharges your batteries. Go by yourself, go with a friend or take the entire family. Just get out and enjoy the summer!"},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"This book is organized extremely well and has a good amount of detail. In addition, the photographs are beautiful. It gives some of the highlights of each state. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get off the Interstate and see this beautiful and unique country of ours."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"I am a road trip ethusist. And therefore, when I came across this book, I knew I had to buy it. What I like the most about this book is the careful selected trips the author put together. I have been to about 10% of the trips outlined in this book and when I read through those sections, this book is right. Not only does it tell you where the \\"must see stops\\" are, it also tells you approximate mileage, time needed, as well as other useful information for your trip. And flipping through those spectacular trips in the rest of the book made me want to explore U.S. that much more. I highly recommend this book as a starting point, or the main source, for your road trip planning."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"My husband and I have done many of the scenic drives in this book and we always enjoy the commentary that goes with each one. We have learned so much and enjoyed the destinations more than if we were just driving along on our own. I play tour guide as I read the descriptions of each place we stop on the drive. The photos are really spectacular too! Keep in on the coffee table and be sure to take it along in the car on road trips. What a beautiful country we live in. Get out and see it."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"If you are a serious traveller who &quot;clips and keeps&quot; travel information, then this book is not for you. If you are a &quot;some time traveller&quot; then you might enjoy this book. I found that this book includes mostly items which are found in the state highway guides published by every state which most serious travellers would already have. However, the pictures were pretty, but I don't like to spend that much money for pretty pictures!"},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"I strongly considered returning this book. The possibility of identifying for future exploration the 120 most scenic drives in America was intriguing. The drives may be spectacular but you would never know it from this book. The narrative was sparse and uninviting. The pictures were scant and unimpressive. Maybe my expectations were too great but I feel strongly that this book lacked in fundamental ways. This book will not inspire me to take any trips soon but I did keep it as a basic reference or starting point."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"I purchased this book as I already owned and use the 2nd edition. While I live in Indiana and there are not many scenic byways in this state, I really purchased the book for an annual \\"Two For The Road\\" trip I take with my car buddy Larry Cox. The maps for our week long adventures are usually based upon this book and another reference book that I have purchased called \\"the most scenic drives in America: 120 spectacular road trips\\". I recommend that you purchase both books, however, if you can only afford one, purchase most scenic drives in america as they have more details about stops along each byway. So while scenic drives is a great book to plan, the national geographic guide is easy to take along, carry on the plane, etc. It is an excellent reference book. I won't leave home without it!"},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"Beautiful Coffee Table Book....The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips....Beautiful pictures and they have nice stories with great information about many great place to see in the United States!~"},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"A valuable item for the library of any veteran traveller. The road trips, though outlined briefly, give with the additional photographs a quick outline of the countryside to be covered and an appreciation of what will lie ahead for road users and their travelling companions.The work is not definitive and extra preparation is required for specific travelling information. None the less a good place to start."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"I think my husband's parents will love this book since they like to take long road trips. This book is bigger than I expected and very thick. More of a coffee table, trip planning book than a take along guide."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"I had the very first book written about the scenic drives in America and used it on many of our trips all over the U.S. I decided to buy the updated version and am very pleased with it and will use it in May for our next drive through 4 states. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"This book was an awesome buy. Great road trip ideas with beautiful photos and detailed maps. We have now done several of the trips in this book and have enjoyed all of them. The one time we found ourselves without it, we went by a bookstore to find it so we could read its recommendations for road trips in the area.It is a little big. We get around that by either taking pictures of the pages we want and taking the camera with us, or photocopying desired pages. If we know we are going to be in our car the whole time, we just take the whole book.I bought this for my boyfriend, who loves driving. Excellent buy and excellent gift for the road trip enthusiast."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"I have been having this book for years and it is the first thing I put in the car when we leave home.

I AM VERY EXCITED TO START OUR JOURNEY ACROSS AMERICA. THANKS TO THIS BOOK WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE MANY MANY BEAUTIFUL AND INTERESTING PLACES."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"I just want to applaud the authors for their thoroughness in not only creating a book that inspires a nationwide exploration of America, but also in the way that the book is logically and easily organized. The book seeks to include relevant information that can be used for the begnning of a road adventure, but doesn't bog the book down in excessive details. A note to potential purchasers: this is NOT a book of elaborate photographs. While some of the photos are very inspiring, they are merely teasers to encourage the reader to go out and make the discoveries themselves. I'm glad I purchased this book. My parents enjoyed looking through it so much that I gave them my copy and purchased another for myself."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"Looking for a combination of Drives to get the best out of a Touring Holiday in the USA - you need this book! It is easy to link together many of the \\"120 Spectacular Road Trips\\" to form a fantastic itinerary to see the best scenery and sights the USA has to offer. It's better than the more specialised \\"Route 66\\" and \\"Lincoln Highway\\" drives for visitors to the USA who are wanting to experience a broader cross section of US history and its stunning geography. Maps are clear, colour photography whets the appetite and cultural and scenic highlights are picked out in the commentary. Combined with the use of a simple Tom Tom style GPS system the book would provide the solution for visitors planning a Touring experience of the USA - from the smallest local scale to an epic journey covering the best of the nation."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"This book has become the cornerstone for planning our family vacations over the next 10 years.

A very worthwhile purchase."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"I very rarely rave about a travel book but The Most Scenic Drives in America deserves it. This book is beautifully put together with maps, photographs and research on the drives. I have taken most of the drives in the Midwest and East Coast and can't wait to explore more parts of the country outlined in the book. I really like the way the book is laid out by region and each individual trip/drive includes an overview map of the drive with recommendations for the \\"must see\\" stops along the route and offers up options for worthwhile side trips if you have extra time in the area.The only downside of the book is it's size, it is definitely meant to be a coffee table book not to actually take with you. But this hasn't stopped me from hauling it with me across the country!"},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"This book makes you want to get into your car immediately and start driving.

Some side-trips are not worth missing, so information-at-hand will help you to get there, w/o stopping anywhere to get local directions."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"I love to travel and this book will be a welcome reference for your road trips. Beautifully bound with gorgeous pictures, this book will please you for years to come."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"As Australians traveling throughout the States in a motorhome, we found this book invaluable. Whilst there are plenty of other travel books, The Most Scenic Drives in America gave us a concise and unbiased overview of what to see in every State, without all the advertising about where to eat and what to buy. A \\"Must Have\\" book, and a great souvenir of our travels."},{"Title":"The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips","review":"I bought this book for my parents who are retired to inspire them to explore the country.

Whilst nostalgia demands we should be concerned that, with the exception of the Queen Mary (and now the QE2) none of the great ships from history have been preserved, there is a very good reason why their seagoing lives are short. Liners were built to compete in terms of opulence and speed in order to attract customers. As technology evolved so even the greatest soon became obsolete. That said, had they been made of bricks and mortar, they might have been preserved as listed buildings but there is no equivalent system for the preservation of ships.This is one of those books which is hard to put down. It is a large, thick tome full to the brim with photographs, illustrations, text and stories. By stories, I refer to the death of an actress on one crossing whose body was never found and the famous arrest of Dr Crippen. Just open the work at any page and start reading and, as I say, it really is hard to put down.Just about everything one might expect to discover and learn about some of the greatest ships the world has ever seen is here. But so it should be, this work was a labour of love and took the author over 15 years to complete. All can say is that it shows and his time was well spent.Altogether, an excellent product.NM"},{"Title":"Easy True Stories: A Picture-Based Beginning Reader","review":"The school-age ESL student I worked with found the stories to be challenging and intriguing. Topics such as a woman with hundreds of tattoos and a flying car kept interest high while working on reading comprehension skills. Each story is set up to be an independent lesson that can be effectively taught without any prior preparation."},{"Title":"Easy True Stories: A Picture-Based Beginning Reader","review":"This is one more of a remarkably effective and well-thought out series. I have almost every level so far and each book has added enormously to my English classes. Even so, I was hesitant to get this level because I didn't see how the layout was going work. I needn't have worried.The previous level book (Very Easy True Stories) is set up so that there are illustrations with captions. This level has the the same clear illustrations, but the story is written in paragraph form on the the facing page. What I do is use the book as a speaking tool. I have my students read the story and then tell it to one of their classmates, or to me, pointing to the illustrations to help them continue. Having the story on the opposite page means that I can cover up the words and so they have to search their minds for the appropriate vocabulary instead of continually looking for the word on the page.I have used this method with students from every leel and because the stories are so captivating, it works very well for all. The students are barely conscious that they are learning new vocabulary; they are excited to be speaking and telling an interesting story.Each story is followed by exercises which reenforce the vocabulary and act as indicators as to whether the student has understood both the specifics and the general idea of the text.I hope that the author comes out with a second part of this level as she's done with the first level."},{"Title":"Easy True Stories: A Picture-Based Beginning Reader","review":"An earlier review talks about how well this book works for school-age students. I teach ESL to adults, and my students love this book. Some of them have copied the stories out of the book, even though I never give them an assignment to do that. The progression from Very Easy True Stories to this book (Easy True Stories) to True Stories is really well done. The English is closely attached to drawings in the easiest book, but as the series gets more advanced the drawings - the \\"training wheels\\" - gradually lose their importance."},{"Title":"Easy True Stories: A Picture-Based Beginning Reader","review":"In an effort to teach my neighbors English, I went to the library and reviewed many of the TESL books in my local branch. I borrowed several and found this one to be the best for starting reading. The stories are extracted from newspaper articles that are gossipy and that have vocabulary words related to current life. For example, there are stories about true love, tatoos, how to find a spouse, etc.The articles are charming and they are good humoured. My neighbors got a good laugh out of the first story about a couple with mattress problems. This was a great beginning for their work with me. The other stories have helped the students open up and talk about their lives in English.I do think the exercises after the stories could be more relevant and more conducive to drilling. I can't move through the book very quickly because it doesn't pick out grammar and idioms for my students to study. However, it has some very good conversation topics in the teacher section. It also has some writing exercises.In the past, I have taught foreign languages to high school students but never English as a Second Language to adults. This is a new experience for me. I do think that this is the best material I have found so far to keep the students engaged and get them thinking about the words they need in daily life.It will take a long time to finish all the articles and then I will be able to update this review."},{"Title":"Easy True Stories: A Picture-Based Beginning Reader","review":"I have several of these books for my class of adult beginning readers. The stories are funny, amazing, and interesting to read. The vocubulary is not childish or over simplified for first year adult students with limited education. They love the stories and illustrations and get excited and want to talk about them. If I had any complaints it would be that the stories are two short - only a couple or three paragraphs long, but they have a whole page of comic book style pictures and a half page photo of the subject, with with the story under it. There are two pages of vocabulary, comprehension and discussion work sheets with each story. We use these every week."},{"Title":"Monna Vanna","review":"An extrodinary Play. In the style of romantic realism, it documents the events surrounding a military seige, and how one woman can save the city if she spends a night with the enemy general.

I have all of her books and have to say that they are all wonderful! They are a series type, revolving around a hockey team, \\"The New York Blades\\", and its players and former players. Having gotten hooked on hockey in college and living in the Detroit Metro area, I have to say these books were a very nice surprise!! Not only do they involve a little hockey, but have wonderful characters and story lines. Love them!! *;o)"},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"As a hockey fan, I appreciated the setting of this book. I like the way Deidre Martin writes: snappy, sexy, fast-paced, action-packed yet tender too. The sexual tension and banter was well written and witty, without coming across as hostile and abrasive. The characters were well-drawn, likable despite their flaws. I especially appreciated the subplot of caring for and mentoring Tuck. Both protagonists make a huge difference in his young life, each in their own special way. Kudos to the author for a wonderful story, and I can't wait to read the others in the series."},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"No longer Michael Dante's tomentor, PVD comes back as a tragic hero in the latest winner from Deirdre Martin.

Once upon a time, she was a true ugly duckling, but now she has become a professor swan; highly successful, and beautiful. Paul Van Dorn was the hero, hockey star, heart throb in school, who made Katie miserable. One too many concussions has put him out of the game, sending him back home to run a sports bar and coach a peewee hockey team. Seeing each other again is a surprise for both Katie and Paul, but now they are going to see a lot more of each other as Katie's shy nephew is on Paul's team. Moreover, Katie is writing a scholarly paper on sports, and needs Paul's input. Time together leads to romance, but Katie does not want to stay in town, where Paul does intend to stay forever, or at least for a long time. Besides, there are conflicts of interest inherent in their relationship, and it just wouldn't be a good idea. Try telling that to their hearts.*** Katie represents many women's dreams; being able to go back home as a bigger success than anyone could have believed and getting the best guy in the process. While it's hard to imagine a hockey themed book brimming with sensitivity and caring, this one does. It also has a lot of laughs, so you will enjoy this romance. ***Amanda Killgore"},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"I just had my ten year reunion, so I felt like I fit right into place with the characters in the book. And, I too, like Katie Fisher was a heavier girl in high school and have since lost the weight. I really enjoy reading books where I feel like I can jump into a character's shoes and feel right at home.Paul Van Dorn's character had bit parts in the novels previous to this. He was always a bit cocky and a show man, so to see him humbled by his hockey career ending early made for an interesting character in this book. Paul was the hockey jock in high school and one of the most popular guys around. So, it makes sense that he wouldn't have dated Katie Fisher. But, of course, 10 years can change things.It is a funny, romantic novel. Light hearted and fast paced. I really enjoy Deirdre Martin's books. This is a great story!"},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"I happen to be a big fan of deirdre martin's books, and i was eagerly awaiting the publication of \\"The Penalty Box.\\" All i can say is, she did not disappoint! I found her book by turns funny, charming, and touching. She has an excellent ear for dialogue and most important, she tells a wonderful love story. I would come home after work, turn on the answering machine, and just lose myself in her characters. Well done, Deirdre Martin!"},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"I had such high hopes for this book because I thought Paul was going to be the Paul we'd been introduced to in Michael's story. Wrong! Why Paul put up with Katie, I have no idea. And though I wanted to like her for him, I really didn't get the chance because most of the book was not about THEM, it was about her, her nephew and her messed up sister (don't even get me started on that one!). When Paul did get into the picture, he was more of a fixture, not believable at all. And the ending was SO anticlimactic. Very rushed and not fulfilling."},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"I really liked this installment of the New York Blades series. This is not a hot romance story, but more the story of Katie's life after moving back with her mother, with her involvement with Paul being only one part. However, there is so much real emotion in the telling of the story, that it all adds up to a terrific read."},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"So this was my 3rd Martin book. And so far this one was the funniest. I definitely laughed out loud several times through out. The main character Katie is quite sarcastic and adds many humorous moments.Paul was a major NHL star, but was forced to retire because of injuries. Katie is a sociology professor at a college she loves, but takes a sebatical (at age 28? That part was kind of unrealistic to me) to write a book. She used to be the fat, smart, unpopular girl in high school, and Paul was the hot popular guy. At their 10 year high school reunion they meet again, and Paul goes head over heels for the \\"new\\" thin Katie.The thing i like so far about Martin's books are that the plot lines are a bit more realistic relationship wise. I get so tired of reading stories where two people fall in love in 24 hours. Martin's stories usually have the couple to know each other for at least months or years. Thanks for the depth.The thing I don't like about her books- the abrupt ridiculous endings. I don't want to give anything away so i will not spoil what happens.... but i was disappointed. Katie's character needed more umph and depth.All in all I enjoyed the book and had a hard time putting it down. I just wish the ending was more true to the story and all the effort you put into reading it. I felt like Martin just wrapped it up abruptly for a deadline."},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. But the one issue I had with it was Katie's obsessive behavior concerning her weight. I understand that the character had been overweight in her past but having her stress over every little morsel of food she ate that wasn't healthy was a bit over the top. The girl wasn't going to gain 50 lbs overnight from eating a donut.I did love the relationship between the two characters and Katie's interaction with her nephew."},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"This is the best book I have read in a long time. I enjoyed it so thouroughly I could not put it down and read the entire 300 and some pages on Sunday.This is my first Deirdre Martin book and I must say I was pleasently suprised. The dialoug was witty, necessary and engaging. The characters were deep and human. And the love story was both believable and passionate.It was also more than a love story. It was about two people returning to their home town and reconciling their past. Along with this, they had to make some decisions on how their relationship fit into it.The entire story was nicely developed and the characters came to life. Definately worth the read."},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"I kept putting off reading Dierdre Martin...see I read a bunch of other authors, so I didn't want to add to my list...WHAT A MISTAKE! She is a fabulous writer. I was caught from the 1st sentence. You really get to know these characters...so much that you cry when they cry and you laugh (sometimes outloud) when they laugh. Dierdre is such a talented writer. I am waiting (not very patiently) for her next book, Chasing Stanley. Please don't make the same mistake I made...don't wait to read these books, GET THEM NOW, and enjoy them as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"This book was a refreshing break from some of the really heavy paranormal or historical romances I've read lately. Yeah, it's a bit superficial and light, but it was written well, and kept my interest. I finished the entire book in a day, whereas sometimes I can take days to slog through a book. The author has a good style and is very witty, at times this book made me smile or even laugh out loud, and that's just the thing for a good summer romance book."},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"The Penalty Box is funny, entertaining and dramatic at the same time. Her characters are not perfect, they are flawed, insecure and generally manage to mess up the whole situation without any effort at all.In my opinion Deirdre Martin writes some of the most appealing heroes in modern romance, because they are neither incredible smooth, though or in any ways superhuman at all, but very endearing.I really recommend that or any other book by her."},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. After reading \\"Body Check,\\" I didn't know if \\"The Penalty Box\\" could live up to my expectations. I like how the book wasn't so fast and had a slow pace so that I could get a real feel of Katie and Paul getting to know each other. The only reason I gave this book a 4 rather than a 5 is because I wish the end was more conclusive. Maybe an epilogue or something would have made me feel more fulfilled at the end. Other than that, it was a great read and all the other stuff really makes the book worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"Deirdre Martin writes books that are enjoyable, easy to read, and full of sly humor and strong secondary relationships. The Penalty Box is certainly a fun, light read, but my honest opinion is that it's easily forgotten, and not the kind of book that I'll re-read or recommend.For one thing, I had trouble with the fact that Katie, formerly overweight and mocked in high school, transformed into a thin, gorgeous woman that Paul, the high school hockey hero, immediately hits on. Maybe this is just a personal issue, but I hate it in romances when the author turns an overweight girl into a skinny stunner. It would have been more interesting to me if Katie had been thinner and more attractive, (but not perfect-looking, because really, how many of us are perfect looking or can readily root for a woman that is?) and then charmed Paul with her wit, rather than her new hot body. I realize romances are about wish fulfillment, but for me, a more fun fantasy involves reading about a man taken with a woman he once ignored because she challenges him as much as she turns him on. Having Paul wowed by Katie's model-perfect looks felt too easy to me, and not especially compelling. Plus, Paul never came alive for me, either. He was a nice guy who had once been a jerk in high school and not much else. I also thought Katie was able to put aside her hurt at some of the horrible things he'd once done to her way too easily just because Paul was cute and attracted to her now thin self.I did like the family dynamics, although I thought Katie's mother was a poorly drawn, cliched character, given stilted dialogue. The romance had some good moments, and Martin does write some solid romantic dialogue, but I never felt swept up in Paul and Katie's relationship.This is not a bad book; I don't regret reading it. But I wouldn't say it's a can't miss romance, either."},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"Penalty Box does not dissapoint any fan of Deirdre Martin's. It also should be on the list for anyone who love's great writing, humor and characters portrayed with realism and honesty.

I found myself going ho-hum most of the time. The story could have been more in depth and it seemed like Ms. Martin was just trying to fill up the pages so she could sell a book. The romance was sweet but not as hot as it could have been. I will keep reading her books and hope this is the only one I found to be a dud."},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"This book wasn't bad. It was cute at parts and flowed right along. I have on major complaint. The end seemed rather abrupt. It seems as if our characters had various things to overcome, and *poof* the book ended. I felt like I had bother to read this book and was somewhat disappointed. I don't want to give anything away, but this wouldn't be my first choice for a romantic read."},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"Like the other books of Martin's I've read, this one makes good light reading. The book is amusing and cute, but lacking in the depth that would make it a truly good book. It's all just very superficial. She skimps past the real issues, never digging down to the true emotions and problems. Martin doesn't do justice to the characters, their pasts, and their situations.Paul was introduced in at least one of her other books that I've read. In that book, he was a total prick until near the end. This was addressed with about two sentences in the current book. It should have been talked about and dissected a bit. Because she didn't, there was a lack of realism with Paul's character. As for Katie...she pissed me off a lot. She was very self-focused to the point that it was annoying. And there was the whole issue with her weight that is mentioned a lot, but never really dealt with.Overall, like I said, it's a cute story and good if you want some light reading, but if you want something deeper, I wouldn't recommend Martin's books. I tend to read them only because they involve hockey players.Rating: 2.5 / 5"},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"I didn't like Martin's other books \\"Body Check\\" and \\"Fair Play\\", and this one is just as bad. Katie's humor is dry and she tries too hard to be funny when it is not. I particularly do not like stories where the reject-turned-hotty are so easily compliant to the popular jerks that they had a \\"crush\\" on back in high school. If the guy treated you bad, why would you have feelings for him? Paul is like a big kid stuck in a grown man's body and he was being a prick throughout the entire story. Katie's sister Mina who happened to be a teenage mother is one horrible person to read about. The dialogue is like a convoluted mess. Katie and Paul talk to each other like children, and some of the words spoken are not okay to be said among lovers.

Katie's not just smart, she's hilarious, delivering the snappy comebacks we all wish we could come up with. Of course, she developed her humor back in those difficult high school days to compensate for her perceived inadequacies which she has never quite shaken off.Paul Van Dorn also attends the reunion. Unlike Katie, he was the most popular guy in school since he was gorgeous and brilliantly talented athletically. He went on to a major league hockey career with the New York Blades which was cut short by a succession of serious injuries. He's gone back to his hometown to buy a sports bar, called The Penalty Box, where he can relive his past glory.The chemistry between Katie and Paul is instant and exciting. Their verbal sparring keeps you laughing but also makes you stop and think. Katie's apparently successful adult identity is still riddled with the insecurities of her past to the point that she has a distorted view of the town she grew up in. Paul goes back home to assuage his anguish over losing the only career he's ever wanted, basking in the adulation of his old friends but living almost entirely on memories. This is a book about learning to embrace your past without letting it dominate your life.Martin treats us to her deft grasp of the dynamics of family as Katie struggles to help her young nephew Tuck survive the trauma of having a mother, Katie's sister Mina, who's in and out of rehab. Tuck tugs at your heart and you find yourself rooting for his mother to get her life together. However, Martin does not minimize the difficulties of such a task, either for Mina or her family, making the book even more emotionally compelling.THE PENALTY BOX gives us everything than Deirdre Martin does best: witty, laugh-out-loud dialogue, a hero we fall madly in love with, a heroine to root for, and plenty of emotion.

However, you don't have to be a sports fan, or know spit about hockey (the heroine certainly didn't!) to enjoy this book! I read this book as fast as I could and enjoyed it so much, that I had to go back for an instant and much slower re-read!Katie Fisher is a college professor who has returned to her hometown for a year long paid sabbatical to write a book. While at home, she reluctantly attends her ten year high school reunion. Her reluctance is a result of her agonizing overweight teenage years. At the gala she is reunited with old \\"friends,\\" tormentors and an old crush. The ex-crush, Paul van Dorn, is a pro-hockey player who has just retired, albeit not by his choice. Katie and Paul are both at the brink of major life changes and dealing with the myriad of emotions that arrive with such situations. They share an undeniable attraction to one another, but making a relationship work is not as easy as it might seem. Life has pushed them both through a full circle and back to their hometown... a very small town, with tongues and overgrown teenage terrors...The book is touching, but fun, fast-paced, and incredibly well written. Between the great story, a charming cast of characters and refreshing twists to what could have otherwise easily been a predicable tale, this book is more real-life like than you'd expect. The hero might have been a superstar, but he is a normal guy in the book with issues that are neither too far-fetched, nor tabloid material.

The main character, Katie, was a delight with a wonderful sense of humor that had me chuckling time and again and she suffers from something most women do--trying to keep the weight off.

Check out all Martin's books you will love them."},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"This is the third book of the series and I will say I enjoyed them all. I still could not say that this is 5-star material, though. This story had a strange flow to it and it did have room for improvement. Here are my thoughts....Katie's attraction to Paul was understood. The infatuation of someone that appeared to be out of their league is commonplace. High school has plenty of stories that mirror that thought. Katie's battle of the bulge is understandable, too. I battle it every day and noticed that the way her weight loss group called \\"Fat Fighters\\" certainly mirrored the Weight Watchers protocol. The reunion that she attended was even reasonable to see. Meeting with people that once tormented her, becoming apologetic for their transgressions is plausible. The attitude of Liz, Katie's original and most vicious tormentor remaining just as vicious held true to the fact that not all people are capable to change. The connection that Katie has with her nephew, Tuck was heartwarming. The rivalry between Katie and her sister, Mina felt more ridiculous than believable. Mina's bitterness felt a little overboard and her addiction, the trip to rehab and her attitude towards everyone (including her son, Tuck) became more of a focal point than it should have been. This is where I felt that Katie was less understood. Her resentment from her past felt a little far-fetched for me. People do get over emotional baggage eventually.... it should have not taken as long as it did.Paul's attraction to Katie seemed more superficial than real to me. His desire to be with Katie was more based upon appearance and ego which made him look less of an appealing main character. There was only one mention of his parents and that was it. No connection with his parents the whole book and it just seemed odd since they both resided in the same town. While Paul's drive to cling onto his glorious past, he did try to remain gracious to the town that put him on display as the town's golden child. Liz's determination to get him back was painfully forward and childish, which I could see that Paul would want to stay far away from her. Of course, her attempts were shot down and she quit rather easily. As the book moved forward, we never really understood how he knew he was in love with Katie. There was no epiphany for us to see how he fell in love.... it just happened and we had to accept it. His connection with the kids he coached for hockey felt rushed. Even his feelings about Tuck felt rushed. Of course, with the story unfolding about Mina and her release from rehab and rapid descent from the promise of clean living took a fair amount of focus on the two characters this book was supposed to be about. Well, I also did not really feel that Paul tried all that hard to get Katie back. His ego is not enough to fix their issues and Katie seemed a little too easy to forgiving him. Even her casual, yet secretive relationship lacked rational thought. She appeared to be more ashamed than proud of grabbing the attention of her youthful (and also adult) crush with Paul.With all that said, I will mention that it was well written. There was some humor, romance, and emotion in the writing. With how the book panned out, feeling rushed and filled with more side stories than actual focus on the main characters' relationship, it can hold the attention of the reader. Sadly, the ending felt rushed and not complete. It left far too much room for speculation and really no true closure. While the author tried to tie up as many loose ends as she could, I felt that this book could have been better. It was good, but not her best. I will look forward to reading more of her other books with hopes she can really knock it out of the park for me. I wanted to have rated this book at 3-1/2 stars, but gave the 1/2 star to make it a solid 4 because she did write it well even if I felt it was too choppy, unfocused and the ending lacked real closure. Would I read it again someday? Probably not. Would I recommend this to a friend? Not sure on that, but if a friend would decide to give it a try? I would not stop them."},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"Paul is retired from the New York Blades; he goes home where he opens a sports bar. He is the hero of the town and bored out of his mind, he doesn't know what to do with himself. He gets drunk and sleeps with an old girlfriend, sneaking out of her house after her son finds him the next morning. Katie used to be the fat smart girl, she moves out of town goes to college loses the weight and becomes a hot professor. Katie comes back to help her mom with her nephew and maybe go to her schools class reunion. When Paul and Katie see each other again, they find out that they are very different people than they used to be. The two start dating while Katie tries to help take care of her nephew. An ex of Pauls tries to get between them; now that she is divorced she wants Paul. Katie doesn't want to move back to her hometown and Paul wants to stay so he can continue being a hometown hero. While they both like each other, they have a hard time figuring out what they really want. I liked Katie she worked really hard to become the woman that she wanted to be. Even though it is not her responsibility, she changes her whole life to take care of her nephew. Paul was a annoying in the beginning, but he became less so towards the end. I did like how the author had a story of a retired player, but I had a hard time dealing with Pauls selfishness. Katie was selfish in her own way, but she has things up easier than the rest of the characters. The Penalty Box was ok, but I had a hard time reading about the drug addicted mom. While the main characters did have chemistry I think they had to try to hard to be together."},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"Who doesn't love a story about the chubby but smart girl who's come back to stun the little town that had made her teenage high school years hell? Or the story of the star jock way back when, gets moony-eyed only for said once chubby but still smart woman?Oh, *I do* :-).What I like about Martin's telling of the story is a well rounded romance, and her rendering of two imperfect, awkward and struggling, souls finding each other when it seemed unlikely. For both Katie and Paul, their mutual physical attraction is a surprise and a pleasure. But Katie Fisher turned sociology professor, now thin as well as beautiful, is somewhat neurotic and immature when it comes to being back in town, especially the possibility of Paul and becoming a 'townie'. As she deals with her always-in-trouble sister and taking care of her nephew, Tuck, Katie's old fears creep up and begin to consume her, threatening to derail her own happiness. Meanwhile, Paul, ex-NHLer whose career was cut too short, is now owner of the local bar, Penalty Box, lives in denial and floundering as he struggles with his new identity as regular guy but in Katie, he begins to find something meaningful. If only Katie would just relax.The humorous and contemporary romantic romp is well mingled with their personal pains and working through their pasts, which have marked them both with insecurities that Martin doesn't easily write away into a Fairy Tale solution but she does give a satisfying and believable ending. The author has given us a story and people who are more realistic than most romance books tend to present, and Katie and Paul are full of complications with compelling characterization and snappy dialogue. They are the kind of characters who could be real people, that have depth, emotional growth and evolve from beginning to end. At the end, they still have their issues, but they come to acknowledge their problems, know they have to face their past and that in each other, they might find a way to overcome their pasts.This is my first read by this author, and the Penalty Box is the 4th installment of the New York Blades series. Since I read it out of order, I didn't feel like I was dropped in the middle or that I was missing something at all. It stood all on its own merit and faired very well. Also, hockey is only a peripheral element to this story, a psychological obstacle for Paul but it is there in subtle forms.

The romance was hot. and the background story interesting. I loved how Ms. Martin wrote the characters of Tuck and Mina. I would give this novel 10 stars if I could. Simply spectacular!"},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"I've read all of Deirdre Martin's past books and enjoyed them all. This one however, was very disappointing. The relationship between Katie and Paul was very unbelievable to me. For her to not be resentful at all to the way he had treated her in highschool when she was heavy, was ridiculous. I don't care how gorgeous he is, if he'd done to me what he did to her I would at least make him work hard to have me and I would not have acted so crazy over him just because of a past school-girl crush. Then once they were seeing each other, the way that Katie insisted they keep their relationship a secret even though everyone seemed to know, didn't make any sense and made her seem really irrational and uncaring for Paul. They didn't have any real chemistry or development to their relationship either. All of a sudden they were together wihtout getting to know each other again and lust at first sight between the two of them just didn't work for me, it didn't seem real at all. The second half of the book didn't really even focus on their relationship, just their own individual personal problems and also concentrated on Katie's problematic sister and her nephew. Over all the characters didn't work together very well and the whole book was pretty bad. The only reason I finished it was in the hope that it would have a redeeming moment or two, but it wasn't so. And the only reason I gave it two stars was because it did have a few parts that gave me a laugh."},{"Title":"The Penalty Box (New York Blades)","review":"I have read all of Deirdre Martin's books and the last two have just fallen flat for me. This one was a bit better than the last, but she is fast losing a must auto-buy from me. I just didn't get the whole I love him, but I don't want anyone to know, but things were being said and done to make sure everyone knew. The ending to me, it just didn't ring true, it was a hurry up and give a happy ending.

She is staying at her mom's home in Didsbury, Connecticut a town she hates ever since she was an obese brainy outcast in high school. Also at mom's place is Katie's nephew nine years old Tuck whose mother is in rehab.At her tenth anniversary high school reunion Katie, explains her study to former NHL legend Paul van Dorn; he agrees to be interviewed. The interview goes well until she mentions his forced retirement due to injury. He ends the interview. Paul coaches the Squirt Squad; Tuck is on the team. He takes Katie on a picnic. A few days later after dinner, they make love, but Katie demands their relationship be kept secret so as to not harm Tuck.When his team loses, Paul works the team too hard. Katie tells him to ease up on them. Not long afterward Paul insists he loves her, but ends their relationship because she is a snob. One of them will have to skate towards the goal if they are to score the hat trick of love, marriage and family.Deirdre Martin's latest hockey romance stars delightful lead protagonists especially Katie, who \\"smoothly handles her dieting and a strong support cast. The story line scores because of the youth hockey subplot that bring out the differing attitudes between Katie and Paul while spotlighting the little leagues. Though a spoiled selfish villainess acts like she is still in high school and when marginally \\"hip checked\\" not even into the boards vanishes, fans will enjoy this fine sports romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Verdict of Twelve","review":"Raymond Postgate wrote very little crime fiction ,being primarily a social historian with leftish leanings .When he did turn his attention to the genre the results were invariably satisfying , none more so than this quite splendid and somewhat unusual book.There is enough detection to keep devotees of the classic detective novel interested and engaged by the book but the main concentration is on the jury ,and in particular with the factors that influence jurors and shape their verdicts..We are given detailed biographies of 6 of the 12 citizens who must decide on the outcome of a murder trial -that of a middle aged ,middle class woman accused of murdering her nephew.In the well written and sharply detailed studies of these people we learn of their personal values and their domestic situations and of how these constitute an insurmountable barrier to objectivity.Their response is emotional as distinct from rational ,and as we come to know the jurors we begin to anticipate their reactions.Cleverly,these are modified as the case proceeds and the role of class and personality types comes to result in the weaker siding with the majority .The concentration on the jury is not at the expense of other factors however and the portaits of the accused and the victim are sharp and penetrating.,.Add a twist ending that is a genuine suprise and some neat literary allusion and the result is a novel that should be an established widely read genre classic rather than the unknown materpiece it is today"},{"Title":"Verdict of Twelve","review":"I first learned of this novel's existence years ago from Raymond Chandler's essay \\"The Simple Art of Murder,\\" in which Chandler described it simply as an \\"ironic study\\" without saying anything more about it. When I learned that \\"Verdict of Twelve\\" was once again in print, I ordered it. I can see what Chandler meant, and why he found the book worthy of mention.The story concerns a murder trial in England, but unlike most courtroom dramas it devotes considerable attention to the personal histories of the individual jurors. It's safe to say that if you were on trial for murder, you would be horrified if these people held your fate in their hands. One of them is actually a murderer herself, though she was never arrested and accordingly considers herself superior to anyone so inept as to have been caught. The other eleven, in their own unique ways, aren't really much better. All in all, they are a collection of damaged, corrupted, and not particularly intelligent individuals who lack the self-awareness and mental balance to prevent their own emotional issues from interfering with their judgment of the case.Postgate's character portraits are adeptly written, with a very dry sense of humor giving flavor to the unsentimental factuality of his descriptions. In its own way, the book manages ultimately to be something of a horror story simply by depicting in simple language what can happen when ordinary citizens are chosen for jury duty. In essence, the whole idea of a \\"jury of one's peers\\" is hung out to dry. If people like these can be our \\"peers,\\" then how can the system of trial by jury be expected to produce a just verdict?"},{"Title":"Mel Bay prsents Bass Line Basics for Guitar","review":"Playing basslines with a chord accompaniment is a mystery to many guitarists, but if you can master this form of playing your phone will never stop ringing. Although this style is mainly used in jazz, there is no reason why players of other styles shouldn't learn it as well, because you will have heard this style used in many genres of music. Players like Joe Pass, Martin Taylor, Tuck Andress, and numerous others have made careers out of this approach. If you are playing gigs the advantages are that you are your own complete backing band, so just get a vocalist or sax player and you are in business.Charles Chapman's book begins with some basic harmony so that you can understand what you are doing and why. This important introduction will give you the knowledge to create lines and patterns of your own with the tunes you are playing. You won't need a theory background here, but what you learn will help in other areas of your playing as well. In the next section you throw your pick away and begin a few little playing exercises in finger-style to give you a feel for this new-world of expression.The second half of the book gives some great examples of how to implement these ideas over some well used progressions like a blues, a Latin tune, some bebop, and standard jazz tunes. The \\"four to the bar\\" style made famous by Freddie Green (Count Basie Band) is also featured and Charles gives some great lessons here which emphasise the bassline in this style.The book finishes with a feature on chord melody style played over a bassline so you can play like Charlie Byrd, Chet Atkins, and lots of others. Learn this unique style and you will be able to play solo gigs without the vocalist or sax.The book comes with a CD (all examples are played) and the music is written in tab and real music notation. This title is an introduction to this style of playing only, but if you want to get into this style of playing deeper then you would have a great starting point on which to carry on further.I can really recommend this publication. It is easy to understand and would suit a person who has had some playing experience and wants to have a go at another really \\"fun\\" style.Happy practising,Kevin DowningProfessional guitarist, teacher, and author...."},{"Title":"Jade (Thorndike Core)","review":"This book and the series is by far the worst I have read. Each time I finish a series of late I tell myself it is the last VC Andrews books I will ever read. I am sure VC Andrews is rolling over in her grave to have such elementary garbage written in her name.Her stories were famous for the depth and character they portrayed. A reader would be swept up in all the drama. Now, they are just a boring fairy-tale. Time for the ghost writer to step aside while the damage is still slight."},{"Title":"Jade (Thorndike Core)","review":"Her parents are fighting over her whilst they divorce, each one wanting custody to hurt the other. In fact, the only one they are hurting is Jade. She runs away to the boy she met on the internet, who turns out to be a psychopath that keeps her locked in a bedroom, tied to a bed with computer cables. She escapes and eventually tells her parents, who realize they are hurting her. The warm family ending won't work out, but that's where her story stops. I couldn't help laughing at the scene where she is taken prisoner. It's not cool when you laugh at a scene like that. It should bother you."},{"Title":"Jade (Thorndike Core)","review":"I loved the book Jade! It rules! My friend gave me it for my birthday. One Saturday, I began to read it, and I didn't put it down. I loved the part about her escape from the &quot;internet pal&quot;! This book does a fantastic job at displaying what makes one wealthy, pampered girl not so shallow. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to ANYONE"},{"Title":"Jade (Thorndike Core)","review":"Jade is a girl caught in the middle of her parents' divorce. They're fighting over custody of her, not because they love her oh-so-much; rather, it's to claim the prize. She doesn't want to take sides, but her parents are putting her into situations where she feels pressure to choose one over the other.Jade's story was a bit repetitive. Parental bickering, choose me, I feel so invisible / like a game piece, second verse same as the first. Also, the creepy internet guy who holds her hostage was ridiculous not scary. Like one reviewer said, it shouldn't be making you laugh but it did. Yeah, this book just didn't hold my interest."},{"Title":"Jade (Thorndike Core)","review":"Out of all four books in this series, Jade was easily the worst. It wasn't that she was a spoiled rich girl or anything like that. I actually liked her for a while. However, the cyber-relationship and her falling into \\"Sonny\\"'s trap was ludicrous. Yes, it happens in real life - girls falling prey for Internet predators - but this is hysterical. Jade is supposed to be a smart girl, she's on the honor roll, whatever.But when she realized something was wrong, she didn't run. And what follows is just utterly ridiculous as a old man ties her to the bed and continues to feed her BS and is clearly insane. This story started out with promise but vastly deteriorated, and is the worst one in this series. It's not even good by a 'tween book' standard."},{"Title":"Jade (Thorndike Core)","review":"A Review by AmyA familiar word, divorce, is the main part of Jade's life in this third of a series. Jade starts out with Jade talking with three other clients in a therapy office, all in which are girls. Jade is being swarmed by both her mom and dad about divorce issues; who will get custody? While her parents are pressuring Jade to feel that she loves one over the other, she meets someone online; Craig. He has similar family problems to her and Jade soon sets off for a journey of her life to meet him in San Francisco. Jade will never be the same again.The plot of Jade was boring and dull, and nothing built up to the climax. This was defiantly a quite boring 3rd book. There were no exciting points that made you want to read more. I liked how V.C. Andrews wrote in this book, such as her use of words and characterization, but it still isn't one that I would read again. Andrews usually has a great twist in her story, but this was a little too strange for my liking. It had no relation to the story what so ever.I would recommend this story to people who like to be bored as they read a story. V.C. Andrews definitely was not writing her normal here. I don't recommend reading this book at all."},{"Title":"Jade (Thorndike Core)","review":"The first two stories in the Wildflowers Series were great. I was really excited to read &quot;Jade&quot; - but I was very disappointed. Jade is a beautiful, rich girl with parents who absoultely hate each other. Her mom is favoring her and fillig her mind with horrible stories of her father, and her dad is doing the same. Jade is wrapped up in the viscious court battle, to see which parent will get custody, and it is driving her insane. Soon, she starts to go into chatrooms, and meets Craig - a teenager with problems like her's. One night, when the situation with her parents becomes absoultely unbearable, she hops on a plane to California to meet Craig. When she gets there - she finds herself in one of the most dangerous situations in her entire life.I loved the first two books, but in my opinion, VC Andrews is slacking. This book was good for the last twenty-ish pages. The first hundered or so were very slow and boring, then it was interesting...then it was so utterly disturbing I had to stop reading it. It took me about two weeks to finish, because I really didn't want to read it because it's such a sick and disturbing story.

HA! What a pitiful book to put under beloved VC Andrews name.

I never read one of her books I didn't loke but since she died they haven't been the same. This new series is abousolutely awful, it seems more made for teenagers than adult women.

I think that, unlike the Orphans, this series is actually building to something. Each girl's story is a little more dangerous than the last, and &quot;Jade&quot; had some interesting twists in it.

Her parents are in a huge custody battle over her, but it's not because they care about her, they just don't want the other to have Jade since she is like their &quot;trophy.&quot; She has lots of money but learns that it doesn't guarantee happiness. The one thing that she wants, loving parents, can't be bought. It gets to the point where Jade runs away from home and no one realizes it. There are some huge surprises in this book, and it makes you realize as Star says at one point, &quot;You can't judge a book by it's cover.&quot; Fans of VC Andrews should definitely read this book.

You ain't seen nothing yet. \\"Misty\\", \\"Star\\" and now \\"Jade\\" have nothing in common with our beloved VC Andrews stories about dark family secrets waiting to be unveiled while a poor and rejected heroine beats the odds and grows into a beautiful woman. It is merely the tale of 4 girls from broken homes that meet in a psychologist's office to tell their yawn-inducing personal stories. The non-existant plot reads like an article in \\"Reader's Digest\\" and even VC Andrews' usual, neverending metaphors seem overbearing and are an unsuccessful attempt to make the story worth reading. If, like me, you are a VC Andrews fan, spare yourself the disappointment and don't waste your money on this one...you're better off digging out the older Andrews novels and reading them again instead."},{"Title":"Jade (Thorndike Core)","review":"I have all of VC Andrew's books and I love every single one of them. If I could rate these books and VC Andrew herself (on a scale 1 - 10) I would have to give her and her books a 10 with no questions ask. I've been waiting for her new ones to come out so I could start reading them and now that they are out I can start again."},{"Title":"Jade (Thorndike Core)","review":"When Jade's parents got married they're marriage was more like a buisness partnership. Everything was divided down the middle just in case anything ever happened. And when they had Jade they couldn't divide her. When it comes time for Jade to tell her story in Dr. Marlowe's therapy session, she dosen't want to speak. But when she dose she spins a story of a terrible battle masked by a privileged life. When Jade's parents got divorced they fought over her not becasuse they loved her, but becasue they wanted to come out on top. Will Jade be able to deal with everything? Or will she fall apart.I really liked this book it's a good edition to the series and so far my favroite. I've already read Misty the first one and I'll be sure to read Cat and Star.

First of all, this is a series. The Jade book to portraying a character that is a build up to the Orphans Book. Sure she is a whiner and a baby and most of us envy her problems, but the book had to be written in order to portray her character. Why she does the things that she does later in the final book. I would recommend reading it and pay attention to it because if not you could miss out on the bigger picture."},{"Title":"Jade (Thorndike Core)","review":"This story is the 3rd installment of the Wildflower Series. Jade comes from a wealthy family. At first glance, I didn't expect to get much from her story, but I quickly learned otherwise. Jade's parents are getting a divorce, but being the competitive business people that they are, neither of them are willing to give in to the other on any matter. They both remain in the house because neither of them want to lose it. Not because of any attachment, but because of their desire to &quot;one up&quot; the other. Their heated battles at home and in court are slowly tearing Jade apart. Now she has become a pawn in their divorce. Not because of their great love for her, but because she is another asset to battle over. Unable to take anymore, Jade makes a nearly fatal decision. Every book in this series of four girls brought together in group therapy to tell their stories has really captured my attention. I can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"Jade (Thorndike Core)","review":"I can relate to all of the charecters thus far.

'The spirit of Ecclesiastes is not this, is rather in the questioning and doubting mode in understanding life and experience.True there is a reconciliation in the final short- chapter where we are recommended to 'Fear God' as all we should do in this world.I view the 'Artscroll interpretation' not in the way it perhaps views itself , but rather as one of the 'seventy faces' of Torah."},{"Title":"Koheles / Ecclesiastes - A New Translation with a Commentary Anthologized From Talmudic, Midrashic and Rabbinic Sources (The ArtScroll Tanach Series) (English and Hebrew Edition)","review":"I consider this book the ultimate book in the Bible.

Plaidy's writing style, her keen knowledge of history, and her ability to really develop the characters into living, thinking human beings made for a terrific read, --- even though the story, for the most part, is a sad one.After spending decades uniting and bring peace to Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella finally have the time and wherewithal to concentrate on establishing a lasting dynasty. Ferdinand knows that this can only be achieved by marrying their five children off into the royal houses of Europe. Through his sheer will and his political prowess, Ferdinand has the House of Spain poised to become Europe's greatest dynasty. Isabella, however, is torn and hates to see her children sent off from her, missing so much of their growing up fighting for her crown. She knows Ferdinand's ambitions are sound but she finds herself torn between her duty as Queen and her love as a mother. Of all the characters, she generates the most sympathy.The first marriage arranged had already been a tragic one. Princess Isabel had married the King of Portugal only to have him die a short time later. When his cousin, the new King, offered to marry her so she could keep her position as Queen, she refused and returned to Spain. Getting her back to Lisbon was one of Ferdinand's principal goals. Her stubborness to not marry a man she did not love caused friction between them throught the first third of the book.Meanwhile, Crown Prince Juan, first heir to a united Spain, has been set up to marry Margaret of Flanders. Once again, Ferdinand sets up an genuine love match only to have it end in tragedy. Juan dies of a fever and Margaret gives birth to a stillborn son.Next comes Juana's turn at the alter. She marries Philip the Handsome, Margaret's brother and heir to the Hapsburg crown. Philip, a philanderer and political snake, uses the near obsessive love Juana has for him to secure the crown of Castile for himself. Meanwhile, Juana slips more and more into insanity.Finally, Isabel agrees to return to Portugal and marry the King, only to be tormented by what she believes is a curse on the family for their expelling the Jews. She dies after giving birth to Miguel, the heir to both Spain and Portugal. He, too, dies after only months of life. Maria, then, is sent to Portugal where she meets a similar fate to that of her sister.Catalina, the baby of the family, and through whose eyes most of the story is told, is then sent to England where she becomes the ill-fated Catharine of Aragon, the first of Henry VIII's many wives.This book is full of excellent imagery, dynamic plot twists, powerful dialogue and true emotion not often seen in historical novels. If you can find it, buy it. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Daughters of Spain (Ferdinand and Isabella, 3)","review":"They are the daughters you need to be concerned with as their stories and the most told, and most interesting of Isabella and Ferdinand's four daughters. The one left, Maria, isn't very interesting at all, and Plaidy states it a few times and spends next to no time on her at all.This book focuses more on Isabella's passion for her family. While she may be Queen of Castile, she is a mother, and she struggles with which to put first often in this book. While she has four daughters she also as a beloved son, Juan. He is the apple of her eye and his story is so very tragic. As is what happens to all but Maria. Isabella, her daughter, tried to tell people the House of Spain was cursed and it seems so.This book is really filled with so much upset and tragedy it's a wonder it's not so depressing you don't put it down. There are deaths, exiles, burnings, turn abouts, and downs. There is madness, sadness and at times a little gladness. Plaidy does a wonderful job showing the end of Isabella's years."},{"Title":"Friendship - Fate - Fortune","review":"In this fictional novel, lifelong friends, Bob Callaway and Doug Jennings, amass an oil and gas fortune under what some perceived as very bizarre circumstances. Some people thought they were just plain lucky, while many others believed it was fate that played a hand in the conditions that led to their wealth. The reality was that one man's tragedy is another man's treasure.It was a strange set of events that brought Bob, from northwest Louisiana, and Doug from southwest Montana to the same college. Was it their destiny that they should meet the very first day of their freshman year and become roommates?\\"Friendship-Fate-Fortune\\" takes us through Bob and Doug's developing friendship and the tragic events leading to the formation of the multi-million dollar oil and gas company, LIO & SAG, Inc. We will learn that they have personalities that were characterized as resembling sandpaper. There was a smooth or soft side that was relished by many but there was a coarse or harsh side that you didn't want to encounter.Friendship, Fate, Fortune is a very inspiring novel about the lessons that can be taken from pursuing life with vigor and honesty. It seems the Bob and Doug, the two main characters, gain success and fortune in life by making good decisions and working their butts off. Despite some tragic episodes in both their lifes they become luckier the harder they work. This is a story about devotion to family, friends and co-workers. Doug and Bob are just not satisfied with the ordinary successes people achieve in life, they are compelled to pursue bigger and bigger goals while remaining true to those that mean the most in their lifes. At times I was surprised at my emotional upwelling at certain stages in the novel and can only conclude that I really identified with the heart felt message that was being conveyed. This novel reveals many of the truisms behind why certain people achieve greatness and others do not. A real winner!"},{"Title":"Friendship - Fate - Fortune","review":"Seth Jackson Horne's \\"Friendship-Fate-Fortune\\" is an original novel about the role of serendipity in the successful lives of two friends and business partners, Bob Callaway and Doug Jennings.

This is a coffee table book with numerous beautiful color photographs of the races from the Breeders' Cup inaugural (1984) to the present. The triumphs, the tragedies (for example, Go For Wand's breakdown and death in the 1990 Breeders' Cup Distaff), and the upsets (such as Arcangues' longshot win in the 1993 Classic) are beautifully chronicled in this book.The only thing preventing me from giving it five stars was that it was a little bit on the skimpy side with regard to the commentary.

The book explores Magley's relationship with the Black Canyon in Colorado and the research he undertakes to find out more about the first explorers there, but Magley takes the reader on many other side adventures - what do we (the paying public) really expect from National Parks? How does that differ from what our ancesters expected from the same area 200 years ago? And, what do the author and his friend do when exploring the river turns life threatening? This is a great read."},{"Title":"Deep Black","review":"Deep Black: An Adventure Through The Black Canyon by travel and nature writer Robb Magley is both an extensively researched history and a thrilling saga of personal challenge. Magley recounts the history of Colorado's Black Canyon, a part of the Colorado country whose dangerous rapids were not conquered until 1901. In addition to thorough archival research, the author's own journey on foot through all thirty-three miles of a canyon that is steeper and narrower than the more famous Grand Canyon, the reader is deftly introduced to seventy-six river crossings, and informed of a brush with death that forcefully illustrates the power, majesty, and danger of this great natural resource and wonder."},{"Title":"Deep Black","review":"Deep Black was great reading, one of those books you don't want to put down until it is finished. Having been acquainted with Black Canyon for many years this book answered questions that had been a puzzle to me for a long time. Robb's diligence in learning about the history relating to the trip made by A.L. Fellows and W. Torrence was much appreciated and it was interesting to learn that even writers in the early 1900's could not refrain from spicing up their stories. The first hand account the reader gets of the experience Robb and Michael had in traveling through the canyon makes one appreciate even more the task undertaken by Fellows and Torrence."},{"Title":"Deep Black","review":"Where do I get my money back? My girlfriend bought the worthless thing for me to help enhance a paddle down the Gunnison river in the Black Canyon. I suffered through it only because I thought it just got off to a slow start. The author goes on for like the first ten chapters about the excitement of -- get this!---doing research in a library. You call this adventure? This is like writing a book about writing a term paper. There are a couple of chapters at the end (fortunately it's only about 100 pages, most of it quotes from others) where the guy does discuss a HIKE along the beginning of the river, but it covers almost none of the river because the author and his buddy, both of whom clearly were fish out of water at the bottom of a canyon, didn't know anything about the power of moving water, and bailed after just three days of an \\"adventure\\" that would have otherwise taken weeks. If you are a Park Ranger, yakker, or involved in any search and rescue team, you might get a good laugh out of the part about how all their gear boofed a rock without them during what had to be the most senseless river crossing ever. If there were no stories like this, we would have fewer laughs around the campfire at night when we're drying out. The book is too bad to be a teaching tool about what not to do on a river run, useless as a guidebook, and too shallow and dull to be at all entertaining."},{"Title":"End Run: A Drew Gavin Mystery (Drew Gavin Mysteries)","review":"Brewer once again shows he knows how to titillate the reader with a wondrous menagerie of characters.

The bibliography is extensive and organized by major family and order. This is a good text for beginning aquatic biologists and teachers that want to start pollution monitoring of streams and rivers, however I would have liked to have seen more detail on collection methods, specifically kick net methods. Kick nets are build specifically for this method of collection and provide a better means than the &quot;window screen&quot; method described. It would have also been nice to go into the methodology of where and how to perform sampling. The only other improvement I would make would to have included more drawings of entire insects(ie. various genera and species of Plecoptera) and some photographs would have been a nice supplement as well.

The book provides brief sections on introduction to aquatic insects, marine insects, frequently encountered non-insects, insect morphology, collecting and preserving, use of aquatic insects in water quality work, a section on how to use the book, and references. The bulk of the book consists of a key to orders followed by a series of keys to families or, in some cases, subfamilies. For the benefit of amateurs like myself, drawings are numerous and clear and a good deal of information about distribution, ecology, and appearance is provided in the keys.

The secret shame and private pleasure of every major publishing house. It's gotten to the point where even Barnes and Noble has set aside a separate section of its bookstore just for the newest crop of poorly written, beautifully illustrated celebrity picture books. Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he or she can just jot down some random thoughts, put them to paper, and watch the money roll on in. Credit Ed Koch then to actually writing a book or two before coming out with \\"Eddie, Harold's Little Brother\\". Granted his previous books tend to be noir paperback thrillers (\\"Murder On Broadway\\", \\"The Senator Must Die\\", etc.). Still, at least he hasn't produced a picture book apropos of nothing. The fact that it is not a particularly good picture book is another matter altogether. When it comes right down to it, if this book were not about Ed Koch it would simply be a forgettable story we've all heard before but has for some reason been illustrated by the multi-talented James Warhola. It's a perfectly nice book and all, but ultimately one that will not stick with you for much longer than the time it takes to read it through. An exercise in bland self-congratulation.Back in the day there was Harold and there was Eddie. Harold is the older brother and he excels in every single sport. Whether it's basketball, baseball, or football, Harold's a pro. Eddie, on the other hand, doesn't seem to be endowed with the athletic gene. Though his older brother coaches him constantly, when push comes to shove Eddie's a poor pick in a baseball game. One day, Harold even goes so far as to conveniently \\"forget\\" Eddie at home when there's a big neighborhood baseball game. Undaunted, Eddie keeps showing up. The kids tolerate his presence when he retells the game's highlights in his particularly engaging style. When Harold asks Eddie why he keeps trying to join in on the game when he knows he's no good, his little brother confesses that he yearns for the kind of respect and adulation that Harold comes by naturally. Together, they figure out what Eddie's real strength is (public speaking) and little Mr. Koch goes on to win a public speaking contest. The rest is history.Allow me to point out that the book is not poorly written. It suffers from overly simplistic statements like, \\"Eddie was sad thinking that Harold was ashamed of him, but it didn't keep him from being proud of his big brother\\", but these are few and far between. The writing is fine. It's just not terribly engaging. Some picture books are snatched up by children and must be read over and over again. Not so much, \\"Eddie\\". The story was intended, I am sure, to be a tale in the vein of everybody-has-different-strengths, or something along those lines. Instead, it's more of a how-Ed-Koch-became-mayor-of-New-York kinda tale. That's fine if you're a schoolchild living in Manhattan and find young politico tales of former mayors your cup of tea. Otherwise, you won't be much taken with it.Celebrity picture books all have one thing in common. They are usually paired with especially talented but occasionally little known children's book illustrators. Think of Madonna's pairing with Gennadii Spirin, for example. Prior to reading this book the only other James Warhola creation I'd had the pleasure of reading was his magnificent author/illustrator tale, \\"Uncle Andy's\\". The book retells Mr. Warhola's childhood visits to his eccentric uncle... Andy Warhol. That particular creation was amazing. This one? Well, it's clear that Warhola is trying to invoke a sense of the past. There are knickerbockers and jalopies and suspenders galore. Warhola draws all his characters with tiny black circles for eyes, occasionally giving them whites if they are in a situation of stress or pleasure (as with the cover). The effect is faintly unnerving but never directly unpleasant. There's plenty of action here and more than a little visual humor. It cannot, however, counteract an otherwise plodding narrative.All politics aside, I suspect that a picture book taken from the childhood of fellow New York mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia would prove far more fascinating (not to say insightful) than the well-meaning but ultimately bland \\"Eddie\\". It's a perfectly fine book, of course. Some people will coo and grin over it for long periods of time. Just the same, it's not much to look at and not much to read. A dandy tale that will be forgotten within ten years by libraries and bookstores alike."},{"Title":"All Things Hidden","review":"Somebody send some aspirin over to Publisher's Weekly, because you don't have to be Christian or African-American to appreciate this book.The strong female lead Jael offers up a lesson in faith, applicable to all flavors. I don't typically read books because they're Christian, but this book gave me a new perspective on my own faith - I didn't feel like I was being evangelically pounded.It's so good to see a woman lead character without super powers dealing with her problems and not passing them off on someone else, or waiting for a man to come to her rescue!I laughed and cried when I read this book - then I bought it for my mother to use at her Bible study, glad to have this literary bridge to connect our religious gap.Judy Candis writes books that stay with you for awhile.

But it is a Holy, God-fearing person that is always prepared to do battle with the forces of evil no matter the circumstances. In ALL THINGS HIDDEN, Officer Jael Reynolds is no slouch to performing her duties as a homicide detective for the Dadesville County Police Department. She is touted as the cream of the crop when it comes to homicide cases in the police department and she is well respected by other members of the force and her team. She also has a secret weapon in her daily walk with crime, her faith in God. So when known drug dealers in the area turn up murdered, with no clues left behind and nobody willing to talk, Jael relies heavily on God for direction and guidance especially when the tide of the crime spree turns and knocks on her door. Will she be prepared for the ultimate test?Jael is a divorced mother of one son, Ramon. Her ex-husband, Virgil, is a constant thorn in her side when it comes to rearing their only child. Due to her past relationship with Virgil and her current relationship with God, Jael has used work as an excuse to avoid dating. However, it appears that God has other plans for her in this aspect too as He puts FBI Special Agent Eric Grant, an exact replica of The Rock, at her disposal during this crisis. Their relationship begins tentatively and proceeds to one of mutual respect and high romantic interest. Will Agent Grant help solve the crime or give Jael dreams of another nature?Judy Candis has written a great detective crime story with many elements to make this a smash hit. The heroine is a smart, likeable African American with heart and soul and a deep abiding faith in God. The hero is a man straight from her dreams and has enough courage to lean on God also as well as encourage her to strengthen her faith. There were so many twist and turns in this book that it was very hard to put down. What was truly inspiring in this book was the author's weaving of how we can use God daily in our professional and personal lives and her reminder that evil lurks around us where we least expect it. This is a great read.Reviewed by Brenda M.

She was an angel for the people of the New York City area known as Harlem. The novel covers her 1896 birth in Massachusetts, moving to NY with her parents and living in dreadful poverty conditions. May was burdened with tremendous childhood and teen years of struggles and heart aches. Among them were an unplanned teen pregnancy, having to give her infant son up for adoption and afterwards suffering from severe depression. However, due to her mother's fortitude and continuous encouragement, May was accepted into college based on her extraordinary high scores, minus a high school diploma.Facing enormous and threatening hardships throughout the enrollment of college and medical school; racism, sexism, financial difficulties and love affair barriers, May Chinn achieved what many dared her to accomplish. She became a doctor and is noted as the first Black female physician in New York. She served her patients diligently and tirelessly for many, many years. With amazing talents and working assiduously in order to aid the sick and needy that were in dire need of medical assistance, Dr. Chinn was definitely a woman who wore an invisible halo around her head. She was indeed the Black Angel of Harlem.Angel of Harlem is definitely a great novel of worth. I was truly inspired by the biographical and historical information on this female pioneer's accomplishments. The sites of the NYC area, the Harlem Renaissance acquaintances (Zora Neale Hurston, Paul Roberson, Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, Fats Waller and a host of others) of Dr. Chinn, along with information surrounding her musical mastery were treats within the chronicle. Ms. Haulsey has penned a prized novel regarding a woman with phenomenal integrity and breathtaking compassion.Readincolor ReviewerTanya Tatum"},{"Title":"All Things Hidden","review":"Author Judy Candis has written a beautiful Christian Fiction mystery novel, one in which it is more than evident she spent a lot of time and love writing. Jael Reynolds was godly proud of her position with the police department as a detective with promises of a promotion to lieutenant in the near future, but not as much as she was humbled and thankful for her Christian walk and faithfulness to the Lord. Because of this, she is able to do her job and be a help to as many people as she can, but not even her eventful past, an arrogant ex-husband, raising her son alone, and the usual dealings of police work prepare her for what was lying beneath in her small Florida city.For some reason, the unease Jael felt when the first drug dealer was killed would change her life as she knew it. The turn of events that followed appeared to be a serial killer taking out the local drug dealers, but that was just scratching the surface. As each event would unfold, it appeared to be one positive step towards solving the spree of killings, including bringing in the FBI. Even still things were not as they appeared to be.Jael's faith was tested through the roof when her son and young friend were kidnapped because she had gotten too close to finding out about the true \\"White Power\\" hate crimes, who was involved and how they had covered their tracks. Stressed far beyond her limits, Jael found herself in a place of obedience by praying and waiting on God to move on her behalf as He placed people in her life and in the way of the ongoing investigation who turned out to be a help to her bringing those responsible to justice.Author Judy Candis penned a beautifully written Christian Fiction mystery in which she took a lot of time to research and put into her story as it pertains to detective and police work.

Jael learns that you never know who your enemies will be. Jael has sacrificed much to succeed and also to find her way spiritually. She learns that even though she has done what was considered right, the devil has his spawns and there are times in a believer's life where they have to practice and battle that \\"No weapon formed against (me) shall prosper.\\" and the fact that GOD said that he will \\"never leave you or forsake you.\\" Jael is a living testimony that \\"He may not come when you want him, but he'll always be right on time.\\" Life itself is hard, but racism and supremacy is real and very much around, you have to know that there are wolves in sheep clothing.

If you are a Christian fiction reader or if you are not, I recommend this book!!!"},{"Title":"All Things Hidden","review":"Judy Candis not only did great in-depth research for this novel, she has spun the silk of her labors into a bumpy cloak of intrigue and street-smart dialogue. Although I consider myself a \\"heathen\\" and therefore don't normally read this genre, I did enjoy the characters, the plot twists, and the overall storyline. I do believe we need more heroines, and this detective stands tall when we need her most. Great main character. I'd follow her anywhere. Thanks to the author for giving her readers a woman who solves problems (not who creates them)and who sticks with my memory for a long time. She's pithy, funny, and down to earth. I couldn't ask for more. Ok. I could and I am: Where's the sequel?"},{"Title":"All Things Hidden","review":"Jael Reynolds is a tough police woman, balancing her career and single motherhood, it is her faith sustains her. This was a fast paced novel, with numerous plot twists and great scenes. The story could have taken place 40 years ago, yet it is set in present times making the plot even more engrossing. This is a clear page turner. I look forward to more \\"Jael Reynolds\\" in future novels."},{"Title":"All Things Hidden","review":"All Things Hidden is Judy Candis at her best! From the very beginning, homicide detective, Jael Reynolds, handcuffed my hands to the bookcover and took me along for the ride. I was horrified one moment, heartbroken the next, then swept up in the momentum of her fierce determination. I've never read a thriller with such a compelling and realistic rendering of faith and the trials that challenge it!Jael faces obstacles that would push any of us to the brink, if not over the edge, and yet she pulls strength from her faith to keep her feet planted firmly beneath her.I'm giving ALL THINGS HIDDEN to all the booklovers on my gift list!"},{"Title":"All Things Hidden","review":"All Things Hidden is Judy Candis at her best. We're taken on a whirlwind adventure in which Detective Jael Reynolds relies on her faith to keep her focus. Not only has Ms. Candis employed the use of intricate plots to hold our interest, she has also created characters with grit.I was unable to put it down. In fact, I read the whole book in one setting. It's a fast-paced, easy read, one you can recommend with confidence to all you know.My hat's off to you, Judy Candis. Can't wait for Detective Reynolds' next exploration. Don't make us wait too long."},{"Title":"All Things Hidden","review":"Author Judy Candis has written a beautiful Christian Fiction mystery novel, one in which it is more than evident she spent a lot of time and love writing. Jael Reynolds was godly proud of her position with the police department as a detective with promises of a promotion to lieutenant in the near future, but not as much as she was humbled and thankful for her Christian walk and faithfulness to the Lord. Because of this, she is able to do her job and be a help to as many people as she can, but not even her eventful past, an arrogant ex-husband, raising her son alone, and the usual dealings of police work prepare her for what was lying beneath in her small Florida city.For some reason, the unease Jael felt when the first drug dealer was killed would change her life as she knew it. The turn of events that followed appeared to be a serial killer taking out the local drug dealers, but that was just scratching the surface. As each event would unfold, it appeared to be one positive step towards solving the spree of killings, including bringing in the FBI. Even still things were not as they appeared to be.Jael's faith was tested through the roof when her son and young friend were kidnapped because she had gotten too close to finding out about the true \\"White Power\\" hate crimes, who was involved and how they had covered their tracks. Stressed far beyond her limits, Jael found herself in a place of obedience by praying and waiting on God to move on her behalf as He placed people in her life and in the way of the ongoing investigation who turned out to be a help to her bringing those responsible to justice.Author Judy Candis penned a beautifully written Christian Fiction mystery in which she took a lot of time to research and put into her story as it pertains to detective and police work. I would recommend this book to anyone who is going through a time in their lives where it seems they will not make it. In the face of adversity, there is God's mercy and His unfailing love and faithfulness. Rest in peace, Judy Candis.Reviewed by Sharel E.

The illustrations were cleverly arranged and wonderfully reproduced. A charming and lively outline of Grandma Moses' transition from farm wife to famous and successful painter is provided for the young reader, in a tone that is clear and simple without condescension.

It wasn't a good purchase. Know the contents before you buy."},{"Title":"Feiffer's album","review":"Intro included, Feiffer put seven short pieces into this book. Three (Introduction, Superman, Crawling Rnold) are in the form of one-act play scripts, one (Excalibur and Rose) is a brief illustrated fairy tale of complementary complexes living happily ever after, two (Harold Swerg and The Lonely Machine) are comic-strip stories expanded to full length, and the last (The Relationship) is an illustrate parable for our time, drawn without words. Gawd, I wouldn't want to hear them talk anyway.These pieces date to the late 50s and early 60s, the era of evil Russians, Kennedy, J. Edgar Hoover, fallout shelters, and the Organization Man. Some of the pieces have the pervasive, oppressive 'psychological' awareness that was so intellectually chic back then (even comic books featured heroic psychoanalysts). Even if they're not a look at today's concerns, they remind us of what mattered to people back then.Amusing by themselves, these are even more interesting as mementos of their era. Worthwhile to Feiffer ffans, or to anyone in search of nervous nostalgia.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Russian revolution, 1917-1921","review":"There are numerous good books on the Russian Revolution of 1917, and this is one of them. There are few good books on the 1918 - 1923 Civil War, and Chamberlin's book, originally published in 1934, is still essential reading for anyone who wishes to know more than what's contained in Evan Mawdsley's \`The Russian Civil War'. Chamberlin's book was chosen by the reviewers for \`Foreign Affairs' in 1997 as one of the most important books on international relations published in the last 75 years; I agree. Chamberlin's book goes in and out of print; copies are easy to find even when it's out of print.Chamberlin spent 1922 to 1934 as a foreign correspondent in the USSR; he was later a lecturer at Yale and Harvard. He had access to people, places and documents which no later writer on the Civil War had access to until about 1990. So his book is packed with important information about aspects of the Russian Civil War that it's hard to find discussed elsewhere. And his statements of fact are almost all accurate, which is more than one can say for many books on the subject. The organization of the book leaves something to be desired; finding all the places where a particular topic is discussed is difficult. Hence, it's a good idea to read Mawdsley's book before reading Chamberlin. But Chamberlin is still a \`must read'.Chamberlin set out to report facts. Therefore he was severely criticized by left-wing reviewers in the 1930's as being biased against the Soviet Union, and equally severely criticized by right-wing reviewers and scholars of the 1950s and 1960s as having been too sympathetic to the USSR. From the perspective of the 1990's this book contains a remarkably accurate account of the facts."},{"Title":"Midwest Eclogue: Poems","review":"...And I read a lot of books. If you are looking for a book of poems by a smart, humane, passionate poet, here's the book you need to read. If you're tired of the pretentious incomprehensible word constructions of the hip ironic poets, read these poems instead. If you like poetry that's both musically rich and emotionally adult, complex and yet precise, here's your book. The poem \\"Hyper,\\" about his daughter's diagnosis of ADHD, is by itself worth the price of the book. I'll be reading this collection for years to come."},{"Title":"Midwest Eclogue: Poems","review":"The poetry in this book is stunning. Two of Baker's favorite poets are Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, and it really shows.

This book should be required reading for all who are interested in strategic management. Digman provides students with a great place to start for understanding strategy. Digman gives a clear and concise review of the basics that everyone in an organization needs to understand the foundation of strategy. This book works well with Digman's case study book. All cases are right-on, useful, and very meaningful. Anyone interested in strategy process can use the simple model provided in the book.

For all the classes that teach Rosencrantz, this book finally gets after what is really lurking behind the shadows in Tom Stoppard's plays.To read Stoppard and not notice the constant thread of morality (failed or successful) is to look at a bicycle and only notice the spokes.I was lucky enough to take a modern drama class from Paul Delaney at Westmont College, where I was quickly clued in to the coolness of Tom Stoppard (Jumpers being my personal favorite).If for no other reason than the chapter on &quot;Jumpers,&quot; you need to get a hold of this book, someway, somehow.Unfortunately, I never got around to purchasing the dang thing. And now it looks like it might be on its way to out-of-printland (right next to tomorrowland at Disneyland).Hello? St. Martin's Press? Are you listening? REPRINT THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Radicalism and the Origins of the Vietnamese Revolution","review":"This book deals with the origins of the revolutionary movement in Vietnam (1920-1930).Although the topic is dry, this in-depth, well-referenced review of this complex problem makes it more interesting. It suggests that the Vietnamese revolution started with various nationalist groups before being displaced by the communists. The role of women is also acknowledged.Studies by McHale also suggested similar conclusions.This is an interesting book reserved for a selected group of people interested in the study of Vietnamese revolution. I have learned a lot from it although it took me my trials to grasp its significance and finish it."},{"Title":"The Cavalryman (The Roman World Series)","review":"As usual Peter Connolly produces an excellent little booklet to accompany \\"The Legionary\\" and the various other books in this series on the Roman world. Both \\"The Legionary\\" and this one deal with the life of Tiberius Claudius Maximus who lived in the time of Trajan. His life in the army comprised both serving as a legionary and then later as a cavalryman in the Emperor's forces in the region of Romania, then called Dacia. This is the second part of his story, this time serving as a cavalryman. Connolly being an experimental archeologist knows what he is talking about and provides detailed reconstructive drawings of his own reconstructed arms, saddles, armour and whatnot required by a cavalryman of the time. In addition he is a good artist and provides some quite atmospheric portrayals of life in the Roman army.The book is thin but informative and packed with wonderful illustrations. Originally intended for a younger audience it is nevertheless a superb piece of work and is useful for anyone interested in the Roman army whether he/she be a wargamer, modeller or reenactor. Not as serious as the Osprey series or as simple minded (and inaccurate) as much of historical fare now available for children, this book is never far from view on my bookshelf merely for the enjoyment of leafing through its pages.A wonderful booklet."},{"Title":"The Cavalryman (The Roman World Series)","review":"Peter Connolloy has again produced a book useful to those engaged in teaching and learning about Roman history. The illustrations are, as usual, both striking and historically accurate."},{"Title":"The Cavalryman (The Roman World Series)","review":"\\"The Cavalryman\\" follows the career of Claudius Tiberius Maximus who was first introduced in Connolly's \\"The Legionary\\". In this volume, Maximus has transferred from the Legion to an auxiliary cavalry unit stationed along the Danube during the reign of the Emperor Trajan. The story follows him on Trajan's two campaigns against the Dacians where Maximus gains accolades for hunting down the Dacian King, Decebalus. As with \\"The Legionary\\", what makes this a great book is Peter Connolly's beautifully detailed illustrations. The marriage of a compelling story and great illustrations make \\"The Cavalryman\\" a must purchase. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Cavalryman (The Roman World Series)","review":"Connoly's book is a good read that is quick and filled with beautiful illustrations.

This is in no way a bad thing, however, and should show just how easily vested you become in her character and well being immediately. Not caring whether or not the heroine dies is a bad sign don't you think? :-)The way the author was able to insert me into Veronica's mind shows her talent as a writer in demonstrating that age old rule of \`Show not Tell'. You see through her eyes the battles that we all, as woman, have faced, have watched someone face or sorry to inform you but WILL face at one point in our life. That proverbial should I or shouldn't I trust this man or person that for some reason I love with every fiber of my being even though they clearly don't deserve it.The moment or moments when you realize that everything you thought you knew was a lie, that you should have headed the warnings of your intuition that so many take for granted; and this person, this man you love is not only a stranger but in Veronica's situation pure evil.And that is just what Victor (her lover/boyfriend) is in this story; the wolf in sheep's' clothing that plays on the love and desire that Veronica feels for him.And though we know this, and though we feel this, and though we want to encourage Veronica to \`leave his sorry ass', the truth that comes out is still shocking.You should know, and maybe I should have mentioned this before, that to me this is not a love story. No it far surpasses just the love of an undead monster and a semi-nave mortal. This story is about choices and not just good vs. evil but life or death.With the introduction of Aidan, I won't get much into him as to not give away the plot and spoilers, adds on a whole other level of twist and turns as well as the truth about Victors past, that I didn't expect and often found myself screaming at the screen to \\"SHUT UP!\\" (true story I did that). And the end? Well just read that and find out yourself, then come back and tell me if it moved you while simultaneously ripping your heart out like it did mine.I recommend this book for anyone looking for a suspenseful and interesting quick read."},{"Title":"Puncture","review":"This book is so good, I could not put it down! I sorta felt that I was one with Veronica..I had a Victor, who sucked the life out of me. He was not a vampire but I also felt lost and alone except for him... This book makes me think of the power some men have over women and I think you did a good job with this!!"},{"Title":"Puncture","review":"Wow! This book blew me away. I have never read a story that captured the agony of love and abuse so vividly. Veronica is so fragile yet so strong. She kicks ass! Victor is a real wicked so and so but you can see why she loves him so and fights so hard to keep him. You love him but you hate him! The author really captured the internal fight Veronica feels as she struggles with her vampire life and her mortal heart. I actually cried for her. A great read! Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Puncture","review":"Never have I read a book that brings together romance, drama, and horror in such an engrossing and absorbing way. A great combination to complete a masterpiece of fiction that no book shelf should be without. Proulx makes the reader feel the anguish of her character Veronica in such a way that simple words can not do justice for. It simply must be read. Though short in stature this piece of fiction lacks nothing and carries the reader on a journey through the eyes of Veronica and her plight for normalcy in a chaotic world of vampires. A must have and a must read! Two enthusiastic thumbs up to Proulx!"},{"Title":"Puncture","review":"Proulx writes a dark and enticing story full of twists and turns which kept me entertained throughout. I really enjoyed reading Puncture, I'd seen it mentioned on a blog and knew instantly that I wanted to get my hands on it!! Her writing is full of emotion and meaning which really adds to the story and makes it somewhat more gripping. I would have liked a bit more of a love story to have entwined its way throughout, and I would have most definitely liked it to have been longer. Apart from that Puncture is an excellent book and I defInitely recommend it to anyone interested in the undead and their way of life!!"},{"Title":"Puncture","review":"First, I have to say that I only got this book because I have known the author and her family personally for MANY years. I thoroughly enjoyed her book, 'The Rainbow Won't Wait'. I am not into horror or vampire themes at all. I never knew when I would get around to reading it. My opportunity came and I had a chance to open the first page. I could not put it down!!! I read this book cover to cover in less than 24 hours!! Definitely not JUST a vampire novel. The enveloped message that this story portrays is so significant in the lives of many. Kudos Lisa on another great novel!!!"},{"Title":"Puncture","review":"This was my first read by Lisa and when I started this book, I couldn't put it down. Victoria was a women from my own heart. Love the romance and the drama in this story, that was one of the reasons I couldn't put the book down. The power struggle between the characters was one of great.I don't tell you the story in my reviews because I believe you should read the book and get your one reviews.This is one of the books I think you should pick up."},{"Title":"Puncture","review":"A great read is understated. The style of writing of Proulx makes you feel as if you are right there. Your emotions will range while you root for Veronica and sometimes feel for Victor. A must for anyone who has experienced abuse and a great 'cautionary tale' for those who haven't! Brilliant! Thank you for another wonderful book Ms. Proulx!"},{"Title":"Your neighbor's faith: A Lutheran looks at other churches","review":"I have been trying to relocate this text for sometime now and was pleased to find it through Amazon. It is a brief but comprehensive comparison between what Lutheran's believe as compared to other denominations in our country. It does not include Judaism, Islam or the eastern religions. I used it as a High School Sunday School text years ago at our Lutheran Church and found the High School age students very responsive to it. We hope to use it again."},{"Title":"Saved at last from among the Mormons, (Farm and fireside library)","review":"Full of dramatic action, fascinating historical details, and outlandish claims against Mormons, this novella was first published in 1881 as an anti-polygamy tract by the well-known Utah activist Cornelia Paddock. Although most anti-polygamists were against the institution primarily for religious reasons, Paddock was equally, if not more, concerned about the rights of women. Paddock's didactic narrative is able to transcend its now outdated anti-polygamy, anti-Mormon morals and stand as an early work in the feminist tradition.In addition to being a classic example of anti-Mormon sentiment from the late nineteenth century, this book will enthrall students of Utah and Mormon history who will enjoy the small details which creep into the story."},{"Title":"In the Wake of Chaos: Unpredictable Order in Dynamical Systems (Science and Its Conceptual Foundations series)","review":"The author investigates the question: with all the research (and hype) in chaos theory, what has been the actual impact on our understanding of the world? I give the book 5 stars for completing it's stated mission, being readable and enjoyable, and for not pandering to a lcd.Kellert approaches this question from a philosophical, but down-to-earth, view. From the start, this is certainly not a &quot;gee-whiz&quot; hop-on-the-bandwagon book. In fact, the prologue begins: &quot;Chaos theory is not as interesting as it sounds. How could it be?&quot;Yet, Kellert is not out to dismiss chaos theory, but rather to make sense of what the implications of chaos theory are. Unpredictability and determinism are two such topics potentially affected by chaos theory. Quantum mechanics is another topic influenced by chaos theory. And later in the book he ponders the historical question: why did it take so long for nonlinear dynamics (chaotic systems) to come under study?There is very little math. The intended audience seems to be those who have some notion of chaos theory already, and although an introductory chapter is included, it would be helpful to understand conceptually what a Lyapunov exponent is and what bifurcation means.The book is footnoted sufficiently but not overdone. It is heavily (but not annoyingly) referenced with everyone from Poincare to Prigogine. Despite the years that have passed since initial publication, I do not think this book has become obsolete. Another way to say this is: chaos theory (and it's results) is still not the mind-shattering revolution that some have made it out to be.If you have some science and math background and have been asking yourself &quot;So, just what the heck does all this talk about chaos theory really mean??&quot;, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"In the Wake of Chaos: Unpredictable Order in Dynamical Systems (Science and Its Conceptual Foundations series)","review":"Among the loads of literature on chaos theory, this one is definitely different and the one to chek up on."},{"Title":"Emergency Newborn Care","review":"An excellent, well-written concise book with easy-to-understand format for ALL emergency personnel.

As previous reviewers have indicated, this is largely a problem-based text, so for those of you who seek a detailed theoretical explanation of the tools presented therein, you may want to look elsewhere. A major advantage, however, is Dupont's presentation of how to run the respective analyses using the statistical software package, Stata, although it should be noted that the syntax presented is for version 7 of Stata -- not version 8. Parenthetically, all of the code -- w/ the exception of the graphing commands -- are essentially the same between versions. In short, this text is a good introduction to some of the techniques typically not discussed in an elementary biostatistics course, although the book is best characterized as an invaluable adjunct to more theoretical, comprehensive biostatistics textbooks."},{"Title":"Statistical Modeling for Biomedical Researchers: A Simple Introduction to the Analysis of Complex Data","review":"As a non-statistician with some stat background, I find Dupont book a delightful book. It is packed with interesting and useful information. It starts at t-test and ends with GEE models, covering Cox model with time covariates along the way. But as the author noted, the book assumes some statistical knowledge and access to STATA maual. One minor note: While the book introduction asserts that it only assumes &quot;high school mathematics&quot; knowldege, the high school the author attended must be very different than the one I went to."},{"Title":"Statistical Modeling for Biomedical Researchers: A Simple Introduction to the Analysis of Complex Data","review":"In general, there are 3 types of books on statistics: (1) Those that describe general statistical methods (2) those that describe specific (esoteric) models, and (3) those that teach \\"how to\\" implement statistical models in specific software packages.In this book, William D. Dupont does an excellent job of providing sufficient descriptions of each of the major statistical modeling approaches along with the specific Stata software commands to make this a rather complete book. Topics include simple and multiple regression models of the various types (linear, logistic, Poisson) as well as survival and longitudinal modeling approaches.While as an experienced researcher these concepts are not new to me, what I found the most helpful was Dr. Dupont's thoughtful approach to choosing, testing, and displaying the results of each method. On countless occasions I found myself thinking \\"huh, that was a clever idea.\\"This book can serve as an excellent text for an intermediate biostatistics course (preferably a class that uses Stata), as well as serve as a resource to experienced researchers who may want to find streamlined approaches to implementing these models in Stata."},{"Title":"Statistical Modeling for Biomedical Researchers: A Simple Introduction to the Analysis of Complex Data","review":"This text is especially valuable because it is written in clear and concise language. It thus serves the needs of the biostatistical community while remaining accessible to the non-biostatistician. The latter is what is so often lacking in textbooks in this discipline.

As a clinical investigator, I turn to this first when I have a complex data issue that I need clarification about."},{"Title":"Statistical Modeling for Biomedical Researchers: A Simple Introduction to the Analysis of Complex Data","review":"This is a highly recommended book if you are trying to use Stata in biomedical research. This covers most of the standard procedures (t-tests, linear regression, multiple comparisons, logistic and other contingency table methods, Cox PH, Poisson (log-linear), GEE) and a reasonable amount of noncalculus statistical formula derivation to show what goes on inside the box. ANOVA is relegated to the back of the book, because in the author's opinion, the amount of control needed to pull off these studies is not normally feasible and GLM can cover the same ground. There isn't any other book that addresses GEE as comprehensively as this book. The Vittinghoff book is also recommended as a companion piece to give a more in-depth approach to regression topics."},{"Title":"Statistical Modeling for Biomedical Researchers: A Simple Introduction to the Analysis of Complex Data","review":"If you are working with Stata this book will be a good help to understand the basic concepts of the multivarite analysis."},{"Title":"Statistical Modeling for Biomedical Researchers: A Simple Introduction to the Analysis of Complex Data","review":"I have had the pleasure of using this book during a biostatistics level two course this year. The book is structured to assist in the course work in statistics using STATA. It is user friendly and gives mathematical explanations when appropriate but without losing the reader with too many equations. The book's approach uses problem based learning along with explanatory text which I found essential in learning to navigate STATA along with learning and understanding logistic regression, poisson regression etc. The best aspect of the book is the STATA output to assist with the problem solving. The book is a very good choice as an interactive tool for understanding advanced statistics using STATA."},{"Title":"Statistical Modeling for Biomedical Researchers: A Simple Introduction to the Analysis of Complex Data","review":"I decided to buy this book since this is a new book on teaching how to use STATA on advanced statistic methods.

Keep in mind that the original printing of this book was 1932.I feel that this book would be better suited for someone with fencing trainingor perhaps to an individual who is interested in the strategy and history offencing.

The staff's perfection in all their duties seemed like something out of a book or movie. Being of a bygone generation, Miss Jane Marple liked staying there, where things were done properly. Little did she know that it had a mysterious side to it. When she saw Canon Pennyfeather leave his room at an odd, early hour, she kept it in mind. She didn't miss much of what else was going on at Bertram's Hotel, or at surrounding areas, for that matter. When a young woman was nearly killed, and the doorman rushed to put himself between her and the gunman, it seemed an ordinary street crime, except that the local police had already suspected something bigger was going on. Putting the pieces together, Miss Marple figured out the scheme without leaving her chair.This was one of Christie's later books which have a slightly different style than her early ones, though the fast-pace and the dialogue that characterize her books is there. It is longer than the early ones: by this time her publishers had probably finally worn her down and talked her into adding an extra 10,000 words or so of description not essential to the plot."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"I am a big fan of Agatha Christie's, but haven't read many of the Miss Marple books.

It sucks you in, and won't let you go (as all Agatha Christie's books tend to do!). The plot, which is centered around Bertram's Hotel, is spooky, mysterious, and lavishly well written."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Sheepishly I admit that, prior to reading AT BERTRAM'S HOTEL, the only Agatha Christie mystery I had read was THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD.The Ackroyd book was a prime pick (understandably) of required reading for a graduate level detective novel class, which I attended in 1970 at Portland State University while working on my Master's Degree in English Literature. The focus of that seminar was a fascinating analysis of the style dichotomy of British Vs American detective fiction. (a dichotomy which was enthralling to me, open-mouthed student).To summarize that professor's points:On the other side of the pond (please excuse this stereotype; it's used to spotlight a style contrast):- The UK domain of the Hercule Poirots and Lord Peter Wimseys, featuring the lifted-pinky-on-the-china-tea cup, is delightfully cerebrally challenging. The inspector cajoles his reading participants with the brilliance of rambling-reasoning-romps. If the \\"Sherlock\\" is sagacious, his setting is scrumptious: \\"Entre-vu and be pampered in a mansion.\\" This style might initiate the plot with a castle caretaker managing an extensive staff of butlers, maids, and chatelaines, each bowing and bolting to cater to every imagined slight of luxuries lost. Slumber is sensual (even if unsafe) atop feather ticks and down-puffy pillows.On this side of the pond (again, please excuse this stereotype; it's used to emphasize a contrast in genre content):- The US Domain of the Mike Hammers and Lew Archers, featuring the broken-nose and sliced-off-finger, is physically brutal. The detective rivets his readers with chillingly raw, tangy-testosterone-tangents. If the P.I. is gritty, his setting is grimy: \\"Come-hither and slum it.\\" This style might open into an unheralded urban mood of a classic, sleazy-motel-room, set into sad surrealism by the blinking of a red-neon-light staged outside an oil-coated, cracked window lifted half-way to invite dreams of momentary night breezes which effortlessly evaporate the sweat of fitful slumberIn either venue, murder is most dreadful, and justice is sought. With precision, ambition, and thought.Primed with reminiscence of this ambiance awareness, I approached AT BERTRAM'S HOTEL. Prior to arriving at the doorman's attention, I perused my reading history...To be honest, I'd been side-stepping full-blown studies of long-established, hard core mystery writers. Unashamedly, I read fiction for personal enjoyment (I did not apply for that Master's degree, even after finishing the required class work with colors flying). I need to slip into a sensual setting, or I can't escape into the book's world enough to avoid the early yawn, the closing of a book's covers, the final tuck-under-chin of bed clothes ... as eyelids weigh down ... and the cerebrum closes shop.Then, one fine sunny day, Sue Grafton's Alphabet series gatecrashed me into the genre for keeps. ALIBI took me for a ride beyond the college classroom, into the exquisite realm of escape fiction. After reading Grafton's series, I didn't want to wait a year for more. Yet, I still wasn't attracted to macho bats and bruises, or the cerebral-cereals sans creme.Diane Mott Davidson's yummy Goldy repeatedly cooked up, just for Marla and me, the creme de la creme, which I devoured. Of course I wanted more, and didn't want to wait a year for the next catering campaign. From Davidson's appetizers, I gate-cashed into the collections of cozy culinaries, and contentedly set up housekeeping.Burping escape-reading-satiation, I wondered if I might return to some of the established mystery masters, give them another chance to capture my cozy.AT BERTRAM'S seemed to offer a classy HOTEL ambiance (kicked up several notches). I could live there, I thought, hoping Christie had slipped in enough sensual detail of the hotel lobby to shove me over the threshold of my resistance to drought. Satisfied with every nuance as the first few pages leisurely fed word pictures, I checked into Bertram's, and eased into the London high life through full-blown-characters, wallowed in that world, plodded pleasantly through subplots.All that for the price of paperback. I was, am, and will be forever impressed.Like Miss Marple, without a means beyond my pocketbook, I'd never have been able to pay the price of a closet-under-the stairs at this swanky ritz. As Marple's niece and nephew gifted her to a room for a \\"week or two,\\" I laid my dollop of dollars onto a bookstore counter, and walked off with The Milky Way waiting under fingertips.The opening paragraphs described the \\"way\\" to Bertram's so well, the prose could be excerpted and placed into a framed example of how to lead a reader down-a-garden-path of delicious detection. Why did I think Agatha was ... though fitting my pansy taste buds by avoiding broken noses, and not featuring characters walking gingerly with constantly cracked ribs ... why had I believed Agatha was, in a word, too dry to escape into and stick therein?Maybe the reading part of my cerebrum hadn't matured enough yet? Maybe my lack of short term memory, aggravated by dyslexia, made me dread the impossible task of memorizing every clue? Or was it just a change of attitude to read-to-enjoy, to be-taken-for-a-ride, rather than working too hard to stay in the driver's seat, alert and focused, with nemonic-devices pasted to the dash?Whatever it was. Something worked, and a reading worm hole appeared.The classic car on the cover (of a 1992 Harper paperback edition) of AT BERTRAM'S HOTEL opened it's door, and I stepped right in, breathing the aroma, feeling the smooth, cozy-crack of leather seats polished to prime.Agatha had her way with characters, plot, and setting. The setting wasn't simply something to get my senses rolling in a Rolls. It was intricately designed into a complex web with every angle and tangle interconnected in near religious fervor. The ingredients of storytelling were so ... precisely intertwined ... so perfectly woven. I had to conclude that my tastes had matured into picking up skiffs of subtleties and rolling them on my tongue. Though apparently dormant, they had been there all along.Two of the main captivating points in this novel were the hotel becoming a functioning world, and the culprit(s) stepping into such living, breathing, complex characterization as to be not only \\"comprehended,\\" but, in a sense ... admired ... even as the evil was exposed. This type of clear creation of the villain mystique; this fathomless dark in a living labyrinth, is rarely executed with such glamour. This level of complexity is rare even for heroes in detective fiction.Most often the dangerous ones are painted through a glass darkly; we might feel pity for them through a haze of disgust, as directed by the author, but we do NOT like them nor identify with them. Yes, we have the arch-evil personifications of Sherlock's Moriarti and Stout's Zeck. But these, rich and full-bodied though they become, are archetypes.The culprits at Bertram's could literally walk off the page.A third major point of captivation was the way Miss Marple worked with Chief Inspector Davy, so behind the scenes, yet so brilliant with simple insights, which he endearingly, intuitively respected. The somewhat limited, though balsamic, direct exchanges between Marple and Davy were delicious, especially the final conversation as they sagely nodded heads, ensconced (innocently of course) in a suite at Bertram's.I'll happily return to The Master of Mystery, with sensual side trips to the Gurus of \\"picnic\\" plots, absorbing nutrients to keep me primed to \\"see the light,\\" to spot each vigil on the path leading away from perdition.For your legacy, Agatha, I stand and applaud, (with tears of honest admiration in check). You be The Mystery Lady.Linda G. Shelnutt"},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"I am 11 and I loved this book! I read it in 1 day and I am the slowest reader in the world! The end is a complete suprise and it kept me guessing the entire way through. Miss Marple does and excellent job on finding outthe murder! This is a perfect book!!!"},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Agatha Christie mysteries always provide an intriguing cast of characters that are so lively, you can picture them sitting across the table from you. The sense of place is another wonderful feature of these novels, and nowhere is that more pronounced and remarkable than in this book - At Bertram's Hotel.I found this to be a different kind of mystery with some interesting characteristics. The book certainly held my interest, but surprisingly not because of the plot, which I find okay. For me, this was a slower, more disjointed, and meandering plot and mystery. There are a number of places where I thought the story could have been tightened up and better focused, but it is a charming one still. What really struck me and has stayed with me is the sense of place. Bertram's Hotel is an enigma - a place out of time. As the world has sped up and sped by, it is an oasis of old-fashioned traditions and values. It is remarkably unchanged and has become a popular spot for those people, now elderly, who knew it from years gone by, as well as tourists seeking a taste of authentic and original London. However, as we all know, time touches on everything. Bertram's Hotel may seem unchanged on the surface, but as you peel away the layers, and peer behind the veil as it were, all is not as it once was. To remain a place suspended out of time, other things must change, and change they have. There is the core of the mystery of this book.Only through the keen observation of Miss Marple, her notice of the minutest of details, do we get to uncover what is really going At Bertam's Hotel. There are very sinister goings-on, but there is also a larger social and societal shift underway, one that left me with a distinct melancholy for what is sometimes lost to time, and a sadness that we cannot stop it from happening. A thought-provoking and worthy read.Rai Aren, co-author of Secret of the Sands"},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Things are not just as they seem at the elegant Bertram's Hotel. Miss Marple is on vacation there for two weeks, and she is trying to relive some old memories of staying there with her aunt when Miss Marple was a child. At first it seems like not much has changed, but Miss Marple's excellent powers of observation show her that all is not as it seems in the grand old hotel. Just how bad things are, she doesn't at first realize, but then a doorman gets killed in a \\"pea-soup\\" fog. Miss Marple realizes that evil walks the old hallways of the hotel. There are some great characters in this book, and the story is quite complex. Before we're done we have a major crime syndicate uncovered, and it's a surprise to find out who is the mastermind behind this crime gang, and it's also a surprise to find out how they've been operating for so long. Nothing is too complicated though for Miss Marple and for Chief Inspector Fred Davy. This book is a pretty good representative of a Miss Marple mystery, and I'm surprised that I had not read it before this."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Another of Agatha Christie's ingenious plots. Well written as usual and gives a good picture of the life of certain classes."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"This is more like a 2.5 stars -- better than just okay but not really overly likable. Perhaps if it weren't my first Marple and only my third Christie my opinion would be higher, but it just felt underwhelming.While maybe not up to her typical form, Christie still manages to craft an incredibly smooth narrative with rich characters. Canon Pennyfather was charmingly hilarious and particularly memorable in the midst of this large cast. I did find myself facing some confusion about which character was which the longer the book went, a problem likely solved by reading it in a much shorter time span than I did (tip: don't move in the middle of it and forget where you placed the book for a week or so). The resolution to the crime seemed slightly forced and not all that guessable, but was satisfying enough to earn three stars.There are no red flags to be found, short of some off-screen violence and a discussion about bigamy. The third person style suites the large cast of characters, but the pacing is slow despite being a mystery."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"This is a fast moving mystery where murder takes second place to a whole series of robberies. An intriguing story, though I was disappointed that I had to delve through 80% of the book before any murder took place. Miss Marple herself also plays second fiddle to some Scotland Yard detective. She renders help, but it is not clear that the cops couldn't solve it without her."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Bertram's, a central London hotel, attracts a wealthy and staid clientele. It specializes in creating an old-world ambiance for those who want to relive days past. But not all is right at the hotel, which Miss Marple discovers when she spends a holiday in its quarters. What exactly is amiss in the hotel is unraveled over the course of the book.This book was somewhat different from the other Christies I've read. Most begin with a murder, and the rest of the book is spent sorting out whodunit. When I'd reached the halfway point of this book, I realized that no one had died yet; quite unusual for Christie. Instead, much of Miss Marple's time is spent trying to determine what, if anything is wrong. Several parallel story lines converge by the end of the book at Bertram's.The unique format makes a nice diversion for the Christie fan, though I don't think that this is one of her best, it is still solid."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Bertram's Hotel is located in London's fashionable West End; Mayfair to be precise. A stay at Bertram's is like a visit to the past; Late Victorian England to be precise. Miss Marple arrives for a two-week visit and indulges (to a surprising degree) in nostalgic trips around London to the places of her girlhood (many of which are no longer extant).Bertram's is pricey, clearly beyond Marple's meager pocketbook, but her niece picks up the tab. When her niece initially suggests a stay at Bournemouth (an old resort town on the south coast), Marple characteristically rejects that sleepy destination and states her preference for a trip to the capital instead.Anyway, something isn't quite right about Bertram's. It's too good to be true in its defiance of the march of time and progress. Of course, while Marple is thinking that something is fishy, the reader gets to indulge in Christie's descriptions of a bygone time and place. And Christie populates her tale with charming stock characters, such as the forgetful cleric and the out-of-touch uncle. Marple is right about Bertram's, of course, and in the end we find out what is really behind the place.Christie acknowledges that time marches on, while simultaneously juxtaposing the old values with the new much to the detriment of the new. The yearning for the past is no surprise and certainly no impediment to enjoying the story. The biggest problem I have with this story is the insufficient amounts of Marple. She resides in the periphery of the story until about the last fifth of the book when she helps the old chief inspector (known as \`Father') solve the crime. Jane and Father don't like all the changes in society, but are flinty-eyed realists. Not bad, but not first rate Christie."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Dame Agatha Christie the doyen of delicious English murder mysteries published \\"At Bertram's Hotel\\" in 1965. This is late Christie but it is well written with enough suspects, humor and comments on the passage of time to make for an afternoon of interesting reading pleasure.Bertram's Hotel is a quaint, cosy Edwarian hotel in downtown London. Miss Marple visited the hotel in her childhood. The muffins, high tea and refreshments are outstanding; the staff service is excellent and the clientele of doddering old maids, retired clergypersons and American tourists make for an eclectic mix of clientele. The hotel is a fictional creation of Christie.The story concerns the lives of:Bess Hardwick and her daughter the Honorable Elvira Blake. Bess has run through several husbands, is carrying on an affair with international racing star Ladislaus Malinowski and has been a bad parent for Elvira. Elvira is the graduate of an exclusive Italian school; is smitten with her mother's lover Mainowski and has secrets she is not sharing. Elvira is due to inherit 600,000 pounds from her deceased father's estate.Detective Inspector Fred Davy does more research on this case than does Miss Marple. Davy is rotund, brilliant and bulldogish in his determination to expose the murderer and see that justice is restored.Mickey Gorman is an Irish taxi driver who plays an important part in the resolution of the murder mystery.A collection of fascinating characters espcially that of the absent minded Rev. Moneypenny make this an exciting and easy to follow tale. An enjoyable yarn told with aplomb by Dame Agatha! Nothing profound in the Christie novels; just pure reading enjoyment!"},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"\\"Bertram's Hotel\\" was one of Miss Marple's later adventures, and (though I hate to say it) she's slowing down a little. Of course, she was an old woman when we first met her back inMurder at the Vicaragein the 1930s, and now over three decades later she's even more so! That being said, readers will find that Miss Marple is more of a witness to a crime and less an active participant in its solution this time around. She relies on eavesdropping and coincidences to get her information, and is not quite as infallible as she used to be. If this was to be your first dose of a Miss Marple mystery, then you might not be particularly impressed with the spinster sleuth.Raymond West treats his great-aunt to a trip to London, and Miss Marple requests that she stay at Bertram's Hotel, remembering it fondly from her childhood. Bertram's Hotel is popular amongst certain people simply because it retains an old-world charm that makes one feel as though they're stepping back into the past. With comfy chairs, warm rooms, magnificent meals and attentive staff, the hotel may be expensive, but certainly has an atmosphere that can't be replicated elsewhere. Feeling both melancholy and comfort in her surroundings, Miss Marple is thoroughly enjoying herself, particularly when she notices several odd occurrences in the hotel.A host of colorful characters are staying alongside Miss Marple: the infamous Bess Sedgewick, the vague Canon Pennyfather, the sullen Elvira Blake...but unbeknownst to all of them, Scotland Yard has their eye on the hotel in pursuit of a crime syndicate, having narrowed it down as potential headquarters. The point of view is rather erratic, moving from Canon Pennyfather, to Elvira Blake, to Miss Marple, to several detectives, and doesn't linger particularly long on any of them. Of course, it is the comfortable-yet-oddly-ominous Bertram's Hotel that is the centerpiece of the novel, making an interesting quasi-character that reflects its inhabitants in regards to not at all being what it seems.\\"At Bertram's Hotel\\" was one of the last novels Christie wrote (by my estimate, only nine mysteries followed it) and you can tell she's beginning to slow down a bit. Some of the twists are broadcast a bit too loudly, and the inclusion of several plots make the story rather disjointed, ranging from an elaborate train robbery to a forbidden love affair, from the three-day disappearance of an old man, to a shop-lifting teenager. Even though Christie often delayed her murders in order to provide careful set-up, the murder featured here is not committed until three-quarters of the way through the book, and ultimately \\"At Bertram's Hotel\\" is more of a police investigation into organized crime than it is a look into human nature and what drives an individual to kill. This is what Christie excels at, but it is in short supply here.As always, a quick and rewarding read; but hardly the best that Christie (or Miss Marple) has to offer."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Miss Marple is on another vacation courtesy of her nephew, the mystery writer Raymond West. On this outing, she is spending a week at Bertram's Hotel in London. Bertram's is one of the few places that has maintained its elegance and not given in to the mod fashion now sweeping London. The staff, the food, the setting is all very genteel and charming, much as it was in pre-war days.However, something is not quite right at Bertram's. The police turn up checking out a clue that a series of well-planned robberies in the city is somehow connected to the stately hotel. Chief Inspector Davy is the detective in this one and he welcomes Miss Marple's keen acumen. We are introduced to an assortment of English ladies and gentlemen staying at the hotel which serves as a gathering place for suspects much as the country estates did in Christie's earlier works.Although this is slower than many of her other works and has a rather complicated conclusion, it is a good look at the changing times in English society and another wonderful visit with Miss Marple."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"ends up involved in a modern day murder.Jane Marple's nephew has given her a treat, a vacation. Miss Marple was delighted with the idea but requested a trip to London instead of the seaside resorts he had mentioned. Specifically she wanted to stay at Bertram's Hotel, a place she had stayed several times as a young girl. Her family was surprised that the establishment was still in business and cautioned her that it could not possibly be as she remembered it but arrangements were made and soon she was settling in. To her delight Bertram's had not changed a bit. She also met an old friend that was staying there and, while expressing her surprise at this lack of change, realized that Bertram's should have changed.Over the next few days as she enjoyed her vacation Miss Marple puzzled over this lack of change and other odd things about Bertram's. Odd things like how Bertram's could possibly find and keep such good help, much less pay them! And wasn't it interesting the way she and her friend were seeing so many people they knew, or thought they knew. Being Jane Marple she also could not help but take an interest in those around her. Particularly she noticed the notorious Bess Sedgwick and the Hon. Elvira Blake and the men that seemed to be following them.Murder of course invades the sancitity of Bertram's (this is a Christie after all). In the course of their investigations the police also come to realize that Bertram's is too good to be true and with Miss Marple's aid sort out the tangle that ties Bertram's to an international crime ring and teenage romances - both past and present.This is one of the 'cozy' mysteries for which Christie is famous.The plot centers on Bertram's, an Edwardian hotel isolated in modern (1965) London. Secrets, long hidden, come to light due to unlikely coincidences. As always in a Christie, all the clues are fairly laid out for the reader to follow and of course, there is a surprise twist at the end."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Lacks suspense. Plausible characters are far and in between. Not as horrid as Passage to Frankfurt which is unreadable. That's a plus. But the whole finale is ridiculous. That Christie uses this novel to reminisce about the loss of of England's traditional ways is endearing, but not a vital enough element. Clearly, whenever the old gal starts trying to address bigger crimes, she loses her way. This one has a train robbery and a crime syndicate and much below par writing. If this is anyone's first Christie novel, it will no doubt be their last."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Bertram's Hotel totally interesting .wish it was longer.

But something is off with a canon going missing, wild celebrities hanging around, and finally a shocking murder and a near miss. Luckily Miss Marple is there to aid the police in their investigation.Thoughts: At first I wasn't sure what was going on as no crimes seemed to be happening. It was just a leisurely trip to and around London. However Miss Marple is ever curious and it is through her that we get the first idea that something is going on. The problem is that everything seems too perfect. Hard to believe that's a problem but it is. And because of that, a major crime syndicate (I think they can be called that) is unmasked and will be brought to justice.We meet two new policemen, one is affectionately called Father who is a very good policeman despite his appearance which causes many people to underestimate. Other characters are wild Bess Sedgwick and her estranged daughter Elvira, neither of whom I really liked although I was interested to find out what role they played. Canon Pennyfather is the man who goes missing partly due to his own absentmindedness-he was sweetly endearing.I did not figure out the mystery or the murderer but I was pleased with the end. At first it seems like the murder will not be prosecuted (like Poirot does in Murder on the Orient Express) but then the policeman says he will go after that person and have him/her arrested. I was very pleased.Overall: The best Christie I've read recently with an interesting cast of characters."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"I can't claim to be a real Agatha Christie aficionado, not at the moment. My dad has always loved her books, and so I read a couple of the most famous ones back in high school and enjoyed them. Something clicked, though, this summer, and I wanted to read some more Christie novels. I guess I needed something a little like what Miss Marple is looking for at Bertram's Hotel in this novel--a nostalgic, comfortable, and light escape. I guess that Bertram's Hotel itself doesn't ultimately offer those things to Miss Marple in the story, but in my opinion, the novel itself possessed those qualities.I can agree with some of the other reviews at At Bertram's Hotel has a plot that's slightly unruly, certainly too large for a novel of this size, and I'll admit, too, that I most enjoyed the moments when Miss Marple was in the action--and there were not necessarily that many of them.But I liked a lot of things. I loved the descriptions of the hotel and of Christie's London and the nostalgic pleasure that Miss Marple feels for it. And even if the plot is not perfectly tight, it is romantic and funny, a quality and entertaining mystery at the least. And even if Miss Marple is not the lead investigator here, Inspector Davy is himself a pleasure to read about. He reminds me of one of Chesterton's mystery solvers (the one from The Club of Queer Trades) who solves cases by intuition and a sense of humor rather than by stolid logic. A series of novels starring Inspector Davy would have been quite enjoyable. The adventuresome and wild cast of side characters and villains, too, enhances the novel, giving it dashes of romance and parody. I was reminded, too, during the novel of Evelyn Waugh's satires.So, I guess maybe this isn't quite like all of Christie's other novels. But there's more than enough of a mystery and plenty of humor and atmosphere to entertain just about any reader."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"At Bertram's Hotel: A Miss Marple Mystery (Agatha Christie Collection)This Miss Marple mystery has our sleuth stay mostly in the background while a young girl, her guardians, her distant mother and Scotland Yard tangle with high level robberies and the mystery surrounding the old-fashioned Bertram's hotel.

I figured it out pretty early and I'm certainly no genius!"},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"A relatively late \\"Miss Marple\\" mystery. Miss Marple is vacationing at the old, exclusive and expensive Bertram's Hotel in London. But, this being a Miss Marple mystery, she hardly has time to get out her knitting bag before the mysterious occurences begin. This edition is a good well-made hardcover edition at an exceptional price, and clearly the one you want to buy. My tepid rating comes from a feeling that--without giving the plot away--Christie overreached herself with this one, and wrote a kind of crime novel perhaps better suited to other authors. I don't regret buying it, but I'm glad the other Marples are different."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"I am shocked, but I must admit, that I have come across an Agatha Christie that I did not enjoy at all. It is dull, confusing, and the ending is poor, but it was impossible to figure out the ending. If you are going to read Agatha Chrisie's books, I reccomend that you start with Sleeping Murder (THE BEST) or And Then There Were None/ Ten Little Indians (THE SECOND BEST). Save this one till the end."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Once again, Agatha Christie has created a mystery with such color that you both wish and feel that you're there solving the mystery alongside Miss Marple! The descriptions alone create a deliciously real setting. Then, to top it off, a plot that hooks you right from the beginning and doesn't let go even after it's ended. This book is definitely a must read, over and over again. And of course, prepare a pot of coffee, because you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Great book good piazza and coffee time yeah its great good mystery with a twist as a usual one and stuff"},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Though it has a surprising twist at the end, this Agatha Christie book is slower than the others. Good expression and description of characters, though it doesnt really make much sense where Chief-Inspector Davy finds out who is actually behind all the crimes that link to the hotel. Not the best AC book, but its still is a good read."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"That is the title of the edition I read. Colonel Protheroe is an unlikable curmudgeon that enjoys inflicting his personality upon others. When the man is found murdered in the Vicar's study, no one is very upset and the quick confession of an individual seen fleeing the scene of the crime leads all to believe that is that. Then another confesses to the crime, and another...and there is that matter of the ill timed clock and the incorrect time on the note that Protheroe was scribbling to the Vicar when he died.Agatha Christie's first Miss Marple mystery makes for diverting, albeit unmemorable, reading. As most mystery readers know, just about anything by her, even on an off day, is essential reading for mystery fans. Recommended."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"First, let me correct a misaprehension.This is NOT the first Miss Marple book. I don't understand where that notion came from, but it isn't right. The first Miss Marple book written by Ms Christie was \\"Murder at The Vicarage\\", and the second was \\"The Body in the Library\\". I believe this one was nearer the end, not the beginning, or Marple's sleuthing career.This is certainly one of my faourite Marple books (second only to \\"A Caribbean Mystery\\") The plot is great, a somewhat change of style for what Christie would normally pit Marple's wits against, yet it is refreshing and works well. The climax is brilliant. The plot is complex, involving, intriguing, exciting, and the solution believeable, and also a slight surprise.Strong characterisation, and an excellent and somewhat refreshing plot, make this one of the best Miss Marple books, and also one of Christie's best novels. (altough there are so many under that category, calling a book \\"one of her best\\" has become slightly ambiguous)"},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Ovo je verovatno najslabiji roman koji je Agatha napisala.Dug uvod, bespotrebni dijalozi, jako slabi likovi.

If you were thinking she was going to have some kind of adventure like she did in _A Caribbean Mystery_ or _Nemesis_ while she was on vacation, think again. If you enjoy Miss Marple because she comes up with these wacky village parallels, you are going to be disappointed. There aren't many here. A large part of the detecting is done my Chief Inspector Davy. Miss Marple is merely a side character in this one -- she really isn't super involved except when Davy talks to her during his investigations. She is more a &quot;witness&quot; than a sleuth.Granted, by this point she is rather old, so at least Christie keeps her doing things within her capabilities!The description of the hotel are great, and the premise of the plot had some nice possibilities but I don't think this was as well mapped out as some of the other Agatha Christie mysteries. If you are a long time reader, you are going to guess whodunit fairly quickly.Overall, it's ok, but not one of the best. The Miss Marple short stories (ex: Thirteen Problems) are better."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"One of the best of Agatha Christie's later mysteries. Miss Marple has found the perfect spot to stay for her vacation. Nothing ever seems to change at Bertram's Hotel, everything is just as it was before the war. But is this all this charming gentility merely a facade for something far more dangerous?"},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"This novel by the ever wonderful Agatha Christie is very exact and detailed. It had a twisted plot and suspicious characters. But! It was also from several people's point of view. The scene kept changing so you had to say &quot;Okay, who is seeing this and what are they most likely to think&quot;. In other titles by Christie the story is from one point of view. The entire story is based around one person's story and mode of thinking. That is why I give Bertram's four and not five stars."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Raymond West's latest novel is doing very well indeed, so he and his painter wife Joan decide to treat Raymond's old Aunt Jane Marple to a holiday. Miss Marple takes this opportunity to visit in London and spend the week in that eminently traditional, eminently expensive bastion of Edwardian hostelry, Bertram's Hotel. On arriving she immediately recalls her visit of many years ago, when she was still a silly schoolgirl, madly in love with a very unsuitable young man. Most things in the hotel seem to be untouched by the greedy monster of modern time and that is the way Miss Marple likes to see it. But something did change: an undefined atmosphere suggests more than the eye can see. When the absent-minded clergyman Canon Pennyfather goes missing, Jane knows that she still can trust her dark premonitions.Agatha Christie was sixty-six when she wrote At Bertram's Hotel and by doing so proved that she still could recall the spirit of her earlier works. All the elements of a typical Christie mystery are present. The setting is this time an Edwardian hotel full of memories of that golden age (supposedly based on the Brown's Hotel in London). Christie looks back to the good old days with more than just melancholy. The main characters also seemed to have travelled trough time: old spinsters, colonels and clergymen, they all carry past glory as some kind of burden.When the plot really unfolds, try not to miss the hidden clues, because the conclusion is surprisingly \`fair'. If you succeed in ignoring the numerous red herrings, you must be able to solve at least part of the mystery. This is certainly one of the Miss Marple mysteries worth remembering."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"This is not the book that Agatha Christie wrote. There are major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. What \\"improvements\\" have been made for the Signet edition? For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Stepping into Bertram's Hotel is like stepping into England of the past, right down to the maids and servers who work there. Everone fits ths part pefectly. All the right people stay there, a mix of nobility, clergy and fine old dames, and people seek out the hotel to have just that experience - a step back in time. Miss Marple has decided to take her vacation at Bertram's Hotel, a place she stayed at when she was a young girl. To her great pleasure and surprise, she sees that everything at Bertram's is just as she remembered it, well, not quite, for everything is not quite what it seems to be at Bertram's Hotel.The plot revolves around a cast of characters staying at the hotel, and then mixes in Scotland Yard who are trying to solve a string of bank and train heists. When Chief-Inspector Davy makes a connection between some eye-witness accounts and Bertram's Hotel, he decides to check the place out. Initially, he is just as struck as Miss Marple at the atmosphere of the hotel, but he definitely smells a rat, and knows somehow that Bertram's is involved with the case the Yard is trying to solve. What follows is a masterfully woven mystery about an absent-minded clergyman who has 'disappeared' and a young heiress intent upon knowing how much money she will inherit (or who will inherit it if she dies). The matter becomes all the more pertinent when a hotel worker is killed, leaving Davy with no doubt that Bertram's is a facade.\\"At Bertram's Hotel\\" is as fast-paced as all of Christie's works are: the reader never wants to put the book down because you need to know what happens next. Miss Marple's methods of deduction fit in perfectly with the mood of this novel, and she winds up giving the Chief-Inspector a hand in solving the case, naturally, although the inspector is just as sharp-eyed as Miss Marple. The conclusion is both rushed and unhurried, and the story is left with a delightful air of uncertainty at the very end."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"In a nod to the lifestyle in her earlier books, Miss Marple takes at a vacation at a hotel that perfectly reproduces pre-war life. Too good to be true? Even in her old age, Miss Marple is caught in a mystery.Perhaps not the strongest Miss Marple, but with many of the elements that made her a great character. It is interesting how much the focus on her age creates an air of melancholy around the book. Miss Marple becomes a pre-war artifact in her own right. I suspect that this aspect alone would make this book particularly interesting for people interested in Christie biographic material."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"In the midst of a crime wave involving a host of startling robberies, elderly Jane Marple takes a vacation at London's Bertram's Hotel--a hotel that specializes in recreating the luxuries of the bygone Edwardian age, complete with high tea, cozy armchairs by the fire, and world-class service. But when a young heiress staying at the hotel becomes involved with an undesirable man and the absent-minded Canon Pennyfeather mysteriously disappears from his rooms, Miss Marple quickly realizes that the hotel's famous service may include more than meets the eye.Although Christie's novel successfully evokes the delicious pleasures of the hotel, the plot of AT BERTRAM'S HOTEL hinges on a series of unlikely coincidences and becomes increasingly transparent as the novel progresses. The mastermind behind the current crime wave is extremely obvious--and when the murder at last arrives, quite late in the novel, the killer is more obvious still. This is not one of the writer's better novels, and newcomers to Agatha Christie's works will likely be disappointed; recommended to hardcore fans only."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"This book was an uncharacteristic A.C. in that it contained many sub plots, sub plots that distracted and confused me at times(Although I knew that all of these plots somehow shared a common denominator of the main plot).What I found to be particularly peculiar was that there wasn't a single murder until over a third of the book was read!Also, the ending, having the signature twist, was a bit predictable. I, of course, wouldn't have figured it out to the very last detail, but it wasn't by a far stretch of the imagination, either. That's a first for me w/ an A.C. book.The chief inspector came to the solution, but I was still left scatching my head as to HOW he figured it out. It wasn't thorough enough of an explanation for me.Overall, this wasn't the best A.C. featuring Miss Marple. As one reviewer pointed out, Miss Marple was instrumental in the investigation, but she wasn't the anchor in solving the crime, although the chief inspector leaned on her at times for help.I would strongly discourage you, a would be 1st time A.C. reader, in picking up this book. Read some of the other classics of A.C. before reading this. Ones w/ one-dimensional and faster plots,confined settings(And Then There Were None is an excellent start). You'll quickly become a fan and will be able to still appreciate a declining A.C. book like ABH if you do."},{"Title":"At Bertram's Hotel (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Agatha Christie had a tendency, throughout her distinguished writing career, to inject international intrigue into her mysteries, ergo, the Tommy and Tuppence entries. This one also captures that sweeping idea, only it features Miss Marple instead.The scene of the crime, for the most part, is at Bertram's Hotel, which features perfect, old-time, nostalgic lodging, primarily for aristocratic Brits and for American tourists who are drooling to savour the stereotypical English \\"experience\\". But one swarthy and infamous race-car driver does fracture the pristine ambiance of the hotel's lobby with his prickly presence when he apparently shows up to visit his beau, a well-known adventuress who is lodged there.A man is killed (shot), literally on the Hotel steps and sub-plots of thefts and robberies all around England prevail contemporaneously. An absent-minded cleric also goes missing. Of course, Miss Marple teams up with the local Police Chief Inspector to crack these incongruous cases.If the work has a flaw, it's the implausibility of the action, leaning toward that of what one might experience while viewing a James Bond film, only not quite so high-tech. Overall, though, I enjoyed the book, albeit I confess to being a huge fan of Christie.Not Christie's best but pretty good."},{"Title":"The liberation of the Jew","review":"The Liberation of the Jew is a riveting self-analysis of the Jewish psyche. To be Jewish is to belong to a despised group, this is an axiom that is hardly touched upon in the book, and rightly so. Now GIVEN that you are universally despised what on earth could you do about it? Not much. You could accept that hate, pretend it doesn't exist, change your name, get a nose job, marry out, bury in, whatever. None tackles the tragic predicament - you life is going to be crippled one way or another. Well, Albert Memmi does offer a kind of a \`cure' at the very end of the book. My suggestion is to read the whole book first.

They were expressing themselves through their prose and poetry. I started to give this book four stars for providing a broad (yet sadly, still incomplete) selection of women who were active in the Beat Movement.

I was studying religious studies, and wanted to be able to understand the primary scriptures of the primary religions of the world in their original languages as much as possible; I've had a reasonable facility with languages in terms of reading, and found that Coulson's book fit my style of learning rather well.There is a useful, pull-out sandhi grid early in the book, that shows consonants and vowels. This does not show all possible combinations, but most of the basic ones. This is a hard thing to remember (rather like learning the difference between written English and spoken English, where the pronunciations colloquially vary depending upon accent as well as position in the sentence or the speed of talking). Sanskrit is a langauge where it isn't necessary to learn the entire alphabetic structure for writing at the outset -- Coulson recommends this as a gradual process, and I agree with this idea. The primary Sanskrit font described and used here (a common Sanskrit font throughout India, although far from the only one) is the nagari script.Sanskrit is a part of the Indo-European family of languages, but that being said, it is vastly different from English, and the student of this book would be well-advised to make sure she or he has a good command of English grammar ideas, and the willingness to not attempt to apply them to the Sanskrit sentences and passages presented.Coulson in his introduction makes the distinction between a learned language and a natural one, as well as a dead language and a living one. Sanskrit to a Western student is both a learned and a dead language; to the late Sanskrit writers, it was both learned and living -- very roughly parallel to the Latin used in academic circles in the Middle Ages, a language still living in a sense, but not a natural language for anyone. Sanskrit has much greater fluidity and variation over its incredibly long history; Coulson introduces bits and pieces of these strands, but stays fairly close to a classical Sanskrit represented by the most common and widespread of religious texts.There would be only one item where I really feel I must take marks off, and that would be the constant use of transliteration into Latinate script rather than using the Sanskrit throughout the models. While almost all of the reading passages are in the Sanskrit basic font style, the various grammar points (conjugation and declension charts, etc.) are presented in transliteration, which made things a bit more difficult for me, as I'd sometimes have to struggle not only to remember the Sanskrit but also the code for the transliteration (which, of course, never coincides with the transliteration paradigms in other langauge texts I've studied).This book is designed both for classroom use and for self-study. Based on my readings and comparisons of my translations on texts such as the Rig Veda with other, published translation, this book has helped me gain a working knowledge of Sanskrit, and provides a useful text for review on a periodic basis.It includes an answer key to all the major exercises, a guide for further study, an introduction to prose/poetry constructions, and a useful vocabulary glossary."},{"Title":"Tremendous Trifles","review":"Those familiar with G. K. Chesterton probably know him for his novels (The Man Who Was Thursday), his stories (The Complete Father Brown Stories (Wordsworth Classics) (Wordsworth Collection)), and his non-fictionORTHODOXY). Even the fans may not be aware that his chief profession in life was as a journalist. Indeed, Chesterton wrote a stunning 3,000 columns during his lifetime. Many collections were published at the time, and others have been added since then. It is said, by the true fanatics, that all 3,000+ are quite good. I wouldn't know, since I've only read a hundred or so. But I can say this. Among all essay collections by any author that I've ever read, \\"Tremendous Trifles\\" is the best.\\"Tremendous Trifles\\" is, to put it simply, a series of reflections on everyday life. In \\"The Twelve Men\\", Chesterton recounts the story of his call to jury duty. Being chosen merely because his name starts with 'C', he ends up hearing the case of an accused bicycle thief. \\"We did indeed, well, and truly try the case of the Crown versus the defendant in the issue of stealing bicycles, and we concluded, after much debate, that the Crown was in no ways implicated.\\" Several cases later, Chesterton has an epiphany and realizes why we need juries rather than judges. To professional judges, judging seems ordinary. Only a jury of normal citizens can remember that putting men on trial is an extraordinary thing to do.In \\"On Lying in Bed\\", Chesterton reflects on the ceiling, and the joys of observing it from a bed. In \\"The Extraordinary Cabman\\", he tackles the philosophical question of whether anything is actually real, and answers with a definite yes. It's hard to pick the best essay in a collection like this, but I can definitely pick the best title: \\"The Advantages of Having a Broken Leg\\". But regardless, every essay is well worth reading, and the whole book is a worthy addition to any library."},{"Title":"Tremendous Trifles","review":"2009 marks the hundredth anniversary of this book from 1909, which is a collection of columns the author penned for a British newspaper, the Daily Mail. As such it's a mixed bag; some of the writing is, in my view a 3, and some a 5, thus my rating of a 4. Sometimes I don't know what he's talking about. Other times I find myself quoting a paragraph in an e-mail. This book contains my first encounter with Chesterton, a brief essay called \\"On Lying in Bed\\", which I still think one of his best. But when I began this book, although I avidly devour G.K.'s novels, and some of his nonfiction, like Orthodoxy, this one didn't hold me.I returned to it now and then, as one does, after reading rather more gripping reads. Then its magic kicked in, and in my view, some of the later essays, particularly those that are travelogues, are the best. Other readers will have their favorites; some of mine are:\\" The advantages of Having One Leg\\"; \\"The Twelve Men\\"; \\"The Wind and the Trees\\"; \\"In Topsy-Turvy Land\\"; \\"The Tower\\"; \\"The Orthodox Barber\\"; \\"Humanity: An Interlude\\"; \\"The Little Birds Who Won't Sing\\"; \\"The Travellers in State\\"; \\"The Prehistoric Railway Station\\"; \\"A Glimpse of My Country\\"; and \\"The Ballade of a Strange Town\\".That's my dozen keepers from these 39 essays, a rather good haul from a book a century old. The difficulty in this volume is that the references, as in most newspaper columns, are to current controversies, culture, and even jokes of the day. The reason this book celebrates a centennial when so many others of the era are forgotten, is because for Chesterton, those passing fancies, all the rage at the moment, are signposts to conditions common to humanity. That's why he remains so quotable. But neither did he write vaguely about universals; he observed and commented on particular people and places in his time. That's why he remains readable.Few read the sort of column collected here in our day, and fewer now write it. What one notices on reading any Chesterton, however, on dipping into any book almost anywhere, is his delight in living, and looking, and reuminating. This is not a self-help book, but any reader who helps him or herself to it, may be helped regardless, to see more, and enjoy life more. Because his message at bottom is it's OK to enjoy life, to see it as a good gift, to be thankful and revel in it. This is not the frantic optimism of a prescriptive self-help book. To Chesterton, it's simple realism. As he writes in \\"The Ballade of a Strange Town\\":\\"The false optimism, the modern happiness, tires us because it tells us we fit into this world. The true happiness is that we don't fit. We come from somewhere else. We have lost our way.\\" A hundred years later these words still ring true. Which is why we're still reading him."},{"Title":"Tremendous Trifles","review":"I have read some of G.K. Chesterton's fiction and religious non-fiction but had never read any of his newspaper articles. These reflections cover a variety of topics -- mostly light. I enjoyed them for his opinions, style, and the fact that they are short stories that can be read when just a few minutes are available. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to see another side of Chesterton's interests and writing skills."},{"Title":"Tremendous Trifles","review":"This is a compilation of essays written for his newspaper column. I am always impressed by his poetic and detailed descriptions of the world around him. He covers a variety of subjects and always turns the observations about life into truths that I did not expect.

It will give you a glimpse into the genius of Chesterton's brilliant mind. Then you must move on to the more meaty, weighty, substantive philosophic works: Orthodoxy and The Everlasting Man."},{"Title":"Tremendous Trifles","review":"If you're a fan of great writing, you'll be a fan of this collection. Each story within the collection is short, maximum 4 pages, and they get right to the point. However, like any great story, they save the best for last and you will find yourself looking forward to reading the last paragraph within each story as it is truly the best and most invigorating. Chesterton's control of the English language is stunning and his direct matter of proving a thing is awe-inspiring. If you're a fan of his other works, you may like this one even more because it doesn't take as long to get the same great Chesterton-messages out of the reading. I give this book 5 stars because it really is wonderful when you don't have all day to read, yet still want to learn something or be motivated that the world is not all bad throughout the day. If you've got 15 spare minutes, thats enough to flip through one of these stories and feel better about yourself and the world."},{"Title":"Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time, Division I","review":"BEING-IN-THE-WORLD : A Commentary on Heidegger's 'Being and Time,' Division I.

As a general introduction to Heidegger's life and thought, however, it can only take one so far, and those wishing for a fuller treatment would be well advised to take a look at the present equally lucid and stimulating study by Dreyfus.He explains that he has limited detailed treatment of 'Being and Time' to Division I of Part One (i.e., the first half), because he considers this &quot;the most original and important section of the work, for it is [here] that Heidegger works out his account of being-in-the-world and uses it to ground a profound critique of traditional ontology and epistemology&quot; (p.vii). Division II, though containing important material, is marred by &quot;some errors so serious as to block any consistent reading&quot; (p.viii), though it is taken up in a 57-page Appendix.In his brief but extremely interesting Introduction, Dreyfus sets out to answer the question, 'Why study Heidegger?' If I have understood Dreyfus correctly, what he seems to be saying is that Western thought has been fundamentally in error since the time of Plato : &quot;Plato and our tradition got off on the wrong track by thinking that one could have a theory of everything.... Heidegger is not against theory. He thinks it powerful and important, but limited&quot; (p.2).Heidegger, in other words, although accepting a reasonable use of reason, has seen through the folly of that worship of reason which leads to its unreasonable and excessive use. Dreyfus tells us that Heidegger seeks to clear away five main false assumptions :1. Explicitness. &quot;Heidegger questions both the possibility and desirability of making our everyday understanding explicit&quot; (p.4). There are and always will be many things in life that cannot be made explicit, that cannot be explained, that are not amenable to &quot;critical reflection,&quot; things, for example, such as human skills.2. Mental Representation. &quot;Heidegger questions the view that experience is always and most basically a relation between a self-contained subject with mental content (the inner) and an independent object (the outer).&quot; For him &quot;there is a more fundamental way of being-in-the-world that cannot be understood in subject/object terms&quot; (p.5).3. Theoretical Holism. Heidegger &quot;insists that we return to the phenomenon of everyday human activity and stop ringing the changes on the traditional oppositions of immanent/transcendent ... subject/ object ... explicit/tacit ... etc.&quot; (p.6).4. Detachment and Objectivity. &quot;From the Greeks we inherit not only our assumption that we can obtain theoretical knowledge of every domain, even human activities, but also our assumption that the detached theoretical viewpoint is superior to the involved practical viewpoint&quot; (p.6). Heidegger, following the insights of Nietzsche, Peirce, James and Dewey, denies these assumptions.5. Methodological Individualism. Heidegger, &quot;in his emphasis on the social context as the ultimate foundation of intelligibility [shares with Wittgenstein] the view that most philosophical problems can be dis(solved) [sic] by a description of everyday social practices&quot; (p.7). In other words, they are pseudo-problems.If Heidegger were only clearing the ground of 2,500 years of sheer wrongheadedness, he would of course still be an extremely important and valuable thinker. But, as Dreyfus explains, he goes further, for &quot;he has a positive account of authentic human being and a positive methodological proposal for how human being should be systematically studied&quot; (p.8). His influence, which today extends into many areas, has been and continues to be enormous as more and more specialists and experts and technicians of every kind begin to appreciate the fruitfulness of his way of thinking in contrast to the often dismal results produced by their own.Heidegger's 'Being and Time' is a notoriously difficult book, and Dreyfus' commentary is to be welcomed as the first study that succeeds in making it both intelligible and exciting, even to the non-specialist reader such as myself. As one of the clearest accounts of Heidegger's thought to date, it belongs in the library of anyone who is at all interested in this revolutionary and amazing thinker."},{"Title":"Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time, Division I","review":"I am amazed that this book has not been reviewed. For 30-odd years Hubert Dreyfus has been the beloved guide to Heidegger and Continental philosophy for thousands of undergraduate and graduate students, first at MIT and then at Berkeley. This book is constructed from the courses he taught on Heidegger's work, Kierkegaard, and especially that difficult centerpiece of Heidegger's opus, Being and Time. For the beginner and the expert, he opens Heidegger's questions and claims in distinctive, poignant, simple, accessible ways. I cannot imagine attempting to grasp Heidegger's thought without Dreyfus at my side. Dreyfus' account shows Heidegger in the middle of the struggle with those who came before him as he attempts to make sense of the question of what a human being is. I strongly recommend this book as a helpmate. If you are interested in confronting Heidegger's thought and work, get and read Dreyfus."},{"Title":"Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time, Division I","review":"I got to this book after reading &quot;Disclosing New Worlds&quot; by Charles Spinosa, Fernando Flores, and Hubert L. Dreyfus, a very profound work that tries to recover our abilities to make sense of each of us as historical beings, helping us to &quot;live life at its best.&quot;Reading Being-in-the-World has had a great impact on the way I now understand our everyday life in terms of the practices that we pick up -as Heidegger puts it- from the society we are brought up in and not in terms of abstract theories that try to relate our specific actions to mental states. As a management consultant, it guides me away from trying to specify precisely, say, the 'things' a salesman should say and do in a conversation with a client. I'd be better off if I can find another salesman that exhibits the results I'm interested in, and managing a &quot;learning-in-action&quot; program, so that the first salesman learns from the more experienced salesman. As a father, it guides me away from getting my son to hold on to vast amounts of information -the purpose of our modern educational system- but to situating him in an environment where he can pickup successful practices for dealing with diverse situations- including technical and interpersonal problems.Being-in-the-World was not an easy read for me, since my background is in Computer Science and Management (I had to do some research in the philosophical traditions and problemas that Heidegger was attacking). However, Dreyfus' commentary is most relevant to people in Computer Science and Management - guiding them away from the utopias of Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support Systems.I recommend this book to anyone willing to make an effort in understanding one of the deepest thinkers on what it means to be a human being &quot;living life at its best.&quot;"},{"Title":"Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time, Division I","review":"I have gone through this book at least three times and I find it to be the clearest and most easily understandable companion to Heidegger's magnum opus. One of the things that makes this book so special is that Dreyfus' is giving us his class notes and updating them every year until after some 25 years we have a very refined and distilled product . I have yet to find anyone who can equal the clarity here."},{"Title":"Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time, Division I","review":"Professor Dreyfus has rendered a valuable service to readers of Being and Time. Why do I think this? For two reasons: Dreyfus has selected abundant quotations directly from Being and Time most pertinent and comprehensible to the topic at hand; and Dreyfus provides extensive commentary clarifying further the arguments made by Heidegger in each section of text.Including the introduction there are 16 chapters in Being-in-the-World. In the Introduction Professor Dreyfus provides rationale for why anyone should even \\"care\\" about studying Being and Time. The following 15 chapters deal with particular aspects of the Being of beings and Being in the world.As an example of Dreyfus's ability to make Heidegger comprehensible I have selected a section from Chapter 4 in Being-in-the-World. In this chapter labeled Availableness and Occurrentness Dreyfus quotes Heidegger:\\"In everyday terms, we understand ourselves and our existence by way of the activities we pursue and the things we take care of. (BP, 159). To Exist then means, among other things, relating to oneself by being with beings. (BP,157).A fairly clear statement by Heidegger in itself. But Dreyfus buttresses this with discussion of Heidegger's two modes of being. One mode of being is called \\"availableness\\" and \\"occurrentness.\\" And the other mode of being called \\"comportment and cognition.\\" According to Heidegger these two modes reveal the implausibility of Cartesian-like accounts of \\"knowing objects\\" through disinterested, self-sufficient, context-free contemplation of things as substance. Instead, Dasein knows things (i.e., entities and Beings) by existing, or interacting with them to accomplish some task or goal of especial importance to Dasein. Hence - and unlike Cartesian accounts - things are known to Dasein not by contemplating them first and interacting with them second but by the reverse. Active involvement with things and people is more basic to making things intelligible than is simply looking at them.In sum, I recommend Being-in-the-World to anyone with more than a passing interest in Being and Time. Professor Dreyfus does an outstanding job of making the seemingly incomprehensible knowable."},{"Title":"Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time, Division I","review":"Not only an introduction, but a constant companion. I'm on my third copy of this book; the first two literally fell apart from constant use. Whenever I'm reading Heidegger,or any commentary or other work on Heidegger, Dreyfus is always close by. Whatever he may think of his own shortcomings, there's really no one else like him. One reason is that he thinks about Heidegger the way Heidegger would think about himself. Using Dreyfus as a guide, you don't have to worry about being led down the wrong road to a dead end. Dreyfus writes with all the clarity of any analytic philosopher, but is not hagridden by the ontological biases inherent in analytic philosophy as an ideology. And make no mistake about it: in Anglo-American philosophy, the analytic tradition does define an ideology. It offers a worldview which Heidegger (correctly, I submit) rejected. To try to translate Heidegger into the jargon of analytic philosophy is to misunderstand him from the start.Before you even begin to read \\"Being and Time,\\" or any other work by Heidegger, read this book by Dreyfus first, even if not from cover to cover. Then get a copy of \\"Being and Time\\"; either the Macquarrie & Robinson or the Stambaugh translations will do, but I would recommend getting both. If you do German, then try to get the Max Niemeyer edition of \\"Sein und Zeit.\\" Then go through Dreyfus again, this time along with \\"Being an Time,\\" so that you can put Heidegger's dense and sometimes convoluted prose into context. When you've finished this phase of your study of Heidegger, then I would recommend moving back in time, and reading Heidegger's earlier works. You will then see \\"Being and Time\\" in its formative stages. Two excellent primary sources (with ample commentary), both available from Amazon, are \\"Ontology: the Hermeneutics of Facticity,\\" and \\"Supplements: from the Earliest Essays to Being and Time and Beyond.\\"If you're a hard-core philosopher or Heidegger aficionado, you may want to include in your study such sources as Plato, Parmenides, Heraclitus, Aristotle, Augustine, Duns Scotus, Luther, Descartes, Kant, Hegel, Brentano, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Dilthey, Husserl (especially), and a host of others, all of whom had an influence on his thought, as well as his own students, contemporaries, and people who were influenced by him (Gadamer, Arendt, Jaspers, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Derrida, Foucault, et al.), as well as thinkers in the Far East.Now, why go through all this? Why is Heidegger worth the time and effort needed to understand him? Because, after Heidegger, there's simply no going back to pre-Heidegger. Not that everyone agrees with this; in fact, until recently, very few did. However, slowly but surely, Heidegger is acquiring an audience of serious thinkers, who understand that he got philosophy moving in a direction that, to use market terminology, allows no retracement. When I say that there's no going back to pre-Heidegger, I don't mean that everything earlier than Heidegger is obsolete. As he himself would have been the first to assert, there can be no answer without a question. And those giants whose thought articulated the great questions are no less part of the ongoing project which is philosophy than others (including Heidegger) who stood on their shoulders.Yet, even if there are no answers without questions, there can be questions without answers. And this is especially unsettling to human beings, whose \\"reason,\\" is, as Kant understood, architectonic, Reason's prime directive is order; it can't abide danglers or loose ends. Everything has to \\"fit.\\" To use contemporary (mindless) parlance, we all seek \\"closure.\\" However, readers who are looking for \\"closure\\" in Heidegger look in vain. No one understood better than he that he never reached his destination, a complete revelation of Being, and an exhaustive understanding of human being (Dasein), in particular. His lifelong attitude toward philosophy was that philosophy is and must be an eternal questioning. Unlike the great system-builders of the past, whose metanarratives have worn out from constant use, Heidegger always has something new to reveal, by clearing away, to use Locke's terms, the rubbish that lies in the way of understanding. It all depends upon how you view philosophy. If you see it as a source of entertainment and distraction, then you can ignore Heidegger. But if you take it seriously, and believe that it can, and should, disclose dimensions of the human reality that are not accessible to science, and that we humans, especially since the onset of modernity, have come perilously close to forgetting who and what we are, then Heidegger must be near the top of your list of great thinkers. And having Dreyfus as your guide will make things so much easier, even if not easy. But, as Spinoza once observed, \\"omnia praeclara tam difficilia quam rara sunt.\\" (\\"All things excellent are as difficult as they are rare.\\")"},{"Title":"Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time, Division I","review":"Dreyfus is able to write one of the strongest intros to Being and Time because of his background: instead of spending his entire career trying to work out the esoteric details of this text, as many history of philosophy professors do, he as appropriated his understanding into his own unique and important work on modern technologies. The result is that he is able to relate this understanding, although of course it will have its personal emphases (as any intro does... the only text that lets you know truly and fully what Heidegger is up to without a slant, is Being and Time itself), clearly and effectively; other scholars let their specialist debates overly influence and complicate their introductory work.The only work about Being and Time that deserves five stars, however, is Being and Time... and even though this work is notoriously difficult, please do try to read it primarily and then use these aids for clarification if you ares stuck."},{"Title":"Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time, Division I","review":"Towards the very end of this 370-page commentary on Heidegger, Dreyfus articulates the anxieties inherent in a society that does not understand \\"how to make meaninglessness the foundation of a life worth living\\" (p.335). This problem is made all the more difficult because, in Dreyfus's words, \\"human beings seek secure meaning\\" (p.334). The banality of everyday human existence and its unbearable meaninglessness induces one to immerse oneself in a fascination with trivial activities (p.228) and gossip (p.231), which, at best, distract us from our predicament.To resist the pull of such mundane activities and concerns \\"requires constant effort\\" (p.236), an effort made all the more difficult given that the banal and conformist social world is the foundation of our existence and therefore largely inescapable (p.143). Everything we do falls within the context of this conformist social world--even the natural sciences--the study of which only make sense within the context of our society, as nature itself derives no benefit of being revealed to man (p.277). It is worth noting that Heidegger considers the societal benefits of an understanding of the natural sciences as important, in that \\"nature immediately takes vengeance on a wrong-headed approach\\" (p.263). Heidegger contends that (in Dreyfus's words) \\"truth is not subjective . . . The practices that make possible agreement between assertions and states of affairs under some description are not up to us--we are thrown in them\\" (p.278). Or, in Heidegger's words, \\"If one interprets \`subjective' as \`left to the subject's discretion,' then [truth is] certainly not [subjective].\\"Dreyfus goes on to explain that it is the realization and acceptance that we are \\"thrown\\" into events that allows us to distance ourselves from the banality and conformity of common human existence (p.315). Dreyfus considers Heidegger's approach to the problems of an apparently meaningless existence to be analogous to, and influenced by, the theological views of Kierkegaard. Kierkegaard regarded any attempt to find rest in hedonism, ethical rationalizations, or even a God before which one was a mere servant, as sinful. These facile spiritual stances are considered by Dreyfus to be \\"safe\\" pseudo-identities similar that those provided by the classes of depressingly banal human existence imagined by Heidegger. Heidegger's solution to this conundrum appears to be that of coming to terms with the random events into which one of us is inevitably thrown, and actively anticipating the future and move toward those goals that we actually yearn to achieve, rather than waiting passively for come what may while contenting oneself with picking low-hanging fruit."},{"Title":"Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time, Division I","review":"There's no getting away from Heidegger; most of the intellectual life of the later 20th century is a series of commentaries on or arguments with Being and Time. But the book is almost as difficult as its reputation would have it. Most of us need some help.Probably the best short summary of its thesis came from Samuel Johnson: \\"Depend upon it, Sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.\\" But Johnson died about 140 years before the book was published, so he didn't actually get to read it. Those of us born after its publication could use a more detailed guide to Heidegger's dense and unwieldy work. This, unfortunately, isn't it, in spite of Dreyfus's decades of teaching and the testimonials on the back cover from Charles Taylor and other luminaries.Dreyfus, who teaches at UC Berkeley, reduces Being and Time to a neutral quasi-psychology in which \\"being-there is doing something it makes sense to do given the public situation, and given already taken-over public for-the-sake-of-whiches.\\" And that's all, folks. Dasein (Heidegger's term for us human folk) and the world are knowable only through everyday public practice, and according to Dreyfus the point of Division I of this two-part work is to show how it's possible to get through one's day without thinking about it and how that provides the only basis for knowledge.After being criticised for his failure to address Division II, Dreyful admitted that he had \\"overlooked warnings, scattered about in Division I, that the average intelligibility desribed there would later be shown to be an inferior form of understanding.\\" Well, duh. Those aren't hints; they're screaming tirades. Dreyfus not only undervalues the importance of Division II; he is deaf to the emotional character of the whole work, which conveyed as much by its literary qualities as by its argument.Although he tossed in a few half-hearted denials that he's doing anything more than ontology, Heidegger clearly loathed the world of everydayness, the inauthentic being of the \\"they,\\" and he longed for its supercession. \\"Existential analysis,\\" he said, \\"has the character of doing violence, whether to the claims of the everyday interpretation, or to its complacency and its tranquillized obviousness.\\" (H 311) In retrospect it's clear how this position led to his embrace of Hitler--not that one can read Nazi ideology off from the book, but because its hopes and fears were just those played on so expertly by the Nazis. Heidegger saw Hitler as the truly authentic man who could be the conscience of the nation. (He tried to cast himself in a similar role at Freiburg, with results that would be comical if anything about that time could appear humorous.)But one doesn't need literary sensitivity to see what's wrong with Dreyfus's Heidegger. Why would young German intellectuals have flocked to his lectures if he were simply showing them that everyday skills were the be-all and end-all? It's simply impossible to imagine this spectacled epistemologist as \\"the secret king of philosophy,\\" the charismatic magus who captivated the young Hannah Arendt in presenting \\"the thinking that springs as a passion.\\"Dreyfus's book contains a long Appendix on Kierkegaard, authenticity, and Division II; but its conclusions are just as bathetically deflationary as the main text. Here, too, Heidegger comes across as a multiculturalist liberal. Authenticity is supposed to make available a salad-bar of \\"marginal practices,\\" a phrase which appears nowhere in Being and Time and which is not supported by the citations adduced. Instead of a stoic and joyful acceptance of one's fate--one of the themes that leads Heidegger to Nietzsche--Dreyfus sees merely a free choice of commitment from the social resources available and a concomitant choice of a role model like Jesus or Florence Nighingale.And Dreyfus knew Heidegger. No doubt the sage listened politely to whatever he had to say and took it as further proof that Americans had no culture."},{"Title":"Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time, Division I","review":"I was assigned this book as part of a Performance Coaching\\" course...it is by far the most confusing book I have ever read.

Clarke's Mysterious World","review":"I am totally confused by this book's title. Ordinarily, one might expect a book called \\"Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World\\" to have been written by Arthur C. Clarke!, but on this occasion there are another two names on the book's cover which are shown separately from Clarke's. Some years ago, Clarke hosted two successful British television series' entitled Mysterious World and World of Strange Powers. This work appears to be the best-selling book which accompanied the former series.My problem with this book, however, is Clarke's attitude towards the world's mysteries and I get the firm impression that he thinks \\"Daddy knows best.\\" Put another way, Clarke is a most distinguished scientist and engineer. For him, therefore, all paranormal events have a perfectly reasonable and rational explanation - even if he does not yet have all the answers to hand.Take the many sightings of various Apemen around the world - Yeti, Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Almas and Yowie - to name but some. People from different countries and even different continents have reported seeing similar creatures over hundreds of years. To me this suggests there really \\"is\\" something out there or the reports would have petered out a long time ago. Clarke, however, draws the opposite conclusion stating; \\"Personally, I would take reports of contemporary apemen more seriously if there were not so many of them.\\" Wrong!In short, it is because Clarke is a scientist that his mind appears to be totally closed to the possibility of any true mystery. For that reason, I would suggest his suitability for a book on this subject is questionable. His downbeat comments certainly spoil the enjoyment of the read.NM"},{"Title":"Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World","review":"For me, this book was an introduction to many a strange thing, and to a better approach to the paranormal. For this book is neither a smug debunking of the kind that Carl Sagan or Richard Dawkins are so keen on, or the sensationalised tabloid trash of the kind you get repeated continually on cable TV...The book's attitude is summed up in the afterword by Arthur C. Clarke (who as some have cleverly deduced, didn't write this book) - some phenomena are much more plausible than others. This is a good thing, as all too often, there is a black and white approach, which seems to think that all of the so called paranormal is either real (to anyone with an \\"open mind\\") or the province of the gullible and ridiculous. So he says, quite rightly, that there's a better chance of \\"monsters\\" living in the deep ocean than in smaller lakes and lochs, which can be searched extensively.My favourite chapter by far, is the one on Tunguska Explosion. This is something everyone should read. Here you've got a genuine mystery, and it is published with some excellent pictures from the original expedition, interviews with the surviving members etc. The bits about ball lightning and sea monsters are superb. Some of the pieces have been debunked since, unfortunately, but at the same time, plenty of things have emerged since - for example, Roswell and Area 51 were not the big legends in the early 80s that they are now.Anyone who is looking for stuff on telepathy, poltergeists, ghosts etc will be disappointed. This is to be found in the sequel \\"World of Strange Powers\\".It's great to read a book like this - it talks about the odd things in our world, without getting stupid or trashy.

All serious wine aficionados should keep a copy handy for quick reference."},{"Title":"Divisions of the Tetrachord","review":"Chalmers here goes on an extremely comprehensive exploration of a long-forgotten (but highly interesting as a field of study) building block of ancient music: the tetrachord, more commonly known as the fourth. In ancient Greece, the fourth was divided into any number of different types of division, depending on the regional or philosophical or mathematical taste prevalent, and various &quot;flavors&quot; were in fashion from one period to the next.As a tool for the aspiring pure, or just, intonation enthusiast interested in the historiography of ancient tuning systems, this book is a treasure. It does, however, have a couple minor flaws. First, a pure fourth, based on a simple harmonic ratio of 4/3, has a value of about 498 cents, not the even-tempered 500 that he uses throughout the book. This may seem like a completely geeky bit of arcana, but the distinction is more important than mere esotery: if we are to discuss intervals as whole-number ratios, we have to give their exact equivalent in cents, not the nearest approximation in equal temperament. People fought for centuries about how to define certain intervals; we do them injustice if we gloss over that precision.I suppose that should serve as a sort of primer for you: if you're the sort of person who would care (or even know) about the difference between 498 and 500 cents, this book will be invaluable. If you don't care, you should probably spend your time reading something else."},{"Title":"Divisions of the Tetrachord","review":"While the review above is correct in clarifying the 498 vs. 500 cents issue, I thought it important to point out that the call to use the \\"exact cents value\\" for a ratio is misguided: the ratio 4/3 does not have an exact cents value, and this is really the crucial point. To 7 decimal places, 4/3 is 498.0449991 cents. This is close enough to 498.045 that we should be OK using that, but any cents value is only an approximation of a ratio, and vice versa. Anyway, Chalmers's book is an encyclopedic account of the multifarious tunings proposed by ancient and medieval authors, and importantly, it also includes proposals from the Islamicate world which found their way into Europe after the Moorish conquest of Spain and the Crusades."},{"Title":"Divisions of the Tetrachord","review":"This is an amazingly informative book from a man who never gets bored with the subject. It is encyclopedic, as others have said, but it also has observations on the relevance of the tetrachord, not just a catalog (although it has that too). Many of the ancient Greek theorists had completely different reasonings and systems for tuning the various modes, but they were largely attempting to explain what was already being practiced by musicians; meaning that, for the most part, musicians weren't studying these guys' works to learn how to tune their instruments, they were just tuning them, and these guys came along and wanted to know why they used those notes. So there were plenty of proposed explanations, which together form a great introduction to musical tuning.BUT read it FREE online!

It tells the story of young Elizabeth de Beauchamp, the daughter of Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick, and her subsequent marriage to Thomas, 3rd Lord, Baron de Astley.In the narrative, young Elizabeth is sent to London as a lady-in-waiting to the newly crowned Queen Isabel, child-wife of King Edward II. As her wedding day nears she meets her betrothed Sir Thomas, and finds herself the center of a rivalry between Thomas, and her near cousin, Roger de Mortimer, 3rd Baron Mortimer, and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.Though such events in the narrative are fictitious, the historical events are told in extraordinarily, vivid detail. The bitterly loveless marriage of Isabel of France, and the weak, King Edward II of England, is told in the First Person from Elizabeth's point of view. And her observations of the exploits of Edward, and his favorites, first Piers de Gaveston, then later Hugh le Despenser, embroil her in palace intrigues, both in England and France. The reader watches how she unwittingly, but willingly participates in events that facilitate one of the most famous scandles in British History.As a woman in the barbaric climate of the 14th C, she is the witness to great events, though not a participant in any of the battles. However, those limitations do not keep the irrepressible Elizabeth down. She becomes fully immersed as a participant in court intrigues, and her story is both thrilling, and wonderfully passionate.Many male readers may find the girlie romance aspects of the novel bothersome, but trust me when I say, if you love a great historical, romantic fiction, with loads of plot twists, and turns. This is absolutely a must-add to your collections.That Graham did extensive research in Britain in order to write this trilogy lends all three novels immediacy, and realism. The characters were not only real people who lived in those times, but the historical facts are well chronicled."},{"Title":"Notes of a white Black woman: Race, color, and community","review":"I too am a White Black woman and this book captures the complexities of our life experiences.

Judy Scales-Trent makes some excellent points regarding race divisions in today's society. Not only does Ms. Scales-Trent present her information in such a way that anyone can identify with, but all the information in this book has been researched and is quite valid. I learned about things, such as the racial purity law, that I never new existed. It really made me think about what my race means and how it shapes who I am. This is a great book for both teenagers and adults, biracial or not."},{"Title":"WinRunner 7 In A Hurry! Software Test Automation With WinRunner","review":"I'll first start my review out by saying that I need to agree with the other reviewers on the length of the book. It is a bit short. But in spite of its length, for a technical book on a very narrow subject, the price is within the norm.Now, this book is aimed at the beginner, and anyone with a few months experience at WinRunner should overlook this one. BUT for the NEW WinRunner scripter, it seems to have all the right stuff.One thing someone buying this book should understand, it that the book is clearly self-published. Don't expect the same glossy pages you'd find with an IDG or Sam's Books kind of publication. You don't get that with this book. Enough said about that. On to the review.Chapter's 1 and 2 do not say much.Chapter 3 starts you off with installing the product. I've seen a few people have trouble installing software, so, this would be of use to some beginners. It is funny. It reminds me of the instructions for the installation of Windows 95 in the &quot;Windows 95 For Dummies&quot; book. Same wacky sense of humor.Chapter 4 is a tutorial that assumes you know NOTHING about WinRunner. It has you recording scripts for MS Notepad, MS Paint, and MS Calculator. It explains what each line in the recorded script does.Chapter 5 is a second tutorial aimed at introducing and teaching about the &quot;GUI map.&quot; It points out some of the pitfalls that even I had trouble with early on. It explains how to capture an application's screens into the GUI map. It walks you through capturing all the screens in MS Notepad.One interesting note is that it seems like these guys have been around the Mercury tools a while.Chapter 6 is a list of some 8 GUI map pitfalls and work-arounds for them.Chapter 7 is the next tutorial. Here they have you recording scripts for the testing of a web site. They start by walking you through nine steps for automating such a site: Web Browsers, Sizing up the Project, Breaking it down into Related Areas, Recording, Debugging, Running the script, Finding and Reporting Bugs, Updating the scripts, and Updating the Scripts for each Build.Each subject is taken up in detail and they even have you put together a simplistic automated test plan. As with the other tutorials, each WinRunner script line is explained. This is the biggest chapter and since most software these days is web-based, that is a good thing.Chapter 8 explains how to debug a WinRunner script. Just a short three pages, but it explains some of the &quot;gotcha's&quot; and how to avoid them.Chapter 9 is another &quot;Pitfalls&quot; chapter. This time you get the problems and solutions for 15 different web testing issues.Chapter 10 is just a &quot;Why and when do you automate&quot; kind of chapter. It is short.Chapter 11 has 5 pages of hints and tips. Again, not much new here for the WinRunner Pro, but a lot of info to keep the beginner going.Chapter 12 is an overview of software testing techniques. It contains the basic info that a tester should know.There is an excellent SOFTWARE TESTING GLOSSARY with some 200+ testing terms defined. Someone new to test automation or general software testing would find this to be one of the most valuable parts of the entire book. I would even buy it if it were available by itself for a few bucks.To sum it up, this book has a LOT to offer the WinRunner beginner. It gets him/her started, it teaches him/her &quot;the ropes&quot; and there is not much else out there in third party WinRunner books."},{"Title":"WinRunner 7 In A Hurry!

Software Test Automation With WinRunner","review":"A client asked me to review this book prior to purchasing it for his test organization. While I did read the entire book, it only took about 5 minutes to see that the book was not only useless to my client, but for anyone looking to successfully implement automated testing with WinRunner (or any other tool).I understand that the authors targeted the book towards users who were completely new to automated testing. However, automated testing is a lot like swimming - you have to have a minimum level of expertise, or the consequences will be extremely negative.I have been involved with hundreds of WinRunner implementations with groups of all experience and skill levels. If I had to find a use for this book it would be to illustrate how to fail. I will say that the description of how to open the box and remove the contents is very helpful to those who haven't ever opened a software package before...The book completely ignores the process of automated testing. WinRunner is not the process, it is a tool that enables the process. However, the worst aspect of the book is that many of its recommendations are outright wrong! At one point the readers are advised to simply re-record the scripts if they stop working. Anyone who has experience with automted testing knows that having to recreate scripts is one of the primary reasons for failure. The object is to create an automated test suite that will NOT have to be constantly maintained and re-created.Independent of the content. The book is poorly constructed (it looks like it was published at a low-end copy shop), and is filled with typos and other useless information that appears to be there only to fulfill some minimum page quota. I could go on, but I think enough has been said."},{"Title":"WinRunner 7 In A Hurry! Software Test Automation With WinRunner","review":"This book is so hastily made; the authors apparently did not even go through the trouble to complete a simple spell check!Aside from bad grammar and blatant misspellings, this book is technically misleading and horribly inaccurate.With sections that tell the users how to open the cardboard box, yet explicitly tells them NOT to read the readme file as part of the installation, this book appears to be a malicious attempt to confuse users of the testing tool and increase the likelihood of failure.Going past the embarrassing installation section, the application sections are technically flawed and misleading. Two examples are found in the way they repeatedly describe the set_window and the gui_load WinRunner functions. The descriptions are not just \\"different\\" than the WinRunner manual, they are in direct conflict.Overall, much of the content is repeated over and over (literally copied and pasted) to take up space.Although this tool, like any test tool in the industry, is not always easy to implement, especially for beginners, I'd recommend the material that comes with the WinRunner software. I'd like to see a book like this with REAL content to complement Mercury's training material. For now, this is all that is available and it does not deserve the time to review, let alone the outrageous cover price."},{"Title":"WinRunner 7 In A Hurry!

Most casual tourists who visit Big Bend are disappointed, as I was, in their pitiful efforts at capturing the essence of the experience both in words and 35mm photographs. This is a land that does not exist in standard format; it is truly a large-format landscape that requires exceptional verbal ability and skillful large-format photography to do it justice. Gentry Steele has done just that. His love and knowledge of the Big Bend country are clearly evident in his text and, especially in his striking black and white photographs. A hearty thumbs up for this spectacular book!"},{"Title":"Land of the Desert Sun: Texas' Big Bend Country (Louise Lindsey Merrick Natural Environment Series)","review":"This is the kind of book you return to again and again. Steele has both consumate technical skill and the eye (and heart) of an artist. The composition of each photograph is striking, but it is the play of light and shadow -- across canyon walls, over abandoned adobe buildings, and the occasional plant -- that will delight and amaze the viewer. Steele used the intense desert light as his accomplice, creating art out of light, shade, rocks, and space. Each photograph is accompanied by a brief description of what you are seeing and where the photograph was taken. Steele's love and respect for the Big Bend region is evident on every page. This isn't the kind of book to be flipped through casually. I find myself lingering over each page, savoring the image, returning over and over to particular images, seeing some new each time. I plan to give this book to friends and relatives for Christmas this year. I confess to owning two D. Gentry Steele photographic prints, including the one chosen for the cover of this book.

Pretty books of this sort are a means to solace the soul on a dreary day. The photographs by Rob Gray lead me to daydream --first I'm looking at the picture of the garden, then I'm in that garden in my mind. For some, daydreams may be the only way to garden but for those with access to dirt and a little ambition, all things are possible.Recently, various authors have produced a spate of books on antique roses but what about antique perennials? These are the perennials people used to grow, and in some cases still do because they are so tough. While the modern growers offer hybrids of every persuasion, some folks want to restore an older garden, or create a garden with an &quot;older look.&quot; If so, this book is filled with ideas for &quot;antique&quot; gardening -- in plots and in pots.Proctor's book contains an overview of the story of perennials: antique perennials, the written history of flowers, and the history of the perennial gardening style. He then provides a portfolio of antique perennials, laid out A-Z. Each entry covers one or more pages. Various garden shots as well as close-ups of plants, in many cases in floral arrangements (in vases, pots, or other containers, for example Gooseneck Loosestrife in a tuba) are provided.The photographs in the front section show various old-style gardens from garden parterres (literally parted earth) expansions of the French knot gardens of the Middle Ages to fields of flowers such as Goldenrod or Solidago growing in England (introduced from America). Further along the book contains the separate plant listings that range from Acanthus Mollis grown in the Middle Ages and Achillea grown in 19th Century Romantic Gardens to Zantedeschia aethiopia the Calla Lily from Ethiopia.PERENNIALS is not exhaustive, but it does include a solid listing of plants that will work in the &quot;antique&quot; garden. Having grown all of them at one time or another, I can assure you they will mostly do well in Zone 7 if you &quot;follow the growing instructions&quot; found in the ordinary gardening manual (not PERENNIALS which is more concerned with showing you what might be grown and how it might be grown, not how to grow them). Some of these old-timers do so well they'll take over, but that's another book."},{"Title":"A History of Medieval Europe from Constantine to Saint Louis.","review":"This is the thinking man's intro to medieval history. It's complex, thoughful, never dry, lucidly organized, and, surprisingly, barely dated at all. This man must have been on the cutting edge of his time for his work to be so strong after 50 years. Be sure to get the newer edition with the little update at the end of each chapter, responding to recent scholarship. You won't find a smarter or easier-to-read short survey of medieval history anywhere."},{"Title":"A History of Medieval Europe from Constantine to Saint Louis.","review":"I read this book from cover to cover as part of a course I did on Medieval Church History - this book is about history in general, but I guess that it deals with a time period where the church was so ubiquitous that there is little need to deal 'separately' with church matters. Indeed, Davis gives entire chapters on things like the rise of the Papacy and the First Two Crusades. His book deals with a massive expanse of history and geography. He delves into matters concerning Russia, the Mongols, the Sassanids etc. etc. when needed, but his focus is overwhelmingly continental Europe - as the title leads us to expect.The book is actually organised thematically, which is quite amazing. Of course the chapters come in a kind of chronological sequence, but what Davis seeks to do, daringly, is to highlight the major issues of this period of time (such as Feudalism, or the Investiture Controversy, for instance), and tell history that way. Only a master of the field would attempt such as thing, and Davis pulls it off remarkably. Nonetheless, the result is kind of... potted. It's just too easy to lose a sense of flow as he shifts gears to move from one theme to another. You come out of the book appreciating medieval history, and understanding certain things (such as Justinian's conquests and the Fall of Rome, for example) really well. What's lacking sometimes is a sense of how these things fit together and what the overall sequence of events actually was.Don't get me wrong - this is a brilliant book. The timelines at the beginning of each chapter and the appendices at the end are excellent frames for what is a lucid and incredibly informative text. For all I know, this is the best book there is dealing with this expanse of history, and I feel so enriched to really understand the 'whys and wherefores' of so many crucial turning-points in history such as the rise of monasteries and the sickening Fourth Crusade. I do definitely recommend this book, but it gets 4 stars from me because I found it just a bit too potted.(The most bizarre thing of all is that the introduction to the second half of the book is all about architecture - but at no other point does Davis say anything about architecture other than in that 'introductory' section. Weird! I guess things like this give 'character' to a book.)[Footnote: Just so people know, Davis was a brilliant medieval scholar who wrote this book about 60 years ago for an introductory course he taught on medieval history - it was a compulsory background unit for students of modern history! Now, another scholar named Moore has revised the text a little, updated the 'Further Reading' sections and added Appendicies dealing with major debates and research that have occurred since the book was published. As I've said, these updates and new sections are good. What's most astonishing, however, is the way that Davis seems to have 'anticipated' a great deal of the scholarly work that would be done later - his analysis of Feudalism is a great example of this.]"},{"Title":"Common Sense: A Simple Plan for Financial Independence","review":"Art Williams presents a clear and simple process to help you focus on putting your money in the right places.

Buy it, borrow it whatever you have to get it and read it you wont be sorry."},{"Title":"Secret Fantasy","review":"\\"Secret Fantasy\\" was my first Cheryl Holt Romance, and I have to say that I didn't enjoy it. Margaret Gray came to live with her extended family as a child, following the death of her parents. Margaret grows up with a tyrannical aunt, Lavinia, and spoiled cousin, Penelope. Lavinia desperately wants Penelope to wed a title, and invites Jordan Romsey, who holds a laudable said title, to her home to entice him into marrying the 16-year-old. Jordan, however, becomes instantly smitten with Margaret, and the two eventually begin a pointless affair, for Jordan must marry an heiress and Margaret is most definitely not one.My issue with this book wasn't the actual story, but the dialog and character development. I thought the dialog was anachronistic, and very short, staccato. There never seemed to be any meaning or emotion accompanying the conversations between most of the characters. Even the primary relationship (and believe me, there were several couplings going on in this story to keep track of!) felt flat and distant; I found myself just not caring what happened to ANY of them. The sex scenes in the book also bothered me, probably because, again, there wasn't enough connection between anybody to be having sex all over the place. In one particular scene, Penelope is raped by Jordan's father (told you there was a lot going on), and everything about it was completely depraved and horrible, but the author tried to make it seem like Penelope deserved it. And even with all the awful goings on, everything magically turns out just fine in the end. Hmmmm....Save your money and read something else.

The sweet, innocent, kind and intelligent, Margaret is respected by those in the local village and young children at the school where she works and is able to escape the verbal and at times physical abuse of her aunt and cousin. The widowed Lavinia discovers from her long time lover and Steward Robert Mason that she has depleted the funds left from the estate of her merchant husband. She plans an arranged marriage for Penelope with the titled, handsome and naughty Jordan Prescott, Viscount Romney. Jordan is cynical about life and love, as he has been burdened with estate debts and the care of his younger siblings left in his care by his rogue of a father Charles Prescott, the Earl of Kettering. When Jordan arrives at Lavinia's home to meet Penelope, he accidentally walks into the bedroom of the beautiful Margaret. He falls in immediate lust for her and decides he will have her as a mistress while pursuing the spoiled Penelope for marriage. When the Earl discovers his son is considering marriage to a rich young heiress, he plans to steal the young Penelope away from Jordan. He shows up at Lavinia's home accompanied by his long-time mistress Anne. This wicked house party soon becomes a house of schemes with revolving doors on the bedrooms, with the schemers unaware that not a one of them has any money. Penelope decides she would rather have Charles than the son Jordan. Lavinia wants Charles for herself while leading on her Steward Robert as well as Jordan. Anne, disappointed in Charles and his continued lies desires Robert. Jordan wants Margaret most of all. They meet for several passionate interludes that begin to grow into love. Margaret desires Jordan and realizes her love is growing and knows it will lead to a painful ending. While she and Jordan are struggling with their intense feelings, Lavinia catches them in a passionate embrace and evicts Margaret to the streets. Robert, while doing some searching into Lavinia's accounts, discovers that it is Margaret who has been the heiress all along and that Lavinia has been living off of Margaret's dowry while keeping her unaware and enslaved. Just as Jordan realizes he loves Margaret, he discovers the news about her dowry. He now understands he has an upward battle to convince her of his love, but most of all he seeks justice by attempting to find her and inform her of the inheritance, while at the same time making sure Lavinia and his father pay for the years of using people for their selfish needs. The secret fantasies of all the players involved in this story of scheming for money and sex fall into place in many surprise endings. Secret Fantasy is an entertaining erotic read that is difficult to put down with a complicated plot that seduces sizzles and flows in perfect balance."},{"Title":"Secret Fantasy","review":"The other reviewers may be taking themselves a little too seriously! This author has a fabulous talent at creating MANY interesting and multi-layered characters we want to know more about, gives us levels of both villians, demi-villians and star-crossed lovers all to enjoy. This is not a deep, emotional family saga that spawns generations--heck, no! We have a male and female lead we care about, the reality of economics for women in 19th century England and acceptance that the most \\"moral\\" person in the crowd may not be the one who truly steals your heart. This is an easy, afternoon or two of reading to leave with satisfaction and a smile for the winning of true love and the punishment of those mean and deserving."},{"Title":"Secret Fantasy","review":"Margaret Gray is an orphaned spinister living with her aunt and cousin.

Jordan has to make a decision, does he marry for money or does he marry for love.Lots of twists and turns make this a fun read. Yes, this formula has been seen before, but I thought the characters were very fresh and well developed. I couldn't put the book down. Jordan and Margaret have an unforgettable story!"},{"Title":"Secret Fantasy","review":"In 1812 England Jordan Prescott, Lord Romsey, must find an eligible bride with a large dowry in order to restore the family fortune that has been squandered by his worthless father, Charles. He's lured to Gray's Manor by the scheming Lavinia Gray who hopes to pair Jordan with her daughter, Penelope.A case of mistaken identity leads Jordan to believe he's been paired with Lavinia's niece, Margaret. He immediately sets about seducing her only to find that she's a penniless schoolteacher who will inherit none of the Gray money. Margaret falls in love with Jordan and has her first sexual awakening with him but is bewildered to learn that he must marry Penelope for her dowry.The situation becomes more complicated when Jordan's father arrives at Gray's Manor. He turns young Penelope's head with dreams of becoming his wife and obtaining the entr&eacute;e into London society that she's always dreamed of having.What none of them knows is that Lavinia is deeply in debt and hiding a very big secret at Gray's Manor. It's a secret only one other person knows, and it could unravel everyone's schemes.Secret Fantasy is one of Cheryl Holt's best novels. She has a wonderful ability to create the most despicable villains, and readers will cheer when these connivers get what's coming to them in the end.As with other recent novels, Holt takes as much care with the minor characters as she does with the hero and heroine. There's a lovely, romantic sub-plot involving two secondary characters that's nicely worked into the story.All-in-all Secret Fantasy is a terrific read. It's erotic, fast-paced and ends on a very satisfying note."},{"Title":"Secret Fantasy","review":"I can't remember the last time a romance novel was full of so many mean, nasty characters. I usually enjoy Cheryl Holt's books, but I could barely finish this one. The heroine is certainly far more forgiving than I would have been in her place."},{"Title":"Secret Fantasy","review":"This was my first time reading this author and this is my last time reading this author. The main characters were nasty pieces of work. The male, Romsey (can't remember his first name), could have been written better and given better qualities but the author relied on his non -existent sex appeal. The heroinne was supposed to be the sweet one, but that mess she said about not caring about Romsey's brothers and sisters totally turned me against her and she could not be redeemed later. Romsey's father was a pervert/pedophile and the sex/rape scenes described between him and the 16 yr. old Penelope was disturbing and disgusting. The only good part of the book was when she had his old 54 yr. old perverted butt jailed. Penelope's mother was one of the most evil characters I have read about and she deserved everything she got. Cheryl Holt's writing style is boring and solely relies on her uninteresting, untempting, disturbing, perverted version of erotica."},{"Title":"Secret Fantasy","review":"I love this author, and read everything she publishes, usually a good read. This one not so much. I would swear I've read this already, and had to check the published date to see if it was a reprint. The plot, characters and just about everything else are not an original for Ms. Holt, and I was disappointed to that regard. Still, an entertaining read for a couple of hours."},{"Title":"Secret Fantasy","review":"I'm not picky. I just want some romance, erotica, and a decent story. This book was offensive. Repeated \\"sex\\" scenes that were actually rape, including tying up a young girl (who is a 'villain' but come on) and sodomy. I'm liberal, I'm forgiving, but this book was unforgiveable and just gross and icky. Felt like I needed to take a shower (or 3) after reading it."},{"Title":"Secret Fantasy","review":"Despite the popularity of the author, I was not impressed. The romance scenes were some of the most unromantic I have ever read. Relationships appear and disappear without any true warning or any idea what the relationship was like. Most of the characters were rude and did nothing to deserve a happy ending except the main female character.Towards the end the timeline is impossible to follow. Suddenly months go by and the main female is livid at the main male. Then another year passes and the characters, who we had no idea what happened to them, were changed and behaved nothing like the characters who we became attached to. I love character development and believe that they should learn from what happens in the book but these characters were suddenly and dramaticly different with no hinting as to their thoughts or how they became this way. I was not impressed."},{"Title":"Secret Fantasy","review":"I struggle to find a good romance novel these days. Between the vampires and other paranormal creatures, there aren't many publishing houses printing contemporary or historical novels for the devoted romance reader. When I read the book jacket, I thought I'd discovered a nice steamy historical novel. Unfortunately, I discovered a novel with contrived characters who related to each other for the sake of sex. The heroine was weak, the hero unlikeable and the secondary characters ranged from twisted to evil. In a disfunctional world, I search for strong family relationships, which this novel lacked. A mother who used her daughter for personal gain, a son who hated his father, and a daughter who was self centered she lacked any morals at all. The book was too contrived to finish. I don't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Secret Fantasy","review":"Margaret Gray was orphaned at a young age and sent to live with her uncle Horatio. This was a pleasant until he died.

But, the heart won't be denied and they give into the passion they feel knowing it can't lead to anything serious. Then they are caught in a compromising situation and Margaret is sent away. Will they ever have a chance to be together and find a happy ending?This read was rather a let down...certainly not something I expect when picking up a title by this talented author. First off there is little character growth for any of the myriad of characters introduce which may be due to the fact that there are at least three different storylines running at the same time. The other element that was missing from this particular story was the sensuality. This read was almost tepid when compared to Ms. Holt's other titles. All in all this is an entertaining read but not to the level Ms. Holt normally writes. I still look forward to reading her next effort."},{"Title":"Secret Fantasy","review":"No developement of plot or characters. Some of the dialogue about how sex is performed is taken almost word for word from some of her other books. Instead of one villian, there are three, which is two too many for this story.

No fire, no sizzle, just blah."},{"Title":"Secret Fantasy","review":"I was skeptical about this book because of so many negative reviews, but I found it entertaining and it kept my interest.

She admits to herself she is enjoying every kiss and caress. While he offers her the opportunity to share debauchery, which to her chagrin, Margaret is considering, Jordan knows he must marry wealth. This means wedding the heiress cousin if he is to provide for the future of his half-siblings after his father destroyed everyone's prospects, but he is falling in love with the poor relative though someone else will go to lethal means to keep them apart on this world.SECRET FANTASY is a delightful regency erotic romantic suspense starring two likable lead characters who find their limited options means no relationship beyond a month of heaven before plunging into diverse hells.

There are lots of secondary plots that are twisted but always interesting."},{"Title":"Secret Fantasy","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I have read several of Cheryl Holts books and for the most part enjoyed them. Like most people who read romance novels I enjoy the love scenes, however, there were no love scenes in this book. There were plenty of sex scenes but most of them dealt with degradation of the female and several times they talke about rape and included a scene where an old man ties up a young girl (you don't like her but still..) and rapes her. Even the main characters have sex basically for sex's sake. Not until the end of the book do they even talk about love.

Certainly it is a major contribution to undersatnding the fundamental problems of any attempt at a settlemen in Israel/Palestine. Working in the same vein as Benny Morris, Tom Segev, Ilan Pape, and other &quot;new&quot; historians (the name is used in both praise and derision), Shafir crafted an impressive work that attempted to cut through Zionist and Palestinian myths and examine what truly happened from 1882-1914. However, after all his impressive research, readers feel like there may be more to the story than written.After a comparison and contrast of different styles of colonialism (he asserts that Zionism can best be understood as a form of colonialism), he reviews Zionist land policies. For Shafir, agriculture and the land is the root of Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While this is certainly a hugely important issue, he neglects the urban roots of conflict in favor of his agricultural theories. Ironically, this only furthers the myth of Israelis returning to the land, whereas most future Israelis lived in cities. Without examining the urban aspects of the conflict, he only tells part of the story. Also, his work is Ashkenazi-centric (European Jewish). True, the leaders of Zionism were mostly Central/Eastern European during this period, but he virtually marginalizes the story of other Zionists.Nevertheless, Shafir's contribution to the academic literature as it offers a glimpse into the agricultural roots that contributed to the modern conflict."},{"Title":"Land, Labor and the Origins of the Isrli-Palestinian Conflict, 1882-1914","review":"This is an example of a revisionist argument at its best. Gershon Shafir uses the same primary sources the major Middle-East historians have used for decades and offers up an economic, non-religious, and elegantly simple explanation of the conflict as it exists today."},{"Title":"Land, Labor and the Origins of the Isrli-Palestinian Conflict, 1882-1914","review":"This is an excellent examination of the economic forces that have shaped the conflict in Palestine/Israel."},{"Title":"Great Royal Palaces of Sweden: Vasa to Bernadotte","review":"This cocktail table style book presents a number of nice photographs of royal palaces and manors in Sweden.

Nevins also lists the contents of each of Queen's short story collections.Ellery, incidentally, sometimes ridicules the idea of really elaborate dying clues, but they occur nonetheless.\\"The Glass-Domed Clock\\" (1933) Dying clue. Martin Orr has been found murdered in his curio shop, clutching an amethyst and one of the clocks on display.\\"The Bearded Lady\\" (1934) Dying clue. Old Mrs. Shaw suspected her grown stepchildren of attempting to poison her, so despite her late husband's wishes she disinherited them, leaving most of the money to her husband's niece in England, with instructions that Edith would live in the Shaw house for at least 2 years, with regular checkups by Dr. Arlen, Mrs. Shaw's own physician (who got the rest of the money in trust). Alas, the stepchildren are the residuary legatees, and Dr. Arlen has been found murdered - leaving only an oddly defaced painting in his hobby studio as a clue.\\"The Mad Tea-Party\\" (1934) This story was adapted for the TV series starring Jim Hutton as Ellery, as \\"The Adventure of the Mad Tea Party\\"; it's one of the strongest episodes. (Few of the episodes corresponded directly to any Queen story, oddly enough.) Richard Owen is staging a reenactment of the Wonderland tea party for his son's birthday; Ellery consented to visit only because he wanted to meet one of the actresses involved. Owen mysteriously vanishes on the day of the birthday itself, so Ellery (despite his best efforts) has to get to work.\\"Man Bites Dog\\" (1939) A cyanide-laced hotdog at the Polo Grounds, in this case, during a subway series: Ellery's NY Giants vs the NY Yankees.\\"Mind Over Matter\\" (1939) Paula Paris (Ellery's girlfriend from California), is covering the heavyweight title fight between champion Mike Brown and challenger Jim Coyle, and offers to get Ellery and the Inspector tickets. (Ellery at first refuses: \\"I'm a jinx. If I went, something catastrophic would be sure to happen. So why should I want to go?\\" \\"He's afraid somebody will knock somebody off,\\" said the Inspector. \\"Well, doesn't somebody always?\\")\\"The Inner Circle\\" (1947) The 1913 class of Eastern University, the 1st graduating class, formed a special organization within the Alumni Club: the Januarians. But 5 of them formed a club within a club as a clandestine business partnership, of which 3 have now died, organized as a tontine. Who will be the last survivor?\\"The Dauphin's Doll\\" (1948) Cytherea Ypson, even at 78, made a hobby of collecting dolls. Upon her death, the collection is to be auctioned to establish a fund for orphans, but only 1 entry in the collection is really valuable: partly for historical associations, partly for the $110,000 diamond in its crown. But Miss Ypson's will provides that on the day before Christmas, the entire collection is to be displayed in Nash's department store...\\"The Three Widows\\" (1950) Locked-room. Penelope and Lyra, after their husbands died, moved back in with their dad, Theodore Hood. After his death, their stepmother feared that (under the terms of the will) they had a great deal of motive to murder her, so she took extraordinary precautions to thwart them. Nevertheless, somehow someone managed to poison her.\\"Snowball in July\\" (1952) Diamond Jim Grady, specializing in jewel robbery at gunpoint, has had Lizbet as his girl for 2 years, 10 months - eternity, in the circles where he moves. But she's put on weight, so when he picks up a new girl, Lizbet (nobody's fool) stages a vanishing act before Grady can clean up any loose ends.\\"'My Queer Dean!'\\" (1953) Matthew Hope, one of Ellery's Harvard professors, is much given to spoonerisms. Very awkward, when he's been hurt badly in an attempted robbery, and Ellery's trying to interpret his attempt to say what happened and who did it.\\"GI Story\\" (1954) Wrightsville + dying clue. One of Clint Fosdick's 3 stepsons (each named for a president: Wash the lawyer, Linc the MD, and draftee Woody) seems to be the murderer, but his last scrawled clue doesn't seem to fit the other evidence.\\"Miracles Do Happen\\" (1957) Henry and Claire Witter have 4 children and no money - but Jody has expensive medical treatments, and hasn't been able to walk for 3 years. So when Tully the moneylender begins calling in debts on the eve of upcoming prosecution, Witter is the prime suspect, as the last victim to see Tully alive.\\"Last Man to Die\\" (1963) Just as Ellery gets stuck with The Butler in his novel-in-progress, the granddaughter of one the last 2 survivors of the Butler's Club comes to him with a problem. The club treasury is tied up with a tontine...\\"Abraham Lincoln's Clue\\" (1965) DiCampo, having fallen on hard times, must now sell his prize: a book bearing the signatures of Poe and Lincoln, with an accompanying document in Lincoln's own hand. The 2 competing bidders (one a Poe collector, the other a Lincoln enthusiast) have agreed to buy it jointly and let him select who takes custody. But the items are hidden somewhere suggested by the manuscript itself, and everyone's stuck figuring out the Lincoln clue.\\"Wedding Anniversary\\" (1967) Wrightsville + dying clue. Ellery, through the police chief, attends the 1st anniversary bash of Ernst Brauenfel and his 2nd wife Zelda. Mr. B has been tactless, not only marrying his pretty bookkeeper within weeks of his 1st wife's death, but on his 1st wife's birthday. Somebody, however, has been much more crass, poisoning the liqueur he drinks only on very special occasions."},{"Title":"The Best of Ellery Queen: Four Decades of Stories from the Mystery Masters","review":"Ellery Queen stories are fun to read on a rainy day. They are also all utterly preposterous. No, he doesn't \\"cheat\\" like Agatha Christie by hiding clues from the reader until some moment late in the story --- every clue in an Ellery Queen story is right there for the reader to see. However, the solutions to Ellery Queen stories almost universally rely on having characters possess external knowledge that no real humans in similar positions would actually possess, or on having characters behave in ways that real humans would not behave. It is simply hopeless to try to deduce the solution to an Ellery Queen; just read it and be entertained. By the way, do not skip the introduction to this book, it is one of the most interesting parts."},{"Title":"The Best of Ellery Queen: Four Decades of Stories from the Mystery Masters","review":"This brilliant and extensive work is my first foray into the beloved realm of Ellery Queen. Queen was a detective created by two cousins who lived in New York. They came up with the unique idea to have their detective share the same name as their pseudonym. (The full history of the cousins writing career is found in the excellent introduction of the book). Francis Nevins and Martin H. Greenberg have collected memorable short mystery stories that span the entire Ellery Queen detective career from the 1930's to the late 1960's. These stories trace the revolution of Queen from an aloof character who has very unhumanlike qualities, (a man who resembles a machine), into a compassionate and caring individual who helps people who are in trouble. All of the plots are ingenius and put you in mind of an Agatha Christie story. Some of the best stories in the collection are as follows:1. \\"The Glass-Domed Clock.\\" A dying antiquarian dealer leaves a clue to the identity of his killer, but the clue points to several people. Ellery must use his deductive powers to determine who the dead man is accusing. A classic Golden Age mystery plot with a twist.2. \\"The Mad Tea-Party.\\" Queen uses Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland to trap a clever killer. This piece is from the 1930's.3. \\"Man Bites Dog.\\" This hilarious mystery takes place at a World Series baseball game and involves the frustrated and distracted sleuth sniffing out a poisoner. This story has a classic twist at the end that will shock you.4. \\"The Dauphin's Doll.\\" This is an amusing Christmas story in which Queen matches wits with a cunning thief who intends to steal a valuable collectors doll which is on display at Macy's. Ellery almost meets his match in this one! This story also contains a shocking conclusion.5. \\"The Abraham Lincoln Clue.\\" Ellery uses the events of the last day of Lincoln's life in order to determine the authenticity of a letter which collectors are dying to get their hands upon.These stories are just a sampling of the many delights contained in this wonderful collection. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I needed to refreshen my knowledge of economics after taking a year or Macro and Micro economics courses.

I guarantee that you will find it enjoyable."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This book was hard to put down once you start reading. The syntax and diction bring the points through clearly. The examples that Wheelen gives to support his statements are easy to understand and Wheelen poses the questions that we want to see answered and informs us enough to come up with answers to those challenging questions. The book tackles why there are poor nations to basics for investing in stocks and so much more. I highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn about economics in an ways that are not confusing. Really enjoyable read and clever subtitles."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Wheelan's book is as entertaining and novel as his cover makes it look.I've studied economics for several years, after beginning with absolutely no knowledge or understanding, and whether you can barely even define it, have a casual interest, or have a PhD in economics, this will change your perspective of the world and of the dismal science. You could use this book as a high school or college economics textbook and drastically increase the supply of economists worldwide!Wheelan's book is different than other well-liked layman's economics books. Naked Economics uses cases to help explain economics principles. Freakonomics uses economic principles to explain help cases. To read a compelling book and laugh out loud while developing a better understanding of this subject and the world, read Naked Economics. With that foundation, read Freakonomics. Wheelan is just as masterful a connector. He follows in the vein of Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner (and Malcolm Gladwell) in choosing fascinating cases whose connections to social science shed illuminating light, from CEO compensation (a particularly relevant topic today!) to weight loss.Naked Economics is also often compared to Todd Buchholz's New Ideas from Dead Economists and they follow a similar formula, though Buchholz uses biographies instead of cases. This is great for economic history, but for a foundation, while both are funny and well written, Wheelan's is funnier, fresher, and even easier to understand. He is also more balanced, quoting and explaining economists from both sides of the political spectrum with more consideration than Buchholz.If you have a casual interest, this will cement it. If you could barely define it, you can now sound like the PhD. And if you are the PhD, you will remember why you love it.

This book is easy to understand and fun. GREAT!"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This has to be among the best \\"popular\\" economics books out there, if not THE best. The book has pretty much everything one could hope for:- Broad coverage of economics- Clear explanations of concepts- Abundance of practical examples to illustrate the concepts- A writing style bordering on perfection (economics made entertaining!)- Reasonably balanced treatment of controversial topicsOne of the central points illustrated by the book is that we're prone to making bad economic decisions when we oversimply matters and neglect secondary, cumulative, and long-term consequences. The examples in the book illustrate this point, though one could argue that many of the examples are themselves oversimplified to the extent that one might draw wrong conclusions. However, I think that criticism would be unfair, since it should be self-evident that the examples are illustrative, rather than attempts to be comprehensive analyses of the issues involved.Like most nonfiction books, I would have loved to have a bullet-point summary of key points at the end of each chapter, but the book still fully deserves 5 stars and my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I'd just like to confirm what a lot of other reviewers have said. This book is very entertaining and makes its points forcefully (but you can be left wondering if there are deep assumption errors or facets the author has glossed over). Time and time again he adresses issues that I keep hearing (If only the goverment would so and so...) and gives a pretty compelling point of view on the issue.I keep this book for times I am a little tired, because reading it is so effortless. Now if only the author would write a book on linguistics and one on ethics for example!"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I'm no economist, but the beginning of the book was pretty basic, even for me. But by the middle and through to the end, Wheelan had me hooked with his perfectly placed jewels of insight. I found myself quoting them to friends and family all time. I was informed in an interesting and sometimes provocative way. I'll never look at money I find on the sidewalk the same again.It's the perfect book to get you a small but firm foundation in economics."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This was a very entertaining book and a good overview of micro and macro economic concepts. I'm not sure you would pass an econ 101 final after reading it, but it does provide a broad understanding of the economic underpinnings that pervade our lives. Very well written and funny."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I am a network engineer who usually reads technical books on TCP/IP and other network protocols. However, I have a great interest in the US and world economy but I never really understood how it all works. This book was a breath of fresh air. It explained many aspects of economics in a way that I could understand. It made me want to learn more about it while laying the groundwork for that knowledge. Highly suggested to everyone!"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I bought the book as it was required for my MBA Managerial Economics class. While most economics text books are hard going and often need to be read over again to actually take in the information this book is actually a pleasure to read. Wheelan gives current, relevant, examples of the principles covered and even injects a little humor at times. This is ecomonics as reality not theories. Highly recommmend the book."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"If you are interested in learning about economics but find the topic somewhat confusing and boring, this book breaks down the major concepts in a way that makes it interesting and understandable. Wheelan is a witty and sarcastic author which added greatly to his stories and real life examples he used when supporting topics within economics. The chapter on developmental economics broke down common misconceptions that people may have about developing countries and why they have problems with their economies. Naked Economics is an informative and highly enjoyable read. Well written, funny, serious, and easy to understand."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I'm entranced, appalled, frightened, happy, and thrilled to read this book. Economics as a subject has always felt like a big fat bore to me until I opened the pages of Naked Economics. I feel enlightened, educated, and even entertained with this book.I'll also admit to laughing until tears streamed down my cheeks and then feeling like crying and weeping over some of the content.This is one author who has ripped the lid off a powerful subject for all of us. Why is this not available on my Kindle yet?!!! Come on, now!"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I have used this as a class text for university freshman economics. I like it as a no standard nonmathematical text however I do think that the material does need to be supplemented in lecture with a few more graphs and such."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I read Naked Economics and Freakonomics around the same time. Naked Economics is much better in explaining the real economics and much more coherent than Freakonomics. At the end of each chapter, you would learn something, of which Freakonomics failed to do. Freakonomics is nothing but a bunch of incoherent stories. It tries makes the comparison and contrast internesting, but that's about it, making the stories interesting. But you learn nothing. If I were to choose again, I'm picking Naked Economics."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This is an easily read and digested primer on Economics and its implications in the world (markets, prices, poverty, policy, etc.). Wheelan keeps it light and interesting for the most part; it's certainly not technical and it doesn't get caught up in the excruciating details of economics and policy. It's a Big Picture treatment. And Wheelan's dry wit provides for some good humor along the way.I took a year of Economics in college decades ago, and this was a very nice refresher. Kudos."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This book was not only interesting and entertaining, it was also very funny and educational. I've taken Intro to Macro and Intro to Micro Economics and I retained very little from both of those classes. It wasn't until I read \\"Naked Economics\\" that I finally grasped the concepts of economics and how they relate to the average person. I would definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"My 20 year old nephew, a junior college student not known for his scholarly pursuits, took this book before I had a chance to read it. He found it so fascinating that he began taking it with him into the bathroom. He says he's going to take an economics course next semester."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This item was purchase for my daughter for school and she said that it is helpful that her school economics book."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I can't fault the book for not teaching the subject material well. The fact is, the author makes it very easy to follow Neoclassical economics (minus the charts, graphs, and equations) as it is currently taught in most universities.The quibbles I have are twofold:1. Being released in 2002, some of the information is dated, and makes the author look incompetent when it comes to using academic economic theory to explain depressions and recessions. He is shown to be utterly wrong. Perhaps if he were somewhat versed in Austrian trade cycle theory, whether in an appendix or a separate chapter, he could have redeemed himself somewhat. Neoclassical economics has few credible explanations for business cycles.2. He seems to have an incessant need to keep stating (and restating, ad nauseum)the \\"need\\" for government (and a central bank) in a successful economy. He does it in such a way that I couldn't help but wonder if he happened to be suffering from some cognitive dissonance. He just wasn't very believable._________________________________________In the end, I could only muster three stars for this book. He really did an excellent job at delivering flawed material."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"It is a must read for everyone who loves to read books even if you are not interested in economics. Great book."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Mr. Wheelan presents a unique perspective on economics in this interesting and thought-provoking text. He presents the basic principles of economics while avoiding charts and graphs, relying instead on vivid illustrations and anecdotes. There were several moments, while reading this book, that an economic concept that I had struggled with became appreciably clearer to me.Of course, economics is a complex study and could not be fully explored in a single text, much less one of this size. Don't expect to be debating the complexities of Alan Greenspan's policies with an MIT graduate upon completing this book.That said, I really enjoyed the pace and tone of the book. Mr Wheelan uses humor and illustrations skillfully to explain difficult-to-grasp topics. There are several quotable statements that you will recall while watching the news and listening to people discussing their stock portfolios and the economy over lunch.In short, it is a very useful, readable book that will give you a little bit more of an understanding of the world around you.On a side note, there are many reviews that reference Mr. Wheelan's politics, including one erroneous one that labels him as very left leaning. I found that to be a complete misinterpretation of the text. Mr Wheelan has several views that would be considered moderate but would probably be pegged a little right of center. He does quote Paul Krugman quite often, but also warns strongly against meddling governments. He often debunks both the typical liberal and conservative views on an issue, showing that most politicians simply embrace a policy that sounds good in a speech but has little or no benefit in reality."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Enjoyed the book. An enjoyable read that was required for my econ 110 class. No graphs = a pleasure."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I thought this book broke complicated goverment policies down into the terms of the average Joe, and it was greatly appreciated."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This is the first book I read on macro economics. Trust me, it made me think I should have taken economics as my career. Its a terrific, insightful intro to macro economics. Author takes you through fundamentals of market economy, the role of goverment in it, how some countries mess it up, how simple the fundamentals are for buidling a rich and prosperous country etc. In the process he quotes lots of studies/papers done by great economists, Nobel prize winners. Usually just the title of those works makes you yawn.. but with the way author explains the practical aspects of each of those works.. its just wow, I didn't realize so far how sexy economics can be.."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I took several economics classes in college (in fact, my major - not used later though), and they were uniformly boring and irrelevant. My profs and the texts taught the math and the basics, but not how to use economic reasoning to look at economic, fiscal, public policy, etc. problems. This was published before the current recession, but the analysis helps to understand what's going on.This book will not help a student pass a class - no propensity to consume graphs, for example. However it is great for the layman or younger econ student to get a good overview of economic reasoning they will not get in classes. Easy to read and funny in parts."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I've been teaching economics for over 10 years, and came across this little gem last night. I spent the next few hours reading it completely. The author has a remarkable ability to explain economic concepts well without dumbing down the material. He also attempts to be balanced, bringing out the pros and cons of markets, as well as the public sector and the role of the government. That said, he comes out mostly in favor of markets and argues that the role of the government is important but minimal. This point of view has been very fashionable in economics, but the recent collapse of Wall St. and the banking system will make us rethink the weaknesses of markets, and the heightened role that the public sector needs to play. Despite this bias, I would strongly recommend this book to anyone (I plan to read it to my middle/high school kids this weekend) who is remotely interested in how economists think. In fact, I am positively surprised that books like Freakonomics achieved far more success, even though this book is far more accessible for the general audience, and has much more interesting insights for the lay reader."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I use this book as a primary text in a high school Economics class. I love it and so do the kids!"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Most of this should be fairly obvious to anyone with any exposure to economics, but it makes for an entertaining review nonetheless. The two chapters on government were particularly good. I wish all my friends would read these chapters so they would finally understand that policy issues are not factual issues, but rather value issues. It's frustrating debating with people who don't know the difference. I'm tempted to say politicians should read them too, but I suspect most politicians purposely cater to the prejudices of their supporters, and stoke the fires for their own advantage. Frighteningly, some probably don't know this stuff.The chapter on Human Capital I found a little naive.He makes the argument that Bill Gates, if stripped of all his wealth and degrees and left stranded on a street corner, would still rise in the food chain. This sort of mythologizing of the wealthy and successful fits in well the human minds predilection for a \\"Just World\\", but it hugely downplays the role of contingency, chance, social networks, reputation, etc... I suspect Bill Gates is actually pretty rusty as a programmer, and as a tech or business consultant he may find it hard to compete with younger, more attractive workers who didn't drop out of Harvard! Reputation and connections are everything. We are just so inclined to want the universe to be \\"Just\\" we retroactively construct narratives to fit the model, and of course we have Heaven and Hell for those cases that are too hard to fit.His musings on what the world would be like if everyone had a phD was a bit naive too. He surmises the undesirable jobs would actually pay more! Rather, I tend to think we would find a way to discriminate, to judge and repress, whether it be ageism, looksism, or whatever. Perhaps transgressions like getting a DUI would become so elevated in importance that they would condemn the offender to a life of menial work. The problem is he forgets everything is on a relative scale, both wealth AND human capital. He realizes this when it comes to wealth, then forgets it when it comes to human capital."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I am someone who took a basic Econ class in school. Found the math involved cumbersome and the way the subject handled quite boring. So you can guess I never took another Econ class.Saw the amazing reviews on Amazon and purchased this one and boy ! am I glad I made this purchase. This one's a keeper.Mr. Wheelan, thanks for writing the book so simplistically , yet without missing any imp points. I think this book is a must read for everyone just to gain a basic understanding of how the different things in our daily lives are governed by Economic principles.Interest rates / Stocks / Bonds/ Trade / Currency / Inflation..... I can go on and on.Thing is, if you feel confused about Economics and need an overview without the charts and math. This is the book to read.The writing is clear , funny :) and makes it's point using some really great examples.Worth every penny !!!!"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Very clearly written, this book gives a whole review about the economics science that can sometimes be blurred behind every day news and hectic rythm.The style is very frankly, it is a pleasure that such a bunch of complex issues can be explained in very simple terms."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I loved this book.

He explains it all very well, and he's right that it's very interesting stuff."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I've read quite a few books (including the drab high school ones) on economics but never really completely understood macroeconomics and how it ties to my every day life, until now. The author does not assume extensive background knowledge and essentially strips economics off of the myriad of jargon that \\"experts\\" use to obscure intuitive facts. The book is full of current, historical and sometimes even insanely funny hypothetical examples that illustrate every single concept discussed. One of the best buys of the year for me. I would highly recommend this book to every man, woman, child and dog (if it is one of those special ones that can read)."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This is a terrific introduction to basic economic principles. It could have been titled Economics for Dummies. Whelan covers most of the principles that are in introductory economics classes,but Naked Economics never feels like a textbook. What I especially liked about Naked Economics is Whelan's fairness, He never shows the ideological bias of say, Paul Krugman or Arthur Laffer. He just explains the principles of economics in an entertaining way. Naked Economics is a must read for economic novices."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This is a great book. It is written in plain language so a layman like me can understand without pondering upon any perplexing and confusing jargons. The way the market works is explained in a very direct and clear way. It stresses, among aother things, the importance of lateral thinking, and consideration of ramifications in policies, in economics. Lots of humor. 5 stars."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This book is written in such a way that it is interesting and educational. It talks about several topics found in an economic textbook, however it is told in such a way that the topics are entertaining and understandable. There are examples for every topic and point made. Well-written."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Today is a great day to review this book. Although I read it last year, France just announced that it is bailing on the 35 hour work-week. I suppose that are going back to the 39 hour week. See Wheelan's introduction where he predicted this would happen, then go to page 104 to read about why.Another reviewer stated that you will not get quotes or figures out of this book to impress your friends. I wholeheartedly disagree. First, the anecdote about job creation on page 104 is enough reason to buy the book. Second, the reference to Paul Krugman's 2001 NY Times article is definitely worth repeating: In 1993 child workers in Bangladesh were found producing clothes for Wal-Mart. Senator Tom Harkin (D, Iowa) proposed legislation that would ban imports which employed child labor. The factories stopped employing children but the kids did not go back to school - they ended up in worse jobs, on the streets, with a significant number turning to prostitution; according to Oxfam. Admittedly, Harkin had the best intentions but this is what you get from this book, things to think about."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This is a very good introduction to economics. The only criticism I have is that in teaching the reader to &quot;think like an economist,&quot; Wheelan literally thinks *exclusively* like an economist.For instance, Wheelan asserts spraying DDT, thus eliminating pests, can be good in some instances because the costs (pollution) outweigh the benefits (better economic benefits in the long run leading to reduced pollution levels eventually). Organisms, however, are notorious for building resistance, as evident with the fruit fly population explosions and the failures of modern antiboitics to keep up with the new bacterias. Taking an economic approach, an ignoring an evolutionary one, can be dangerous indeed.Despite, this book is very good and well written and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I read this and my mind run back to my University of Chicago study time, and I appreciate more of the people who can teach coplexities into something interesting. Now i have a great book to recommend layman who are willing to dwelve deeper into the logics of economics.I believe this book should be made a mandatory reading for college and MBA students. It shows economics in the simple way and stripped out all the numbers and hard stuffs without losing the essense.We all can learn about Markets, Incentives, Utility, Goverment, human Capital, Financial Market, Federal Reserve (What does Alan Greenspan actually do?), Trade and Globalisation. We can booste to our friends that we know all that, and we can do it all without sweat, blood and pains. It even feels sweet and enjoyable.If you want to know about economics, this book is the perfect introduction, and will give you much more understanding than spending the entire year sitting in the room with a boring econ proffessor. And the knowlege you gain will stay with you for a long time giving a deeper understanding how the world of economics make the world a better place to be, even that it will never be a perfect world.tanadi santoso, www.tanadisantoso.com, surabaya, indonesia"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"The first two-thirds of the book is very good, and I learned a lot, but Wheelan's politics skew the last third too much. He makes a convincing case that globalization is a good thing, but in general, if you're not 100% for the way that globalization is going right now, he sees you as 100% against it, which makes you a rock-throwing thug who is only interested in breaking windows. (He actually uses the word \\"thug,\\" and keeps getting back to the rock throwing and window breaking as symbols of people who disagree with WTO and IMF policies.)I was very surprised when he quoted Jeffrey Sachs as writing \\"The current pattern of rich countries--to provide financial aid to tropical Africa while blocking Africa's chances to export textiles, footwear, leather goods, and other labor-intensive products--may be worse than cynical. It may in fact fundamentally undermine Africa's chances for economic development.\\" Because the rest of this book provides no room for people whose opinion about globalization is neither 100% for nor 100% against it, I would think that Sachs' attitude would, in Wheelan's eyes, group him with the rock-throwing, window-breaking antiglobalization thugs. This acknowledgement that at least one responsible person might have a more nuanced opinion about the potential harm of rich countries dictating economic policy to poor countries was much too rare in \\"Naked Economics.\\""},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"If you are like me, who has never studied Economics or never liked this subject, then this is the book you would like to READ.Its an eye opener, it has changed my thought process and I am sure it can help people who have never studied this subject.I liked Charles style and he has quoted good examples and makes me feel that its an easy world and what is the role of economy and ecomist.On a side note: Interesnting fact- In my discussions I have started quoting examples from this book :-)."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This book explains how the world works, and in some cases how it doesn't work. Tons of topics are covered from free markets to the role of governments to international trade to the price of your health insurance to the stock market to the federal reserve and more.It is written in a very entertaining and highly accessible way so that non-economic majors (like me) can easily grasp all the concepts. Many interesting real-world stories and examples are given that help you understand economic principles.After reading this book, be prepared to re-evaluate any negative views you may have about outsourcing, sweatshops, wal-mart, expensive prescription drugs, insurance companies, high gas prices, and much more.Understanding economics makes you appreciate more the standard of living we enjoy today and makes you complain less about life. You may not understand what I mean until after you read this book or similar books.If you enjoy this book, you will probably like \\"Undercover Economist\\" which also does a good job covering many of the same topics but is a little more dense. If you were disappointed by \\"Freakonomics\\" because it didn't really delve into economic theory, then read \\"Naked\\"."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This book is really the most enjoyable economics book I ever read! It takes you beyond the graphs and teaches you the practical way of understanding what economics is all about. It is very lively and full of examples which are real and which are all around us everyday. Even a person who hasn't got a clue about eceonomics can go deep into the subject without even realizing.

I wanted to understand economics further since I'm pursuing my Master's degree in Urban and Regional Planning, emphasizing on economic development and downtown revitalization. Needless to say, I enjoyed the frankness of the author in explaining economics and the topics worked together with what little I remember from taking Macroeconomics back in college. It is also easy to digest in small bits so you don't have to feel obligated to read every day in order to understand how everything links together."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"The best part about reading books by journalists is the readability. In a book on economics, which I neglected to study in college, this is the most important factor. Wheelan breezes through developmental economics, monetary policy and the various aspects of the stock market in about 8 hours of reading. My understanding of economics has been greatly enhanced by this quick read, great in clips of about 60 pages at a time. I've wanted to read a book like this for about 3 years and have truly benefitted from the experience. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This book was a good introduction to economics and what this social science does, and tries to do. In fact, due to this book, I was able to learn exactly how the Federal Reserve Board actually fixes the nation's interest rate (I had always just figured that they just get together and decide, \\"O.K., this month it's 5%\\" and that was that; however, it is more involved that this and this book explain it clearly).This book aims to be a good, generally overview to economics to 1) people who haven't learned anything about it before (for example, high school students), and/or 2) people who have studied it before but couldn't/don't remember what they were taught (I think I barely passed Intro. to Macroeconomics as an undergrad). I did learn by reading this book, but....There are several typographical errors in this book. It seems like maybe it was rushed to the printer's without adequate proofreading (someone could have at least proofread this ONE time!).Also, there are often times where the author is focusing on one point throughout a paragraph, but then suddenly introduces a barely related point as the final sentence of the paragraph. A few times, I was left re-reading the paragraph and the offending sentence and trying to piece together if there was actually a relationship, or if there was some type of typographical error, or why in fact that weird sentence was actually there.I rated this 3 stars, and that is better the 2 stars or 1 star, but this book needs to be revised (hopefully an economist).Compared to this book, I would recommend \\"Freakonomics.\\""},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"The book is very readable, mostly an enjoyable peruse of what could easily be a boring subject. But be forewarned, like many college professors this author is a Kool Aid drinker when it comes to anthropological global warming. You'll be cruising along, immersed in the subject, when he interjects man made global warming. One typical example, is at the bottom of page 43, where he states that the real costs associated with driving an SUV include the melting of polar ice caps. (What ever happened to the concept of separation of church - of global warming - and state??)It is so typical of what is taught in our institutions of lower learning. MMGW a man made fabrication, basically a scam, that this author spews out like it's a proven scientific fact. If you're a Kool Aid drinker, no problem. If you're a thinking person, you'll be annoyed."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I gave this book a bad review in 2006 when I first read it. I just read it again and I kind of feel bad that I did that. Mr. Wheelan did put a lot of work into this book, and I sure as h*ll couldn't write something this good. This book is a good introduction to economics spoken in plain language. It gives numerous real-world examples, things that happened just a few years ago, so it is very current. I guess I expected a more formal treatment of the subject, but I should have just looked at the cover and the title and realized that the approach would be casual and humorous."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This book should be used for nothing more than a popular-definition economics dictionary/paper weight. It's deceitfully clever, and fundamental wrong, wrong, wrong, in so many ways I don't even know where to start. Free trade, the best of ALL possible worlds; the glorious benefits of NAFTA; the WTO our benevolent, selfless, economic overseer. I urge you to read, or at least read the Amazon reviews of \\"Free trade doesn't work what should replace it and why\\". Amazon only has one copy left so you'd better hurry, the truth is in limited supply."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This book is strongly influenced by liberal left ideas. For those who have an interest in learning more about economics, you're better off reading books by Mark Skousen for clear thinking, common sense, and straightforward explanations that are easy to understand. Also, Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt is excellent. This book is a good one for environmentalists and the politically liberal who believe that markets are best served when managed by the government. The author holds an MPA, the professional government bureaucrats degree.This book should be a big hit in Europe or for out-of-touch central planners, but it's not for the reader who is interested in acquiring knowledge and understanding."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This guy thinks it is a good idea for our government to tax everything that has to do with carbon dioxide.

People compare this to Freakonomics but Wheelan, who used to write for the Economist, is less engaging than his competition. Secondly, this is not a book to be using for a 2nd or 3rd year economics course, especially not at a university renowned for its economics and public policy departments. I ended up giving mine to a high school aged cousin, who found it to be a good overview but commented that he wasn't really sure why he should be accepting the prescriptions offered and left wondering if there were alternatives (which he framed in terms of opportunity cost so I guess it did the job there)."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This book is enlightening.

What I mean by that is that in this book Wheelan is genius in how he can concisely describe complex matters in simple terms without over-simplifying to the point of simplicity. It was obvious to me, as a reader, that he clearly understands economics in all its complexity; that is, he could probably make a sequel to this book called: Economics Dressed Head to Foot: Ornamenting the Dismal Science With Toe-Rings. The fact that Wheelan understands economics throughly and has an obviously polished journalistic, pleasant-to-read writing style lead me to give this book 5 stars, and recommend it to my wife and mother, who typically would have little time and interest in the topic. Thanks Wheelan."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I've never opened an economics book with so much enthusiasm...after an hour of reading, I wondered to myself what was the use of my high school and first & second year university level economics courses! Why do they have to make concepts so simple and common sensical extremely complicated and overly theoretical? I certainly hope not that the only underlying reason is to weed students out of their educational system. It is so true that too many academians out there don't have much talent in writing to interest rather than bore and confuse. Don't get me wrong, these authors are all very educated and well-informed, much more than I ever will be. University professors and high school teachers are just as bad communicators who don't deliver the message effectively. I am now keenly searching for Naked Finance, Naked Accounting, Naked Statistics, etc.... to reinforce my concepts of these topics in business that are scattered all over the place. As they say, common sense is what is lacking most in this world...and this author brings it out well to us the readers. Applause to such great works!

And, I did, without question. And loved it. Wheelan's approach to economics is practical and more applicable than anything ever written in any textbook. Not to mention amusing. This is a book that I could've read for recreation.

Though, as Wheelan states a number of times through the book, economics may not have all of the answers, it can certainly help us understand what the right questions to be asking in a particular situation are.The book explains important economic concepts such as externalities (when a person or group does not pay fully for the economic, social, etc. costs of their actions) and resource valuation, but more importantly applies them to real-world situations (why is Bill Gates' house bigger then mine?; why do pour countries seem to get pourer?)The book is written as a dialog between author and writer and avoids confusing matters by presenting equations and charts. Instead, concepts are explained and applied making the book accessible to those with virtually no knowledge of economics.If you are interested in knowing more about economics and how it effects the world around you or if you need a bigger-picture overview to help with understanding specific areas of economic study, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Like \\"The Undercover Economist\\" by Tim Harford, I enjoyed Mr. Wheelan's book and found it both entertaining and educational in a way that an Econ 101 textbook filled with confusing graphs, curves, and shifts is not.Both books coincidentally use a number of the same examples to explain economic concepts:1) Starbucks coffee2) Mohair subsidy3) Leprosy cureAfter reading several books by economists, some things are certain. Many economists1) Reiterate what other economists have already said.2) Use the phrases \\"seminal work\\" or \\"seminal study\\".3) Refer to famous (within the circle of economists) economists, particular those who win a Nobel Prize for Economics.4) Advertise other authors' books.What is not certain is whether economists do anything that improves the economy, other than write books that talk about other economists that write books."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"After reading economic books by Milton Friedman and Thomas Sowell, I find Naked Economics to be a more balanced explaination of economics.

Though it will be harsh for some groups who loses their jobs. Whether it's through replacing human hands with robotics or outsourcing for cheaper labor, it ultimately advances our productivity.This book answers a lot of questions very relevant to today's current events. All the outcry about US outsourcing jobs. The author puts forward a great question, &quot;Whould it be better for the US if trade weren't allow across the Mississippi River?&quot; I think you could even go further on that question, &quot;Would it be better if each state weren't allow to trade across it's border?&quot; Many would realize the answer is no, but yet, there is such an outcry on outsourcing?

The experts may love all of those tools and jargon, but they do get in the way for most everyone else. Wheelan is one of those rare people who speaks technical econ-speak and regular English and can translate for the majority.This is a strong enough book that I would seriously recommend it for anyone taking a basic econ class as a primer. I would also recommend it as a supplemental textbook to go along with a basic econ textbook for advanced high school students or Econ 101 type classes in college. I would even recommend it instead of most basic econ textbooks since they are usually about as interesting as reading the owners manual for a microwave oven. \\"Naked Economics\\" is a book that will be read and enjoyed, rather than skimmed, dreaded and cursed.Read this along with Thomas Friedman's \\"The World is Flat\\" and you have doubled your education about economics and the modern world and you have a fundamental grasp of the modern economy. Notice I said fundamental, not complete - these book are tremendous places to start your learning."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"As an Undergrad working towards an Economics degree, I decided to pick up Charles Wheelan's \\"naked economics\\" as some light reading, and to take another look at the basics of the study, which is sometimes lost in the memorization of equations and mathematics that are inherent in introductory Economics. Wheelan's book is an excellent reminder of why I love Economics, and a great introduction for anyone who wants to know a little bit more about the economy. It also offers excellent insight into the arena of politics vs. economics. I firmly believe that this book should be required reading for anyone taking first year Economics, and anyone else that is at all interested in economics. Anyone who claims to have an interest in politics should also read this book, as the ties between the two are so deep that you truly cannot understand political decisions without understanding the economics behind them (and vice versa). Anyone looking for further reading, \\"Applied Economics\\" by Thomas Sowell is another excellent book that looks at some very interesting policy issues, and I also highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I am a college student who recently undertook the major of economics. Going into it I had my doubts. I heard whispers of the subject being dry and relatively uninteresting. Not one to drive blind, I decided to read up on the subject and stumbled on this book.The book is keenly written and tackles interesting life subjects that are frowned upon by the average college economics book. This is the best of both worlds because one actually will want to read this book AND learn all the terms and nuances of economics that would be found in a text book.By an means, if you are interested in econ, or are looking for a reason to be interested in it, read this book.

The advantages of market economies as opposed to government-controlled economies are discussed. Good and bad governments, central banks, monetary policy, and fiscal policy are explained.

It always looked like some kind of trickery. Mr. Wheelan makes the subject make sense and explains how, in fact, such a bizarre idea is actually possible. His analysis of the key factors that make economies work and grow and those that stifle growth should be essential reading for any politician. Definitely 4 stars.Mr. Wheelan also puts the human face on economics in explaining the drivers for people in a money lubricated world.I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and I now feeI have a real understanding of some of what I hear on the news on a daily basis.If there is any criticism, it is that the book is a little US centred, but this does not detract from its value."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I've been studying economics for the past six months or so from various texts, plodding through all of them by dint of perseverance and a sense of duty.For some light reading, I picked this book up. From it, my studies of economics gained renewed vigor, because this was the first book that really made me LOVE ECONOMICS. After reading it I saw most economic ideas -- especially macroeconomic ideas -- in a new light.Folks, it's fantastic. Absorbing, witty, and clearly-written.Not only will you come to basically understand many important economic principles from reading it, but the book contains not a single graph, chart, or unsavory equation.This is the only economics books I've ever read and read, until I was done: on the john, in the tub, on the bus, etc. I just could not put it down!The thing I really like is Wheelan's genius for picking examples, many of which will boggle your mind and stick with you for days.Wheelan has also got a great sense of humor. When's the last time that you found yourself laughing out loud every few pages while reading an economics book?Here's an example:\\"The sultan of Brunei earned billions of dollars in oil revenues in the 1970s. Suppose he had stuffed that cash under his mattress and left it there. He would have had several problems. First, it is very difficult to sleep with billions of dollars stuffed under the mattress. . .\\""},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Naked Economics is a good introduction to economics for the layman. There is no math, although personally I wish Wheelan had used some to back up some of his points or to show some issues in more depth. It is well written and easy to read. So even though the information is as useful as many textbooks, it isn't tough to understand it.Subjects covered include: why capitalism and free markets is better than communism and state-controlled markets; how information is crucial (such as product or corporate branding and health insurance for individuals); efficiency of financial markets (why the individual is often foolish when he buys a stock after reading a tip from the newspaper); and why international trade is good even if special interest groups may oppose it due to job losses.Readers on both the extreme left or right will be able to pick up certain issues in the book that they disagree with. They will then pick those up and attack Wheelan for being an extreme liberal or an extreme conservative. They will accuse him of not caring about U.S. jobs; they will accuse him of pandering to the environmentalists. For those readers, their mind is already made up before the read this book. For open-minded readers, this book will be very enjoyable and interesting."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone unfamiliar with basic economics, or looking for a simple, easy-to-read introduction to the science. Wheelan does a great job explaining the nuts and bolts of a free market system, and why this economic system as it stands is currently the most successful in the world. He's devoted chapters to the power of markets, incentives, the government, information, productivity, human capital, finance, the federal reserve, organized interests, trade and globalization, and ends with a discussion as to what it would take for poorer, less developed countries to get out of poverty. After reading Thomas Sowell's, &quot;Basic Economics&quot; I found Charles Wheelan's writing to be refreshingly balanced, and more humorous. That said, I still think both writers and books are worth-while. Anyone unconvinced that a free market system is the best economic system available, or wishing to know more about the system in which we live ought to read these books. Especially if you're against free trade, and fear &quot;globablization&quot;. Wheelan admits there are serious social consequences and problems related to bad government, but insinuates (with a little more finesse than Sowell) that the problems are mostly rooted in bad policies, not economics. Corruption and dishonest politicians and leaders impoverish countries, not capitalism itself. However you choose to look at these issues, I think Wheelan does an excellent job at providing the fundamentals of the world in which we operate on a daily basis, and reading &quot;Naked Economics&quot; can only help one understand how to better affect desired change. Every college student should be required to read this!"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Naked economics is an extraordinary account of what economics really is and how they should teach it. Unfourtunately current professors think that throwing a lot of math at you (without any intuition whatsoever) makes them look intelligent.

Highly recommended.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I never attended a single class in economics, so Charles Wheelan's book, Naked Economics, was directed to people like me. The book is well-written and attention grabbing, although I sometimes felt I was being misled by the \\"enthusiastic school boy\\" style.I couldn't agree more with the author's basic premise- that thinking in terms of incentives and disincentives is the best way to formulate policy, and that one of the most important roles of government (besides providing a minimum safety net) is to regulate these incentives to make sure that they work as intended. Although not an economist I had already thought about most of the specific ideas presented in the book, perhaps because during my 30 years in Brazil I have experienced in the flesh the effects of hyperinflation, price controls, overloaded currency and impossible bureaucratic regulations, while at the same time appreciating its public health system. I also understand the author's concern that people do not appreciate these questions enough.That said, there were a few points I found weak in this book. Perhaps most importantly, I had hoped for a better discussion of utility. Economists readily admit that maximizing utility does not mean just maximizing personal or public wealth. Yet the book leaves totally open just what other kinds of utility there might be, and how incentives might take advantage of our search for these kinds of utility. For example, people are willing to invest enormous amounts of effort to increase their prestige or honor, and not all forms of prestige can be purchased (for example, a Noble Prize). Indeed, it may very well be that for humans \\"All is Vanity.\\" But what are we vain about? - our ability to control others? The amount of material goods we consume? How much we produce? How much we help others? The book made not even a nodding gesture to these questions in the form of a citation to Maslow's \\"hierarchy of needs\\" or other literature. Worldwide, Americans are seen (unjustly from the data I've seen) as being mostly motivated by material rewards. Yet there are cultural differences here - Scandanavians, for example, generally rate higher on seeking \\"personal fullfilment.\\" Where do these different values come from? How can people be enticed into seeking those types of utility we deem most worthy? What values should be encouraged and how? How can we construct incentive systems based on these values? The author often simply dismisses these questions with the \\"relativistic\\" claim that different people are all entitled to their own views and we shoujld respect this. For example, he suggests that one man may find greater utility in beating his boss over the head, than foregoing this pleasure to avoid going to jail.Often the author cites physical well-being (measured by life-expectancy) as the clincher criterion for whether economic policies work or not. I have no qualms with that, but would also include mental well-being (measured by life-satisfaction or happiness scores), and try to get some measurement of how sustainabile different policies to increase physical and mental well-being might be. These questions have been analyzed. Do we know whether the \\"social indicators\\" used by the U.N. or other researchers actually predict physical and mental well-being? I had hoped for a review of the literature here.One question in this line is the emphasis on the well-being of consumers at the expense of producers, and the lack of concern for \\"externalities\\" (secondary costs)here. For example, \\"total quality control\\" policies require questioning job hierarchies at frequent intervals. People (and animals) accomodate fairly well to established hierarchies, but unstable hierarchies generally create a great deal of stress. How are these social costs being measured?One argument in the book actually made me rethink an old suggestion of mine, but I still don't have a solution, and, unfortunately, neither does the author. This is the question of how to maximize well-being when a given policy will negatively affect a small group of people, but benefit a large group - for example, farmers who might lose land for the construction of a dam, or young men threatened with being drafted into the army. I suggested that people ought to be given a yearly quota of \\"votes\\" and be allowed to invest those votes wherever they want. People most affected by a possible policy would invest a greater proportion of their votes in that question. The author shows (rightly, I think) that such a procedure would create a tremendous \\"tragedy of the commons\\" as everyone cared for their own interests to the detriment of the general good. In describing his own actions (fighting to prevent the installation of a new subway line in his neighborhood) the author simply stimulated a \\"shout-ocracy\\" in which those who make the most noise always win, and meeker people always lose out - not a good idea in my view.There were also a few other points where I felt something was missing in the analyses. The author suggests agriculture is less productive in the tropics than in moderate climes, but does not clarify if this is productivity per hectare, per dollar invested, or per man-hour of labor, and he seems to contradict this suggestion when he mentions that the productivity of orange growing is far higher in Brazil than in the U.S.I had also hoped for a better discussion of international exchange rates. The author simply suggests that over the long run purchasing power parity should be the same in different countries. This is obviously not the case. Why the difference? Surely assessments of political risk affect international investment decisions, which must have an effect on interest rates and exchange rates. What else is involved?Finally, one argument was badly stated. The author suggests that countries should engage in the activity they do best. Surely this cannot be true. I'm sure the author would agree that a young man in the 99th percentile for music ability, but 60th percentile for computer skills would not be better off choosing a career in music. How does this work out internationally?Dennis Werner"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Just as we can look back, today, at economic failures and fallacies of the past, so too will those of the future look back at the economic policies (and much else for that matter) of today and see great flaws. While I understand that this is an introductory book, and thus should not go into too much detail critiquing modern-day economic policy, I wish I at least could have gathered the sense that the author realized there are many flaws with today's mainstream economic policies. Unfortunately, I think he finds little flaw in many of the popular policies and ideas of our day that (I believe) will surely be looked at more critically in the future.As an example, I found it especially annoying that the author kept bringing up Bill Gates, once even making the argument that we're all better off because of this man. The great irony in this is that, not only does Microsoft make money by selling something non-scarce, they've been known to use dirty, anti-competitive tactics time and time again. It's not hard to imagine how this combination can make someone rich -- at the expense of others! The author obviously has no idea that there are alternatives to this model of \\"proprietary software\\", and I'm sure many would argue, alongside me, that we'd all be better off if Microsoft never did come to power, and the open, non-proprietary model (of creating software) produced the first mainstream desktop operating system.And whether that comment about George W. Bush being a mature world leader was made in seriousness or not... Well, the author being an economist, I would think he'd at least make mention of the outrageous deficit spending of the U.S. government.For a more honest introduction to economics, and a critical look at many of our modern-day economic fallacies, try readingEconomics in One Lesson. Economics in One Lesson doesn't have as much of the humor of Naked Economics (which isn't really funny, but makes for lighter reading), but at least it uses good logic and examples for its arguments. (Naked Economics leaves out sound arguments in many cases.)And for some insight into the great flaws with the monetary policy of most governments in the world today, try somethinglike this."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"As an undergraduate, I used to find topics for potential areas for research papers from the Economist's Economics Focus section. For those uninitiated, the once-a-week, one page explinations the repetitive column provides are excellent, cursory introductions to complex economic topics, usually spawned from new research in the dismal science.That said, Wheelan has taken that concept and spread it out over a fast-reading, entertaining 236 page book. Basic economic concepts and more complex and modern research are explained with vigor and enthusiasm. The book features no charts, functions, formulas or graphs. Nonetheless, it would prove a much better textbook for a High School or undergraduate Intro to Economics course. Better yet, it serves as an excellent review for those already initiated to the field.Highly reccomended!"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I thought this was a very good introduction to economics for the layman. Wheelan purports to explain the subject without all the mind-numbing charts and economics jargon and he succeeds in doing just that. My initial reaction to the book was that Wheelan was merely an apologist for unfettered capitalism but it turned out to be a relatively objective work. He gives both sides of the story so to speak, and concludes that government is important to a healthy economy, as long as it is used judiciously. For instance, on page 51 he flatly states; \\"Anyone who tells you that markets left to their own devices will always lead to socially beneficial outcomes is talking utter nonsense.\\" He points out how most developing countries would love to have the bureaucracy that we have, and this lack of effective government is what keeps many nations from prospering. Of course, this goes both ways as he also describes the damage done by excessive government regulation, as witnessed by states like North Korea. He argues against the allures of protectionism and emphasizes the importance of international trade, for rich and poor countries alike. Besides the relationship between government and economies, the author tackles all the major aspects of economics such as how the financial markets work, the difference between monetary and fiscal policy, the Federal Reserve, inflation, human capital, currency, externalities and so on. His analysis of \\"creative destruction\\" can be summed up by the following; \\"It would have been one thing to help displaced Pony Express workers by retraining them as telegraph operators; it would have been quite another to help them by banning the telegraph.\\" He's actually quite humorous at times also; \\"Any thoughtful policy analyst knows that some individuals who wear spandex in public should be taxed, if not jailed.\\"Wheelan makes no secret that capitalism is an amoral system that often leaves short-term damage in its wake. He insists though, that in the long-term it is the best system around, hands down. He makes some interesting points about international trade and globalization, pointing out that those who oppose it, often do more harm to the very people they intend to protect. For instance, he claims that Third World sweatshops, while deplorable by Western standards, are often the best option that some people have, and that they are a necessary step in the process toward industrialization. He claims that any attempt to boycott or otherwise oppose these conditions would simply force these places to shut down, condemning the workers to even worse prospects. My only criticism of this argument, and maybe I'm nave, is that this seems a bit too \\"all or nothing.\\" It seems hard for me to believe that any effort to enforce better working conditions would automatically put these places out of business. Isn't there a middle road here?One thing I did notice was that Wheelan states early on that capitalism is not a zero-sum game, meaning that my wealth does not depend on someone else's poverty. Then, later in the book he says that there is a finite amount of capital in the world and the more in the hands of government, the less for the rest of us. Either I'm missing something or this is a contradiction. Other than that, I enjoyed the book greatly and actually feel more knowledgeable on the subject than before I started. Economics has always frustrated me but the author explained it in a way that even a meathead like myself could understand. Wheelan also accomplished something I heretofore thought impossible; he actually made economics interesting! 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Now I understand what I studied while getting two degrees in economics.

This book often touched on issues of inequality and poverty which I appreciated, and it was very adept at explaining the impact of globalization on developing countries.

He understands that there are very few clear-cut solutions in economics, and while a couple of his thoughts may seem a tad politically controversial (i.e. globalization and outsourcing), all of his arguments are based in educated analysis and facts.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in knowing how the world and its money works.

As an economics instructor at the principles through graduate level, I've searched high and low for such a book, and finally found in \\"Naked Economics\\" one that passes all of my screens. First, there are no graphs or formulas. Yet Wheelan has been able to capture virtually all of the basic lessons that are found in entry-level econ texts. The book covers micro, macro, monetary, labor and global economics. There are a number of fine non-technical econ. books on the market that focus on microeconomics (David Friedman, \\"Hidden Order\\" being one example), but have little to say about macro-, monetary or international economics, except in passing. Also, Wheelan offers brief but sound economic advice on personal investing. Thirdly, the book is politically well balanced. Neither the right nor the left get off scott-free, as Wheelan picks apart each side's weaknesses yet gives credit where sound economics supports a particular position. This aspect alone leaves it head and shoulders above its competitors, which in many cases are more polemics than economics. Wheelan is an economic journalist with a Ph.D., and happily, it shows. He weaves economic lessons with daily life and world events so smoothly that the reader is unaware that he or she has been learning the dismal science. Economics text writers can take a lesson from him."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Wheelan does a great job in explaining the fundamentals in the easy-funny style that The Economist practices so well. Even people who have done economics courses will find this useful in putting together all the pieces.I don't mind the very few instances of politics in the book. Opinion is good, whether you like it or not, as long as it doesn't drown out the main message."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This fantastic book contains an incredible wealth of information, but is written in an engaging style that makes the concepts seem intuitive and relevant. Open this book to any random page and you will find a great deal of highly readable information and concepts. Wheeler manages to elucidate many of the key concepts of economics, sacrificing little in the way of depth (at least for the lay reader) while tying many of the ideas together and conveying a level of excitement for the subject that is laudable.Finally, perhaps the most impressive aspect of this book (can you tell how much I loved it?) is how balanced it is. Wheeler sidesteps the common tendency to simply pick a side and add to the noisiness of the tired left-right debates over free markets, globalization, and the like. Instead, he examines contentious issues in a way that highlights their complexity and the inherent tradeoffs in any position, while making these potentially confusing issues seem startlingly clear."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Layman's approach to economic theory.You'll hear a bunch of suits here on the Amazon site yapping about how \\"basic\\" the book is.Basic it may be, but it gets the job done.I've read tons of econ books, abstruse ones and enjoyable ones alike.This one fits in the second camp, yes, but you'll finish it feeling refreshed and fit to see the financial universe in a new light.Other books you should check out -- Lester Thurow's \\"Economics Explained\\" and -- if you have a bit more time -- I highly recommend the \\"Portable MBA in Economics.\\""},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Very interesting, simple and funny book that explains the fundamentals of modern economic system.

As the title suggests, economics can be dismal and dissatisfying. However,Wheelan contradicts this and adds an enjoyable, and rather humorous experience. Certain subjects, particulary globalization is a bit biased and one-sided,some may take offense to this. Nevertheless, Naked Economics is a book that will provide you with an understanding of economics that unfortunatley many tend to lack.One pleasant attribute of the book is that it contains no charts or graphs. However, for those hoping to get an in depth view of economics this may not be the best choice. Wheelan is rather vague in what he has to say and doesn't cover all aspects of economics, nor the history. Not once does he mention Keynsian or Austrian school of economics, which is a recurring subject in todays policies. He briefly touches on fiscal and monetary policy as well. Ultimatley, I would recommend this book to the newcomers of economics."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I took Principles of Macro and Microeconomics in the Fall, but both of those classes did not give me any interests in Economics until I finished reading this amazing book. You can find any major economic issues in this book with a very easy-to-understand words.The chapters about Human Capital and Global Trade by far are the best. It motivates you think not only for your own life but how the market/the world around you works."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Naked Economics is a book solely about economics, that isn't boring. As a young short intention spanned high school student I was able to enjoy reading a book on Economics. \\"How is this possible?\\", you might wonder. The reason that I was able to make it through this would be daunting task was the way that Wheelan involved the reader through humorous writing, and explanations that are understandable and easy to relate to. The book covers confusing topics that would normally leave a teenager like myself with a splitting headache, but instead left me wanting to continue reading. Naked Economics breaks down and organizes different confusing concepts in a well thought-out manner that is easy to follow and makes referring back to previous texts simple and easy. This economics hand book helps to understand the tricky science of economics without giving you a headache that feels like your head is abut to combust"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This is a great book for anyone who has just casual understanding of how the economy works. Wheelan does an excellent job of connecting the dots of different concepts and institutions that you may have heard of but don't really understand. The chapter on the Fed is especially enlightening. He does a great job of breaking down some of the basics of one of our most powerful institutions. And throughout the book he does better than just aptly explain basic concepts -- he breaks them down in a way that makes them relevant to our lives and interesting."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Wheelan writes with a clear and entertaining voice. He's one of the best popular economics commentators and now a candidate for US Congress in Illinois. One of his research and writing interests is the interaction between government and markets and the role public policy plays in in our economic lives. Public policy and related issues such as public goods and interest groups are some of the themes that frequently come up throughout the book."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This product was required reading for a university level Principles of Economics 110 Course.

Also, there are even jokes.Economics - math emphasis + a sense of humor = total freaking awesomeness."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Maybe the best introduction to econommics you can read. If you teach economics, consider using this as your textbook. It is an espeically helpful book if you wish to use current events, as there are plenty of examples of economic principles in action used in the book.

I would call it Synoptic Economics."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"If you think economics is a mysterious or unapproachable subject, I believe you'll find that the author is able to introduce, explain and illustrate many economic principles without jargon or complex terminology.

I found it very readable and convincing, even without tables or graphs. If I had anything to quibble about, it would be that a very few basic, simple tables and graphs might have been useful. On the other hand, the author was trying not to scare away folks who have a math phobia; so his choice to stick strictly to text was probably right. I definitely will read other books by this author."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Great service, came in about a week.

Wheelan covers the major topics in an instructive and entertaining manner, without resorting to odd examples to make his point. He covers markets, incetives, the role of government, trade and globalization in a manner that makes it comprehensible and interesting for the non-economist. This book deserves more attention than some of its brethren have received (Freakonomics [Revised and Expanded]: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything;More Sex Is Safer Sex: The Unconventional Wisdom of Economics) as it does the more important job of teaching economic principles rather than just entertaining with economics.

She then went on to tell me what a bore her two terms of Intro to Econ were. Luckily, I unwittingly stumbled across this book instead. This was exactly what I had wanted, and my wife had wished, to get out of an Econ class.In this book, the author explains economics from a practical and applicable standpoint. He does this by presenting the concepts \`in context.' By using plenty of real life examples, the author presents a basic overview of Markets, Government and Economy, Human Capital, Organized Interests, The Federal Reserve, Trade, Globalization and Development. This is a relevant way of learning about economics and is application, especially concerning the myriad of ways economics effects our everyday life.I really enjoyed this presentation of this subject. The author made the topic interesting and understandable. I can't say I am walking away from this book an expert in the topic, but I do now have a firm grasp on the basic concepts of economics and its everyday application.

A couple of years old now but still a good read."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I was very excited about this book...until I started reading it. Having forced myself to read a couple of chapters and then skipping ahead to the chapter regarding the Fed, it scares me to death that this book is pushed as a starter in Economics. I wouldn't recommend this book in short because it is a pretty dysfunctional overview. I don't think that the author has fully considered his reasoning behind the various cases he makes. His logic seems to jump all over the place, swinging from relatively logical and sound economic reasoning, to downright economic totalitarianist-like beliefs that stem in my opinion from more \\"reactionary\\" type analyzing. The book, and the authors views, just lacked depth of good economic reasoning to me, like he has sort of started his way in, but not fully fleshed out good sound reasoning for a lot of his opinions, and as a result come up with some really shallow and sort of \\"by the book\\" answers.Then again, I am one of those crazy folks that has pretty well come to agree with the \\"Austrian\\" school of economics. Note: If you ARE of that ilk, this book will drive you insane for the reasons noted above.I'm so disappointed because I CRAVE good economics books, but this one fell flat.....now I have to wait for my next Amazon shopping spree to find something better...."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"As others have mentioned, this book is a decent intro to economic theory. Most of the major topics are discussed (although many are only given light attention) and the author uses real-world examples and humorous stories to keep the reader interested.However, the book is also somewhat difficult to read because of the author's constant political commentary.I'm not sure of Wheelan's political ideology. In many ways, he comes across a bit like Eric Cartman in the episode of South Park where he has to confront his dark side: on the one hand he accepts free markets (defined as markets with only light, meaningful, and helpful regulation) and the positive benefits of capitalism. At other times he just can't help but parrot left-wing talking points. As he states a couple times in the book, Wheelan was at one time a Democratic speechwriter and he has many left-wing friends (he even frets about being chastised by his friends in uber-liberal Boulder, Colorado). This leads him to interject some snide political comments and take a very biased (and frequently self-contradictory) look at economic policy.The first example doesn't take long to get to. In the introduction Wheelan explains his approval of free markets, but then says \\"Does this mean economics is an advertisement for the Republican party? Of course not.\\" He then engages in juvenile stereotyping of Republican ideology so he can reject it, claiming that Republicans are for 'unfettered' markets (as in, not even criminal law enforcement) and are for discrimination! This is Wheelan establishing his left-wing bona fides for the possibly anxious reader.Wheelan repeatedly quotes left-wing 'economist' Paul Krugman, which might be fine if he were critically analyzing Krugman's economic beliefs, but instead Wheelan just repeats some of Krugman's jokes and sayings. It reeks of fanboyism (Krugman's name is pretty well besmirched at this time, he was a big cheerleader for the first failed stimulus and has openly called for followup stimuli). Krugman is actually mentioned more frequently than Milton Friedman!In the face of numerous studies which clearly show that deficit spending only prolonged the Great Depression (and led to Japan's lost decade), Wheelan still endorses the practice, claiming that 'cutting spending during a recession will almost certainly make it worse'. He does not address the broken window theory. He praises the Fed endlessly. He makes frequent reference to the supposed, now disproven, economic surplus when Clinton left office. He correctly labels Social Security as a pyramid scheme, but when proposing solutions only suggests that the young pay more or the elderly take less - completely neglecting personal retirement accounts or privatization of Social Security. And he has nothing but negative things to say about the 80's, which every economist knows set the stage for the boom of the 90's.But most egregiously he makes constant, irritating reference to 'global warming', by which he means anthropogenic global warming (AGW). It is his fallback argument whenever he wants to show negative impact of the economy. At the time this book was published AGW was still pretty new theory. In the years between we have seen as much, if not more, evidence debunking it than affirming it. But more importantly for a book on economics, he doesn't discuss the potential impact of legislation to curb 'global warming' and he doesn't mention that warming generally has positive implications. He does, however, routinely speak about the 'guilt' that should be associated with driving a large car (has he never lived in a rural snowfall state?) and other tiresome left-wing bromides.As I said, it's very bizarre. For the majority of the book Wheelan endorses free markets and capitalism. Understanding free markets and capitalism generally leads one towards a more Conservative mindset (in the American sense). Wheelan just seems scared to take that step so he has to keep name-checking these emotional left-wing topics and figureheads. So while it's a generally fun read, and the economic novice will learn a few new things, it's confusing and at times off-putting."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Even if economics is nearly a foreign language to you, I think you will really enjoy and understand this book. The author makes economics seem interesting and relevant by explaining how its principles work in our everyday lives."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"it is a ok book, the first few chapters are good, but nothing new. the last chapter about development economics is a complete failure.I assume the author is fully aware the development stragety of Britian, America, Germany, Japan and China, at this point he is not honest, pray, which country put property right or IP on their agenda when theywere trying to steal other countries' technology?I burst into laugh when he discribed a Chinese student in Nanjing University to ask to implement a similar government in Beijing like Washington, from Korean war, Vietnam wars to Gulf wars, Irap wars, Aufganstian wars, the author can simply tell the girl: you have a better government than we got in U.S, you have nothing to envy , haha3 stars."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Overall I thought some of the analysis was incorrect as the author allows for government intervention more than is logically (or empirically) necessary. Overall it is a good book, but not as good as Free to Choose, Basic Economics, or Economics in One Lesson. Nevertheless, I wish more liberals read the book so they can learn about positive side about free markets."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"It's funny reading economists trying to explain human behavior. An economist will say that people make decisions in order to maximize their utility, without understanding what motivates them to do so. Why would anyone ever want to be generous, or altruistic? It makes you feel good to be generous or do a good deed. Why is that? Economists are apparently ignorant of the Biological concept of reproductive fitness.That aside, I found the book to be a good, if somewhat typically biased, introduction to economic principles. For example, the author claims that sweatshops improve lives, because they pay a greater wage than is otherwise available in that region. Well, looking at Saipan in the CNMI, it seems that the only reason the sweatshops pay a greater wage than might otherwise be available is because we are not enforcing federal labor laws there, despite the fact that the manufacturers are gaining economic benefit by being able to use a \\"Made in the USA\\" label while paying typical sweatshop wages. In other words, if we required the standard federal minimum wage to be paid, and enforced other labor laws like workplace safety and overtime requirements, the workers would benefit due to the rule of law being enforced for social good. That's why we have the laws, to prevent abuse in the face of no bargaining power, a concept lost on this author. Further, by allowing countries to engage and compete in our market using sweatshops, it diminishes the quality of life for everyone by encouraging and perpetuating labor abuses. There are other profitable business and job creating investments to be made in foreign countries besides sweat shops.The author goes on to claim that Social Security is a waste of money, because it's a tax that reduces savings and capital for investment. Of course, history proves it also dramatically reduced elder poverty, a point lost on the author. This is a common theme in economics and in this book, the \\"starve the market losers to feed the market winners\\" approach to society, no matter the cost.Another example is the already debunked earned income tax credit. This allows low wage workers to be subsidized in their many, benefit-less, part-time jobs, instead of getting aid. Of course, it doesn't help the unemployable, but more importantly it also causes a parenting cost. What's the cost? Single mothers are not raising their children.In an anecdotal example of how economists fail to account for all costs, the author states that we should allow people to pay extra and be allowed to drive the Unimog (a giant SUV that didn't make it to market), because we can choose to eat ice cream. But I'm not going to mow over a family of four with a pint of Haagen-Dazs. It doesn't matter how much extra you pay, that money doesn't defray the cost of others of being in increased road danger. Again, this author and economists in general fail to acknowledge the real costs of social policies. It's easier to ignore reality and stick with oversimplified models and explanations. Granted, the book is supposed to be light, but in many places it is too light, and gives a biased assessment as a result.He suggests public education is a function best privatized, which makes for a great discussion topic. Realize that it used to be private, back in the days when most were illiterate. Apparently we should return to those days.A common free market argument is that the government should contract out for public work projects to be done by private sector, which certainly happens a lot, e.g. Halliburton and all of our missing money for the Iraq reconstruction. In contrast look at the infrastructure road building in Alaska done by the Army, which was accomplished ahead of schedule. When we aren't fighting unnecessary foreign wars, our military can accomplish quite a bit, for less money than over budgeted and corrupt private ventures. Both have their place, and I would be remiss not to point out that the real problem is the lack of government contractor fraud enforcement.The author mentions the CIA venture capital firm In-Q-I as another example of tax payer money being spent in the market to benefit us, but he doesn't say if this program ever produced anything of value. I suspect it didn't.Then comes an old saw about lawyers and the bar: lowering the standards for admission would increase the number of lawyers and ultimately reduce legal costs to the benefit of society. Unstated by the author, this would also be true for doctors, nurses, psychologists, and all other licensed professionals. The author sees no problem with this reduction in licensing requirements, apparently due to being incredibly nave. A small sampling of problems would include:- Cost of education would remain the same, so more professionals and lower fees would mean a lower return on tuition investment, thus the better minds will pursue other careers.- Malpractice has a cost too. A pretty big one in medicine, though not the health care dollar cost that conservatives lie about, since medical malpractice expenses account for less than 2% of healthcare costs. No, the real cost of medical malpractice is 98,000 people killed every year under the current \\"restrictive\\" system for medical licensing. That's more than automobiles and handguns combined. Granted, if your attorney commits malpractice, you are unlikely to die from it. But you may lose your house. We already have non-ABA accredited law schools out there, churning out below average lawyers in a diploma-mill style. We really don't need even worse lawyers practicing law.- Paralegal services fill the gap of low cost legal services already, a rather obvious fact of which the author is apparently ignorant.The author even claims that using DDT makes economic sense in developing countries, at which point he has driven off the cliff of reality. The cost of environmental destruction is greater than cost of better pesticides, in the long run. Extinct species don't come back.Economists love to berate regulations, and this author is no exception, pointing to countries that use excessive regulation as a means of extracting bribes. The problem isn't the regulation, it's the corruption.The author repeats the old saw that economic growth is better for the poor than targeted programs. What we see today is tax cuts without any equivalent economic growth, since those tax cuts only significantly go to the wealthy *and* the benefits reduced were largely job creators (e.g. special education, medical care) with good economic returns. What little economic growth has occurred still leaves an increasing number of children in poverty. When poverty indicators increase every year, along with economic growth, reality disproves the maxim that economic growth helps the poor.As an amusing aside, the author claims that discriminating based on race is illogical, but on sex is logical if you factor in maternity costs. Gay males would therefore be the most logical choice of all to employ, a conclusion the author misses.The author also repeats the globalization saw, that increases in overall productivity benefit everyone. Making India more productive increases our economy, because we can trade with a healthier partner. Of course, if we destroy the American Middle Class and lose our labor laws, habitable environment and civil rights in the process, the fact that shirts are cheaper isn't going to be that much of a benefit. If you don't know how all of those are related, you, like the author, haven't been paying attention to the big picture.The author claims that interest groups are more politically effective when small, but the obvious counter examples are the Military-Industrial Complex (defense industry) and Big Oil. Detroit and Big Tobacco come to mind too, as does the garment industry. In fact, I'd have to say that overall interest groups are more politically effective when large, after all the mohair farmers didn't make the country go to war, but small ones can make gains too.The author talks against protectionism and how we should all engage in free trade by doing what we do best, taking an example from the Lincoln Administration where Lincoln mistakenly bought American made iron rails which were more expensive than British made ones. Of course, by investing in American refining, America eventually became the best steel producers in the world, and had the manufacturing capacity to win WWII. Can you imagine renting soldiers from China because they are cheaper than American soldiers? Japan didn't start off making better cars than Detroit, and had they relied on their post-war capabilities without investment, they wouldn't be the economic powerhouse they are today. Michael Jordan has long since retired from basketball, and now needs other skills, like how to best manage his estate without getting ripped off.It is important to plan for the future, to develop new skills and new productive abilities, rather than simply rely on the abilities currently present and risk oblivion if those abilities are not needed in the future, or you are out-competed. Which is a long-winded way of saying that relying solely on your current strengths is a recipe for disaster, and globalization is a risky business to those not already wealthy as American workers have to compete with people willing to work for far less money and social benefits. Call it a \\"race to the bottom\\" where the place that provides the most labor for the fewest costs wins. By the way, that \\"place\\" is called slavery, and currently, right now as you read this, there are 27 million people in bondage on this planet as the cheapest labor pool of all. This is the perfect world of the free market, a highly productive slave world where GDP is at record highs while most people live in abject poverty. After all, the \\"average\\" or per capita income is still good. And yes, you buy their goods and subsidize slavery. Every day. Welcome to globalization.Trade does increase wealth for most, at the expense of the losers. Overall productivity increases through trade, but the wealth that is created tends to be concentrated at the top. In fact, a recent article showed that while productivity has increased substantially over the last century, the actual wealth of working class Americans has only increased by a small fraction of that increase. Call it \\"trickle up\\" economics. The author states that with social programs we can minimize the losses suffered, but of course we don't have many of those social programs because they cost money and in the singular pursuit of greater productivity we sacrifice all other values; instead we only have the losses by the working class and the gains by the wealthy, and a lot of cognitive dissonance regarding the American Dream.The author admits that the free market generates winners and losers, and life admittedly is about change, but he fails to educate the reader that our economic policies should take that into consideration, and seek to benefit its citizens, including the losers, rather than leave them in the cold, to the wolves, while hoping for some future altruistic social policy that never happens. Being heartless and cruel should not be an American value, nor should it be a desired policy defended by economic free market proponents, like the author.In general, the author has a myopic view, repeats and relies on typical economic fallacies, and shows the general pro-business bias that plagues modern US policy making. Still, it's a good introduction to economic principles, even if laden with myths, propaganda and error, and it has some good humor to it. I can't say I've found a better book on the topic."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Let me start by saying that I liked the authors tone and some of his early examples in the book were very entertaining. I didn't finish the book because I found a section that either proved that he didn't know what he was writing about (hard to believe), or that he purposely tried to deceive.Specifically, I'm talking about the discussion on taxes. He mentions the Laffer curve, which posits that as taxes go down, revenues to the government go up. Then he states that this is not true because when tax rates were lowered in the 80's, deficits rose. These two things are unrelated. The fact is that revenues DID go up in the 80's when tax rates were lowerd. The other fact- conveniently left out of the book- is that Congress during that time managed to spend still more than the amount of revenue that was coming in.Once I got to that point in the book I quit reading because I could no longer trust anything in it.If you want to read an excellent book about economics, readBasic Economics: A Citizens Guide to the Economy, Revised and Expanded. It's everything that this book isn't."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I had to read this book for an AP economics course over the summer. Needless to say, it was incredibly frustrating, almost to the point of driving me insane. Don't get me wrong - Wheelan seems like a smart guy, and he put a great deal of effort into the 325 pages. The book itself isn't even bad - people comfortable with the Paul Krugmans of this world will find this book oddly soothing. But as it turns out, I subscribe to the Austrian school, and the hours I spent reading \\"Naked Economics\\" were absolutely painful. Hearing Wheelan tell me that \\"government is your friend\\" (page 54) was like hearing fingernails against a chalkboard. No, government is not a friend to the economy. Taxing cars, redistributing wealth, creating inflation, introducing an individual mandate, etc are illegitimate uses of force and ultimately detrimental to the economy as a whole. Capitalism works. Don't let Wheelan tell you otherwise.At the end of the day, people are free to disagree with my views on economics, as I'm sure most will. But please don't paint this book as unbiased or impartial by any means. The author - a democrat (as I was able to guess) - filled much of this book with modern economic hogwash that is nowhere near the realm of objectivity. In fact, I'd argue that many of the assertions made are simply objectively false.There are plenty of books on economics that tell it like it is, and I'd encourage people to give them a fair shot. \\"Economics in One Lesson\\" by Henry Hazlitt is great on the basics. \\"How an Economy Grows and Why it Crashes\\" by Peter Schiff (somebody who predicted the crash in 08 without any recognition from Wheelan) comes highly recommended. \\"Meltdown\\" by Tom Woods is great. Of course, Rothbard's and Mises's work is always phenomenal, among others. I highly encourage people to look outside the Wheelans of the world and truly open up their minds to new ideas."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This introduction to economics is a good overview of the subject, but it has its flaws. I believe that an important goal of a nontechnical book on economics is to communicate how economists think, primarily to counter news reports and other descriptions of economic matters that tend to be brimming with inaccuracies and misunderstandings of the most basic principles of economics.The two chapters on the positive role of government in the economy are probably the best in the book. Wheelan effectively describes the many scenarios where market economics simply fails to provide the proper incentives for mutually beneficial activity. This part of the book is a nice contrast to some other economics books that sometimes seem as if they were ghost written by the Libertarian party.However, the text, even in those two chapters, includes several statements presented as undisputed fact but which are actually open to substantial debate.Early on, the book claims that \\"cigarette smoke can .. harm those who happen to be lingering nearby\\" without mentioning that little evidence of actual physical harm from secondhand smoke is available. However, the next paragraph does make the nice point that cigarette smokers do perform good for the rest of us: they die quicker, generally after a full working life but before collecting much Social Security. Maybe it would be a fair exchange for nonsmokers to breathe a little annoying second-hand smoke in exchange for the larger old age payments that come courtesy of the nicotine addicts among us.Later, Wheelan says about drug couriers, \\"It's good to have goverment officials blocking the road when the 'entrepreneur' is carrying seven kilos of cocaine\\" but presents absolutely no argument as to why this is true. Many economists would feel that it is the government that should be blocked from interfering in the cocaine market. This would almost surely include the economist mentioned a mere two sentences later, Milton Friedman, who has long made clear his opposition to drug prohibition.Finally, it is asserted without evidence that, compared to a sports car, \\"a college education makes a young person more productive for the rest of his or her life.\\" I'm not sure that's true all or even most of the time. While I guess that most students learn something in college, it is also true that many college students spend substantial time, effort, and money on things like parties, sports, clubs, and other similar activities that probably don't provide a productivity benefit later, but that are simply a hell of a lot of fun.This may sound like I'm favoring sports car-driving, cigarette smoking drug dealers over law-abiding, non-smoking college students but that's not my point. I simply mean that it would have been better had the author pointed out some of these nuances because it would help readers to think more like an economist."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Bought this for a class that I would eventually drop. The book was horribly done in my opinion, and found that the Undercover Economist was a much better book reading for the class"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This book is extremely fascinating. It has no graphs or complex formulas but rather a discussion of economics that is, well, socially revealing!"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This book won't leave you with crafty quotes or statistics to impress people at a cocktail party (although there are actually some interesting statistics within.) But for the ordinary person trying to make some sense of the major news headlines of the day (global trade, right vs. left, taxes, the environment, etc...) this book should leave you with a better basis to form your own reasoned opinion. You can decide which is more important.What Wheeler explains is that economics doesn't in and of itself argue anything. What it does is provide a tool for understanding the impact and mechanisms of various choices we make in the world. Similarly, Wheeler's goal is not to argue for more or less taxes, for free trade or for protectionism, but help the reader understand all the implications and effects (gooad and bad) of different policies and economic systems.You do not have to be of any particular political persuasion to find value in this book (rare in this day and age of red vs. blue.)For these reasons and more, I think this book would serve as excellent material for a introductory economics class (HS or college.) In addition to going over some basic economic principles, it provide excellent context for why economics is important, rather than going headlong into guns vs. butter charts (which are also important, but can leave students disinterested and apathetic.) Alternatively, if you have a child in high school or college who is beginning to take such classes or is simply developing a greater interest in news and current events, I would highly recommend you order a copy of Naked Economics for them. It should leave them with a clearer perspective in which to try to make sense of the world today."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"The two things that can be said about this book was that it is totally tractable and a pleasure to read. While the author does interject personal life experiences and biases, it doesn't distract from the subject. One cannot truly talk about economics without talking about politics.

I already knew a fair amount of the material beforehand, but Mr. Wheelan's humorous, simple explanations allowed me to have a deeper understanding of what I thought that I already fully understood. A perfect first book for someone with zero understanding of economics (or anyone else, for that matter).An example of how well he explains things: I was doing some online research about currency devaluation. No matter what I read, I couldn't quite wrap my head around the concept, much less why a country would purposefully devalue its currency. Mr. Wheelan, in a stroke of genius, put an end to my quandaries in only a couple of pages of his conversational narrative.In addition to the superb organization and narrative, this book was obviously well researched. The author frequently cites the work of other intelligent and qualified economists. I really don't think that 5 stars will do this book justice, as it deserves at least 6."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I never though that I would like to read a book about economics.

The book makes economics interesting. It explains economic theory in an accessible way and constantly applies it to real-life scenarios. The book provides readers with a new lens with which to see the world.I preferred Naked Economics to books such as The Tipping Point and Blink because it provides a time-tested analysis of cause and effect. The Tipping Point is more sensational and based on odd findings in modern social psychology, whereas Naked Economics tracks trends and uses the economic theories developed over the course of hundreds of years.Read it!

Touches not only upon the basics of economics but more importantly the affect economics has on policy making. After all, the greatest gain the average (non-economist) person can hope to obtain from learning about economics is a better understanding on public policy: what makes a good tax/successful tax, how much regulation is too much regulation, when is regulation absolutely needed, the importance of government infrastructure but the dangers of corrupt governments or \\"crony capitalism\\", and so on.The book is humbly written with opinions and life examples; the author reminds readers that not everyone's life is the same and therefore one must not be quick to fall into the attractive traps of placing complex policy issues under one umbrella solution.A must read, not only for those wishing to learn more about economics, but also any layperson wishing to intelligently engage in political discussions (in other words, the book will give you plenty of things to talk about during your next dinner party or holiday.)"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Very insightful repudiation of Miscellaneous Economic policies.He shows you why an idea is sound and then crushes it.Great fun and a very fast read."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Wheelan's book is as good an introduction to economics as I've seen. Each chapter exposes the reader to a major topic in economic theory: markets, incentives, globalization, etc. The presentation is entirely conceptual. There are no graphs or charts and no mathematics. The virtues here are clarity, simplicity and, in general, no grating ideological agenda. Wheelan strongly advocates free markets but never hesitates to identify potential sources of market failure.I have only two substantial criticisms. First, his chapter on the Federal Reserve reads more like a love sonnet for Alan Greenspan than an objective discussion. At least some attention to the Austrian School position -- even in a basic text such as this one -- would be appropriate. This is admittedly a difficult subject to review in fewer than twenty pages but his treatment could be more balanced.Second, there are no suggestions for further reading. Often the most useful feature of an introductory work is guidance to the next level. The absence of such direction in Naked Economics is both puzzling and unfortunate.Notwithstanding the above, if you have never made a serious effort to understand the basics of economics this would be an excellent place to start."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This small book is a great introduction to economics in a non text book format. The author's language is fluid and readable, not like a boring, stuffy textbook. He discusses everything from trade, inflation, fed rates, and the role of government. Sometimes informative, this book assumes hardly any economic knowledge from the reader, so it's really a beginner's book to economics. Anyone who took a simple economics course would probably not need to read big chunks of this.Even though simplistic, it is a quick and fun read and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get in on the ground floor. In the realm of few non-academic economics book, this book is probably the best.

If he touched gold he would turn it to life.\\"For casual observers of 'the dismal science', Naked Economics takes your hand and walks you through a basic understanding of market-theory frameworks, all in a light and conversational tone. Wheelan explains why everyone should love government (as a necessary correcting and regulating force in the market) and outlines which uses of it would be most efficient. He explains why it is that Bill Gates makes more money than you or I and uses that example to bolster later conversations about value and scarcity. He detailed the differences between fiscal and monetary policy and shows you why and when governments would use each.I would stress that Naked Economics is a book for lay-people. It's explanatory powers are vast, as is its potential to make economically illiterate people literate.

So very well done."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I recommend this book, not because I agreed with everything the author wrote, but because I agreed with much and disagreed with just as much -- in other words, it's balanced.For example, the author acts as an apologist for the existence of child-labor and sweatshops in developing countries (he seems to believe that we should accept that either sweatshop jobs or no jobs at all are the only two realistic options for many developing countries), implies that teacher unions (i.e. teachers) are primarily responsible for hurting public education, misrepresents the positions of most who protest the WTO, and side-steps potentially harmful effects on economic growth caused by significant inequalities in distributions of income. Published in 2002, he also confidently states (or implies) that a rising tide lifts all boats (contrary to this assertion, since this book was published, we've seen our economy grow while the poverty rate have risen and real incomes have remained flat for most Americans).At the same time, this author advocates market incentives to reduce carbon output, is a strong advocate of free trade (not to be confused with \\"fair\\" trade), recognizes that without government intervention, business is financially motivated to pass external costs (i.e. externalities) onto outside parties (ex: to save money, a factory might spill waste into a river leading to \\"externalities\\" such as costs and suffering arising out of unusually high rates of cancer and birth defects in nearby communities), is a strong advocate for providing economic aid to developing countries and recognizes that government has an important and necessary role to play in order to maintain a productive free market economy. He writes, \\"Economics can move us beyond the inane debate over 'big government' versus 'small government'... It is about what government should and should not be doing.\\"Despite my numerous head nods while reading this book, in both directions, I learned a lot - a whole lot.

You don't have to agree with everything he says, as it is his opinion, but in order to have your own point of view, you need to understand what he's talking about. And Mr. Wheelan explains it to you very well. You will enjoy reading a non-fiction economics book as if it were your favourite novel, or biography, or a history textbook. It encompasses aspects of everyday life and relates them to economics, which is the only science that can explain the current world order. If you are new to economics, you will learn a lot more than in Econ 101. If you are not--hey, you'll enjoy reading about the opinions of an economist who knows his stuff.

I have read a variety of \\"laymen's\\" economics books and this one earns enough merit to be considered a good book. As a disclaimer, my expectations as a reader are not to gain an expansive knowledge base on economics or to weigh the theories set forth in this book against other equally reputable theories that are existent currently.As with any book, this work will be appealing to you depending on what you are looking for in a read. With Naked Economics you can be guaranteed a broad overview of many foundational topics in economics that are made relevant to the times and are also captivating. If you are looking for a certain writing style, I would comment that while Wheelan is not as funny as a Vonnegut type fellow, but he provides his fare share of humor to keep the reader turning pages. In terms of raw information the book does a good job of avoiding the stretching that you may see at the end of many titles like this. Basically, if something has piqued your interest in economics in any manner and you want to feel more informed, be quite entertained, and possibly rethink some of the basic transactions that you encounter in your week, this is the book for you.I give the book 5 stars because it accomplishes what I believe the author sent out to do. Even if there are competing theories out there as opposed to the ones that this author offers, the book presents its side clearly and forgivingly; for those of us who did not go to school for 6 years to get a Masters in economics it is ideal."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Charles Wheelan does a remarkable job in explaining the fundamentals of Economics in his Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science. The purpose of the book is to provide an accessible corridor for the non-specialist to get her dose of ECON 101 without wading through the math that often clouds the big picture of what Economics is intended to do. Each chapter is devoted to a particular type of economics, from Micro to Macro and everything in between.His overriding concern is to get his readers thinking like economists, which can be a disconcerting experience. He readily admits the shortcomings of Economics. Like Meteorology or Climatology, Economics deals with complex systems with multiple factors and variables acting upon each other, making understanding and prediction difficult. Yet Economists plow ahead with a certain hard-headed certainty, providing answers for nearly all human behavior while at the same time conceding that their theories and explanations might not hold water.So, readers are left with inconsistent expectations. As a science, how useful is Economics in theorizing how people behave? Are its experiments indicative of real scientific procedure? Can any of its conclusions have real world applications? In many cases, I have my doubts. But as an Economist, Wheelan will definitely give you the answers."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"There are differences of opinion on any subject or point of discussion you can think of. No one agrees on everything. This book is an example of where that rule doesn't make any sense to me. Anyone with any interest in economics whatsoever would be very hard pressed to find a better, more concise yet thorough, introduction to the entire field of Economics than this book.I have been studying economics a while now. Most self-directed study entails lots of information from disembodied sources, aggregating to an adequate, but incomplete understanding. I have bought 40 books in the last few months, at least half on Economics, and when this book arrived, I stopped everything until this one was finished.Anyone who desires to be able to take part in any discussion, argument, debate, or interaction of any kind with their friends or colleagues, or just wants to understand what the papers mean when they say \\"Interest rates drop\\" or your buddy says to you \\"The Fed is printing money and it's tanking the country\\" would be perfectly equipped after reading this. You'll have a better understanding of Economics, supply and demand, public finance, and even government, than 95% of the population with the information contained in here. It is very informative, interesting, and even witty, clever and sometimes downright funny. He turns the study of Economics into an interesting narrative that is actually a job to read. If you want to understand half of all political discussions for the rest of your life (The other half being social policy, not covered here), and never be at a loss in a discussion again, there are more advanced sources on the subject; however, pragmatically, this is really all you need.

The wording is very easy to understand and very friendly to read. Basic concepts like cashflow, demand, supply, balance sheets, and some other from finance 101 are very helpful to understand better. Overall, great book!"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This is the best book on economics I've ever read. I have a double major in finance and entrepreneurship, so I've taken a wide range of economics courses and read many economics books for school, work, and personal education.This is by far the best I've read. He actually makes economics interesting and provides useful info to the every-day person."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This book reminds me ofFreakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (P.S.), another excellent book. It is written with the same style of writing, humorous at times, but immensely educational as well. As the author pledges, there are no graphs or fancy math equations. The author is very straightforward and rarely ventures into using technical jargon. He is also very politically removed; I didn't bother to look up his political affiliations or what party he has ran under previously. However, he makes cases for arguments on both sides of America's political aisle. I enjoyed that he removed himself from intensely validating any one party's viewpoints and instead offered no-nonsense discourse on how our economy works and the numerous other forces that impact it."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I enjoyed the daylights out of this book. It's filled with clear explanations from a guy who evidently knows his economics; he is a wonderful writer with a terrific sense of fun. If only I'd had a teacher like him in college I may have stopped showing up stoned to class. On the other hand maybe I did have a teacher like him and just didn't notice. I was young and stupid, but at least time has cured half of that. This book makes a small dent in the other half."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Caveat: I really like economics books, so I probably would have liked this under most circumstances. But this is a quick, clear and entertaining sojourn into the 'dismal science'.This book came with a lot of praise that it made economics more palatable for the first time college student. It does much more than that. Chapters need not be read in sequence and it does not presume prior knowledge. It is an excellent author's anecdotes on the principle ideas of economics in the world in which we live. Emminently readable and relative to our daily lives.If you ever thought this was a dry topic, read this book. It will change your mind."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I read this book because I was so impressed with the author's recent 'Naked Statistics.' However, 'Naked Economics' just doesn't have the credibility his statistics work does - perhaps it would if he were to rewrite it. My main concern with 'Naked Economics' is Wheeler's disdain for protectionism in light of the mess America's economy has turned into.Wheeler's material on the topic begins with deriding Ross Perot's assertion in the 1992 presidential debates that NAFTA would create a 'giant sucking sound' of jobs moving from the U.S. to Mexico. Recently, however, the non-partisan Economic Policy Institute estimated NAFTA cost 750,000 American jobs and trade with China another 2.7 million. We've accumulated an $8+ trillion trade deficit since 1979; every year since then has been in deficit, the deficit now includes trade in high-technology goods, and a large number of service jobs (legal research, computer programming, call-centers, R&D;, etc.) have also recently left for Asia. The resulting reduced demand for labor has also suppressed growth in wages and benefits for most Americans, and reduced government incomes - helping create record deficits. Similarly Wheeler contends that France's lowering the maximum work-week from 39 to 35 hours to reduce unemployment was an error based on the fallacy that there are a fixed number of jobs in an economy - reality, perhaps not a fixed number of jobs, but spreading that work over a greater number can't hurt either.The 'good news' for many readers - 'Naked Economics' contains no graphs, charts, or equations. However, his oversimplifications mislead too often. Another example - Wheeler attributes the rise of 20th century American life expectancy from 47 to 77 years in the last century, along with infant mortality falling 93%, polio, TB, typhoid, and whooping cough almost disappearing, to the private sector. Physicians I've talked to credit public health instead - improved water, mandatory immunizations, peer pressure to improve cleanliness during childbirth, and the Flexner Report helping revamp Colleges of Medicine.Continuing, Wheeler states 'The Soviet economy failed in large part because government bureaucrats direct everything.' Wheeler should have qualified that statement by adding 'poorly.' China has achieved wonders through its heavily managed state economy, sometimes adding capacity in areas and sometimes removing capacity - in their case they have directed most everything successfully. Worse, Wheeler contends that economic transactions for Americans are no different if the products/services originate in China or Mexico instead of the U.S. America's experience over the last three decades has definitely proven that to be a myth. Within the same section he even admits that his assertion in this area assumes nearly every skilled American worker is already working.On the plus side, I did like most of his summary of conditions necessary for economic growth - effective government institutions (laws, enforcement, basic infrastructure, tax collection), property rights, no excessive regulation or corruption (excellent example from Russia; China has a major corruption problem), solid investment in human capital (education, public health), a favorable climate (non-tropical), and responsible fiscal and monetary policy. The author also points out that natural resources matter less than one would think - eg. Japan vs. Iran and Iraq. As for the touted benefits of free trade Wheeler again cites in this section, I've already commented on those; similarly he also supports democracy. The latter attribute is still open to question - recent years have brought a crisis of democracy in both the U.S. and Europe - an increasing inability to effectively manage government affairs that is now reaching the crisis stage. Meanwhile, authoritarian China keeps on growing."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"As far as economic books go, this is the best read. It's entertaining and thoughtful, unlike most economic books. Fun to read."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I've used Naked Economics for years as an introduction for my first-time IB Economics students who are new to the discipline. It's very readable and usually well received by my students. It does an amazing job of compressing and simplifying complex topics with everyday examples. Great book."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This book is similar to the even more popular Freakonomics. This book deals with much more relevant & current topics. The author presents great facts about several things that affect our day-to-day lives such as, incentives, government (big/small), federal reserve and interest rates, globalization & developing economies. I am a horrible reader for taking too long to finish reading this book cover to cover. There was so much information and ideas in the book that I want to go back and start reading all over again. I'm sure I'll do that in a few days."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This book is an excellent buy and a great read. Everyone should read this book as it makes concepts of economics easily understandable and interesting."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This is a great economics book. Instead of dry and boring graphs and formulas, it is full of real world examples that are easy to understand. I have purchased 10 of these books over the last couple of years. I give them away to people I think will actually take the time to read the book. The book is also written so that high school (and maybe junior highschool) students can understand it. If you have children, I recommend you purchase a couple of these books. Read it yourself, then ask your child to read it. You can have some great discussions and debates taht will help your child. I think that this book, and your discussions with your kids will provide them a great foundation in economics, that will benefit them for the rest of their lives. Unfortunately most of us have a poor understanding of how the economy works (and many of us know so much that just isn't true).For me, a lot of the concepts in the book I already knew intuitively, but could not really explain. The explanations the author provides are short and simple. They have helped me better understand what I already knew, and allow me to explain better to people I talk to.He talks a lot about unintended consequences in the book. This is when the government will put in place a policy they believe will solve a certain issue, and the unintended consequences make things worse. One that comes to mind is that at one time, parents could fly on an airplane and hold their infant or toddler in their lap. This way they didn't have to buy another ticket for the child. Of course the risk is that if there was an accident, and the child was seat belted in with you, you would crush them upon impact (they are between you and the seat belt). So, in order to make travel safer for children, we are no longer allowed to do this. Parents must buy a ticket for the child, and have them sit in a safety seat on the plane. The unintended consequence is that this makes air travel too expensive for most families. So instead, the family must drive instead of fly. Flying is statistically safer than driving. It is actually safer to fly, without a seatbelt, than to drive. The unintended consequence is that the law actually increases the risk for children. There are many more examples in the book.One of the key issues I had against the book is the author's belief that global warming is man made. But, it is still a great book, that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"The books is written in an easy to read tone and uses examples that make the topic enjoyable. It isn't a deep dive into economics, more a general overview of why markets work and don't work and the things functioning markets depend on (e.g. good government, trade, human capital). A great book for those who haven't had any economics (e.g. young adults, those who dodged it in college or didn't attend college) and need an introduction to the basic functions and values of a semi-free-market economy. Further along this type of Economics for the Everyman genre I highly recommendFreakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (P.S.)."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This is the first book that I read about Economics and I was surprised by all the things that it covered and how well explained were they, Charles Wheelan tried to create a book so even the person without the slightest knowledge of economics could read it and understand it, and as Burton Malkiel Said If I had wanted to write a book about Introduction to Economics, this is the book I'd have written.The first chapters cover the nature of markets and how is it possible to have so much organizations in a decentralized economy, it's about satisfying consumer goods, there's a great story about a Soviet Commander who once entered an American Pharmacy and amazed by all the quantity of the stuff asked the pharmacist, impressing, but how does the goverment manages to supply all of this things to all the pharmacies, like they did in the USSR, the answer was, they don't, there's not a law that indicates which things a pharmacy must have yet they all have almost the same kind of things, read the book to get the rest of the info on that and much more, believe it or not, interesting and enjoyable stories.He goes on to talk about How the financial system crashed by explaining how the financial system works and how the goverment did things it wasn't supposed to do, what the goverment can do and what it can't as opposed to the extremists who either want to get rid of the goverment completely or want it to control every aspect of our lives with detailed yet easy to understand explanaitions.Lastly and one of my favorite parts as I live in a developing country is the part about International Trade and Development Economics, he goes on to explain that globalization is not as bad as the anti globalization protesters want you to believe or as they believe, he also tackles the asian sweatshops problem and how closing them would cause much more damage to the workers because capitalism is about choices and if they had a better working opportunity they as rational individuals would take it, but they don't because there are no better oportunities, obviously it has much more background than that, I just hope everyone read the book so we could unite to support the policies that help us all and stop the unrational prejudicing about things that benefit us all like Globalization and Free Trade."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This book is a great INTERESTING introduction to the ideas of Economics and Economics itself. I'd strongly recommend this to anyone who has an ounce of interest in Economics, it started me on the passion of economics."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Charles Wheelan has a PhD in economics and is a journalist who writes about economics. He has written a book absolutely loved by college students taking economics 101 because he has made this historically dry subject so entertaining. For Example:Every market transaction makes all parties better off. Even Asian sweatshops have full employment because it is the best option their workers have. Antiglobalization protesters say that world trade is something imposed on third world countries by rich countries, but win/lose thinking is wrong when it comes to economics. Trade gives poor countries access to markets in the developed world and the opportunity to become richer, and the loudest complaints against the antiglobalization protesters came from the developing world. Sweatshops played an important role in the early journey out of poverty by (among others) \\"asian tigers\\" South Korea and Taiwan. Have you ever heard of American workers applauding the closing of a factory in the US? It has been suggested that the antiglobalization coalition should be renamed, \\"The Coalition to Keep the World's Poor People Poor.\\"\\"Naked Economics\\" has perhaps 200 more short examples such as the one above, taken mainly from periodicals such as the \\"New York Times,\\" \\"The Economist,\\" and \\"The Wall Street Journal.\\" These stories will tell you things that you will immediately realize you want to know, such as why government is your friend when taken in small doses, why lawyers deserve a round of applause (but no encore, please), why the army was lucky to get that screwdriver for $500, why Bill Gates is richer than you are, why \\"get rich quick schemes\\" make you poor, why we don't need the gold standard, why the Federal Reserve Board can snub presidents...and why politicians ignore gravity and pass economically stupid laws, how economists showed orchestras they were discriminating against women, how the homeowners on your street are a special interest group, why when economists reach a consensus on policies that would make us better off, brick walls of political opposition materialize, why there's a shortage of cabs and apartments in New York City, why free international trade always benefits all participating countries, why tariffs and import quotas always reduce standards of living, why basic economics made the collapse of the USSR inevitable, a new answer to why the chicken crossed the road, why CEO's are paid in stock options, how smokers help the rest of us, why many American Indians live in mobile homes...and why the former USSR had two abortions for every single live birth, whether or not \\"supply side economics\\" boosts tax revenues, whether a Harvard graduate (20 years later) has earned more money than an LSU graduate, whether or not a state patrolman should utilize racial profiling, why there's a striking lack of correlation between a country's natural resources and its standard of living, why a wealthy man is one who earns $1000 /year more than his wife's sister's husband, why no one has to be poor, how to pick the shortest line at the grocery store, how presidents prevent Congress from adding pork when negotiating international trade agreements...and why a half-million people in India are disfigured by a disease that costs three dollars to treat, which US president committed the greatest fiscal blunder, which presidential candidate said, when asked what he would do if Alan Greenspan died before finishing his term, said, \\"I would prop him up and put a pair of dark glasses on him,\\" why Japan needs a stiff dose of inflation, how globalization (thus far) has brought 1.4 billion people out of poverty while the US still prospered, why excessive regulation goes hand in glove with corruption, why Argentina is the poster child for irresponsible monetary policy, and finally, whether the USDA should tell Swanson how many slices of pepperoni they should put on their frozen pizzas.In each eloquent chapter Wheelan sounds the trumpet for the value and power of sound economic theory. I wish \\"Naked Economics\\" were required reading for every twelfth grade young adult, every college student, and especially every voter.As long as I'm fantasizing anyway, I wish every legislator who casts a vote revealing his economic ignorance or who participates in the relentless Congressional porkfest - and that would be all of them - would be sentenced to a comfortable cubicle with good lighting until they finish reading and pass a test on \\"Naked Economics.\\" Five stars for sure."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Most books on economics for the layperson are written with some political axe to grind. These books are universally worthless. There are a few books that simply present what economists know, and basically agree that they know. There is a lot more that economists know than might be gleaned from reading the newspaper or following political debates. Most political hacks (and anyone who says \\"I am a committed liberal\\" or \\"I am a committed conservative,\\" is a political hack in my opinion, because issues general benefit from insights from both camps) simply ignore the laws of economics. There are a few informative and unbiased expositions for the layperson, which I have reviewed on my web site (under \\"You Must Read This!\\", Books on Economics for Serious Beginners. Naked Economics is probably better than any of these, simply as a balanced literate exposition.Wheelan explains the benefits and limitations of markets, the benefits and limitations of government interventions, the basics of finance (especially, how to avoid the costly errors that about 50% of investors are prone to make, such as believing they can pick winners), and the role of international competition. There is nothing that Wheelan asserts that I think is not 100% correct, including his exposition of development economics and globalization. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I love this book. I teach college economics and used the previous version of this book in my classes. Students really loved it (and said so on their anonymous end-of-semester course evaluations). It has great real-world examples, and it explains economics concepts in ways anyone can understand. The new version is terrific, with lots of updated examples on recent events, while keeping the same highly readable style. I love the range of topics this book covers, including the economics of special interests, things government does right, things it does wrong, the economics of environmental issues and property rights, plus all the new material on the recent economic crisis.This book is great for college students who want a more intuitive and readable explanation of the concepts in their textbook, but it is also really great for anyone who wants to better understand how the economy works.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Title is just because I think those reviewers who are so offended by the political positions stated in the book that they do not find value in it are missing the point. This book was a gift to me from a friend who is an Econ professor. She knew my background in economics (none) and my current state of understanding (ignorance with a touch of intuitive understanding). My interest in learning about the fundamentals of economics and how it relates to our world is only to help me better organize and define my own thoughts and beliefs on everything I experience in life now that I am a father, business owner, and (still) a consumer. In the proper state of mind, it's quite astounding how many pieces of our lives are related to economics.From that perspective, this book has been fantastic. I have a couple chapters yet to go, but will finish within the next few days. Yes, there are political views and anecdotes cited in the book, but they are minimal, obvious, and in my opinion do not substantially detract from the content.If you're an economics newb looking to gain some insight, I highly recommend this book. I'm following it up with \\"International Political Economy\\" which I expect to be far more dry, but more directly related to the things I'd like to understand. Naked Economics has given me a solid framework for my thoughts on the subject and I am encouraging all the enquiring minds I know to pick up a copy."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I'm a firm believer in understanding concepts and models before delving into arithmetic for rigorous proof. Both are essential for a complete understanding, however mathematical symbology (equations), exist only as shorthand to define concepts - be it gravity acting on light or GDP in relation to foreign trade. That said, Charles Wheelan does an entertaining job of exposing economics to the novice. His points are practical and spelled out clearly. If you read this book first, you'll understand why your doing the math when you get to it.I did notice a couple places that seem to have a slight liberal slant. This is just perspective of course, as I tend to be fairly conservative in my views. However, Wheelan has a balance to the points he presents and articulates them clearly using examples. I've somehow carried the idea that smaller government is always better. Wheelan has convinced me of the need for appropriately sized government.Regardless of your political or religious bent, if you're a beginner, interested in economics, Naked Economics is a great place to start.P.S. To Charles Wheelan:I'll be looking for your next book (I'm thinking something like \\"Economics Autopsy\\") that delves deeper into each of the topics in Naked Economics."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Economics is a point of view to see society and life, rather than just figures and graphs. This book illustrates most basic principle of economics in a lively way, from micro to macro. Updated examples throughout the book, is a great introduction for people who first read economics. It's also a good refresh for those who study economics in school and forget most of it already.As a foreigner, I would say some examples are in local American life style, which is a bit difficult for me to found familiarity."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I bought Naked Economics hoping to get a general overview of economic theory without the jargon that bogs down more technical books on the topic. I haven't taken an economics course since high school but have come to realize that a solid background in econ is essential to understanding how the world works.Naked Economics is a mixed bag. First, the positives. Wheelan's style is great for this type of book. It's heavy on real-world examples, which helps frame some of the more abstract concepts in an accessible way without feeling like the book is dumbing things down. It also covers enough topics to give a fairly broad look at the world of economics. I felt like I learned a fair bit by the time I finished.However, the book has enough negatives that I can't give a full-throated recommendation. First, it's repetitive. For example, the book contains several similar explanations of the virtues of free trade. Second (and more important in my view), the book is not well-organized. One would think that an introduction to economics would start with a brief overview of supply and demand and other topics the lay the groundwork for the rest of the book. Naked Economics takes the reader's understanding of these basic concepts for granted. I understand that this is not meant to take the place of a text book, but it feels like it starts in the middle, with a discussion of utility and incentives. These are important topics, to be sure, but it jumps around too much for my liking.Overall, I recommend the excellent New Ideas from Dead Economists by Todd Buchholz over this. Buchholz's text will introduce you to the major concepts in economics but also the major players in the history of economic theory. For a reader who may not know much about Smith, Marx, Friedman, Ricardo, Mill, Keynes, etc., this is valuable information. It's just as approachable as Naked Economics but is clearer and more comprehensive."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"The original version of this book was written before the events of 2008. While I enjoyed it at the time, after 2008, I felt it was discredited due to the author's excessive fawning over Greenspan, and espousing many policies that were found to be an abject failure and the cause of the financial meltdown. Now that 2008 happened, the author has found it necessary to present an after-the-fact correction to the original book and explanation. I find that disingenuous. If the original edition had held up better, I would have considered buying this edition too."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I read this book when I was thirteen, and quite curious about our economy. This book was so easily understood- it is chock full of metaphors and interesting stories- that kept me up all night reading. After the recession hit and Ben Bernanke (Federal Reserve chairman) became TIME's Person of the Year, I read this book again, taking notes and understanding the information better. Particularly interesting chapters were the ones on the Federal Reserve and trade and globalization.Now I am in high school, and because of this book, among other influences, I am seriously considering about majoring in economics in college. Of course, the reading material probably won't be nearly as enjoyable.I'd suggest this book to anyone without much knowledge about economics. It is a great read and among my favorite books!"},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I guess i'm a fairly typical college student along the way i took microeconomics. And as it's pointed out in the book most students just barely get through. I thought some things in the class were pretty interesting, but the graphs and math were boring.Wheelan understands most people would rather have a root canal than read an economics book full of numbers and equations.Thats whats so incredible about this book. It takes all the cool things about economics and explains them in plain english. He still uses econ terms, but uses easy to understand examples. He covers an incredible range of issues. From basic microecomics, markets, competition, incentives. To macroeconomic issues, interest rates and global markets. He explains how currency markets work which i finally understand now. Also he puts to rest the kind of protectionist rhetoric heard from the likes of Lou Dobbs. His arguments on using trade to end poverty are hard to ignore. Make no mistake he is a free market capitalist, but he's ideology is not totally laize faire and is more attune to \\"The Economist\\" newspaper and Thomas Friedman. This book is very informative to the general public and easy to understand. His comments and anologies are very funny.I espically liked the section on trade making everone collectivly better off. Though if you're already anti-globalization you won't like his comments on the seattle WTO protestors.He cites an endless aray of nobel prize winners most i've never heard of. Also he quotes Paul Krugman and Milton Friedman who are more known to me.The only problem with the book is that it's rather short, the index takes up many pages. I wish he'd made the book a little longer to expand more questions i had on these issues. All in all a great read that was so fun i couldn't put it down. Highly recomended."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"As an accountant and former college Econ minor I found this book to be fun and engaging. It tackles common misconceptions about how the economy operates and truly sheds light on how things work from a high level. This is a great read for anyone who wants to understand our economy and should be required reading for all Econ 101 students."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"First of all this is an exciting book. Yes exciting. Naked Economics presents some of the key aspects of economics by using real world situations which are frequently presented in the form of the controversies that arise over these concepts. Is government intervention in the economy a good thing? Naked Economics answers this question in two chapters; the first chapter shows how government can help the economy and the second chapter shows how government can hinder the economy. The author's conclusion, that a corruption free government is an essential component of a functioning economy but that there are a myriad of ways for the government to do harm, somewhat epitomizes the author's approach to explaining economics, rather than take the side of one type of economic theory he presents several of them, pointing out the merits of each one as he goes along. I said \\"somewhat\\" above because the author is clearly pro globalization and, I thought, did not do enough to present countering views of anti-globalization adherents. For example he makes no mention of the Fair Trade movement. I still think this is a very good book as it leaves you with the ability to follow, at a high level, layperson articles on the state of the economy. This book covers the importance of among others, incentives, human capital, information, financial markets and monetary policy. All in all I thought it was a very good read."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Wheelan presents a rational view of the major economic concerns of our time. He addresses politics in the framework of a free market economy and clearly presents how to allow business to progress without allowing the free market to blow through the social concerns of our society."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Economics lies at the heart of most policies. In order to understand these policies, one should have a basic understanding of economics; however, economics can be a \\"dismal science\\" which pretty much means its boring.The problem with economics is that the charts and statistics can many times be confusing. While some branches of economics such as Austrian economics are simpler to understand, mainstream economics is difficult. Naked Economics provides a change in pace for those that really do not have a great deal of understanding in economics.The book, however, is not for only those individuals that have never studied economics. I have studied it some and this book provided a real understanding of some of the more difficult subjects such as the Federal Reserve.The main problem with this book is that many times the author talks of his politic views. With the environment, the author deems that environmental issues are issues for the economy and government almost immediately. Other measures such as social change are not discussed. He is also pro-bush from the readings as noted in other reviews. I do not hold this against him because I realized that if he was anti-bush I would probably not hold it against him."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This book is really quite good at explaining economic concepts without using any math or graphs. As a high school econ teacher, I see some students who immediately understand a concept if they see a graph that shows the relationship; most students don't work that way though and this book provides a lot of anecdotes that can be used to illustrate key concepts. Definitely useful as a supplemental reader at the secondary level."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This is a great, great book. I work for a financial services company and have suggested to our head of training that it be required reading for entry level hires.

I would never have realized that without without this book.In an attempt to economize your time, I will refer you the review written by \\"gnossie\\", entitled \\"peerless\\". I can't say it any better than he/she."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This is a pretty good introduction to economics for the lay reader. Economics presents a peculiar problem, which tends to complicate any 'explanation' of it: any exposition of economics will tend to include normative economics. This book in no exception.The author, when he sticks to topics that are mainly descriptive, like Comparative Advantage or role of subsidies in impacting international trade or inflation on economic growth, is quite lucid and those portions of the book make for informative and entertaining reading. When the author tackles topics like sweatshops or inserts his opinion of the right policy consequence of a certain economic principle, then he veers into commentary best left out of an expository work. I don't disagree with all of his views, but maybe he could have chosen a different model to undress."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Surprising as it may sound, I was not able to put this book down.Now, while I didn't buy the book (I checked it out at my local library), I wouldn't mind having it on my shelf as a future reference. Having read some of Milton Friedman's work, I found Wheelan's writing much more refreshing and easier to grasp. Wheelan's book focuses much more on the &quot;science&quot; of economics than the merits of the free-market system, though he is obviously in favor of such markets.Wheelan's explanation of the FED seemed more attainable to me than what Friedman put forth in Free to Choose.All in all, anyone looking to a sound introduction to the market economy should check this book out."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"The author writes well.The lense through which he views the economy is primarily libertarian.His microeconomic analysis,as long as there are no major negative externalities and/or spillover effects ,or market failures ,involved in the production and consumption of the particular product,good,or market he is talking about,is interesting.Not so when it comes to macroeconomics.Wheelan simply does not know what it was that either Adam Smith or J M Keynes actually said in their major theoretical contributions .He is ignorant.Let's start with Adam Smith's fundamental macroconclusion,stated on pp.734-735 of the Wealth of Nations-the Invisible Hand process,i.e.,comparative advantage,the division of labor,extension of the market(national and international trade),etc., creates major undepletable negative externalities(social,political,martial,intellectual,moral)that impact practically the entire work force.What is Smith's summary of the problem ? Smith is crystal clear:\\"Division of labor destroys intellectual,social,and martial virtues unless government takes pains to prevent it\\".(Cannan paraphrase).What is Smith's solution ?.Smith gives his solution on pp.767-768 after 40 pages of the most lucid and pungent analysis ever made by an economist.I leave this as a voluntary assignment for Wheelan to read and integrate into a later edition of his book.How about Keynes ? Does Wheelan get Keynes right? No! He gets it all wrong-again. Wheelan makes the following claim on p.157 of his book:\\"The government can use fiscal policy-spending,tax cuts,or both-to \\" fine tune\\"the economy[.This] was the central insight of John Maynard Keynes...\\".In fact,Keynes was a life long opponent of such a policy.Nowhere in the General Theory(1936) or in any of the 30 volumes of the Collected Writings of John Maynard Keynes(CWJMK) will any support be found for Wheelan's wild claim.In volume 27 of the CWJMK,pp.225-410 contain Keynes's arguments against such a policy (which were being advocated by later Nobel Memorial prize winner James Meade)are covered for the 3 years 1942-1943-1944 in England.What was Keynes's solution ? It is the same solution as given by Adam Smith-maintain low,fixed rates of interest permanently in the long run and cut off all bank loans to projectors,prodigals,and imprudent risk takers so that their leveraging behavior is prevented.This will prevent the formation of bubbles whose collapse causes major negative externality effects .Wheelan needs to correct these errors, as well as a number of other mistakes,in a future edition."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Finding good, politically unbiased and balanced econ books for the general reader and beginner isn't easy these days, since so many of the issues have become so polarized, but Wheelen keeps the political cant and rant to a minimum, so this is a good place to start. His explanations are clear and concise, well written, and often humorous.I have a special interest in monetary theory and also international economics, which is the area where many economists think that economics puts its best foot forward, because of the theory of comparative advantage, and I enjoyed the discussions of these areas. In fact, since we're on the subject, I thought I'd discuss the monetary issues a bit more here, since they can be puzzling, although some of what I include here is info not specifically from the book, but perhaps it'll be useful, since if you understand the following, you'll actually have most of the important ideas on this interesting and important and often paradoxical economic area.Basically, the question is what really is the value of money in a country's economy, and how do fluctuations in the value of the currency and the amount of the currency in circulation affect the overall economy? That might seem simple at first, but consider the following.You may know the story of the hyperinflation that occurred in Germany in the post-WWII years. Germany was saddled with some serious war debts and reparations, and so the government started printing money in order to pay them off. There's even some suspicion that they did this deliberately in order to pay them off faster with inflated dollars, which royally annoyed the French, who were basically getting stiffed. Very sneaky, if true. And clever--if you can make it work. However, it's also very risky, because there are few things more ruinously inflationary than the government printing money, and eventually those pigeons usually come home to roost, which they did in the case of the German economy with a vengeance. So the situation got out of control, and soon it almost took wheelbarrows full of money to buy a loaf of bread.However, the most interesting thing is how the German monetary authorities stopped the hyperinflation and got things back to normal. What they did was start buying back the worthless paper Deutschemarks with gold. This reduced the supply of Marks, and when people saw that they could get real gold for the paper money, they cashed in in droves. Eventually, the German Deutsche Bank, basically their Federal Reserve, pulled enough money out of circulation to get the inflation under control.This brings up the interesting question of whether one needs gold backing for your currency. Well, in the modern world, it's no longer necessary, since countries like Japan have very little gold backing for their currency, and yet the Yen is one of the so-called \\"hard currencies.\\" Contrast that with the former Soviet Union, which at least in the past had a lot of gold backing for their currency, and yet it wasn't worth much. What really determines the value of your currency in the modern international economy is it's value on the international monetary exchanges, which is basically what people will pay to buy it in order to buy your goods and exports and so on, and to do business with you, not how much gold backing it has.But getting back to the German situation, something very similar happened here back in the early 80s when the prime interest rate hit 21%, because the government was printing money due to the Vietnam war and the deficit spending of the late 60's and 70's. With that level of inflation per year, funny things start happening. For example, it's in the interest of capital-intensive industries or businesses requiring large on-hand inventories--such as retail stores or firms selling big-ticket equipment items and so on--to buy as much inventory as possible on credit, and then to pay the debt off with increasingly inflated dollars, which reduces your overall cost--essentially, not so different from what the Germans were doing.This might sound strange since you're talking about the \\"price\\" or cost of money and how inflation affects it, but inflation has the interesting effect of making future money payments less expensive to the borrower, so they have a vested interest in loading up on goods on credit and then paying it off over time. The longer the horizon or loan term the better they make out as long as inflation continues.In other words, with inflation running at 21%, in two years, the business paying back the loan gets a 42% discount on their cost of capital, assuming the interest rate is fixed, which is usually the case in business loans or at least businesses with good credit. Of course, lenders such as banks and savings and loans know about these tricks but surprisingly, there's very little they can do to hedge and protect themselves. This is one reason so many savings and loans went out of business back in the 80's.Now all of this might make inflation sound like the ultimate economic evil, but actually, and here's another odd fact about monetary economics--the reverse situation is actually worse--which is known as deflation. Recessions usually don't go into serious deflation, but a real bona fide depression will. This is what is really happening in a depression.In the case of a serious depression or deflationary spiral, the money supply contracts to the point where the total amount of money circulating isn't enough to keep the economic wheels of the country greased and operating smoothly thru what is known as the bank reserve ratio and negative multiplier effect. In other words, there is a systemic shortage of liquidity. Unfortunately, this situation is extremely difficult to correct, much more so than the inflationary situation.That's because with interest rates falling and/or very low, no-one has any incentive to lend dollars since, as in the case during the Great Depression, banks get their money from private depositors, and with banks failing, and interest rates at almost zero, no one has any incentive to put the money in the bank if the bank might fail, or if the business that took out the loan could go bankrupt and fail, as many do during depressions. So people stuff it in the proverbial mattress. Hence, there's no money to lend, and so businesses which depend on loans and outside financing (which is about 99% of big and medium size businesses in the U.S.) can't get the money to operate and the economy grinds to a standstill. The government can even print all the money it wants, but nothing happens, since the prime lenders don't want to borrow the money at the so-called Federal Reserve Discount Window and pass it on to borrowers and risk losing it for some measly return and interest rate. In other words, the risk/reward ratio just isn't worth it.To give you a better perspective on this, I can give you a fascinating fact. The average person tends to think of the stock market as synonymous with the overall economy, because it gets all the press and publicity, and that's true to some extent, but the truth is the bond markets operating behind the scenes which get much less press and attention (well, bonds are pretty boring compared to stocks) are actually ten times the size of the stock market and have a much greater impact than even the stock market on the overall economy. With no money to lend for loans and bonds, the economy grinds to a stop, until someone like the government \\"primes the pump\\" to restart it, the policy mechanism that the great economist, John Maynard Keynes, became famous for explaining, among other things. That's what happened back in the 1930's, but we really had to wait for the huge government spending of WWII to turn the situation around.So during deflation, money is tight and scarce, but the value of the currency keeps going up--just the reverse of inflation. So those who have money have more than they had before. But since deflation causes serious unemployment and underemployment and poverty, most people don't have excess dollars, so they're still poor. So you just can't win. That's why economics is sometimes called \\"the dismal science.\\" :-)If this all sounds strange, just think of what happens with a resource or a commodity when there's a shortage of supply--such as with oil right now--it goes up in price, right? That's just normal supply and demand. Same thing in deflation. With a shortage in the supply of greenbacks, the value goes up just like in the case of any material good, except it's confusing to think of lots of money causing a lack of purchasing power as in the case of inflation, and a lack of money creating more purchasing power as in the case of deflation. In practical terms, the dollar's worth more--but no-one is spending them! Hence, paradoxically, money is worth more in a stagnant economy where no one has any incentive to spend it. You might wonder how something can be worth more when no one wants it, since, in most cases, what determines the value of something is the demand for it, but this is where monetary theory parts with normal intuition and common sense about how supply and demand should work, and that's just the way it is.Anyway, that's not a bad little summary of monetary economics. If you understand that you actually have most of the important points. As you can see, it's strange stuff in some ways, but fun once you get the hang of it since it is powerful and explains some puzzling issues."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"After taking several econ classes in college, hearing economic terms thrown around on the news and reading them in finance magazines, I finally feel like I have a good grip on them after reading this book.

Wheelan has a rare gift for taking a typically dry topic (in this case, economics) and making it lively, interesting, and often quite funny. Yes, there is an ideological perspective underlying the ideas in the book, but this perspective is itself an important feature of contemporary economic thinking (at least the thinking that's been most influential). Wheelan is a true teacher. And whether you agree with the book's perspective or not, you will come away much better informed and, in all likelihood, feeling entertained as well. Thank you, Mr. Wheelan, for helping me appreciate more fully the power of trade. I now see more clearly that it's not a zero-sum world out there, economically speaking. I'm not about to start voting Republican, but you've changed my mind about a few things!

This is for several reasons. The author writes very well and very clearly, he covers a lot of ground and concentrates on the Economic Institutions we are familiar with and explains them rather then being too abstract or theoretical.

Let's be honest: most economists are fairly conservative. When \\"Hard Heads, Soft Hearts\\" became less up-to-date (but still a fine book), our department started requiring Armchair Economics (pyuk) for the intro classes. What's great about this book is that it lets people think whatever they want to think. I love economics because it's about choice. Sure it may be more efficient to not incur deadweight losses through taxes, but, brother, I don't want to have to research foreign threats myself. This book points out that efficiency isn't the only thing; it is an important thing, but priorities are different for different people and these different priorities are not necessarily better or worse.In short, a great required text (as it is at our department now, on my, my brother's and our teacher's strong recommendations) for beginning courses and anyone who thinks economists are personally offensive."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Fantastic book, very highly recomended for anyone anywhere. Makes economics momentarily fascinating."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Some weeks ago I decided to start looking for an accessible \\"intro to economics\\" book that I could hand to friends and family. I read through the first third of Wheelan's \\"Naked Economics\\" and came to one conclusion: this book is not what I was looking for.What I expected based on the book's description was a work that followed an undergraduate macroeconomics 101 syllabus, but that explained the concepts using plain English and colorful anecdotes in lieu of graphs and mathematical equations. What I instead found was a politicized, point-by-point recitation of Democratic talking points that is constantly muddling economics with politics. Every chapter in the book follows this formula:1) Pay lip service to core economic, free market principles2) Cite an editorial from either the NY Times or The Economist-- he cites those two sources with so much exclusivity and frequency that it became a running joke to me as I was reading-- that backs a contemporary Democratic opinion3) Espouse the editorial's viewpoint by saying that \\"economists\\"-- implying economists at large of course-- think this view to be true\\"Intro to economics\\"? Not so much. \\"Editorialization\\"? Absolutely.Even the ordering of the chapters is suspicious; one would think the book would open with topics like supply and demand, the business cycle, unemployment, and inflation. Instead, the first chapters are about fringe concepts such as \\"asymmetric information\\", and why it's the government's role to incentivize behavior in all aspects of the economy, especially when it pertains to the environment (the author is a Democrat, and I wonder if environmentalism is a big reason why?).I stopped reading when he said that the \\"only\\"-- yes, he used the word \\"only\\"-- solution to health care problems in the United States was via an individual mandate (page 116, third paragraph). A five second Google search proved that statement to be incorrect. I could do the same for every chapter in the book:[...]All of this is a shame because the book does have redeeming aspects; many of its anecdotes and analogies are genuinely interesting. But the author should have stuck to economic principles exclusively, and then let his readers draw their own policy conclusions, rather than muddling the two together. What's more, I fear this editorilization may have been into an echo chamber as well; Wheelan brags for instance that Democrat Paul Volcker read the book (page 41, second paragraph)-- I would have been more impressed if Alan Greenspan had reviewed it as well.I'll continue my search for a truly accessible, introductory economics text that is purely about economics. But I'm starting to think that avoiding data and graphs while also maintaining political neutrality is a naive pipe dream; too tall of a task for most authors."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I think the title is a little misleading, whether you are interested in economics or not, this is a fascinating book.

I read it in one sitting, the highest compliment I can give any book."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"First, I'd like to say that this book MOSTLY does what author Wheelan set out to do -- to make the science of economics understandable and exciting to the average person without an advanced math degree. Wheelan does that, for the most part. He uses real-world (and recent) examples to illustrate economic principles. The first third of the book, I could not put it down.The only thing really that bothered me (and it is throughout the book, so I had to ding it two stars) is that the author mixes political views of people and issues that I think have no business being in an economics book. For example, he mentions having caddied on the golf course, notably for George W. Bush, &quot;before he became the mature leader he is today.&quot; I don't begrudge him his right to his opinion, but where does that comment belong in a book explaining economics? There are a number of people who question the maturity level of Bill Clinton, but I would not put that in an economics book! You would I think if Wheelan would have tried a little harder to be evenhanded -- certainly there are things to criticize on each side, but can we please leave the personal attacks out of it? -- I would have enjoyed the book more.Still, the book is good at explaining something I have always regarded as a foreign language."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"I think this authors understanding or the complexities of multiple variables is admirable, but his trust in the honesty of others research(especially global warming altered data as fact)and the belief that government can foresee most variables and improve (rather than hinder) mankind with most drastic economic intervention is extremely dangerous if taken at face value."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"This is a very good book on economics .

The author does a fine job of using humor to convey economic theory. He also provides much historic evidence to demonstrate various economic principles discussed in the book. There are plenty of books which serve as an intrduction to economics, this book however stands out because it is such an easy read. I recomend this book to anyone looking for a book to provide them with a basic understanding of economics without the work. Although he seems to have more of a neo-liberal approach to economics, I'm impressed that praises libertarian thinkers such as Friedman and Gary Becker as well as more keynesian type economists such as Krugman and Ackerlof. Most books on economists lack this balance.I think the author should have spent more time discussing supply side economics. He briefly discusses the laffer curve but immediately dismisses it as a failure. If you closely examine the Reagan tax cuts you will find the national deficit was caused by spending, not the tax cuts. The heavy tax cuts did not increase federal revenue but did stimulate the economy."},{"Title":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science","review":"Of course it is only January 5th today -- so Naked Economics is actually the best book I've read in over a year!I generally only post Amazon reviews if a book is either terrible or outstanding -- this book is definitely the latter. Outstanding, excellent, educational, informative, entertaining, funny, and impossible-to-put-down are just a few adjectives for it. It has opened my eyes and sparked my interest in a field I had heretofore thought boring, esoteric, and irrelevant. Charles Wheelan has masterfully showed how wrong I was. It is rare -- perhaps once a year or so -- that I read a book that alters the course and direction and outlook of my life... that every so slightly deviates my life line a bit in a new and refreshing way.

It is also a great book for those studying economics who want a better picture of how all the pieces fit together and many of the social issues associated with those pieces.

The gods, their names, their histories, their interactions with the world, and the impact of their actually existing is found in the flagstones the novel is built on, and the characters are able to walk around on these metaphorical flagstones with great confidence.After religion, I found the comedy of the novel, often based in light cynicism, to help lead me down through the pages toward the more important parts of the novel. Then, the heroic style drama comes to the fore, with the main character and the main supporting character getting into a lot of fairly serious trouble. The problems facing them mount and mount, I was afraid the story would literally cop-out at the end, but surprisingly, it doesn't and provides for a satisfactory conclusion (something sorely missed in many stories).Although there is another novel based on the viewpoint character, The Hunter's Haunt, it has nothing to do with The Reaver Road, which is a self-contained novel."},{"Title":"The Reaver Road","review":"An author who I feel is not really given the exposure he deserves in Europe, his books are near impossible to buy in the High Street Bookshops.

Duncan is truly one of the top modern day fantasy authors offering a smart alternative to the moody, darker side of the genre which seems to be the way most authors are going these days. Reaver Road is the first of his Omar books and sadly Omar only appears again in Hunters' Haunt; This is a typical Duncan read filled with sharp wit, a twisted plot and the expected surprise ending of Omar a teller of tall tales who seems to bring out the \`big fish that got away' story from everyone he meets. Another romping good read from an author who I am lucky enough to have nearly a complete collection from. I am unashamedly a huge fan of his books and have yet to read one that is less than top quality.If you call yourself a fantasy fan and are yet to sample his books, what's a matter with you?

And again, me being me, I needed to identify all the pictures when I got home which was difficult because, coupled with pictures from the Lourve and the British Museum, I had to identify well over 750 snapshots. That's when the Treasures of the Musee D'Orsay came in handy. Besides being a dandy coffee table book, it is chock full of photos from the museum's lovely pieces of art.We learn that the ground floor corresponds to the Second Empire in France with sculptures ranging from 1848 to 1870's. We also learn about and can view the masterpieces of the 1870's...Manet, Degas, Renoir, Monet and Cezanne all have displays. The museum's other popular areas hold work by: Vincent van Gogh, Gaugin, Seurat, and Toulouse-Lautrec. We also see Rodin, Munch, Mollard, and even \\"The Artist's Mother\\" (Arrangement in Grey and Black) by Whistler as shown in this book along with scores of other paintings. Now, if I will only take time to work on my slide show now that I have names to go with these works of art!"},{"Title":"Treasures of the Musee D'Orsay (Tiny Folio)","review":"This is a perfect overview of the Museum & will fit in your carry on."},{"Title":"Uzbekistan: Transition to Authoritarianism (Postcommunist States and Nations)","review":"This is not a book for someone who already knows a lot about Uzbekistan.

I say \\"slowly murdered\\" because his wife, Hajna, lived 33 excruciating days, before dying. His reason was that she was inattentive and did not seem to care about him, emotionally or sexually.The information conveyed above covers 28 pages of a 296 book. The rest of the book, Carolyn Anspacher's THE TRIAL OF DR. De KAPLANY, is about - unsurprisingly I guess - the trial of Dr. De Kaplany. The rest of the book is also for the most part boring.De Kaplany quickly admitted what he had done - not that he had much choice, having been arrested in his apartment surrounded by the bound and disfigured Hajna and a 2/3 empty bottle of nitric acid as well as two full pint bottles, one of hydrochloric and one of sulphuric acid. (Anspacher does not explore the reasons for de Kaplany's choice of acid. This is unfortunate as it may well have been more interesting than the rest of the book.)So the only question at trial was that of the doctor's legal sanity at the time of the murder, and, in the event he was found sane, whether his punishment would be life in prison or death.There are some relatively compelling segments of the trial dealing with various psychiatrists' evaluations of the doctor, but the rest of the testimony is uninteresting, and I often found it difficult to understand how some of it was relevant to the case at all.This, I believe, is due to Anspacher's style of writing, which, in addition to failing to make the book interesting, is kind of disjointedly choppy. This made the trial hard to understand, though in Anspacher's defense, it wasn't that interesting of a trial anyway. Of course this begs the question of why, if all she was going to do was paraphrase a trial transcript while offering shallow observations about the lawyers, jurors, and spectators, she chose to write about it in the first place.There are a few positives. The reader learns a lot about de Kaplany's life in Hungary, which was interesting, and in the U.S. through the testimony of the psychiatrists, and the short opening chapter detailing the crime and its aftermath is, if unremarkably presented, at least not boring.And finally the last third of THE TRIAL OF DR. De KAPLANY is eminently skimmable, which if someone were to choose to read this book - something I wouldn't recommend - could be considered a positive."},{"Title":"The Trial of Dr. De Kaplany (A Signet book)","review":"I picked up a copy of this book after seeing it on someone's \\"Favorite True Crime Books\\" webpage. I was really surprised I had never heard of Dr. De Kaplany prior to seeing that list. His crime, though committed back in 1962 before I was born, was gruesome enough and his defense was whacky enough that you'd think he'd be well known, at least among habitual true crime readers. He reminds me of a character out of a Hannibal Lecter film come to life.This book devotes one chapter to the crime and the rest of the book to a detailed retelling of the doctor's trial. In Chapter 1, Dr. Geza De Kaplany, a Hungarian immigrant anesthesiologist with impeccable credentials and a reputation as a Communist resistor, murders his beautiful wife of just a few weeks, Hajna, by burning off her skin with nitric acid and mutilating her with a knife. (The book contains pictures of the beautiful Hajna prior to this tragedy, but fortunately none of her afterwards, which is probably a blessing since the text descriptions are bad enough.) De Kaplany is caught red-handed right at the scene and all but admits he dumped acid on his wife to ruin her beauty after he heard she was seeing another man. De Kaplany proceeds to retain an attorney with almost no criminal law experience, who nevertheless manages to put on an OJ-quality defense that De Kaplany is schizophrenic, has latent homosexual tendencies, and has a split personality consisting of the \\"good\\" Geza and a \\"bad\\" alter ego named \\"Pierre La Roche\\", who purportedly was the one who actually killed Hajna. De Kaplany is found guilty but is spared the gas chamber and instead sentenced to life. The attitudes of people towards homosexuals (i.e. that being thought homosexual is about the worst thing for a man and can drive him to literally commit murder) and the mentally ill (schizophrenia is brought on by traumas including a rejecting mother, and includes an element of \\"split personality\\") are wildly out of step with today's thinking so De Kaplany's defense can be almost as unsettling as his actual crime.The book ends with the trial and sentencing, but research on the web into De Kaplany's later activities reveals that he became a model prisoner who was paroled in 1975 for good behavior and then left the country and is supposedly practicing medicine somewhere. Truly unbelievable. At least there are plenty of pictures of him (in 1962) in the book, so folks will have at least a vague idea which doctor to avoid!"},{"Title":"The Trial of Dr. De Kaplany (A Signet book)","review":"The Dr. had a very beautiful wife.

By far the best thing I've read this year, and something that I will continue to revisit over the years to come."},{"Title":"Eunoia: The Set (CD and Book)","review":"Christian B&ouml;k's Eunoia is becoming a fast hit among those with actual &quot;colored-letter&quot; synesthesia.Christian B&ouml;k based part of his ideas for Eunoia off the concept of synesthesia, mainly borrowing from Arthur Rimbaud's poem &quot;Voyelles&quot; (the strangely-colored cover design for the book is also based upon the same). In &quot;Voyelles&quot;, Rimbaud creates correspondences between colors and letters of the alphabet (or, more specifically, the written symbols - the graphemes) for vowels.Synesthesia is an actually existing, albeit rare, set of benign neurological conditions. Overwhelmingly, the most common (perhaps as common as existing in 1 out of every 750 people) form of synesthesia involves involuntary, automatic correspondences made between colors and graphemes (letter and number characters). This type of synesthesia is apparently genetically-based (that is, organic, and not psychologically based upon childhood associations), and usually emerges around the age of six or seven years of age. Those with &quot;colored-letter&quot; synesthesia generally maintain it throughout life, with virtually no variations in the color-letter correspondences. They have no choice as to which colors are associated with which letters and are stuck with the links throughout life. Also, each individual synesthete's total set of color-letter correspondences is unique, although there are certain trends to be found world-wide with certain graphemes, such as &quot;A&quot; being red and &quot;O&quot; being white or clear amongst about two-thirds of all such synesthetes.Rimbaud was not a colored-letter synesthete; he admits that he made up the correspondences in his (in-)famous poem.However, now, true colored-letter synesthetes are finding B&ouml;k's book either an overwhelming thrill or nightmare. To those without this form of synesthesia, the pages of B&ouml;k's book - each page using one and only one vowel for all words - glare with the profusion of the particular vowel. For the actual colored-letter synesthete, each particular page tends to totally overwhelm with a particular color. I have received letters from synesthetes writing in rapturous awe of how a certain chapter of Eunoia sweep them with the &quot;icy whiteness of O&quot;, or how it is a nightmare with simply too much red &quot;A&quot; (even though, to Rimbaud, &quot;A&quot; was supposed to be black) distracting from everything else.Sean A. Day, President, American Synesthesia Association"},{"Title":"Eunoia: The Set (CD and Book)","review":"As its author weaves his stories out of single vowels, Eunoia is imminently delightful but also rapidly tiring and gimmicky. It is more of a curiosity than a readable work. Its novelty wears thin after a few minutes, and while this oeuvre never strays from being a remarkable undertaking, my practical side also questions whether the effort on its creator's part was worth the finished product. Perhaps the biggest surprise to come from Eunoia was the sheer difficulty in reading through it. I found myself backing up and re-reading sentences for content, something I haven't done as often since elementary school. How nostalgic, huh? Eunoia is a curiosity but little more. I salute Christian Bok for his labor of love (or was it a labor of madness?) but I can't see Eunoia as a work of genius, merely a work composed of....a lot of work.That said, my five-minute poem of tribute to Bok:Alas, all day a lad's art lacks a fan's handclap andEnters the sleep these restless westerners she reveres here need---I find it icky, writings inWorn schoolbooks, known to hold good old story of:Sunup!

It demonstrates that a brainy game with language can be amusing to lots of people."},{"Title":"Eunoia: The Set (CD and Book)","review":"Eunoia is an amazing book - it is, to my mind, a book of poems in that the beauty of language is the focus more than the story.The first five chapters are each dedicated to a vowel (in alphabetical order), and each chapter only contains words containing that voewl and no other. What is more, the author has constrained the stories in other ways and used the majority of all words that he could use in the writing.After these five chapters there are other random experiments in language, such as the poem written only with the letters in the word \\"vowels\\".I am very glad I read this book. It was an amazing feat of language that took the author 7 years to write (and the only surprise was that he could complete it at all). On the downside it is not an easy read! The constraints of the book make the language hard going. There were words there I had to look up (and I generally don't have that problem).The mixture of words that in other works would be clearly pretentious with occasional gutter language also felt odd. Particularly in the \\"u\\" chapter, I was both impressed and dissapointed that the writer could describe sexual intercourse using just words with the \\"u\\" vowel - but imaginations will not run far as to which words he used. That rather sullied the beauty of the book in my opinion.Hard going it might be, but this was not a long book and it was very much worth the read. Anyone who loves language cannot help but be impressed by what is achieved here."},{"Title":"Eunoia: The Set (CD and Book)","review":"I substituted at a middle school a little while ago, and the teacher had left a lesson that involved reading and discussing a poem (it was \\"The First Book\\", by Rita Dove:Selected Poems) and then writing a \\"found poem\\", based on words that the students found around the room. I knew that I would have to sell it well for the lesson to have any chance. After we established, with only little confusion and resistance, the poem's message, I steered the discussion to the poem's poetic qualities. I tried to emphasize what made the poem a poem, which is hard sometimes when so much that is called \\"poetry\\" is simple fancy prose with irregular line breaks. So we talked about image, figurative language and double meanings, and I suggested, as I suggest with every class on the subject, that poetry is essentially playing with language.(I had had difficulty with a previous definition that had confounded a class of sophomores, that poetry \\"is words doing more that just meaning what they mean.\\" Try as they might some students couldn't repeat that sentence back to me. One was convinced that I had said that poetry \\"doesn't mean anything\\".)When it came time for the assignment to write a \\"found poem\\", I anticipated some resistance. They would certainly ask why they couldn't just write about anything they wanted. So I told them about Christian B&ouml;k, and I reminded them about \\"playing with language\\". Christian B&ouml;k wrote the book Eunoia, in which each of five chapters uses only one vowel, each in turn. The first page goes thus:Awkward grammar appalls a craftsman. A Dada bardas daft as Tzara damns stagnant art and scrawls analpha (a splapdash arc and a backward zag) that marsall stanzas and jams all ballads (what a scandal). Amadcap vandal crafts a small black ankh -- a hand-stamp that can stamp a wax pad and at last plant amark that sparks an ars magna (an abstract art thatcharts a phrasal anagram). A pagan skald chants a darksaga (a Mahabharata), as a papal cabal blackballs allannals and tracts, all dramas and psalms: Kant andKafka, Marx and Marat. A law as harsh as a fatwa bansall paragraphs that lack an A as a standard hallmark.In addition to that constraint, B&ouml;k requires that each chapter must refer to writing, a banquet, a \\"prurient debauch\\", a \\"pastoral tableau\\", and a \\"nautical voyage\\". Each must \\"accent internal rhyme through the use of syntactical parallelism\\", exhaust as much of the available lexicon as possible with minimal repetition, and avoid the letter y. To top it off, the E chapter is a retelling of the Iliad:The Iliad (Penguin Classics).The effect is fascinating. Far from limiting interest, B&ouml;k's syntactic limits heighten our fascination. We wonder how he will pull it off, and what the result will be. Furthermore, B&ouml;k does not ignore the importance of sound. Although he does indeed accent internal rhyme, the fact of the vowels themselves creates a distinct articulatory mood in each chapter. One would never think that somehow the letter u was so linked to the letter s in the English language, but try reading this out loud. The combination creates a phonetic pattern that reminds me somehow of a washing machine:Kultur spurns Ubu - thus Ubu pulls stunts. Ubu shunsSkulptur: Uruk urns (plus busts), Zulu jugs (plustusks). Ubu sculpts junk f&uuml;r Kunst und Gl&uuml;ck. Ububusks. Ubu drums drums, plus Ubu strums cruths(such hubbub, such ruckus): thump, thump; thrum,thrum. Ubu puns puns. Ubu blurts untruth: muchbunkum (plus bull), much humbug (plus bunk) - buttrustful schmucks trust such untruthful stuff; thusUbu (cult guru) must bluff dumbstruck numbskulls(such chumps). Ubu mulcts surplus funds (trustfunds plus slush funds). Ubu usurps much usufruct.Ubu sums up lump sums. Ubu trumps dumb luck.So, back to the middle school class. I asked who liked to do puzzles, and got a few hands. Some mentioned sudoku or crossword puzzles. I told them that what they were about to do was much the same thing, and much the same as Christian B&ouml;k had done: they were going to try to solve a puzzle and write a poem. They were going to play with words.They had five minutes to look around the room and write down any word they saw. I encouraged them to plan ahead, and consider what words might be useful. After that, they were limited to what they had written down (after the time expired, a few students who had been watching their peers run around the classroom and write down words found themselves in a bind because they \\"didn't realize that they were supposed to write down words\\"; this was middle school, after all). Once seated, many found that they couldn't write a \\"poem\\" with the words they had. It turned out that they were defining a poem as \\"something about how you feel, or about love or something.\\" I encouraged them to remember the sole criterion: playing with language. In the end, few students got beyond a sentence. One came up with something quite interesting, because she hadn't bound herself, as most had for some reason, to using each word only once. The repetition and inversion she employed was actually pretty novel and engaging. One small boy was very excited to read his poem to me--a freestyle rap the length of the page. He was disappointed to find out that that wasn't what he was actually supposed to be writing, but hey, at least he was writing.The innovation of new restrictions purely for their own sake, or if you would rather, for the sake of pushing poetic innovation to its limits, intrigues me. Writing in a form often feels much like doing a sudoku puzzle or a crossword, and is satisfying for the same reason, with the added result of--hopefully--a new image, phrase or idea that never would have been arrived at without the self-imposed restriction. I sometimes wonder what extremes could be attempted, like alpinists who having heard of a climber summiting Mt. Everest without oxygen bottles, feels the need to do the same backwards on a pogo stick. What if you wrote a poem using only adjectives? Or a sonnet in which each line could only have a specific number of words? Or a poem in which reduced its available letters by one every line? Or all of the above.John Fuller did something interesting along these lines. In response to a contest to write a poem using only three-letter words, Fuller decided to also write only in lines of three words and stanzas of three lines. Here is the result:\\"The Kiss\\"Who are youYou who mayDie one day?Who saw theFat bee andThe owl flyAnd the sadIvy put outOne sly arm?Not the eyeNor the earCan say Yes:One eye hasIts lid andCan get shy;One ear canRun out andOff the map.One eye canAim too lowAnd not hit;One ear canHug the air,Get too hot.But lip andRed lip areTwo and two,His lip andHer lip mixAnd are wed,Lip and lipCan now say:\\"You may dieBut not yet.Yes you dieBut not yet.\\"The old lie.Critic Jonathan Barker calls it a \\"metric invention in search of a subject\\". Poet James Fenton calls it \\"extremely beautiful\\". I would simply like to insist that a beautiful metric invention is in no way an oxymoron. And what do you know--Fuller's poem is even \\"about love or something\\", as the middle schoolers would have it.Note: John Fullers Collect Works from Chatto and Windus is not available from Amazon.

This brings us to &quot;Eunoia&quot;, a work of sublime mysticism and truly poetic lyricism. The project, shortly described and encapsulated is thus: To divide, into five chapters, words, forming sentences, containing only one vowel. The author, who will no doubt be considered pretentious by those unwilling to invest the time involved in appreciating his masterpiece, has placed additional restrictions on this composition.Did you find the dictionary a good read, but a bit dry in spots? Eunoia is the book for you. Designed to make a mockery of those who insist that a book must be intelligible, poetic, or at the very least worth the pulp it's printed on, Eunoia is a paean to the kind of people who attend Warhol's &quot;Empire&quot;, and claim to be deeply moved by it. That's right, the best use for Eunoia is bumph, doubly so if you've read it first. If you're reading the electronic edition, print out a copy for this purpose.Bok has taken pretense to new levels, nay to dimensions of superciliousness that defy the comprehension of your humble reviewer. Like a two-dimensional man attempting to describe a cube, I find this work to be offensive in more dimensions than I can clearly classify. My mind cannot readily assign depth to Bok's bottomless sense of his own accomplishment.In reality, this (apparently) seven year project reads as little more than a drunken bet between two pretentious authors carried to a degree that surpasses all reason or sense of proportion. This man has been eating, drinking, and breathing while good people starve and suffocate the world over. And what has he made from all this eating, drinking, and breathing? Carbon dioxide, fecula and other waste products -- including this book.If you've gotten tired of Dr. Seuss, and would like to see something that is less creative and less intelligible, help yourself.

The detail is beyond anything found in an anotomy book, and is essential information for understanding percutaneous absorption.There is a chapter that details the pharmokinetics of skin absorption. This is excellent reading for understanding the concepts and terms used in research (ie J Flux, etc).Later chapters discuss the differences between 'in vitro' and 'in vivo' experiments, and extrapolating animal models to humans.

Not quite worth the five star rating I have it when I was younger, but still a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Chemicals of Life","review":"Written in 1954, some of the material and current facts in this book are dated. However, Asimov is such a good expository writer that in most cases it does not matter. He covers the basics of proteins, vitamins and enzymes in such a lucid style that it is still possible to learn a great deal of the basics from this book. Since it is designed to explain the fundamentals of the complex chemicals of life and most of the advances since the writing are in the working out of the details, there are very few places where his statements are incorrect.Asimov starts with the structure of proteins, how they are built, their complex structure and how they act as catalysts throughout the human body. This is followed by explanations of vitamins, how they work, their structure and what happens when the body experiences a shortage. The final sections deal with hormones, where they are produced and how they interact to control the metabolism of the body.Fifty years after it was written, I can still recommend this book as a primer on the fundamental chemistry of the mammalian body. While many things have changed since then, the quality of the writing trumps nearly all of the obsolescence."},{"Title":"The Chemicals of Life","review":"Asimov does a good job describing the process of the human body's in take and use of chemicals. From the air we breath, the food we eat, the effect of sun on our skin (making Vitamin D) and many more. Step by step explaination. Some with diagram. All simplified and in a language a non-medical person can understand."},{"Title":"The Chemicals of Life","review":"Review of \`The Chemicals of Life' by Isaac Asimov.CITATION: Asimov, Isaac (1962). The Chemicals of Life (Signet Science Library). New York: New American Library of World Literature, Inc.Reviewer: Dr W. P. Palmer.The remarkable feature of this excellent book is that it was written more than half a century ago in an area noted for its rapid progress. The book was copyrighted in 1954 and published in a paperback Signet edition in 1962. It is an introduction to biochemistry and is thus an elementary treatment often defining the terms that will be useful in further study, so in general the basic concepts have changed little in the last fifty years. The book, 132 pages long, consists of ten chapters and an index.Chapter 1. The All-important ProteinChapter 2. Enzymes: Proteins that make hasteChapter 3. Enzymes and body chemistry.Chapter 4. Enzymes and digestion.Chapter 5. Enzymes and energy.Chapter 6. The friends and foes of EnzymesChapter 7. The B VitaminsChapter 8. Other VitaminsChapter 9. Protein HormonesChapter 10. Other HormonesOf course, using an old biochemistry book as the basis of current knowledge has considerable risks. For example, the index does not contain the words \`helix' or \`double helix'. Crick and Watson made their discoveries about the structure of DNA in 1953, so to Asimov writing this work at about the same time, the structure of DNA would have been the very latest research and not at all suitable as part of a beginner's guide. Now the structure of DNA would, in outline, be knowledge adapted to curriculum material for primary schools. Asimov, however, was a master of the art of teaching complex material in a simple way and the diagrams/ illustrations (the work of John Bradford) are extremely good. A good diagram is certainly worth a thousand words and they add immeasurably to this book.The book is thoroughly recommended as an example of good teaching in a complex area.BILL PALMER"},{"Title":"Demystifying Switched Capacitor Circuits (v. 1)","review":"Bought this book 3 wks ago while traveling in the Bay Area. The book , in my opinion, is well-structured and detail-oriented. The information presented in this book is current and mostly accurate. However, as the author himself has pointed out in the preface: The maths have been minimized, the fact of which seems both good and bad to me: The good thing is that the book is a simple and easy read; but the bad thing is that a few concepts are poorly explained, for example, the sensitivity of a switched-capacitor ladder filter seems delibrately avoided by the author in my view.Of course, there are quite a few positive points on the other side of the axis, such as the discussion on data converter's resolution in relation to speed and clock jitter, or the anatomy of a dc/dc multiple-gain converter, etc. Thus, despite a couple more disappointing aspects, on the whole, I rate this book a fairly good reference that is worth buying, and more importantly, worth reading/keeping."},{"Title":"Demystifying Switched Capacitor Circuits (v. 1)","review":"I bought this book here.

It is a good buy."},{"Title":"Demystifying Switched Capacitor Circuits (v. 1)","review":"I bought this book based on Amazon reviews soon after it was released. Looking back I see many of the positive reviews are dated prior to the book availability. How can people recommend a book they haven't read?I was very excited by the table of contents because the topics were exactly what I was looking for. However the author failed to deliver anything useful to gaining insight on the topics.Specific criticisms:1) The author writes in a rambling stream-of-consciousness style with no apparent direction for anything written.2) There are no detailed explanations; only the authors tips and generalizations.3) Equations given with no explanation of what the variables represent.4) Examples give answers contradictory to the math shown.5) Inconsistent notation.6) Descriptions include nodes that are not labeled on the schematics so the reader is left to guess what part of the circuit is being discussed.7) Large portion of book is MATLAB code with no documentation.This book demystifies nothing."},{"Title":"Demystifying Switched Capacitor Circuits (v. 1)","review":"The book is full of circuit design examples and real-world stuff on analog/mixed-signal switched-capacitor circuit design.

Hence, this book presumes its audience's command of circuits, semiconductor devices, IC fabrication, signal processing, and control systems, in addition to their access to software tools such as Matlab. (Scilab can do the work, too--for free.)Material covered in this book is necessary AND sufficient to realize reliable switched-cap circuits. With academic rigor, the author circumscribes the limitations of each result he offers, directing interested readers to references rather than straying from scope. By doing so, he remains credible while, at once, effortlessly on-topic. (I dare readers to try to remove the extraneous sentences.) As a bonus in a technical book aimed at a small audience, editing standards embodied herein exceed my highest expectations.You won't waste your money here."},{"Title":"Demystifying Switched Capacitor Circuits (v. 1)","review":"As a circuit designer, I am curiously anticipating the releasing of this book. I read a few technical articles that this author published in some magazines focusing on IC design, and I liked them very much.

Most of them have been re-issues of very popular stories from the past, sometimes of two different authors, sometimes two stories by the same author. This new edition, however, with two stories by Sandra Heath, takes the previous concept one better&#65533;one old 'beloved' story (indeed!) and one new one. What a perfectly splendid idea.A successful Regency novel may have many ingredients. Among the plot elements are: love at first sight, love unrequited, marriage of convenience, mistaken identity, wealthy marrying not-so-wealthy (either sex in each category) and titled personage marrying a commoner. Necessary characters are a handsome hero, a winsome heroine, a charming pair of secondary characters, of the same sterling quality as the main pair, and at least one villain or villainness of superlatively menacing manner. A pet or two certainly adds to the mix. Finally, the writing must be better than good, preferably careful to the times depicted, free of anachronisms, and hopefully with an abundance of wit.It's hardly a secret that I find these quantities to be present in the works of many of today's authors, but most especially prevalent in the works of Sandra Heath. Her newest title, FINE FEATHERS, is no exception, and neither is the older book&#65533;THE MAKESHIFT MARRIAGE&#65533;that Signet has paired with it as their current two-fer. (I love this concept: I hope it continues forever!)The two Miss Marriots in the first story&#65533;cousins Margaret (known as Molly) and Delphine&#65533;provide nothing but trouble for the twelfth Earl of Bardolph, Rupert Drysden, and believe me, no one is more deserving of such a fate. Eventually, after a near-kidnapping, an unsuccessful switch of look-alike racehorses, and a severe case&#65533;or two&#65533;of mistaken identity, all ends well. The Earl is vanquished and indeed banished from England by the cleverness of the hero Hal Cordrey, a widower and wealthy landowner, as well as magistrate for the area. The wealthy marquess ends up with Margaret, while Delphine secures the love of her life, Neville Botting, curate of Coln Cordray.Set in Gloucestershire, in and around the then famous Bibury Club Races at Seven Downs, the lush June setting comes alive by the wondrous descriptive passages by the author.THE MAKESHIFT MARRIAGE, on the other hand, is much more complex (as well as nearly twice as long) and demonstrates in very subtle fashion, the consistency of the author in writing style, research and character development. First published twenty years ago, The Makeshift Marriage has remained atop the favorites list of many devoted Regency readers, which is no mystery whatever. Whether reading it again, or for the first time, the story is satisfying in every possible way.When Miss Laura Milbanke splurges her entire small inheritance for a dream trip to Venice, she has no idea that her life will take a drastic turn-about. She'd seen a picture of the famous Hotel Contarini, and had dreamt of little else since then. Anticipating a lifetime of boring service, she believes the trip will provide dreams enough for a lifetime. In short order, she meets two gentlemen: the Englishman Sir Nicholas Grenville, and the Austrian Baron Frederick von Marienfeld. After Laura spurns his advances, the Baron challenges Nicholas to a duel. In spite of her protests, Nicholas proceeds, and is later brought back to the hotel, nearing death.Even though he is certain to die, Nicholas asks Laura to marry him, and somewhat reluctantly, she agrees. However, Laura is a faithful and caring nurse, and so they return to England and his Somerset estate, King's Cliff.While Laura had traveled to Venice to live out a dream, Nicholas traveled to get away from his home, and ponder the necessity of killing a dream. For centuries, King's Cliff has been an opulent host to royalty and other aristocrats; ruinously so. Now, if the estate is to continue at all, severe changes must be made, and unable to think clearly at home, he'd come to Venice to think.With the care of Daniel Tregarron, the local physician-as well as an old friend-Nicholas slowly gains back his health, only to discover even more danger&#65533;in his own household. More in love with the house than its new owner, his former fiance&eacute;, Augustine Townsend, has no patience with illness or anything that comes between her and her dreams. She flitters between Nicholas and his heir, who is also his cousin, James, the earl of Landford, who has his own dreams.If you like terrific plotting, excellent writing, and perceptive character development, all combined with descriptions that take you to the very scene, you'll certainly enjoy THE MAKESHIFT MARRIAGE. It's a classic for all time."},{"Title":"Fine Feathers And The Makeshift Marriage (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Fine Feathers I found to be only so-so. It started out well, but soon began to drag with needlessly long and uninspired descriptions. Those were easily skimmed, however. What really rankled was the suddenness of the couple's \\"love\\" for each other. I refer not to love at first sight, which can be well done, but to the leads' lack of positive interaction. They think ill of each other, but each suddenly realizes he/she is in love. Heath fails to make it believable. Hal is quite intelligent and Molly is game enough, but this reader never bought into the relationship. The \\"mystery\\" overshadowed the romance anyway, and it was only mildly interesting. Too often the characters acted stupidly and the events were just too convenient. The constant repeition of the phrase \\"fine feathers\\" was highly annoying. The actions of the characters too often were out of sink with the time period. Two stars.The Makeshift Marriage is by far the better of the too works in this book. The characters are well-conceived, is sometimes too obvious. I was, though, highly disappointed in the doctor; he could have been written in a more noble light with the result that both he and the book would have benefitted from a more emotional and difficult decision. The book is best early on, in Venice and when they first return to London, but it remains interesting throughout. My biggest criticism of the book is its too rapid conclusion. Laura and Nicholas needed more time to turn their misunderstandings around, or at least an epilogue to show the results of it. A more minor criticism is that Nicholas' recovery seemed to drag on too long. However, The Makeshift Marriage is a much better novel than Fine Feathers and deserves to be read. After FF, I hesitated to read TMM, but am glad I did so. Four stars."},{"Title":"Long liner fox trapping: Volume I","review":"Great instruction, skill improves incredibly, well beyond book 1.

Maine novelist Van Reid now has published a series of his comic, sweet novels, each more pleasurable than the last, featuring Tobias Walton and his companions Ephram, Eagleton and Thump. His most recent offering, Daniel Plainway: Or the Holiday Haunting of the Moosepath League, is the perfect Christmastime or winter fireside book. Woven with so many pleasurable amiable asides and subplots, the main story about a kidnaped boy and ancient Norse writings seems almost an afterthought. To take one example, Walton, whom Reid describes as \\"himself a pearl, and good things did seem to surround him\\", starts the novel losing his hat in a sudden wind; the peregrinations of that topper itself, and the goodwill it seems to bear from its owner, flow delightfully through the story. In another delightful scene, Reid waxes rhapsodically on the perfect qualities of snow for snowballs, leading to a delightful snowfall fight involving the novel's heros, villains, and local youngsters. A particularly pleasurable turn for me, a former classicist, is that the interpretation of the writings depends on hearing the Greek spoken in a seemingly nonsensical English phrase, \\"she'll bust her feeding.\\" Although always lighthearted, Reid's novel is not without serious purpose, as expressed in the dialogue as to whether \\"there are so many people in the world willing to drive tragedy\\" or whether \\"there are as many, more, really, who are willing to put things right.\\" In Reid's world, those who good-heartedly \\"put things right\\" - most especially the comical Moosepath League - predominate. I finished his book with a fair certainty that the same prevailed in my own place and time."},{"Title":"Daniel Plainway: Or The Holiday Haunting Of The Moosepath League","review":"'Daniel Plainway' is the third foray into the adventures of The Moosepath League for Van Reid, following 'Cordelia Underwood' and 'Mollie Peer'. If you have not read those volumes, do so now.In this episode, the charter members of The Mossepath League encounter their alter egos in the form of the Dash-it-All Boys, while the other members of the league match themselves against a secret society, obsessed with discovering lost Viking riches, known as the Broumnage Club.These adventures, however, are once again woven into the fabric of the continuing story of Bird, a small boy whose story has been heretofore a mystery, in great Van Reid style. That is to say brilliantly. Reid's talent for intertwining story threads is unmatched by any author in my eclectic library, and it is a singular pleasure to find recurring, peripheral characters scattered about the pages of 'Daniel Plainway', as well as 'Mollie Peer'. When these characters appear, it is sometimes to deliver a funny anecdote or story, or to be merely a small participant in an ongoing conversation; and whether identified by name, or left for me to surmise their identity myself, I always feel like a participant in an inside joke.I would love to apprise you as to the identity of Daniel Plainway, or hint at how he is connected to young Bird, but I feel I would be diminishing your reading pleasure, not enhancing it. The best turn I could do for you, in regards to this review, is stress upon you the joy you will have in reading Van Reid's chronicles of The Moosepath League, starting with 'Cordelia Underwood', then 'Mollie Peer' and ending with 'Daniel Plainway'.I feel confident when you are finished with this trio, you will be anticipating the fourth installment in this saga as eagerly as I am."},{"Title":"Daniel Plainway: Or The Holiday Haunting Of The Moosepath League","review":"if, like me, you're a bit plugged up from reading irvine welsh, noam chomsky, dave eggers, etc. van reid's &quot;daniel plainway&quot; might just do the trick.i picked this up on a whim and afterward was scared i had gotten myself into something that was going to be a bit &quot;precious and old-people-y&quot;, though i held on to a glimmer of hope due to the fact that &quot;the onion&quot; had read and liked the book.in the end i couldn't put the thing down -- partly due to the author's way of jumping from storyline to storyline on a chapter by chapter basis, but mainly due to the fact that it was a delightful read. it reminded me more than a little bit of a rural american sherlock holmes adventure (the story is set in 1890s maine), but with tongue planted firmly in cheek (never irritatingly so though).i won't divulge any details of the storyline, but i will say that i thought the book peaked about 2/3 in (when all the various threads finally came together) and after that it slowed down a bit. not bad, but perhaps mildly disappointing after such a fantastic build-up. one other point of note: if like me, you find yourself wanting to read the first two books in the series after finishing this one, you'll realise you've been given too many spoilers about book 2. will this affect your enjoyment of book 2? dunno. i haven't started that one yet... but i know how it ends.i don't think you can go wrong with this one. regardless of your age or interests, a bit of good clean old-time book reading fun is coming your way."},{"Title":"Daniel Plainway: Or The Holiday Haunting Of The Moosepath League","review":"This is the third in the Moosepath series of books by Van Reid and it maintains his exemplary standard of good writing and is a delight.

It follows on from the previous novel Mollie Peer although this story is complete and can stand on its own; but if I you intend to read Mollie Peer (and I recommend it most hightly) it would be best to read this novel after Mollie Peer or you will know what happens in Mollie Peer. This really is good wholesome storytelling at its best - not a watered-down-to-not-offend wholesomeness; but a rich, life-affirming novel of loveable characters in a rollicking laughter-filled old-fashioned tale that will bring tears of joy and sadness.

Albert Campion doesn't really fit into the Sixties scene with its Mods and Rockers, but this is a must-have for the serial detective's fans.For one thing, it is a vast improvement on the previous novel, \\"The Mind Readers\\" (Campion #18 - 1965) where the author made an unfortunate essay into science fiction. Campion, who had been fading out of his own series in favor of Scotland Yard Superintendent Charles Luke, makes something of a comeback in \\"Cargo of Eagles.\\" Of course, it is his last hurrah, although Youngman Carter wrote two more Campion novels on his own, after his wife's death from breast cancer in 1966.\\"Cargo of Eagles\\" takes place in the marshy English village of Saltey--a town that time tried to forget, but couldn't. The villagers, many of whom are part-time pirates and smugglers turn a suspicious eye on newcomers, especially a beautiful young doctor who inherited a house from one of her deceased patients. The doctor begins to receive poison pen letters before she even visits her new house, and when she finally does venture to Saltey, one of the first things she discovers in her inherited home is the body of her solicitor.Is his death somehow connected with rumors of buried treasure, or has it got something to do with the bands of motorcyclists now swarming through Saltey? Campion and his new sidekick, an American history professor attempt to sort out the acts of random violence from those that are directly connected to a pirate's treasure that went missing during the second world war.Here is a complete list of the Campion novels that Allingham wrote. There are also short story collections and Campion novels that were written by her husband, Youngman Carter, which I didn't include in this list.1.

It's a close-knit , rather unfriendly place, and the best entertainment can be found in the local pub by buying a local a pint and let him reminisce about the old smuggling days and the \\"Saltey Demon\\" - whatever that might be. We're in the 1960s here, a time when Mods and Rockers (scooter and motorcycle gangs) were wreaking havoc in seaside resorts. It reminds me of my childhood days at the beach - I can almost taste the Lyons Ice Cream and hear my mother saying that the tea is like dishwater.Into this setting steps the unlikely figure of Albert Campion. Margery Allingham created him as an affable, well-spoken young man in 1928 - but ,unlike some other authors, she sensibly aged him as the decades went past, so he's now in late middle-age.When he was a young man he had a deceptively foolish appearance, and that is one thing that hasn't really changed:\\"Those that disliked him complained that he seemed negligible until it was just too late\\"Campion is carrying out an investigation which doesn't have any official support. He seems to be quite disillusioned about the government and the powers-that-be. In fact one of his allies says:\\"Good God, Albert, how out of date I sound. But it would be pleasant to retire knowing that one had slipped a final fast one past the New Establishment. I do not love it's silly face\\"(Campion's reply is \\"Ora pro nobis\\" i.e. \\"pray for us\\")Allingham spent most of her life on the edge of the Essex marshes and so it's not surprising that she gets the details right - Saltey certainly feels like a real place. The nearby underdeveloped area she calls the Trough more or less exists in real-life as the Essex Plotlands. If you think any of the goings-on in the novel are a bit unlikely, they are not as unlikely as the \\"Barling Bomber\\" of a few years ago who prevented a building from being completed and was never caught.This isn't the greatest of the Campion novels but is definitely worth reading. The plot is pretty good and the setting is well-realised. A suitable read , perhaps, for a trip to the seaside on a cold day."},{"Title":"Cargo of Eagles","review":"Margery Alllingham died while writing this book. It was finished by her husband, Philiip Youngman Carter, an artist and her lifelong collaborator -- and it's none the worse for that. It's got atmosphere by the bucket: the ragged edges of London that merge into noman's lands of forgotten buiding developments and old rubbish heaps, ending in a scruffy little seaside village haunted by kids on motorbikes. Lugg likes it so much he's planning to have a bungalow built there, and an American historian is fossicking around out of love for a young doctor who has inherited a house there. And why is a once-promising poet living there in obscurity? Campion co-opts the historian to help in a mysterious mission and the plot thickens. Sadly the two Campion novels Youngman Carter wrote after Allingham's death are not up to scratch, though the one that isn't Falcon (sorry I've forgotten the title) has just a touch of her elegiac poetry. Elegiac poetry in a mystery writer? Read her and find out."},{"Title":"Cargo of Eagles","review":"Enjoyable Allingham swansong. Has a melancholy air which contributes to the books success. Plenty of characters and action, at times it doesn't seem to be going anywhere, but it does. The solution is satisfying and effective."},{"Title":"Cargo of Eagles","review":"Cargo of Eagles was finished after Margery Allingham's death by her husband Youngman Carter, who apparently completed it based on notes that Allingham left behind. Sadly, the last of the original series (if you count this one because Allingham started it) leaves a lot to be desired. I think it suffers from too many tangents leading to a bit of tedium for the reader. I found myself wanting to just get through it (which is really sad, if you think about it for a minute). The basic plot was good, but it took SO long to get to a resolution that at the end I actually didn't care about it.Brief decription, no spoilers: The small village of Saltey captures the interest of quite a few characters: a doctor who has recently inherited a house from a near stranger; an American historian who is spending a year in Britain doing research on approaches to London in the 17th and 18th centuries; several motorcycle gangs, and some unsavory characters as well. Saltey used to be home to smugglers and pirates, and at one time was \\"visited by a demon.\\" Now it seems it is also home to a murderer who has a secret to keep -- but it's one that Campion must figure out to help solve his own secret mission.I would recommend it probably to people who are working on finishing the series, but likely not to others. It normally doesn't take me long to finish one of these novels, but this one was just not up to par with most of the other books in the series."},{"Title":"The great captains","review":"I bought this book in hopes of reading a more realistic portrayal of the Celtic Cheiftain Arthur.

I've always been fascinated by that faraway red island of Afro-Indonesian culture, lemurs, and chameleons. Since I'd read a number of good books about the place, none of which had extraordinary pictures, I thought this book would be an excellent addition to my small collection. I thought wrong.While I have to admit that Mr. Barbieri is an excellent photographer, with long experience in the world of fashion, I took strong objection to his way of portraying Madagascar. Some magnificent photographs of the world of nature, some portraits, and a few pictures of unusual objects are interspersed with what can only be described as homo-erotic photographs. I have nothing against that either, a Mapplethorpe is a necessary part of modern culture. What I DO object to is such photographs being in any way called \\"a picture of Madagascar\\" with absolutely no personal agenda mentioned. This is totally dishonest. Thus, this is a very dishonest book. Producing self-indulgent romantic fantasies is fine if the audience is aware of what is being done, but to pass off such stuff as being \\"about\\" a poor country inhabited by hospitable, cheerful people with intricate customs and traditions, people who are extremely modest in dress and behavior for the most part---this is an exercise in exploitation. At the very least we should have been told how these pictures were made. In colonial times, many writers and artists produced romantic works about far off colonies. These were then used to show how \\"happy and contented\\" the people were under colonial rule. In the introduction, reference is made to Paradise ! Give me a break ! What is the agenda here ? If someone says, \\"Come on, man, it's just a great collection of pictures.\\" then they have failed to grasp the cultural dialogues of the last 40 years, they cannot see how people with technology and media access can so easily exploit those without. I absolutely don't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Madagascar","review":"Barbieri's book is full of stunning photos that obviously exploit the Malagasy. Sadly, he does the Malagasy people no justice whatsoever. This poverty-stricken population isn't always this serious; they are some of the most soulful, hopeful people I have ever met and have gorgeous, smiling eyes and faces. The DIS-service Barbieri does them is because he didn't do his homework. If he had, he would have found out a)they are Malagasy, not Madagascan and b)their beauty is best portrayed in natural settings, not ridiculous, dramatic poses. Remember, however, that this is a &quot;coffee-table&quot; book, not the news; the truth is a very different story. I'm curious as to whether the other reader/reviewer has been to Mad, or are her/his views the result of political correctness? Was s/he serious about the fashion model comment?

Lots of men, some women and children lounge about in apparent luxury. Unfortunately in portraying them in this way Barbieri glamourises a way of life which might not be so glamourous for the participants. A shot of a graphite miner coated in dust, for example, makes him look heroic and beautiful. But, in reality, who wants to lead a life coated in dust down a mine?

Chapter 1, page 1 starts with &quot;Thosecompanies that succeed at new product dvelopment are the futureMercks, HPs, 3Ms, and Microsofts; those companies that fail to excelat developing new products will invariably disappear or be gobbed upby the winners. .....&quot;. Despite this quite promising catchphrase you will not find a single word on how the above mentionedcompanies develope new products.Things actually get worse. What youwill find in this book are random generated case studies on variousportfolio models the authors encountered in the few firms willing tomeet them - no theoretical framework is given on portfolio management,criteria to be included and best practices in various industries.Asa major disappointment I found the fact that not a single case/bestpractise study came from the pharmaceutical industry and the softwareindustry, those industries where portfolio management/selection are atthe very heart of the strategic management process. It would have beena huge (and logical) opportunity to cover in this book how Merck orPfizer steer their new product development processes. But don\`t lookfor clues to this questions in this book. The case studies you willfind in this book are about a small Canadian bank, a small US chemicalcompany, and about Hoechst US.

It helps to getan idea of what effective portfolio management should do - and thesepoints are very agreeable indeed (e.g. value creation, balance,strategic fit). That these questions are inadequeately and onlyempirically adressed in this book, is a source of frustration for itsreaders. I would give only a very very weak recommendation for thisbook....databaseU"},{"Title":"Portfolio Management For New Products: Second Edition","review":"The purpose of this book is to provide the reader with an actionable approach for implementing a product-oriented project portfolio management process which corporate leaders can use to ensure that the organization's portfolio delivers value, is balanced, and is aligned with strategy.While the book addresses product-oriented projects, it seems well suited to limited generalization to aid the non-product based project portfolio.The ThesisThe authors state that a portfolio process is key to success since projects operationalize strategy. To determine how well organizations manage their product project portfolio, they evaluate leader satisfaction with the process the organization uses along six metrics:* Projects aligned with business's objectives* Portfolio contains very high value projects* Spending reflects the business's strategy* Projects are done on time (no gridlock)* Portfolio has good balance of projects* Portfolio has right number of projectsWhile I think this is a good list for any project portfolio manager to begin using, I note that this survey is simply a ranking of leader satisfaction with leaders in organizations which use portfolio management. The authors did not try to link leader satisfaction with business success. It is difficult to prove that portfolio management led to business success, but one might assert that a measure of portfolio management on business is not fair because what one is really measuring is strategy success. The goal of portfolio management then might be stated as alignment with strategy, not business success. I think an organizational survey asking senior leaders to rank satisfaction along the six metrics might be interesting - how many of the questions can they answer at all? Presumably, knowing the answers and being dissatisfied with them might be better than not knowing the answers.Actionable InformationThis book is well organized and appears well researched. This is not surprising given that it was written by academic professionals. What is a little surprising, given the authors' profession, is that is so thoroughly action-oriented. The authors never seem to loose sight of the fact that if portfolio management is to help an organization it must be implemented. Over and over again, they point out pitfalls, limitations, cautions, and implementation steps for overcoming these. I expect to use this book often to fill in the gaps in other approaches, leaning heavily on the best-practice implementation suggestions they authors recommend in suggestions tailored to specific goals.Among the useful, researched insights was this one: \\"Those businesses that use financial models as the dominant portfolio selection method end up with the poorest-performing portfolios!\\" (p 169). One reason for this (in product portfolios) is that the sophistication of the financial tools exceeds the quality of the predictive value data. Conversely, businesses that rely principally on strategic models outperform the rest. Allocating resources to strategic areas seems to work well, and we are reminded that \\"strategy begins when you start spending money\\" (Ibid).ConclusionMany books are over-blown magazine articles. This is not one of those books. The authors did a lot of plain hard work bringing this book together and it shows. They authors never forget that someone must sell the notion of portfolio management to senior leaders, then provide them with specific, relevant and actionable information to make difficult and important project decisions with strategic impact. I appreciate the fact that the authors frequently provide suggestions on how to keep thinks simple, starting small and scaling sophistication as processes are prototyped, then refined and adapted in specific organizations.There is a possible limitation in how appropriately one may generalize these approaches to non-product-oriented project portfolios. This book does such a good job talking about project portfolio management that the reader can forget at times that the book is about product project portfolio management. It may be that some of the research findings do not apply or cannot be generalized with validity to other types of project portfolios. The reader should keep his grain of salt handy. However, there are still too few project portfolio management books available, especially books based on research, so this is a very useful reference. By way of balance, it does not seem too far a stretch to use this book for other, non-product project portfolio management since the aim of the process is to align projects with strategy, obtain high value from projects, and obtain a balanced portfolio of projects. These are good goals for any portfolio, and organizations are free to define and measure dimensions however they wish.Possibly the highest compliment I can pay the authors is to say that having read the book, my copy is full of underlined passages and pages encumbered with sticky-notes. This book will not gather much dust on my shelf - at least not for quite some time."},{"Title":"Portfolio Management For New Products: Second Edition","review":"Edgett, et al provide an easy to read summary of their research findings on how various companies conduct portfolio management.

The first two chapters are the introduction chapter where the authors go over their research on portfolio management and try to convince the reader that portfolio management is a really good idea. In the second chapter they define the three goals for portfolio management: maximizing value, link to strategy and balancing the portfolio.The next three chapters three looks at different portfolio management techniques for the three different goals. Chapter three looks at the value side and draws some rather interesting conclusions. I liked the examples of how different companies work. The fourth chapter looks at the balancing part and spends most of its time on the bubble diagrams and how/why to make them. The fifth chapter then covers the link with strategy and how to make sure the products in your portfolio are aligned with the companies strategic goals. The sixth chapter was almost a summary of the previous three and looks at how to combine them and which methods are best.Chapter 7 and 8 seems kind-of \\"in between chapters\\". Seven covers some of the challenges related to portfolio management and chapter Eight covers data integrity. Some points made related to the reliability of the data are good and valid, though the recommendations for increasing data validity were weak.The last part talked about the actual portfolio management process. First it looks at the high level, the strategy level and how to make the decisions there. Next it looks on the business unit specific level and especially talks about the relationship between portfolio management and a stage-gate process. The last chapter of the book is the \\"change\\" chapter which gives hints about how to implement portfolio management in your organization.The book surprised me, though I had low expectations, so it might have been easy. It was thorough on techniques and gave lots of case examples. It discussed several advantages and disadvantages, which I enjoyed.Though! I do think there were also some serious problems with this book. First of all, its way too big. It repeats and repeats and requires too much words. The whole book could be 1/3rd of the current size and then it would still cover all the topics. I hate this since I rather read a tense 100 page book than a fluffy 350 page book. Next, I was extremely annoyed by the authors self-promotion for their services and their products. At times, I felt I was reading a Cooper marketing brochure instead of a book on portfolio management.But, by far, the biggest problem is that I felt the books was very traditional. It talks about command-control hierarchical way of working in an organization. It makes lots of assumptions about the role of senior management, the role of strategy and budgeting. I know, this is a fact of life in most organizations, but still... some more insight in modern organizations would have been nice.Overall... I enjoyed the book. I was thinking about a rating between three and four stars. It's definitively not a five-star book due to the mentioned drawbacks. I decided to go for four because, at this moment, I do not know a better book on this subject. Recommended to read for those who do not mind about the mentioned drawbacks."},{"Title":"Portfolio Management For New Products: Second Edition","review":"I find Robert Cooper to be a bit grandiose in all of his publications in his conclusions from various studies (including his own) and thus you have to take them with a grain of salt. However, this book is very good in showing lots of different ways of approaching the problem of portfolio management. You can be assured that the right answer is different for every company, so read how others have done it and decide which version or hybrid may be right for you."},{"Title":"Portfolio Management For New Products: Second Edition","review":"I'd highly recommend this book to anyone establishing and/or revising a portfolio management process.

Cooper, Scott J. Edgett and Elko J. Kleinschmidt, wrote this book. The good news is that they really know their stuff; the less-than-great news is that they write like, well, professors. The book is hampered by academic prose, qualifiers, tangents and a scholarly, if balanced, reluctance to commit completely to most propositions. We find that readers seeking a comprehensive catalog of product portfolio management techniques will benefit from the detailed initial chapters. Meanwhile, readers who are in search of practical, applicable information will find more of what they want in the later chapters."},{"Title":"Portfolio Management For New Products: Second Edition","review":"This is a good guide to help senior managers [1] to decide which new products to progress and [2] to decide how much resources to allocate to those products.

They recognize the difficulties of making such decisions, especially by relying on simple processes without understanding shorfalls of the process and the robustness of the data. They focus on the goals of maximizing value, achieving a balanced portfolio and linking the decisions to business strategy. They tie this process into other key processes in the company, including the product development process and the new product strategy. By far the most valuable aspect of the book, however, is the link between process and real operation provided by the &quot;Points for Management to Ponder&quot; commentary which runs throughout the book. This is a current, encyclopedic and practical guide to this very difficult business process."},{"Title":"Portfolio Management For New Products: Second Edition","review":"Developing new industrial and commercial products is one of the most expensive and risky tasks facing management. New product development is bound to be difficult because new technology or new markets are always involved. Risk in selecting new projects for R&amp;D to spend the company's money on can be managed in a similar way to managing financial investments. You assemble a portfolio, which is collection of investments (i.e. projects) having thought-out risks and an estimated probability of meeting your requirements. This book shows you how.

Read in sequence, Striker's style changes and improvement are readily evident as he evolves into the story teller we expect him to be, having read him \\"from the back side\\" all these years.The bad guys are still the bad guys, but they begin to take on more complex personalities in this work and are something mroe than flat characters. As with all these old dated Lone Ranger westerns, there are mysteries, twists and turns all along the way, all interesting and amusing.In this one there appears to be a ranch of bad guys, but not all is at it seems and in the end, the Lone Ranger, with the help of his faithful Indian companion Tonto solves it all, much to our expectation and delight.Dated material and writing? Yes, of course. But also affectionately heartwarming and nostalgic, reminding us of ourselves when we believed that such a world of simplistic law, order,truth and justice really existed.These Lone Ranger books are great read in bed before dropping off to sleep at night, \\"safe and secure\\" in the knowledge the the ole Lone Ranger and Tonto are still with us, if only in our dreams."},{"Title":"The Lone Ranger and the mystery ranch,","review":"It is easy for the 21st century reader to find fault with the style, phraseology and writng structure of a story written 70 years ago, in 1938, but the value in this book is not the story or the writing style, different though it may abe.The value in this book is memory--and its ability to take the reader to those,if not thriling then certainly more placid and calm, days of yesteryear, when life was simple, when the good guys wore white hats, bad guys wore black, a world of simple rights and simple wrongs, where the good guys won and there was a moral to be learned. Maybe that world never really existed, but we like to think it did.This book, the second in the Lone Ranger series, is so obscure that no one will ever read these words, but in the event someone should happen upon this review, this book will transport you back to those simpler times--and especially to the Meritta Bread sponsored 30-minute Lone Ranger TV show. With every word the Lone Range speaks in these pags, Clayton Moore's voice once again rings across the Plains...Absolute right wins again, evil is vanquished..at least for one week in those days and within the pages of this book for the hour or so it takes to read it....The William Tell Overture...can you hear it?

(DC) (Images of America)","review":"This book is an excellent visual record of Washington baseball in it's own right but is outstanding as a companion piece to Tom Deveaux's The Washington Senators, 1901-1971 (a top notch history containing no pictures). It's great to put a face to a name from a bygone era. This book is chock full of historical photos (all b&w) that extend beyond just the Senators. After all this glowing praise, why do I rate it only 4 stars? I received it a week before Ted Williams' passing. In going back through it a week later, I was struck at the gloss job that the expansion Senators (1961-1971) received. At 14 pages (out of 128), the Senators of my youth are barely represented here. One photo each of Ted Williams and Frank Howard? Reprehensible!!! Hondo isn't even given an action photo (of him crushing another homer) but a tame head shot. Sort of reminds me of James R. Hartley's Washington's Expansion Senators (1961-1971). All in all, a must have that could have been so much better."},{"Title":"Coronado's Children","review":"Dobe's \\"write-as-you-talk\\" writing style makes this, and his other books easy and enjoyable to read. This one is about the stories and lives of the fortune seekers of Coranado's and various Indian's tribes stashed gold and silver. They also chased after gold mines that somehow can't ever be found, but the rich history in the tale is so believable that you want to saddle up your Mustang, grab a pick and shovel and go find it your own self.This is a great evening by the fire or bedtime book. I loved it and several storiers, like \\"Secret in the Burned Cedar Break\\", \\"An Innocent Liar\\", \\"The Masure of a Good Wagon Rod\\", and \\"The Facts About Fort Ramirez\\" are worth a second, and maybe a third read..This was purchesed as a first addition collector's book and it arrived in exactly the condition described in the listing.

Instead, I found a book that was not user friendly and did not offer many reproducible pages. Many of these lessons were not exciting and I did not feel that my students would have been excitied to learn about any of the concepts covered using the prescribed lessons. I was even bored reading it! This book is now collecting dust on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Grammar Lessons and Strategies That Strengthen Students Writing (Grades 4-8)","review":"This wonderful book definitely changed my way of thinking, all for the best reasons. Robb clearly shows that the only way to teach grammar is to choose those parts of speech that clearly support writing: teach strong verbs and specific nouns; teach prepositional phrases to vary sentence beginnings and add details to short, general sentences. Robb shows how to involve students in thinking about grammar this way and also points out the students' improvement when they apply these grammar understandings to their own writing. I said farewell to worksheets long ago, for I realized there was no transfer to students' writing. I'm on board and enjoying teaching grammar with this book as my guide!"},{"Title":"Grammar Lessons and Strategies That Strengthen Students Writing (Grades 4-8)","review":"I teach a basic composition class, and I've always struggled with ways to help the kids see the importance of proper grammar.

This is a tool to help kids see how the grammar rules they've only practiced on worksheets apply to their writing. The Strategy Lessons and Student Practice ideas are easily adapted to any grade level! A must have for ANYONE who teaches writing."},{"Title":"Grammar Lessons and Strategies That Strengthen Students Writing (Grades 4-8)","review":"I have always struggled to teach grammar - it's boring, the students get lost, etc - this book has changed all of that!

I found it on a dusty second hand book shop shelf and never bothered to crack the cover until a few weeks ago. I was kicking myself for not reading it sooner. Besides being completely true, this book was full of action, comedy, sacrifice and outright bravery. It follows a Czech exiled airman who flees Czechoslovakia and continues his fight in France. During his time in France he rescues a German Shepherd puppy after being shot down near enemy lines. The dog is smuggled, as a joint effort by the Czech airmen, to England, where the dog's owner joins the RAFVR and becomes a member of bomber command. The dog, Antis, is at the forefront of this book, as he becomes universally tolerated on the airfields due to his remarkable sense of hearing (detects incoming German planes when no warnings are in place) and his unwavering bravery (saving RAF personnel and rescuing civilians from bombed buildings). The dog eventually is bestowed with a Dickin Medal for bravery, a rare animal decoration likened to the Victoria Cross. I could go on and ruin the book for you, but that would be no fun at all. I will sum up this book in one statement. I recently wrote to a famous movie producer and suggested that he consider that this book be made into a movie. Of the hundreds of books that I have read, this is by far the best and is universally loved by all who have borrowed it from me.Any possibility of new edition Mr. Publisher???"},{"Title":"Hair design and fashion: principles and relationships,","review":"Great tips on the whole appearance"},{"Title":"Is the Antichrist Alive and Well?: 10 Keys to His Identity","review":"One sure way to know Truth is to see how it affects those who question One Truth.

It's about Ed Hinson's twisted, one-sided, dogmatic religious beliefs.He spends one chapter discussing the 10 keys to the Antichrist's identity. The other chapters deal with what is so wrong with American society- like homosexuality, pornography, abortion, secularism, evolution, etc.Ed Hinson is against individualism, humanism, and a secular society. He is against all other religions besides Christianity (he is also against smaller Christian religions like Jehovah's Witnesses). He is against other religious texts and prophets.It's a shame. I was expecting such a better book. I wanted to know more about the coming of the Antichrist. (I'm still not conviced there is one.) Instead, I had to put up with some religious freak.Do not waste your time or money on this book. If you are interested in knowing more about the Antichrist, I would recommend &quot;The Fourth Reich&quot;, which is available on amazon.com. Although it is fictional, it is much more enjoyable than this piece of trash."},{"Title":"THE HOLY BIBLE CONTAINING THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS.","review":"When i first read the word of Jesus at a Bible study,it took me a few times to comprehend what he was on about.I started saying to myself,this man was smart,with a knowledge highly more advanced than anyone around at that time.I mean like people those days in certain parts thought the world was flat,and even though through some excavations we can see evidence of intelligence,they simply did not have the advances we have today.Then how was this man so smart in that sort of situation?He certainly must of had something going for him.Now i have been on both sides of the fence,up to a few years ago i was not a Christian and did not believe in god.I didnt hate god,but i didnt beleive in something i could not see.But after some spiritual experiences of my own i became a believer.Now im not going to dive into my testimony,but i can tell you that im convinced that the spiritual realm is very much alive.I was watching the Christian channel once,a show called Give Me An Answer,and a lady asked how do you know that in 2000 years Elvis Presley wont be looked at as a god as we do with Jesus.Now the answer to that is simple,Elvis may have been a good singer but it was nothing spiritual.Also you have millions of testimonys from believers.Problem is when its spiritual its hard to prove.Now this is another point,how do we know this man exsisted at all?Once again you have the scripture and testimonys of so many followers of Christ.I mean kings and queens come and go,but the name Jesus cannot be replaced.That name is a powerfull word in the spirit,and through it there is healings and other spiritual gifts.So spiritually this man must of had something going for him to of had such knowledge and wisdom.I will also add it is fair to assume then from a non Christian point of veiw that the story of Christ is nothing more than a story book,so Christians be patient and understanding.I have been on that side of the fence,and its up to us individually to seek god.I have had some healings from god myself,and i can tell you a life without faith can be like a living death at times.The Bible states quite clearly that Jesus will return.But how will we know him?We have no photographs,videos or DNA.Thats surely got to create a problem for a Jesus wannabe.I have seen such people,so called Jesus's reciting from the Bible.Just hang on a moment,reciting from the Bible?Now if you realy have a good hard think about that i doubt Jesus would recite from the Bible.Lets get this right Jesus spoke the word,then it was written,it was his word that lead to the Bible.So recitings out right?Also that picture in the last supper is just a painter's depiction of what he may have looked like,and the movie's you see are largely based on that image.So how will we know for sure huh? Well we did not choose Jesus as the son of god in the first place.If someone could claim to be Jesus who do you think would confirm that?A group of Priests?A group of Pastors?Perhaps a collaboration of the 2 groups,or even a politician? Well i think i can safely dump the idea of the politician.The truth is none of the above.There is no Jesus welcoming committee.What if he didnt measure up to our expectations? The scriptures says God so loved the world he gave his only son.So it appears to me that God decides who his son is not us.Now Jesus did refur to the father spirit in the scripture,and in a movie i saw the clouds parted and god spoke to Jesus.I think anyone who can do that has got something going for them and one thing for sure this person would have a knowledge and wisdom far beyond anyone who lives today."},{"Title":"THE HOLY BIBLE CONTAINING THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS.","review":"I had to order this one from Amazon at a relatively higher cost, as this kind of editions are not available locally. Most of the Bibles that you get in the stores are printed on thin paper, with microscopic print. All this is done to make the Bible easy to carry, but imagine the strain on people's eyes!This one has been printed in fairly large typeface (perhaps 13 or 14 points), though it is not giant typeface, as the blurb claims. However, the line margins have been completely eaten up to provide the space for the larger type. Also there is no line spacing between paras. The paper is better than most pocket editions, but the typing on the reverse still shows through, and is a bit of a distraction while reading. If you like to mark or underline your Bible, you are going to have an absolutely frustrating time finding the space for it. There is some space in the margins though.The pages have been edged beautifully in gilt. The signature binding is superb. I have not been able to make out whether the cover is made of leather or some synthetic material, but it wears well. There are also eight pages of color maps at the end, as well as a concordance. There are no other study aids, except of course a list of the books.The edition is King James, 1611. Direct statements made by Lord Jesus Christ have been printed in a dull kind of red, which is somewhat difficult to read as the color is not very sharp.Holy Bible does not normally print the original language text alongside the translation, as is normal with Quran Sharif or Shrimad Bhagwad Gita. To my mind, this is a major loss, as some of the concepts get transformed during translation into another language. For the story of how the King James translation came about, read 'God's Secretaries', Adam NicholsonGod's Secretaries: The Making of the King James Bible (P.S.)All in all an excellent gift for a family friend who is getting along in years."},{"Title":"Direct Selling: From Door to Door to Network Marketing","review":"Excelent introductory book of direct selling, with many comparison and examples"},{"Title":"Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman","review":"Ladies First is one of the best autobiographies i've read.

Women are taught to give up their power as women, or they're taught to abuse it.This book is an excellent read for preteens and teenagers.

The main part of the book that was glossed over was her music life.Ladies First was well written, and easy to read. There were a few slang words, but not so bad that you could not read them. It was pretty well organized, but jumped around some. I thought that she showed great perseverance when telling how she kept going and never quit. There were many hard times in her life, and it tells about them, whereas most people would have given up. I think it could have been improved by discussing more about her. It kind of drifted away from her a bit.I gave this book four stars because it shows that anyone can make it at what they want. I would recommend this book to people if they like the kind of thug/music lifestyle. Some people would not like this book if they do not understand the kind of life that one has to work for. I thought Queen Latifah was trying to send the &#65533;you can do anything&#65533; message across, which is and awesome message to send to people that want to give up on their dreams. I thought the book Ladies First sent out that message very well."},{"Title":"Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman","review":"I found this book to be incredibly sincere and uplifting.

It definitely should encourage young women of all sizes and ethnic origin. I thought that the foreward by Rita B.

The end result is that Ms. Owens has her own company -- Flavor Unit. I only wish that Ms. Owens had discussed how she started the company and what it is like to run it. Hopefully, we can look forward to a sequel."},{"Title":"Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman","review":"The book gave strong, practical suggestions for dealing with the emotional and spiritual issues women are confronted with daily.

She has an eventful life, so it's not boring to read, in the slightest. Check it out."},{"Title":"Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman","review":"I purchased this book initially to get to know more about Dana Owens but instead I learned more about myself. I took my time reading the book because after every chapter or so I had to stop and check myself. I felt as though Queen Latifah was seated in front of me and reading pages from my life. My life does not come close to hers but yet I felt as though it did. I agree that every now and then as women we must stop and do our own personal inventory. Am I who I want to be and is God pleased with who I am?"},{"Title":"Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman","review":"This book demonstrates how Queen Latifah achieved her dreams against the odds by using her God given abilities. She shows the reader how strong will and good judgement at an early age, made her the symbol of perserverence and strength she is today. Through her journey of living, Queen Latifah vividly takes the reader with her..through the good and not so good times. There are many references throughout the book that serve as inspiration for ALL women, especially the &quot;body awareness&quot; revelations.

I would recommend this book to ALL women."},{"Title":"Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman","review":"I have Queen Latifah's autography and I LOVE IT and I know almost everything about Queen Latifah that there is to possibly know.

She has had her own synicated talk show and she also had an acting career and she has starred in movies such as:Brown Sugar, Beauty Shop, Bringing Down The House,Barbershop 2:Back In Business, Set it off just to name a few. I'm a huge fan Of Queen Latifah because she has had to endure the terrible pain of her brother which I think is horrible and sad.

The book was still interesting, but this is basically an outline of her life."},{"Title":"Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman","review":"Ladies First is the uplifting story of the author. Queen Latifah is known to be the first female to be a solo rapper and get a record deal. She has also become a top television actress and movie star. She got a Grammy and became the president of her own company. Ladies First is about a girl named Dana Owens who is from Newark, New Jersey and how she becomes Queen Latifah and the things she went through because of a tragic death.The content of the book is organized pretty well. It starts when her mom, Rita Owens, talking about Queen Latifah's younger days, then moves to Queen Latifah talking about what became of her. The book is quite easy to read. It has vocabulary and slang of a ghetto life style.The book rates a five stars, as it is extremely interesting to read and written well enough that readers are easily able to become involved. I recommend this book to anyone who listens to her music or understands her lyrics."},{"Title":"Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman","review":"Initially I wondered what insights a woman so young would have to offer but no more. Her message that family, personal integrity, and self-confidence are the building blocks for a woman is simple but powerful. I also like that she embraces her size and strength as a part of her beauty not obstacles to be overcome. She has a demonstrated track record of success to back up her way of approaching the world. Her story also provides examples of alternative ways of disciplining and nurturing black children for success. She reminds all women that they already possess strength and power because they are. That is well worth reading. I hope all women read it especially her young fan base. I am 34 years old and I was greatly encouraged."},{"Title":"Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman","review":"... you're going to love this. This book candidly reveals a lot about Latifah that you probably didn't know. Did you know QL doesn't like celery? Well, Chapter 6 is devoted to finally telling you the whole story. Ever wondered why Larry Storch and Queen Latifah have never worked together? Well, QL tells all in Chapter 28. Ever wonder what hip-hop's first lady likes to think about while shaving her armpits? Look no further than Chapter 87. Refreshingly honest, like the woman herself, Ladies First isn't just about the rise of one strong woman to entertainment's pinnacle, it's also a gripping account of Pete Gray, the first and still only, one-armed man to play in the Major Leagues."},{"Title":"Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman","review":"This book isn't like most biographies. It isn't another glamorous tale about a flawless mediaperson. It is a true tale about the wonderful person that is Queen Latifah. What makes this book so different, is that she tells you about the mistakes she has made in her life, about her flaws, and about her strengths. You get to know her in a way that isn't possible with most famous people, because you never hear about their flaws. That makes them unreal. But this is a tale about a real person's road to fame. And it is written in a great way. A must read for all her fans, and for everyone that are looking for answers in their life. You can learn a lot from her experience. I would highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman","review":"Ladies First is one of the best autobiographies i've read. Queen Latifah tell us all how to be a strong woman, she let's us know we have to think a lot of ourselves no matter the situation. I was so sad when I read about the death of her beloved brother. Looking at the pictures she included in the book I could tell they were very close. I liked the part at the end of the book, when Queen let women know they need to be confident about themselves before they should start dating a guy, and that women need to have more respect for themselves when it come to dating. I think all women should get a copy of Ladies First"},{"Title":"Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman","review":"Reading this book, I thought that Dana Owens' story would only tell of her trek to Hollywood.

She was honest in her revelations. Her honesty is appreciated.

I come myself from a confused and complicated family arrangement (what with 'steps' and so forth!), and I think that Jen has a knack for capturing the exact feelings a child within this situation might feel. I've certainly felt many of the feelings that 'Tess' discussed. I disagree with the previous reviewer that associated 'Dreamcatcher' with only steroetypes. I think that, as far as any author really can, Jen managed to disregard the stereotypes that normally go with complicated family relationships (evil stepmother, jealous half sister, neurotic divorced woman). I really like the interesting twist of the two 'mothers' actually becoming friends. It was also refreshing to see strong girl and women characters within this work. The novel works as a great affirmation of the strength of women, and I am sure that it will inspire many young girls. Tess was particularly endearing to me, and i think an effective balance between her strength and vulnerability was reached here! The fact that both of the sisters had strong physical bodies, but were weak or scared within them, was an image that worked well throughout this novel. I would recommend this book to children and adults alike, with its relevance increasing as family situations complicate. It is also quick and fun to read - it's use of dialogue is particularly astute and funny!It would also make a great film!"},{"Title":"On Different Shores","review":"One of the strengths of the author's writing is her realistic portrayal of adolescent feelings and relationships.

That is, the father so involved in his work that he has distanced himself from his family, the daughter whose means of attracting attention is to over-achieve, the peace-making mother and the narrator so outgoing. Basically, I found this unoriginal-an old story retold. Nonetheless, Jen McVeity writes dialogue very well and provides an easy read here, one that I'm sure many can relate to in some way. If you want one perspective of family life, read this book."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Instant Russian Package (Book + 2CDs) (TY: Language Guides)","review":"This book is in regular latin letters.

The sister, Kiera, marries Kelan and she falls in love with him. Elyn after having a terrible fight with Brock, disappears.I liked this book until about 3/4 or alittle more of the ways inwhen books are supposed to really &quot;heat&quot; up. Well, this one sort of fizzled out, and I was disappointed.I only give this book three stars."},{"Title":"Impostress","review":"Setting - North Wales 1286Three years earlier, one of the very independent daughters of the Baron of Lawenydd, Kiera, slipped out to steal a ride on her father's prize stallion, along the way she was thrown, the stallion ran away, and she was attacked and almost raped. Her sister Elyn came upon the attack and saved Kiera's life and from that moment on Kiera vowed to do ANYTHING for Elyn that she asked to repay the debt. Never, in her wildest imaginings would Kiera have thought that she would have to pretend and marry Elyn's betrothed, Lord Kelan of Penbrooke!The plan just might have worked if Elyn hadn't lied from the very beginning about returning when she in all honesty was buying time to run away with the man she was in love with. Kiera found herself not only with a man who stirred her innermost feelings, but who just wasn't responding to the sleeping potion that should have put him into a drugged sleep on their wedding night! As Kiera tries to evade the wedding night ritual, she finds she is unable to resist Kelan's drugging kisses, and sweet caresses and her desire for him was her undoing. Wracked with guilt over the deception to Kelan, her sister's husband, and the man she was definitely beginning to love her anxieties were overwhelming - so much so that Kelan recognized that something was not quite right with his bride.THE IMPOSTRESS was an extremely entertaining historical romance with a wonderful plot that had me quickly turning the pages and holding my breath, waiting for the truth to be revealed. The author really had me feeling all the anxiety that was Kiera's, who I found to be a very likeable, loyal and honorable heroine. I pictured myself in the difficult position of honoring a vow made to a person that had saved my life, knowing how despicable a thing it was that I had to do, and then falling in love with the man who would be your brother-in-law! While I thought the ending came about very quickly, the cast of secondary characters was well thought out supporting the plot and I am looking forward to the next two proposed novels featuring Kelan's sister Morwenna, his brother Tadd, and maybe even Kiera's youngest sister Penelope. Fans of this medieval thirteenth century romance genre are surely in for a treat as this engaging story continues!"},{"Title":"Impostress","review":"As girls, Elyn saved her sister, Kiera, and in turn, Kiera vowed to repay her someday. She never dreamed that the favor Elyn would ask of her would be so audacious. Elyn has been promised in marriage to the Beast of Pembrooke, and her heart belongs to another, as well as her virginity. It would not do for her new husband to learn that his wife is not pure, so she wants the still virginal Kiera to take her place, just for the wedding night. Feeling she has no other choice, Kiera agrees.She finds that Lord Kelan, her \\"husband\\" is not a beast at all, but a good man, and handsome. She does all she can to keep out of his bed, and tries not to fall in love, but fails miserably. The situation is compounded by his love for her and the report of \\"Kiera's\\" death when Elyn disappears following her own betrayal. Then events become even more perplexing, and it appears that the truth will come to light. How will Kelan react to learn that the woman he thinks he is married to, and has fallen for, is not who he thinks she is, and he might not even be married to?***** As always, you can count on a Lisa Jackson book to be filled with intriguing situations, tense moments, and a fantastically sexy and compelling hero. Deceptions, magic, and passion fill the pages, and you will be held captive by the spell she weaves with these ingredients."},{"Title":"Impostress","review":"The story begins as a girl falls from her horse. She is in a forest, and a ruffian finds her and nearly rapes her. Saved by her sister, she swears to help her if she ever needs it. Soon after, her sister asks her to stand in for her on her wedding night, while she goes to see her lover.This was a badly written story with improbably characters and a vapid premise. The heroine lies her way through the story, and the plot is flimsy and tangled. The two sisters are not very likeable and the hero doesn't ever come to life in the book. All in all, a disappointing read."},{"Title":"Impostress","review":"Late in the thirteenth century Kiera dress up like a stable boy before sneaking out her father's best stallion Obsidian. However, she runs into a problem and only the quick action of her sister Elyn keeps her from being raped and probably killed. Kiera vows she owes her life to her sibling and will do anything Elyn asks to pay the debt.A few years later Elyn demands Kiera keep her vow by replacing her at her wedding ceremony although she insists Kiera can avoid bedding the groom Baron Kelan of Penbrooke. Kiera refuses, but Elyn sneaks away to spend time with her beloved. Elyn uses a veil to hide behind and goes through the ceremony. She pretends illness to stay away from the celebration, but Kelan enters her bedroom and soon caresses her into making love with him. The next day Elyn fails to show up so Kiera leaves with Kelan for his estate. As they become acquainted they fall in love, but he knows she is hiding something from him. When he learns the truth, Kiera believes Kelan will angrily boot her out and cause trouble for her father.THE IMPOSTRESS is an entertaining historical romance that at first may seem inane, but works because readers feel Kiera's growing anxiety over the ploy. The story line is a comedy of errors as Kiera compounds the deception though she expects the worse to happen when she also falls in love with the victim of the ruse. Fans will relish this engaging medieval romance because the cast makes it work.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Impostress","review":"This book was amazing.

This is the first time I had read a book by Lisa Jackson, and boy did I pick a good one !!!!!! The author described the woods, and going ons in such detail, that I almost felt like I could've been there seeing what the heroine saw. The only reason I held back a star, is because the story was explained so well, and thought out.. but the ending was so rushed !! All of the build up.. and No intense stand off between Keira of Lawenydd, and Lord Kelan of Penbrooke !! I was disappointed.. especially at his easy going behavior after an intense beginning, and middle .. but the overall story was a really good one with some steamy scenes."},{"Title":"Impostress","review":"The storyline was so interesting that I immediately rushed out to buy a copy. Imagine how disappointed I was that Impostress was not up to standard. Throughout the book, Kiera repeatedly told herself that she could not go on living a lie but when opportunities presented themselves, which were plenty, she kept on hedging and telling more lies. I could have slapped her! I usually make allowances for the characters' behaviour based on the period it was written on. This story was based in the 13th century and Kiera was 17 years old. Those characters involved in the deception were an old nurse, Hildy, Kiera's younger sister 13 year old Penelope and of course, Kiera's older sister 19 year old Elyn.Even when Elyn disappeared and Kiera suspected that Elyn might be in dire straits, wouldn't a teenager confide in an adult, especially when her nurse predicted death? She had her father and Elyn's husband after all. A full scale search launched would have saved everybody all the trouble.There was also no interaction between the hero and heroine. Kelan was hardly featured at all in the book and Kelan's sister, Morwenna, was not a likeable character in this book. So I guess I will not be purchasing Lisa's upcoming book,TEMPTRESS featuring Morwenna."},{"Title":"Impostress","review":"I love medieval romances and this one kept me glued to the page.

I was very surprised that once the story moves to the Pembroke Castle stage itimproves dramatically(no pun intended). And the last chapter is in fact quite good.

It is highly controversial, not only because of the subject matter, but also because of the author's unique perspective on these subjects.\\"God's Gladiators\\" covers a variety of topics, but the two dominant themes are the transdimensional nature of UFOs/Aliens and 'The Sphere' (which the author likens to the concept of 'The Matrix'). Both topics will make your head explode! Stuart tackles the tricky subject of UFOs with a refreshing theory - that UFOs and the Greys are really non-physical entities (beings from the Astral/Etheric). He supports this theory with research, logic, and personal experience. If you have any knowledge of OBE/Astral Projection, and/or Negative Transdimensional Beings, you will immediately comprehend the horrific implications of this theory. Knowledge of the Astral is the key to unlocking the UFO enigma (For those interested in Negative Entities, I'd also recommend \\"Practical Psychic Self Defence\\" by Robert Bruce). Stuart also develops a unique concept which he calls 'The Sphere'. It is essentially a control mechanism which underlies the fabric of reality, keeping us trapped while Transdimensionals feed off our etheric energy. He further explains how all our religions and values are deceptively designed to trap us even further in the sphere. The remainder of the book attempts to give instructions on how to free one's Self from the sphere.Having delved into the confused mass of (dis)information on UFOs and extraterrestrials which plague the 'controversial' sections of our bookstores, as well as the corrupted and simplistic 'spiritual' concepts found in most religions, and the ridiculous 'new age' fluff which is anything but new, I found Stuart's perspective both enlightening and entertaining. This is a very fun book, which will shift your perception of life and reality if you are open minded and detached from limiting belief systems."},{"Title":"God's Gladiators","review":"Gods Gladiators is truly a remarkable book. You will have to read it 2 or 3 times before you come to grips with the contents.Stuart Wilde does give a warning, a couple of chapters in and you proceed at your own risk. After the first reading I wondered why Stuart Wilde has gone ahead and published this book now, because to come out and write as he has in God's Gladiators is to make yourself a target. But Stuart has never shied away from the difficult . As his legacy of books is testiment to.In Gladiators,Stuart talks from his personal experience in the heyday of the new age and how it was doomed from the start. Another of the tricks played on humanity. It would be easy to become depressed after reading Gladiators, if it wasn't for Stuart irrepressible humour and optimism. As he points out, humanity has fooled itself, and been fooled into believing it is in charge, as we relentlessly pursue perfection.But we are the prey, fed off on the ground and in the air. Stuart names some of the predators directly, and alludes to others in the allegorical tale of his personal quest to find the Lady of the Lake, and to tell the Devil he loves him. This no cosy read, but, as world events take increasingly bizzare turns, if you have the courage, READ IT."},{"Title":"God's Gladiators","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this is not an easy book to review. In some ways, God's Gladiators has elements in common with books like Autobiography of a Yogi and the works of Carlos Castaneda (though Wilde is definitely on a different spiritual path from either of these). The problem is, if you haven't personally experienced the fantastic things written about in these books, how do you evaluate their authenticity? If you are a complete skeptic or someone who believes anything on faith, this is not a problem. If however, like me, you are open to almost anything but also skeptical, it can be a tricky business.In this book, Wilde talks about meeting metaphysical entities such as the mythic Lady of the Lake, malevolent transdimensionals and even the Devil himself (though he confesses that this part of the tale is allegorical). I have read several of Stuart Wilde's books and, although this one is the furthest \\"out there,\\" all of his work reveals him to be something of a trickster guru type. This, despite the fact that he warns his readers away from gurus and other authority figures. It isn't just what he says, but the way he says it --he is full of wisecracks and a tongue-in-cheek attitude. This does not mean, however, that I don't believe a lot of what he says, only that I don't necessarily take it at face value. For one thing, many of his experiences have the quality of visions or mystical experiences, which often have a subjective quality. That is, what I \\"see\\" may be valid for me but not for everyone. The book also contains what I see as certain contradictions. For example, Wilde repeatedly states that anyone who tries to sell you on immortality is conning you. Yet, at the very end he describes, or at least suggests, a way to attain immortality. He tends to paint very broad strokes in dismissing others' beliefs. He mentions that Hitler was interested in Tibetan mysticism, and based on this he rejects everything Tibetan. He likewise condemns Hinduism and Buddhism, the latter for denying the self. Yet Wilde himself tells us we have to get rid of the self we have come to know. This is a common theme of all spiritual traditions, including Buddhism.I suspect there is a basic truth to Wilde's premise that we are controlled by the Sphere --similar to the Matrix (see David Icke's books for more on this, as well as the Matrix movies of course). Dark entities feed off our fears and negativity and also control all of \\"our\\" governments, religions, economies and mass media. The latter will not be news to anyone who has studied conspiracy theories, but Wilde does a good job in exposing this widespread deception. If there is a basic theme to this, as well as Wilde's other books, it is attaining freedom from control.This is a fascinating book, and I'd recommend it to anyone who is not afraid to go beyond the standard dogmas of most religions as well as self help and new age philosophies. My sense is that it contains a lot of wisdom, some material that is true for some but not others and some hot air as well. It's worth reading it to make up your own mind."},{"Title":"God's Gladiators","review":"I should have read the package warning label...for things like\\"Don't read this book late into the night\\" \\"or don't read after having pepperoni pizza\\" ...maybe there was no packaging label and that got morphed too!I am still on the fence here...

I find myself in the position of having to sift thru and sort out the details of this book (and now my mind...because as one reviewer aptly said..this book is like a l2 gauge shotgun pointed at your head) How much of this is workable? How much can a serious seeker use...theories and UFO's notwithstanding?Okay...so why would I give it 5 stars...because it is so compelling...it makes you look at the game your life is again...and who and what you are plugged into...and where you are vs. where you intend to be. Even if you trash a lot of SW's theories as substance induced drama, you can't really walk away from this without it pulling you back into your own life review.

This is apparent to those who have tagged along on his website through the discussion pages, traveling, rambling, commentary, visions, morphing walls, crop circles and finally little grey space creatures. Is it real or is it mescaline? I figure the old boy is just shaking his metaphysical tree. Some of us will drop to the ground; but I won't be one of them.Stuart Wilde did not invent the concepts he presents in his books. Somehow he manages to pluck these ideas out of the cosmos and wrap them up for us in his charismatic words. As children we understood these concepts clear as a bell. There are worlds within worlds. We can fly in our minds. Sunshine has a feeling. All life is sacred. We're not steering the big ship.Thank god - or the gladiators - for someone who will step up and disrobe the charlatans of the modern world and breathe life into our stale existence.When I read the book the first time I got so much out of it. When I read it the second time I'll enjoy it even more. Suspend your judgment long enough allow Stuart Wilde to stretch your perception like metaphysical silly putty.What a deal. Thanks for writing it."},{"Title":"God's Gladiators","review":"I was going through a crisis in my life and I intuitively picked up this book off a shelf. It was one of the strangest events of my life as I had never heard of Stuart Wilde or any of the many other books he has written. This book is about Wilde's journey through the dimensional doorways and into the other dimensions that many know are there but few have had the time or courage to enter. This book is about the \\"Godess\\", and what one may find when going on a \\"Godess\\" or vision quest. The energy is what he has referred to as Quest, or the sacred journey, but this story takes it a step further. As we are entering a quickening now, and events begin to accelerate, I believe that now is the right time for those who are ready to take the Red Pill and find out just what reality really is and not what the fat controllers of the world want you to believe it is. This book is a sort of Red Pill, a doorway into an energy that changes the direction you are going in life if you are ready. I picked up that energy and I am ready, a year and a half later, to leave everything behind and go on my personal quest. That is the energy contained in this book, and that is the energy which will slowly transform our world and save our people. If you have the courage and this feels right for you, get it."},{"Title":"God's Gladiators","review":"Haven't you ever wondered why it seems that so many nasty people seem to rise to the \\"top\\" despite their lack of either talent or content? Perhaps you've looked into some of the current conspiracy theories that deal with seemingly multi-generational plans to make the world a nastier place, and wondered how in the heck fallible humans are able to pull it off over the years. This book raises some interesting theories concerning the answers to these (and other) sorts of enigmas. The author is seriously playful in his approach to describing the meaning of life, the structure of existence, and the roads \\"back home.\\" Along the way we encounter those nasty little Alien fellas that usually seem to imply that they've travelled zillions and zillions of miles through interstellar space just to stick things up your varied orifices - and find out they're about as truthful as they are fun to hang out with. We meet up with boddhisatva pirates sailing the etheric seas to free those captive on slave ships...and just maybe this book is flying the jolly roger for some. And, we get some hints of how it may be possible to walk through walls, without the last meal you just ate making a mess on the wall-paper. Most of all though, we get a boost or a tug, pushing and pulling us on to higher or deeper places in or out of the cosmos...a fun and salvific kick in the pants.

Why did NASA try to ban Dr. Paul Hill's book? Why were Fouche's home, car, and hotel rooms broken into? Why did he go underground after delivering his \`insider presentation to the International UFO Congress? Why has the great researcher and bestseller, Jim Marrs, been slandered? Why are there still questions about the deaths of Corso and Hill? Were their sudden demise a product of this conspiracy?Why? If you read this excellent book and the others, you will know that they are indeed true.

Read this book and check out the reviews of the other TOP books I have mentioned."},{"Title":"God's Gladiators","review":"11 years ago, Stuart Wilde changed my life with his marvelous work \\"Whispering Winds of Change\\". Being raised as a Jehovah's Witness, his teachings were particularly profound in my struggle with finding spirituality after breaking free from a brainwashing cult. To date, he is THE most influential of all metaphysical teachers in my life--period. But something has changed. In his book, \\"Infinite Self\\" he warns of the dangers of \\"becoming a guru by manipulating weaker people and \\"using your knowledge to frighten people, to scare them into giving you their power or their money.\\" So what is it that you want from ME Stuie and the rest of your faithful that bought this book? \\"God's Gladiators?\\" \\"God's Train Wreck\\" would have been a more suitable title--you really want to look away but you just can't. Strip this book down to it's bare bones and take away all the woo woo ramblings and you have the same basic premise of the Jehovah's Witness religion: you have no control, you are being controlled, there are very dark forces at work and even if you live the best life possible you are still probably going to end up being screwed. Oh, and by the way, the end of the world is right around the corner. Even the pictures on his website look like images straight out of a Watchtower or Awake. Did the man who changed the way I perceive the world really just tell me to make sure I put a towel under my feet if I simply MUST put my feet on the floor because the Ghouls love to come up through the floor boards? I think Mr. Wilde has played (or faught) too long in the dimensions of the dark...or maybe he's just done too much Aya...perhaps both. Whatever his path. destiny has taken him on an extended trip to the dark side. What hope does he offer? Not much at all actually. I honestly only think he mentioned God's Gladiators a handful of times...but don't count on them if you eat meat, use a microwave or talk on your cell phone too much because the Ghouls are gonna get ya and suck up all your life force. This sad work does not detract from what he has given to me over the years but I had to come to the same conclusion about Stuart that I did of the Jehovah's Witnesses when I broke free: Even if this IS the truth, I will not live my life that way. I'm going to miss you Stuie. Please come back to the light."},{"Title":"God's Gladiators","review":"For years I have been a fan of Stuart Wilde, often an uncomfortable one, who has been challenged by his ideas and ideals. I ordered God's Gladiators and read it cover to cover the day it arrived. I immediately went into a long clinical depression (my first) while I tried to wrestle with the dark world he has invented. Now that I am well medicated and almost a year into therapy, I can see the book for what it is, and objectively: The Ravings Of A Liar Or A Madman. If the book is meant to be a metaphor, Wilde pointing out that the devil story IS a metaphor only makes it appear the rest of the book is not. I think this old man has gone bonkers, right out to lunch, and is quite possibly schizophrenic. Try holding up any of his claims to scientific scrutiny and I bet we'll find nothing that can be proven. This is a sad and dangerous book by a sick man who used to have something to say. Total BS.

Its rather matter of fact, offering an alternative POV on one's current situation. Our situation looks grim at this point, acc. to SW's vision (and that vision is shared by other highly respectable people). Yet he offers an escape route for those who dare. This escape route is not new, its eternal and utterly beautiful. It does ask to give up a lot of what most people regard as necessities in their lives. Beyond the materialistic stuff there is much much more to let go of - and that might be scary. Yet if you listen closely your Heart will tell you that there is Truth.Thank you for writing this book, Stuart!PS: If you ever get the chance to listen to Stuart's lectures you will feel in his voice where this beautiful soul is coming from.

I always wondered wether germans are more critical and more intellectually trained than americans. 4 Stars average in the US reviews may be a proof of that ... sorry that I am that disrespectful. When I did read this book years ago (yes, actually I did COMPLETELY read and study the book!) I did NOT went into any kind of clinical depression problem or whatsoever just simply right from the beginning I recognized the book as what is is: pure fancy, really weak, poor metaphysics. I loved the authors book \\"The Trick to Money is having some\\", but this book really seems to be a complety downfall of a once aware and intelligent man. It's by far the weakest and worst piece of metaphysics I ever plowed through, the only reason why I did read it from beginning to the end is that I really loved one of the authors previous books \\"money\\". I am not even willed to waste any more time in writing this review, that book isn't really worth it.

Since I belong to the 99.999% who do not give a hoot about them this book and the so call relationship of these beings with other transdimensional entities is quite boring.On the other hand it feels highly contradictory with many other principles and opinions that the author teaches in his web page and other publications. Particularly the fact that the world is doomed (including our existence in the afterlife) no matter what and then to claim that every person is sacred and its soul is eternal and a part of God (whatever she/he/it/light or some other category is) so one is forced to conclude that God is also in very serious trouble in these round lands and that its sacred part inside of me or you is also doomed.At the end feels like this chap is as lost (although quite right on his appreciation that we are much, much much, much more controlled that we would like to believe) as everyone else about the meaning of life, the true nature of self, the extent of love, and what wrong with the the dark side if it is also a part of God's plan. So if you are buying it to get some kind of orientation, is better to spend your money on a compass."},{"Title":"God's Gladiators","review":"Stuart Wilde lays it all out. If you have not read any of his other work I suggest you do so BEFORE reading God's Gladiators.

There is the special maple syrup fast, parasite removal herbs, colon cleansing, and let us not forget examining one's stool in a kitchen colander with a popsicle stick for worms (no kidding); tantric sex techniques, G-spot location (I guess he presumes our prostates are getting better), aural bodies, chakras, aroma therapy, mercury dental filling removal, wearing non-metal belt buckles, channeling by his guide &quot;Lazaris&quot; (probably not his birth name) and of course diet advice. The Clapp diet (like everything else, is a little bit of this and a little bit of that. He recommends the Zone Diet which teaches carbohydrate control.

If you have never fasted before you may be a little apprehensive about trying it, but it seems to me so far to have been the exact thing I needed to do. I do not have prostate cancer but I had been to the doctor 3 times for a prostate infection and was told (after taking antibiotics which partially helped) that I would have to live with it or start drug therapy and possibly surgery. Since taking the advice in this book I have almost no symptoms and I feel great. I will admit that it was not easy and sometimes I don't stay away from foods I know are not good for my health but it took a long time developing bad habits and Rome wasn't built in a day.

It will require some real effort on the reader's part to actually utilize the complete plan, but the road to health is often long and must be undertaken with patience and dedication.

As reported above, I delayed my biopsy and chose instead the path described in detail by this book. I did not do everything in the book, maybe half of it, actually. I did improve my diet, over what was already a good one (I am a personal trainer), I did increase my exercises, I did drop an already moderate alcohol intake, I did eat many of the foods he suggests, and limited the ones he suggests limiting, I did start with some external prostate massage per my sweetheart, I started the stretches, I did start taking some of the supplements, and I did do the parasite and colon cleanse. I could only get through day 4 of the fast. I also started visualization, mantras, and praying. My latest blood test one month ago shows my PSA at 5.01. My symptoms of aching in my prostate are 95% gone. My late night bathroom trips are 99% gone. I am closer with and thankful to my sweetheart. I believe I am healing form whatever I had.

Relating to the eight-day ultimate fast, page 95 states to Juice 3 lemons per 32 oz bottle or about 1 and 1/2 ounces of lemon juice. Plus the maple syrup was to be about 1 and 1/2 ounces. This was half the amount that should have been used. While on the fast I not only felt bad because of releasing toxins, I also was not getting enough nutrients -- not a good thing. True, if I was on the ball then I would have noticed that the 10-ounce mixture recommendations were different from the 32-ounce mixture. However, when I pay good money for a book then I expect it to have been proofread and accurate.Not to long ago I stopped by the bookstore and noticed that they had the 14th printing (March 2002) of this book. The amounts of lemon juice and maple syrup to use for a 32-ounce mixture were accurate. However, the recommended colon treatment was for the TheraClear products. The fifth printing that I own used the Clear/Experience/Harmony products. On the Prostate90 Web site under the \\"CLEANSING THE COLON AND BODY WITH THE ULTIMATE FAST\\" it states\\"Please Note: In order to best serve you, we endeavor to stay abreast of advancing technologies in cleansing and fasting. This evolution has resulted in 3 protocols over 12 printings of \\"Prostate Health in 90 Days Without Drugs or Surgery.\\" As we have tested new products we have revised the book to recommend slightly different parasite protocols. We have updated each version to include what we deem the most effective products available at the time of printing. We apologize for any confusion this has caused. All three versions of the fast currently in print are safe and effective. All of these products are currently available from the sources indicated.\\"According to the Prostate90 Web site the current product recommended is PC 1,2,3. This, in my opinion, does not add up because it appears the Theraclear was initially recommended prior to Clear/Experience, and Harmony.I think the author has some good ideas and recommended treatments.

For example the author states the biopsy is painful. I had one last week with no pain whatsoever. He also states that his doctor made an appointment for him to have surgery the next day. There is no way that would happen. The colon must heal for several weeks before surgery can be preformed and the urologists will want to discuss treatment options. Prostate cancer is very slow growing therefore it is not urgent to remove it immediately. There are many, many more examples. It is scary to thing how many people may have missed their chance to remove their cancer and instead followed this book. Once the caner goes outside the gland there is NO turning back and NO cure is possible at that point. A cure is 100% if the glad is removed in time to stop the spread.

But attorney Larry Clapp didn't buy it when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1991. He refused to have surgery, radiation or chemotherapy, and opted instead to investigate alternatives, finding that prostate problems don't exist in other cultures, and concluding that prostate illness was neither inevitable nor incurable. Clapp propelled himself into an intensive research effort to evaluate both traditional and alternative healing methods, and the results became the basis of the healing program that ultimately cured his cancer. The details of his journey, and a step-by-step program for becoming cancer-free in 90 days are outlined in his easy-to-follow, emotionally sensitive book,&quot;Prostate Health in 90 Days Without Drugs or Surgery.&quot; The foundation of Clapp's program is the Nobel Prizewinning work of Otto Warburg, who won the coveted prize in 1931, for proving that cancer cannot live in cells that are in pH balance. Most of us living in an urban environment are very acidic, and therefore unwitting hosts to prostate and other cancers. The book explains how the prostate is especially vulnerable, and how to achieve a pH balance that will increase the flow of blood and oxygen to the prostate and force the cancer cells to return to normal cells. Clapp's program is based primarily on balancing the pH by clearing toxins from the body, improving the diet, exercising and working toward a healthier emotional and sexual life. A key part of the program is the Biological Terrain Assessment (BTA), a European test which is gaining popularity in the U.S. The BTA is a major break through, measuring pH, reduction oxidation, and the resistivity of the blood, saliva and urine, to two decimal places. These nine measures provide an in-depth view of the body's present condition, revealing levels of dysfunction that traditional tests don't encompass. With present weaknesses precisely established, a healing program can be mapped out and equally important, progress or lack of progress can be monitored and precisely adjusted weekly, monthly or quarterly."},{"Title":"Prostate Health in 90 Days","review":"Well this book did.

Believe me when I say, I could have easily been another victim of conventional medical methods and unnecesarily forfeited my bodyparts to surgery or radiation.

Dr. Clapp healed himself from prostate cancer and has done leading edge research and investigaton into what works to heal prostate cancer. His book is easy to understand and the methods he imparts not only guided me towards healing my prostate cancer, it also changed my entire lifestyle and attitude towards health. If you have prostate cancer and you've got one book to read this should be the one. If you've got any other type of cancer than this book should be one of the ones you read, and if you just want to know more about how alternative health works this one will give you a unique and up to date perspective on the subject."},{"Title":"Prostate Health in 90 Days","review":"The &quot;C&quot; word is one of the scariest in our language. But the prostate &quot;C&quot; men have time on their side to check out what really obtains since this is the slowest growing of all cancers. Mr. Clapp's book gave me insight and knowledge to have confidence that I could research and make intelligent decisions in a timely manner. Since of all cancers prosate is the one that gives us time, I followed his program for just three months (doing a considerable amount of personal research also) and my cancer markers all came down. Today, four years later, my doctor tells me that I have no signs of malignancy whatsoever.I have done many different approaches to &quot;natural healing&quot; in addition to what this book recommends, but this was my first start...and a very successful one at that. It impressed upon me that eliminating the source of cancer was the key. The conventional doctors in my medical plan (a very comprehensive Fortune 500 company) all agreed that cancer's cause was unknown and the only solution was to eliminate its presence (ie: cut it out now, immediately!). The alternative which Mr. Clapp proposes is to eliminate the cause, the source. As the Prosate90 web site also hosts a free and open discussion group (generally unmonitored except for uncivility) there is lively discussion and several research threads to follow.People are people. Doctors are doctors. Not all people and not all doctors are the same. I have been extremely fortunate to have procured the tools from this book and its on-line discussion group to gravitate to those medical professionals who truly care about curing the cause and not just eliminating the symptom indicated by a labortory assay.My own experience from reading this book and joining its discussion group, meeting with others with the same concerns, looking beyond so many different personalitites and attitudes presented therein, is that we have all achieved results above what statistics for PCa show.

The urologist recommended that I have surgery within 2 weeks, 4 if I wanted to donate my own blood. I sought a second opinion at a leading unversity hospital. The doctors there recommended surgery within 3 to 6 months. The cancer was contained within the prostate, so no mestasis was involved. I read Dr. Clapp's book thoroughly with much skepticism. I am a Christian and the education director for a large Southern Baptist Church. A detailed and careful study of scripture showed me that many of the recommendations were consistent with scripture. I read other writings by Christian authors who had experienced cancer cures without surgery, radiation or chemotherapy and found they followed similar programs. You might look at &quot;Why Christians Get Sick by Dr. George H. Malkmus or check out the writings of Lorraine Day.I committed to try the plan outlined by Dr. Clapp for 3 months then reassess. Within three months I was experiencing significant health gains that told me my prostate was shrinking from its enlarged state. At 6 months I had another PSA test which had fallen into the normal range. One year later, without surgery, radiation, hormones or chemotherapy, I was evaluated by a leading cancer radiologist who determined that there was nothing evident in my prostate that he could call cancer. I am 20 lbs lighter, and healthier than I have been in 20 years. I have no fear of cancer and will continue my new lifestyle for the rest of my life. A serious Bible student with an open mind led by the Holy Spirit will discern that Dr. Larry Clapp is describing the true path to health with respect to diet and care of the body as described in the Bible.

The book reads extremely well with several personal stories of the author's own trial and error. My wife decided to experiment with the author's &quot;Ultimate Fast&quot; and we were both shocked at how easy it was for her to follow. She literally had no headaches or discomfort. She felt she could have continued if she'd wanted to. I plan to follow this fast soon. The book does get alittle too New-Agey in the last few chapters for my particular taste. The author also has quite a few sexual suggestions for mere pleasure, not necessarily for your prostate. Entertaining. I was very pleased and would certainly pass this book along to anyone wanting to manage their own prostate health."},{"Title":"Prostate Health in 90 Days","review":"I bought the book immediately after being diagnosed withprostate cancer in January this year. It gives a reliable,holistic, serious approach to this disease and proposesan alternative 3 month program, definitely worth tryingbefore one goes in for any of the classical methods.I have done it and felt better after the first week. It trulychanged my life. One can go on and be operated on after completing this program, the result being certainly a bettergeneral health. The book led me to the discussion forum, veryvaluable for me, too.The author is a survivor of prostate cancer himself (well documentated on the net) and a learned person. The whole book issomething totally unusual , very clear and doesn't push thereader towards any kind of decision except to change his styleof life for the better. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Prostate Health in 90 Days","review":"It's interesting that almost every reviewer either gave this book one star or five stars. The ones that gave it five stars tried the suggestions in the book and the ones that gave it one star didn't. Sitting on your butt waiting for scientists to solve your problems is actually one of the causes of prostate cancer. Seriously, this is actually a great book on holistic healing - not just prostate healing. But, it is just a book - you have to do the work yourself.

The author has shared his personal experience in battling and defeating a dreaded disease (prostate cancer). It highlights many insights regarding the factors that contribute to its causes and lays out an easy to understand course of action to follow to defeat it. This can be done without the conventional medical recommendation of using drugs or surgery.This book is a must read for any man wishing to achieve good prostate health as well as for anyone wishing to achieve good health."},{"Title":"Prostate Health in 90 Days","review":"At first glance, Prostate Health in 90 Days looked like another good overview of the many avenues of alternative medicine -- written to apply specifically to those with prostate problems, and useful to both men and women interested in healing any condition or achieving optimum health. As I began to actually read the book, however, I found that Dr. Clapp has included some fascinating, yet completely common sense and scientifically validated ideas that even I -- a dedicated patient of alternative medicine -- had never heard of before. His program is designed to cleanse and heal the body through basic good health practices that are the cornerstone of the alternative health movement, and in addition he includes new information on monitoring one's &quot;biological terrain&quot; and preventing illness of all kinds through achieving the proper body pH. One caveat to the reader...in his zeal for completeness, Dr. Clapp also includes some optional practices that may be considered &quot;far out&quot;. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. This is a good smorgasboard of resorative alternatives to the often permanent damage of drugs and surgery, from which the reader can pick and choose what is appropriate to construct their own healing plan."},{"Title":"Prostate Health in 90 Days","review":"My father has been following Dr. Clapp's program for 4 years. He has never looked or felt better and his psa is again within normal range. His small tumor has reduced significantly in size as confirmed by ultrasound. Restoration of health is not something that can be achieved by cutting out or radiating a diseased organ. Those approaches simply treat the symptoms and not the cause of the illness. For those willing to make the effort, it is possible to provide one's body with the tools to heal itself. Dr. Clapp's book provides an excellent survey of the best methods available today to restore prostate and general health."},{"Title":"Prostate Health in 90 Days","review":"&quot;Prostate Health in 90 Days&quot; is excellent beyond words.

He effusively prasied the program while urging me to follow it. His ebullience convinced me to try it. I did and it is to my mind the single most important health program one can follow. I convinced my local health food shop to carry the book. It is something I will follow the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Prostate Health in 90 Days","review":"There seems to be an almost inexaustible supply of books describing the medical and surgical approaches to prostate cancer treatment.

Many thanks to Larry Clapp on their behalf.Here is part of a letter sent by a good friend recently....&quot;'Prostate Health in 90 Days' is about much more than healing and preventing prostate problems. It is based on a concept that many maladies including, but not limited to various cancers, originate in the digestive tract as a result of things such as eating bad foods and/or contracting parasites. Parasties, especially microscopic ones, do not usually show up on the typical GI exams. Other sources I've seen report this as a relatively widespread ailment for people in America.Judy and I read the book and decided that there was lots of good stuff in it for men and for women as far as things that can actively affect our own well-being. We followed a prescribed 10 day fasting routine which the author advocates... though we did not do so to cure any cancers. We each lost about10 pounds (a sustained side-benefit) and feel a distinct improvement in our inner feelings of well being.We've acquired a dozen or so copies to share with friends who are interested.&quot;"},{"Title":"Prostate Health in 90 Days","review":"If you're a man over 50, or if you have any symptoms of prostate problems - getting up too often at night to urinate, frequent urination, etc. - I advise you get this book.The author begins by explaining how he developed the protocols he espouses, which was through trial and error after he developed prostate problems.By far the most helpful - and easiest to implement - advice is in the first part of the book. Essentially, this is a body cleanse to rid the body of parasites. It consists of abstaining from solid food for eight days. In place of solid food you drink a nutritious blend of fresh lemon juice, organic maple syrup and cayenne pepper. You also add some supplements to this throughout the eight day \\"fast.\\"In essence, this alkalizes the body, making it inhospitable to harmful microorganisms, which is the first step of his program.Some of his subsequent recommendations are harder to follow, but they're definitely worth trying if at all possible.I followed all of his early chapter recommendations and found my own symptoms of an enlarged prostate diminish considerably as a result.Definitely a great book for men concerned about their prostate health!"},{"Title":"Prostate Health in 90 Days","review":"It will probably be a while before I'm sure how helpful the book will be.

After all, he kept himself in robust health for a very long time, in contrast to lots of men who perhaps prematurely had surgery. Furthermore, he was in his LATE 70s! He had 17 great years after his diagnosis!Notice that whenever you ask a guy how he is doing after surgery, he'll say he's fine. Probe deeper, though, and he will reveal he is not fine. Unless the cancer is aggressive, there's no need to run into the operating room. The two biggest lessons in the book are: 1. Detoxify a few times per year, and 2. Use power doppler ultrasound as your monitoring method, not a biopsy. Dr. Robert Bard in NYC is the man to go to, and your insurance will probably cover it. Blue Cross Federal Plan, for example, covers it.P.S. Great new lab test with fewer false positives than PSA may even be out right now--the EPCA-2 by Onconome Inc.

He did not even realize he was quoting Larry's book. Look, anyone who thinks that shooting the messenger is a good idea can just shoot his prostate. Larry's book can help you understand how you came to such a state and to take action to live a better way. My study indicates that cancer is a disease of toxicity. Larry's advise points the reader to emotional and physical cleansing. Doctor's don't have a clue. They will tell you about statistics, clinical trials and accepted practice. They are fighting disease. They would mop-and-mop and never think to turn-off the water. They understand nothing about health. Larry's advice is helping me improve my situation. My choice to smile at (and ignore my doctor's advise) may not work, but at least I will die a man. My doctor wants me to be an \\"it\\" wearing a diaper. He would chalk me up in his win column.

My trust in his integrity was rewarded._Before I received this oracle I was familiar the most of the other methods used through the centuries in China: tortoise shell, yarrow stalk, coin, flipping randomly through the classics- but I was not familiar with any fired clay tiles. The text, however, points out that such a method was first used some 5000 years ago. That is what this modern system is based upon- 16 tiles chosen at random. There are two duplicate sets of pieces, one in black and one in slate. The first three in each set are incised with the symbols for Tao, Ying, and Yang- the remaining five are marked with the symbols for water, fire, earth, metal, and wood. All sixty-four possible combinations are indexed with interpretations (meditations, really) in the included booklet._The quality of manufacture is excellent- the stones appear to be made of a high quality ceramic material (no crumbling or flaking), the included booklet is a quality printed softcover- tastefully designed and illustrated, the bag for the stones feels like red silk (though it isn't) and is covered with gold embroidered dragons, and the black lacquered case appears to be well done._Experience has proven to me that this method is indeed a legitimate oracle."},{"Title":"Gateway to Elsewhere","review":"Imagine that you are in a science fiction bull session back in the early 1950s. You are sitting by a warm fire in a neighbor's living room, nursing cups of coffee or glasses of coke in your hands. Somebody earnestly raises the question: \\"What sf writer would have the color, the poetry, the sense of the exotic to do justice to a modern treatment of the Arabian Nights?\\" Maybe Fritz Leiber or Jack Vance? Yes, they would be serious contenders. Maybe C.L. Moore or Leigh Brackett? (Remember the Northwest Smith and the Eric John Stark stories.) Possibly van Vogt? (After all, he _did_ write _The Book of Ptath_.) Somebody briefly mentions Poul Anderson, Theodore Sturgeon, and Ray Bradbury. Well, _maybe_...But who would seriously propose Murray Leinster? After all, he is so damned _prosaic_... And yet Leinster _did_ write such a book, while none of these other authors did. The book in question first appeared in _Startling Stories_ in 1952 under the title \\"Journey to Barkut.\\" It appeared as half of an Ace Double Novel in 1954 under the title _Gateway to Elsewhere_. The flip side of the book was A.E. van Vogt's _The Weapon Shops of Isher_, which was pretty stiff competition. But Leinster's novel was not a contemptible piece of writing.The book title is certainly a snappier one than the magazine title-- but not a more accurate one. The hero does not enter a fantasy world by crossing through a magic portal or gate or door. Rather, he leaves the city of New York and with the aid of a magic coin _journeys_ until he gradually makes his way to Barkut, an Arabian Nights type of country. There he has assorted adventures, mainly with _djinns_, _djinnis_, and beautiful slave girls. There are romantic interludes, but they are constantly interrupted by the comings and goings of other characters.It is all reasonably entertaining... but I found myself wishing for some of the things that weren't there. Where were the forty thieves? Where were the rocs? The mechanical flying horses of ebony and ivory? The flying carpets? The magical dancing fish of red and yellow and blue and white? The Old Man of the Sea, legs locked around his victim's neck? The crafty Viziers? The valleys of diamonds? The magic caves filled with treasure? The enchanted pomegranite seeds that can impregnate the wives in a harem? The giant serpents? The leviathans that are mistaken for islands by hapless sailors? Where are all of those things, eh?

The Victorian era could be harsh especially to an orphan and this is the tale of one. This is not the type of book I prefer to read and so the three stars means more I don't wish to pass judgement on it. It might be yours and Mary Nichols is not a bad author.From the dust cover of the Orion hard back edition...\`Sarah Jane had cast a spell on him that first day on the banks of the stream, which would bind him to her for the rest of his life - and whoever or whatever came between them could never alter that.'Set in the mid-Victorian era, against the wide water-colour skies of the Fens, The Stubble Field is the story of Sarah Jane Winterday, a workhouse orphan who yearns to be a lady. While skivvying at Chevington House, she enjoys a rapturous summer liaison with a mysterious young man, who gives her two love tokens: one is a golden apple, the other, her Son, Jason.Pregnant, and dismissed from her job, Sarah Jane joins a hand of railway navvies who are on the tramp looking for work. This is the age of the railway. All over the country track is being laid, tunnels drilled, and speculators are competing to make their fortunes. Her involvement in this world, first as a navvy wife, and later as a landowner, leads to a fated return to Chevington, and the rekindling of old loves. Meanwhile, the lessons of the years have taught Sarah Jane that her wish to be a lady was but a childish ambition; becoming a woman is what really counts.Reflecting the energy and pioneering spirit of the 1850s, which it brings to glorious life, this powerful love story is illuminated throughout by the golden apple - a precious symbol of the human heart."},{"Title":"The Magic of Walking","review":"Although this book is long out of print (1967), it is without argument an essential book for anyone of the walking persuasion.The authors give a delightful presentation of all the postive facets of the walking lifestyle. From the \\"pyschological magic\\" of walking to the \\"science and art\\" of walking, the authors don't miss a step.Explaining the subtelies and benefits of walking from a varied and vast plethora of world views, the \\"Magic of Walking,\\" is complete in both its study of walking and its lessons on walking.The origial content is suitably accompanied by a ramble through the literature of walking itself, including such works by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Vladimir Nabakov, Thomas Mann and Charles Dickens, among other notable writers.This collection, opening with the creme de la creme of walking literature, Walt Whitman's \\"Song of the Open Road,\\" gives the reader an even further and greater insight into the historical and philosophical aspects of walking.Anyone wanting to escape, not only by means of a walk, but by means of an accomplished book on walking, should not even breath a sigh of doubt or hesitation.As Emerson stated, with a blunt apparency that cannot be denied, \\"Society is always taken by surprise at any new example of common sense.\\" This book is a fine example thereof."},{"Title":"My War With Brian","review":"Although Ted Rall &quot;draws like he's using a Sharpie stuck in his armpit,&quot; I still have to admit his graphic novel is still very interesting despite the amateurish illustrations.Rall's recollections of his encounters with the Brian ring true to me. High school bullies can attack without rhyme or reason. They may be provoked by the appearance alone of their target. Their abuse can go on for as long as the bully cares to indulge his hatred - or until he learns their are costs to his actions.My War With Brian is an interesting novel for creating discussionon bullies; but I wouldn't recommend any of Rall's methods - though I suspect much of Rall's &quot;revenge&quot; isn't as sweet as he would like it to be.Off topic: having seen and read Ted Rall's political cartoons and books, I am compelled to say that if the adult Rall is anything like the boy Rall, then maybe Brian did have a reason for his actions. The ugliness of Rall's personality as expressed in his cartoons, tv appearances, and books is disgusting. So much so, that if I could go back in time, I might hold Brian's jacket while he pummelled Rall - and I fought bullies!Rall states that Brian &quot;made me what I am today&quot; so in that sense, if you want to know who made the monster that Ted Rall is today - and I've rarely met an uglier one - read My War With Brian. Maybe Rall was paying in advance for the &quot;sins&quot; of his adult life. Read the book."},{"Title":"My War With Brian","review":"A short graphic novel about parents and school personnel too lazy enforce, let alone teach, basic standards of civilization. Somewhat based on real life, Rall casts himself as an outsider in a bland late 1970s Midwestern suburb. A small kid, \\"too smart\\" and ethnically different, he was not considered important by either the adults or kids, and soon becomes the constant target of one angry and very violent kid.That there are bullies and nasty people is never unusual, but this book is unusually telling in that it exposes succinctly the blas&eacute; nihilism of late-\`70s middle America. Early on, Rall responds to another bully in a history class by sneaking up on the cretin and cracking him over the head with a desk. \\"Mr Bradford took the roll call, marking the unconscious student absent.\\" (p.9) Rall shows how the unmotivated, middleclass school teachers cared not about violence, learning, nothing...just getting by. The administration, the community just saw extreme violence and intimidation as \\"what boys do\\". Rall aptly calls this \\"a Darwinian nightmare of benign neglect.\\"I can testify that Rall's vision of that time and place is the correct one, and further that Rall's illustration of the consequences of adult nihilism is spot on. For 40 or so pages Rall shows how violence, vandalism, and youthful fighting are the ultimate effect of adults brushing their charges off with a stupid \\"you just have to learn to handle yourself\\". Like any war or feud, the battles escalate into something with little relation to the initial \\"cause\\", all because no one wanted to be responsible or be blessed as a peacemaker.Like many a Rall cartoon, the \\"background\\" comments are brilliant. In BRIAN the kids who witness the violents offer only a mind-numbed \\"oh, cool\\"; the attempt by kids to be in control is contrasted nicely to the stone indifference of adults.In the end of the tale, Rall allows people to escape death so he can show how the kids grow up to carry resentments and hate all their lives. (Rall says the kid who inspired the book actually killed himself.)This book is yet another part of Rall's general theme found in all his work: the indictment of today's institutions as cover for the most short-sighted and stupid bureaucratic mindset possible. It therefore fits Rall's jarring cartooning."},{"Title":"My War With Brian","review":"Just when you think Ted Rall's, \\"My War with Brian,\\" is going to be another run-of-the-mill victim story about bullying, this autobiographic tale takes a surprising shift when the misfit geek decides to fight back in shockingly savage fashion. And thus begins a full fledged war spanning the eternal length of time during Junior High and High School where Ted Rall learns to be a man, standing up for himself and exacting due punishment to those who strike at him, consequences be damned. At times, laugh out loud funny, this book will also shock in reminding you how brutal kids/teens can be to one another - the physical cruelty that Ted and Brian exact on one another is frightening in its murderous intent but just past that initial layer of shock comes a somewhat disturbing reminder of the cruelties adolescents face as they transition to adulthood."},{"Title":"My War With Brian","review":"This is both a tragic and a funny story. Ted's hellish grade school experiences produced scars that most of us have shadows of. Ted Rall mixes a strange hard mean exterior with a desire to point out sadness and occasional touching human contact that belies his detachment. Okay, well, some of his detachment. Anyhow, his art is interesting and the story is fascinating. My only complaint would be that it's a fairly expensive short story, but that's how all these cartoonists get so rich..."},{"Title":"My War With Brian","review":"I don't what it is with the off-kilter independent comic book artists.

While I was constantly getting beat on by a gang of openly white supremacist kids at the school, which was quite backward by Alaskan standards, I usually got the flack from school officials who were chummy with them. Other than the extremes of the ultraviolence, I think people should think twice before thinking this is some kind of exaggeration for effect by Rall. Ted Rall's visual style is great, too, and I was happy to see that people who bought My War with Brian also read Ruben Bollings, another superb comic genius. I think Rall is a good representative of us 30-somethings born in the 60s, too - a more or less Lost Generation between the baby-boomers and their echo generation, but which includes the whole Brat Pack and cartoonists like Tom Tomorrow, Rall, and, I believe, Bollings."},{"Title":"My War With Brian","review":"Ted Rall is nothing if not a masterful teller of his own story.

Unfortunately, I was too easily able to relate to Rall's situation in high school... This book is a must for PARENTS who maybe can't relate to what some kids are going through at the hands of privileged bullies."},{"Title":"My War With Brian","review":"Ted Rall is so outrageous that I would consider him the political writer whose comic supernatural powers allow him to do things that I can only talk about. Until we get to philosophy, of course, where the intellectual death wish sweepstakes rears its ugly head in ways that are as intense as the feelings described in the 66 pages of MY WAR WITH BRIAN, an episode in junior high school that reflects American politics so well, you can forget the adults. They haven't got a clue about anything.The theme is MY WAR WITH BRIAN is bullies, but Ted Rall seems outraged that Americans live in a society in which others rarely have the opportunity to do anything to help victims. Close to the end of the book, Rall summarizes the situation with, \\"Actually, most conflicts are stupid and pointless, but they're impossible to avoid. Given that hard reality, I figure that pacifism is impossible.\\" And on the next page, \\"I guess I still believe in God.\\" It establishes his opposition to hyper-masculinity so effectively, that his young age hardly subtracts from the wisdom of a supreme being allowing the right people to get revenge on the haughty, which might be the highest ideal our society will ever achieve.One of the characters who was under the most pressure is only in the introduction, shortly before Rall admits \\"reading the newspaper at age 5, Sartre at 8\\":\\"He had troubles with bullies, but his biggest problem in life was his father. Dad was a Protestant minister, and he insisted that Bill follow in his footsteps. Unfortunately, Bill thought . . .\\"You really don't want to know that part, and the most exciting part of the intellectual death wish sweepstakes was the awareness on the side of young people who have questions that no one can answer of all the things Bill and Ted Rall would be willing to put down on paper and publish, especially after Bill ends up in the one dead buddy category, which certainly seemed queer to people who thought that killing other people made more sense than self-destruction. My dad was also a Protestant minister, but American society had made that such a simpleton's role that being \\"doomed to a life in the clergy\\" seemed a bit lame for anyone who was capable of accomplishing anything. Like most intellectual death wish sweepstakes observations, this attempt to clarify the nature of American society is unlikely to be considered a major accomplishment, but it magnifies my admiration for Ted Rall. He has paid his dues at the hemlock for Socrates altar, and all you have to do, to see how he did it, is to buy this book."},{"Title":"My War With Brian","review":"Mr. Rall sent me a text only version of this book through e-mail and I loved it!

Not only did I walk away with a bag full of essences to start my own personal practice, but more importantly, with a sense of peace and gentle harmony with desert nature that Cynthia Athina Kemp Scherer not only teaches, but lives.Her book starts off with a brief, but potent, history of her own background and how she began making desert essences in the first place. The bulk of the book focuses on all the individual essences, including composite formulas as well as ones she is currently researching (seems essence producers research them for YEARS, before pulling them out of that category!) At the beginning of each essence, she lists the &quot;Harmonizing Qualities&quot; and &quot;Patterns of Imbalance&quot; she's found to be associated with that particular flower. At the end of each entry, she lists several statements under the heading, &quot;Indicated When:&quot; For example, under &quot;Desert Holly&quot;, it is indicated when: &quot;I am afraid I will appear to be unloving. I feel obligated to love a certain person. I want to love more fully and freely. I feel blockages in my heart and am trying to work at removing them.&quot; She also lists if it is a component of a composite formula as well.One section I found particularly helpful was the Cross Reference. Here she lists various &quot;states of harmony and disharmony&quot; then corresponds each to the flower essence(s) that would be most helpful for either enhancing or dissipating that quality.Needless to say, my copy is already looking quite dog-eared and worn (after only 2 weeks!) But I wouldn't have it any other way. If you feel drawn to flower essences and especially to the incredible survival power and wonderfully adaptive nature of the not-so-dead desert arena, this book is a MUST-HAVE.

Coyle offers basic advice for people pondering retirement. The book outlines straightforward strategies for saving and investing, and urges investors to start early and to put as much as they can into 401(k) plans and IRAs. So much for the obvious. Coyle also offers specific and useful guidelines for buying mutual funds and allocating assets. He realistically presents issues you may face in retirement, such as the emotional difficulties involved in leaving a career and having enough money to support your lifestyle (so buy a bond instead of that snazzy watch). Some of the book's basic advice will seem redundant to sophisticated investors, but the more detailed information will intrigue even them. We at getAbstract recommend this book for anyone looking for guidance about saving and investing for retirement. [getAbstract note: The investment advice here - tax laws, stock markets, and what not - is extremely U.S.-oriented, although the lifestyle information is broadly applicable.]"},{"Title":"How to Retire Young and Rich (Money America's Financial Advisor)","review":"How to Retire Young and Rich was definitely a good read, providing much general information. It didn't focus on retiring at an age that I would call \\"young\\" or with an amount of wealth that I think would qualify you as \\"rich.\\" He suggests that most retired people (in general of course) require about 80% of their pre-retirement income. While this is all well and good, I expect that most people who desire to retire \\"young and rich\\" are going to require more than 80% of their pre-retirement income to fund their new financially independent lifestyle.He does have a couple worksheets in the book that help quantify the amount that you will want to retire on, and the amount you need to save in order to make that happen.Besides the worksheets I mentioned above, the book seems to be more geared toward those closer to retirement (say, in their 40's or 50's), even suggesting the top 20 cities for retirees. Also, he appears to anticipate a retirement somewhere between 60 and 65, which I would not consider exceptionally young. Therefore, the title was not very well chosen and is a bit misleading.

If you want an easy introduction of most of the topics (but pretty older), then, grab Walter Enders book or, the more complicated, but also more complete book of James D. Hamilton. Reading this manual is easy because it's clear and its style is not boring. If you really love finance econometrics, you'll find this book fun to read. The fields covered by the authors are: 1.-Linear models (pretty brief), unit roots, seasonality and aberrant observations; 2.-Regime-switching models for returns such as TAR (Threshold Autoregressive), SETAR,...; 3.-Regime switching models for volatility (and here you'll have the entire family of ARCH models, with its youngest cousins such as GARCH QGARCH, LSTGARCH, VS-GARCH); 4.-Artificial Neural Network for returns. I'm particularly interested in GARCH-type models, and I can tell this part is particularly well done. At the end of the chapter there is a very illuminating empirical comparison between the models.

It is particularly in forecasting and more accurately describing returns and volatility where the non-linear models offer considerable advantages over linear models.Since there are considerable candidate non-linear time series models available for the modeler or forecaster of economic time series, selecting the right model from the get-go can be difficult. Of course, if you have had good lecture notes from your grad program, you are set. If not, then this book does help you along the way. It is an up to-date guide and provides a rigorous treatment of non-linear models.

The authors spent too much time on elaborating a comprehensive chapter on linear models when it was sufficient to cite a few references in case the reader wasn't familiar with the required background.Some demonstrations and explanations were left uncovered which means that you will have to rely on other sources such as Hamilton (1994) to get the whole picture.This is not a self-teaching guide but one important source in this field."},{"Title":"Lone Star Baby (Heart of Texas , No 6)","review":"Pregnant and all alone, Amy Thornton arrived in Promise, Texas, hoping for a miracle to help straighten out her life.

All Amy wished for was a home, a job and a father for her baby. The first two were easy. But as Wade and Amy got to know one another, Wade found that maybe he was the answer to her last wish.Loving it. Even though I did find the heroine to be annoying when it came to the relationship between herself and the pastor, this story was absolutely perfectly written. There was a nice balance of humor, drama, romance and conflict. The story was well paced even though there wasn't much really going in the plot. It was a mellow story that flowed from one chapter to the next. I couldn't put the book down. The hero, Wade, was an absolute sweetheart. As a confirmed bachelor, he was reluctant to even think of marrying. But as soon as he realized that he wanted to know and love Amy, he didn't let anyone get in the way. Even if it meant fighting for her honor. Amy was a nice girl that got a bad lot in life, but despite the wonderful people of Promise and Wade's devotion, she refused to give up her victim role. It can be a bit annoying. The story didn't just focus on Amy and Wade. Past characters will make frequent visits throughout the story and you will get their stories as well. Side note, this is a clean romance.This was definitely one of Mrs. Macomber's best. A clean, gentle, sweet romance that a Christian romance reader would definitely like.

And it didn't. One positive thing, it is easier to keep track of the characters here than in some other audiobooks.The reader does a good job with the voices, though Amy's &quot;protector&quot; Dovie tends to sound like an old woman, real old.Routine happenings here, nothing unusual or even remarkable: for example, Lyle Whitehouse, the so-called cow-hand, approaching Amy with &quot;lust in his heart&quot; (and being what Amy found to be &quot;unmannerly&quot;) and then having to fight the upright pastor, Wade (whose heart is, of course, pure). Ever heard or seen that one before? If you haven't, you've missed many an &quot;oater.&quot;In fact, the whole plot, such as it is, reminds me of an old western, but even duller. I doubt that I'll ever have occasion to read anything by Ms. Macomber again, or any Harlequins for that matter. Unless I'm lost on a desert island with only that one book.

For professional Hispanic marketers it makes a very good work establishing common bases of knowledge and standardizing conceptual language.I am particularly enjoying the cases which are an excellent source of shared knowledge.

Carlene Inge describes shadow traits in herself; prior to marriage and motherhood, she could not, in her words see how anybody could leave their church and issues were clearly deliniated in black and white (\\"it either is or it is not\\") with minimal shades of gray. This is not to say she is on the spectrum; rather it is to say that very (in her words) \\"rigid\\" thinking and not catching the gray tones in between is very typical among the autism/Asperger's (a/A) population.This is a wonderful book by a mother of two sons on the (a/A) spectrum. The book focuses on her older son, Joshua who was born in 1997. Joshua was misdiagnosed with muscular dystrophy as a baby; fortunately the Inges pursued other treatment avenues and learned that their child did not have muscular dystrophy. He was diagnosed as a preschooler with Asperger's.Joshua had sensory issues; he liked to wear soft clothing such as sweats. Toys were largely ignored by him; however, he did like to have them placed strategically in a room in the order he assigned them.One thing that bothered me was that when Joshua was bestowed with lavish toys from infancy was how the adults reacted to his disinterest in the toys. Since he was the first child and grandchild, it was only natural to want to give him lavish gifts. Since the adults mourned over Josh's lack of spontaneous interest in the toys, it does beg the question of who were the toys really for - the boy or for the adults and the response they hoped to get.Josh's stoic tolerance of unpleasant activities such as daycare and early birthday parties speaks to a very accepting side. Since the child's mother told him what the expectations were, he apparently felt he had no option but to endure the activity in question. I like the way Carlene Inge realized that birthday parties were too overwhelming for Josh; the noise, kids and confusion were more than he could tolerate. I loved the way she learned to adjust celebrating Josh's birthday as a \\"family day,\\" where the boy gets her undivided attention and is allowed to pick out a fun activity. That sounded like an ideal approach for him.The balloon metaphor is especially meaningful in this particular book. As a toddler, Josh loved to release helium balloons and watch them float away. Carlene Inge sees in this simple act of joy through release a form of letting go and letting God. That is such an important life lesson and an important reminder.Joshua's brother Noah, some 2 years Joshua's junior was also described as having autistic behaviors. He had serious sensory issues, particularly oral sensitivity and was largely nonverbal. Very little is said about Noah; one wonders where he is on the continuum today and about his overall progress.At the close of this book, Josh, then 9 was an avid, enthusiastic member of a local baseball team and a Star Wars afficionado. His interests are listed and described; special interests are so often a hallmark of a/A spectrum conditions. Readers feel as if they have been lifted on eagle's wings as Josh's progress is outlined in this book.I love the way God is mentioned and recognized throughout the book; the kind people whose generosity and simple courtesies are recognized as acts of Christian compassion or \\"Jesus in disguise;\\" the inclusion of faith sharing and the many ways God is described in the book as making lemonade out of lemons. My favorite aspect of this book is the inclusion of God and how compassion and acceptance opened many doors to Josh and Noah.This book reminds me of the 1980 Pete Townshend classic, \\"Let My Love Open the Door (to your heart).\\" God's love has indeed opened many doors to many hearts and this book is yet another passageway.Ideal companion book toJust This Side of Normal: Glimpses into Life With Autism."},{"Title":"Bye Bye Balloon: An Introductory Guide to Asperger Syndrome","review":"Carlene Inge has written a beautiful book. On the surface the work is a delightful, poignant, humble, and reverent introduction to Asperger's disorders for parents of young children newly diagnosed. Ms. Inge describes her heartbreak, and the eventual triumph, of a mother who just wouldn't give in to the diagnosis, with all its implications for family life, love, and relationships. She gives the parent in her shoes a sense of hope, a vision of the beauty of a child who is just a little different, witness to the power of faith, and an outline of a strategy for personal advocacy. For me, at another level, as a psychologist working with children professionally for over 30 years, the book gave me a glimpse of what Asperger's disorder looks like from the other side. Clinical detachment is of course a necessary thing, but this book also gives the professional an insight from the personal and human side of a disorder that can so often tear a family apart, a glimpse of the reality of its pain and joys, and, most important, the crucial role of a sensitive clinician in helping a family make the passage. We keep several copies in our university clinic for parents and developing professionals alike. Written in elegant but accessible style, the book gives back to the world the blessings that Ms. Inge, through her faith in God and her own will to do whatever it takes, has found in her children's disorder."},{"Title":"Bye Bye Balloon: An Introductory Guide to Asperger Syndrome","review":"I read this book in its entirety in one sitting-although not planning to do that, I couldn't put it down. \\"Bye Bye Balloon\\" is incredibly helpful in sharing the pain, frustration, and the heart-felt joy involved in raising and relating to a child with any type of special needs, not just Asperger.

It continues - &quot;Although Harum directly addresses the renal patient, she offers an indispensable synopsis of renal nutrition for the professional as well. Her book touches on every topic from soup to nuts. It presents simple explanations of the mechanics of kidney function and kidney disease for the patient and facilitates application of this knowledge to nutrition practice by the dietitian. Let's be honest. Renal dietitians understand renal nutrition and renal disease. For the rest of us, it's a foreign language. Even the clinical dietitian who sees renal patients periodically may view renal nutrition as a perplexing topic. When contact with renal patient is sporadic, dietitians may often feel that they are starting from scratch with every encounter. It's difficult to illustrate a renal plan that will meet patients' needs without overwhelming them. The Renal Lifestyles Manual helps dietitians overcome that stumbling block to effective counseling. The book explains conservative predialysis management in simple terms for patients, describes the usual course of disease and discusses courses of nutritional and medical treatment. It lists specific predialysis diet plans for a variety of patient needs and each diet is followed by sample menus. These sample menus are indispensable teaching tools that translate diet principles into practice for the patient. Deceptively simple tools, they effectively enable clients to internalize as well as act on pertinent information. This section is followed by sections on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Each category has a specific section covering diabetic diets for those on the various types of didalysis. Additional sections address other aspects of diabetes and renal nutrition including hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, neuropathy and foot care. The book discusses strategies to manage phosphorus, vitamin D, potassium, fluid levels, estimated &quot;dry weight&quot;, weight loss, weight gain, and anemia.....I highly recommend this book to all practitioners no matter how removed they may be from renal nutrition. I will enjoy having it on my bookshelf as a handy primer on renal nutrition. ---Mary Anne Clairmont RD"},{"Title":"Renal Lifestyles Manual","review":"I'd recommend this to patient/caregiver for anyone with even the onset of renal failure.

This compilation of facts concerning proffessions dealing with the law and the law itself often pokes fun at not only attorneys and lawmakers, but those who make use of them, i.e. moronic lawsuits and things of this nature. Despite the title, the book does not take a harsh prejudice against attorneys, and many of the facts actually glorify the profession rather than painting them as vampires. In fact, I didnt understand the use of Dracula in the title, because technically he was a lawyer, but only in the sense that any other absolute ruler would be in that they are in essence the lawyer, judge, jury and executioner. I thought this was a rather weak basis to title the book, especially when the book does not make a point to paint attorneys with the image of vampires, but rather takes an unbiased motive to simply display facts. But this not withstanding, the book was, as I said, very entertaining and I very highly recommend it to anyone interested in or dealing with the law, or someone looking for a pretty quick amusing read."},{"Title":"Trees","review":"A book that purports to explain everything about trees from how they evolved to how modern forests are managed had better have an author of broad knowledge and experience with a multitude of tree subjects. Unfortunately that is not the case here. Had this been a book on \\"The Biomechanics of Trees\\", or \\"Tree and Wood Structure\\", it would be a very good book indeed, as these topics are competently handled, and fall within the author's expertise. But in broadening his treatment, the author has had to wander onto the kind of thin ice that produces many, many mistakes, inaccuracies, and even blunders. And if the facts in a factual book cannot be relied upon, the reader cannot be expected to take any of the book's assertions on faith.Here are some of these errors of fact, many of which could have been caught if standard references were consulted: Trees are very vulnerable to drought; root systems of young trees are \\"dominated\\" by their tap roots; a tree's roots extend only as far out as the tree's crown; bristlecone pines grow from the Mexican border to Colorado, the tallest ones are found above 10,000 feet elevation, and the bristlecone species in Colorado is Pinus longaeva; coast redwood grows only to 335 feet in height, and giant sequoia to 317 feet; tall Koompassia trees can only supply water to relatively few leaves because they are so tall (though much taller redwoods support great masses of leaves); Siberian larches are deciduous because the winters are too harsh for survival of evergreen leaves (though their associated pines and spruces seem not to know that); coast redwood seedlings cannot grow in the shade of a redwood canopy, and their \\"cones have to wait until the forest is destroyed by fire, before they open\\"; silviculture is the extraction of trees one at a time or in small clearings to be replaced naturally by saplings that then spring up in the light gap; and one of the disadvantages of plantations is that \\"because the young trees are not sheltered by mature ones, they can easily lose their leading shoot....\\"I can't find a reference on my shelf to tell me how many tree species there are in the world, but I am very dubious about Ennos' claim (stated multiple times) that there are about 80,000. If so, North America has fewer than 1% of the world's tree diversity, which seems ridiculous on its face."},{"Title":"Trees","review":"This book explains why differnt trees are designed differently to meet different living conditions. The book answers questions such as: Why be a tree? How did trees evolve? How do trees lift water? How do trees stand up? Survival strategies in different parts of the ecosystem.This book is both simple and detailed, very approachable and well illustrated. While not particularly excited over biology topics, I find myself unable to put this book down. For a reader like me, it has a great quality: it is free of jargon and comprehensive inventory of species."},{"Title":"Trees","review":"Most of the books about living organisms, from trees to mushrooms to dogs to fish, that are accessible to an average reader with little foundation in biology, are field guides or guides to care and breeding. More technical books that explain cell structure, biochemistry, biomechanics, etc., are just too technical for the non-specialist to understand. This books attempts, with some success I think, to offer the non-specialist, non-biologist, some insight into the science of trees while still being accessible to those with little or no background in biology.Another reviewer with more knowledge than I have found some errors in the text. However he also lauded the book for its discussion of biomechanics and wood structure. I agree with him that the book is particularly good in those areas, and I think it's not bad in the others.If you've ever wondered how water gets to the top of a tree (it's pulled up by suction), why old trees are often hollow (the dead wood on the inside is eaten by fungus), what the roles of different kinds of wood are in sustaining the tree (transporting water, transporting sugars, protection, strength), and so on, this is a very easy and informative introduction to the subject.Many of us walk past a tree without thinking about it. That the tree is a living organism, that it lives longer than we do, that it is larger and weighs more than any other living thing most of us have ever seen, that it adapts to local conditions, that there are diverse living processes taking place behind its staid exterior - these are all things many of us have never have really thought about. We usually just pass on by, unconscious of the marvels that stand around us.Ennos' book only begins to tell us the things there are to learn about trees. There's nothing here about photosynthesis, metabolism, chemical signaling, cell division, meristems, etc. There is a thousand times more to learn for those who get into the subject. But it's a quick and easy read with useful illustrations for anyone who doesn't intend to develop deep knowledge but does want to know more than the field guides provide."},{"Title":"Bosworth 1485: Psychology of a Battle (Revealing History)","review":"The battle of Bosworth marked the end of the reign of Richard III. Today it is one of the most intriguing medieval battles that took place in history with not enough information known.The traditional view of where the battle took place has been a controversial point along with where the key players of the battle took place. Mr. Jones provides new insight and offers an entirely new perspective on the attitude of Richard III.Jones overturns Shakespeares account separating the literary Richard III from the historical figure showing us a man who knew and understood medieval chivalry, battle tactics and the society in which he lived.Jones touches on the illegitmacy of Edward IV, his similarity between his role at Bosworth and his father's role in 1441 in Pontoise and the significance of the crown that he wore into battle.Jones relocation of the battle to the villages of Atherstone, Atterton and Fenny Drayton commands not only our attention but more research into the villages and locations in proximity to the current and traditional location.The book is beautifully illustrated with maps showing the new and traditional sites.

I had, for reasons that escape me, great difficulty getting the book finally having to get a used copy from Alibris but the effort was well rewarded. I am not a specialist in that period of history or the battle but found the book well written and convincing . It was interesting to say the least to have a different point of view about Richard III from the one most of us have from reading and seeing Shakespeare. And most of all for a reader interested in military history is was a good read."},{"Title":"Bosworth 1485: Psychology of a Battle (Revealing History)","review":"If you are interested in Richard III I think you'll really like this book. You need a basic understanding of the War of the Roses, Richard III and the Battle of Bosworth before you read this book, so if you are learning about Richard for the first time I would suggest reading a good general book or books on those three subjects first. This book has a large number of really good color and black and white photos and drawings, several maps, a family tree from Edward III, and a War of the Roses timeline."},{"Title":"Bosworth 1485: Psychology of a Battle (Revealing History)","review":"This is respectfully addressed to the third reviewer of this book. Since you've decided to make most of your review about the author having his facts wrong I have to point out that it is you that are mistaken. Richard III based his claim to the throne on Edward IV's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville being invalid and therefore the children of this marriage illegitimate, not on the basis of Edward IV being illegitimate himself. And illegitimate children cannot inherit the crown whether their father is lawful king or not. You can check on the facts and learn more about this by doing a bit of research. But since you seem to know everything about the subject and want to educate everyone maybe you don't need to. After all you KNOW Richard III killed Edward's sons. Were you there or what incontrovertible proof do you have? Please share it with us. Historians have puzzled over this for years and all along you had all the answers."},{"Title":"Bosworth 1485: Psychology of a Battle (Revealing History)","review":"I found this book to be well written and very clever in its presentation. While Battle of Bosworth remains one of the main subjects of the book, its not the true subject of the book. The true subject of the book rest on the author's efforts to restored King Richard III's good name and hopes that his actions were done in honor and respect while maintaining the ruthless elements of his days.However, the author failed to make his points because he failed to delivered on certain elements of logic and facts that cannot be changed. Even if we accept the illogical fact that Edward IV was not a legitimate heir of the House of York, he remains the legitimate King of England. As a legitimate King of England, Richard swore an oath of loyalty to him as his lord and liege. While Edward's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville was unpopular, it was legal. Their two children cannot be considered as bastards even if their father was. (Sons of a bastard is not a bastard themselves.) If their father was the legitimate King of England, then they were his legitimate heirs and Edward V was Richard's lawful and legitimate King. They cannot be bastardized because of their father's status. The author totally missed this point in his long chapters which from his perception, seem to legalized Richard's actions because his older \\"half brother\\" (according to the author's premise) was not a true heir to the House of York. That shouldn't matter at all.I think the author was bit obsessive about how Shakespeare protrayed Richard III instead of how historians protrayed him.Richard did murdered his nephews, he did overthrow a legitimate young ruler to gained power and he lost his throne and crown to an upstart Henry Tudor who probably had every right to be more ruthless due to his initial lack of foundation of his family rule. I have no doubts that Richard did have many redeeming quality as the author like to point out and he was a \\"man of his time\\". But his actions reflects a power hungry man who wanted to be King of England. He fought well at Bosworth and was let down by his other commanders. The author failed to explained why Richard allowed himself to be place in a situation where he might be easily betrayed.The battle analysis was bit better and I really kind of wished that the author stay on this with greater degree. His attempts to turn Richard's reputation proves to be bit meaningless and it took away from what should be the main subject of the book."},{"Title":"Psychology, Sixth Edition in Modules","review":"I used this textbook for a 101- class course, and my experience was excellent.

Who to believe?I read a ton of books on marketing, sales, business biography, personal development, etc. In general, I try to find a few tasty morsels from each book... \\"one good idea\\" to be worth the price of the book.Reading this book was like going through a buffet - with tons of great ideas, and insight into business; both in history, and how those lessons are aplicable today. In fact, I recieved a few concrete ideas which I'm acting on, which will I'm sure result in hundreds of thousands in income to me in the next couple years.The old adage - you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make em drink is true. Joe Vitale can expose a great idea or piece of advice, but if one doesn't take action, what good is it?For $15? good value - read the book with a pen / highligter in hand, and make notes - and take action on those ideas.Knowledge is not power - knowledge is potential power.

This book is what you get when Joe Vitale sets aside his aggressive, non-stop self marketing campaign for a moment and delivers a rich thesis on one of the greatest salespeople to ever walk the earth. For the record, Barnum did not say \\"There's a sucker born every minute.\\" The quote actually comes from one of his competitors...Google it and see for yourself.This book is more substantive and less \\"carrot-dangling\\" than some of Joe's other work. Jeffrey Gitomer provides the Foreword, and Vitale's book...coupled with Gitomer's own recentLittle Platinum Book of Cha-Ching: 32.5 Strategies to Ring Your Own (Cash) Register in Business and Personal Success (Jeffrey Gitomer's Little Books)(itself a \\"revised and updated\\" version of his \\"Patterson Principles of Selling,\\" based on the late-1800s sales creed of the president of the National Cash Register Company), would nicely complement any modern-era sales volumes on your bookshelf.I'm going out on a limb here and say that Joe probably reads his Amazon reviews. So, Mr. Vitale, here's my direct message to you. You would provide greater value and a greater level of service to your loyal customers if you offered more stand-alone books such as this one and fewer items that are merely a conduit to purchasing your other products. Thank you for this book, and while your readers learn the lessons contained within, hopefully you will learn a lesson or two yourself.The book also reprints Barnum's \\"The Art of Money Getting,\\" a speech contained in his 1869 autobiography \\"Struggles and Triumphs,\\" and \\"Barnum's Rules for Success,\\" an article he wrote in 1852 which later appeared in the 1855 edition of his biography.In closing, once again, I want to clearly state that this isn't an open invitation to begin accumulating the collective works of Joe Vitale. This book is an exception to the rule he's created himself. It's worth owning and I recommend it. Beyond this book, caveat emptor."},{"Title":"There's a Customer Born Every Minute: P.T.

I have an original signed copy of his autobiography and even an original copy of his book on money. The man was a marketing genius, but more so a creative master.In this book, the author shows how to apply P.T. Barnum's principles to any kind of organization - a great value to us today. I love the fact that he has included some of the writings of Barnum because it will show people that he really was more than a \\"circus guy\\".I'm also glad he dispels the myth that Barnum said, \\"There's a sucker born every minute.\\" Of course, this was more likely said of Barnum one time when he was conned. Barnum, from all historical records, was an ethical man - a man of integrity. When he pulled one over on people, he let them know it. For example, he had a sign in his NYC museum that said, \\"This way to the Egress.\\" Most people didn't know that an egress is an exit and they would pay, I believe 5 cents, to exit the museum. However, if anyone was upset, Barnum would refund them their money and let them back into the museum.Ever heard of a \\"rain check\\". Mr. Barnum came up with this concept. You'll learn about all of his most important ideas in this book. I highly recommend it.Tom Carpenter"},{"Title":"There's a Customer Born Every Minute: P.T.

This book is filled with excellent marketing advice that ANYONE or any business could benefit from. Direct marketing, publicity stunts, the internet, infomercials, networking, negotiating, mass marketing, publicity, Joe covers it all! In fact, he may be the most successful individual marketing on the internet today! Having known Joe for many years and being responsible for bringing him to Nightingale-Conant and producing \\"The Power of Outrageous Marketing\\" with him - I can tell you first-hand, he's not some so-called pie-in-the-sky wanna-be guru giving you advice that he does not follow. He walks his talk. Joe became a multi-millionaire following his own advice! Do you think a millionaire could teach you a thing or two? Not only is Joe a successful businessman - he's also a stellar humanitarian involved in too many causes to list here! Could you learn a thing or two from a well-known humanitarian? Joe is also wealthy physically as he lost almost 100 pounds following his own advice on fitness. Having worked with hundreds of authors during my tenure at Nightingale-Conant, I've never had another author have such a lasting impact on me. Not only was he the most credible author I ever worked with in eight years at Nightingale-Conant. He was the most fun, hard working, easy-to-get-along-with person. Not to mention a good friend!

I thought that I have had some pretty crazy adventures moving aircraft around here in the United States, but they are nothing compared to the situations that Gordon and his group had to endure.

It starts out fast and never looses its quick pace. The author makes you feel as though you are right there with him in his quest for these rare WW11 aircraft. I am fascinated by the aircraft and that aspect is wonderfully detailed, but of equal value are the descriptions of the inner workings of the Russian Business world.

This is a fun book to read and will give you a great sense of adventure and accomplishment."},{"Title":"Warbird Recovery: The Hunt for a Rare WWII Plane in Siberia, Russia","review":"This is a great read. Gordon's adventures in Russia fall into the category of \\"someday we'll laugh about this\\". By sheer coincidence, I was traveling in Russia in 1993 just a few months before Gordon's first visit. Alas, I was cheated; I experienced no bedbugs, no shakedowns, no raw cod liver, no KGB tails, no self-promoting hookers, no rotgut vodka, no cold showers. I guess I was lucky to be in Moscow and not Siberia.Gordon does a great job of describing his trials and tribulations in dealing with various shady characters, all out for a buck. Or more often, 5,000 bucks. His quest to get the WW2 crashed aircraft back to the US is described in fascinating detail, and you get that feeling of \\"I'm glad I'm just reading about this and not doing it\\".

This journey starts with Gordon Page's childhood dream of flying a Messerschmitt 109 and grows into a real life adventure.After the break-up of the USSR Russia was open for business with the West for the first time in decades. Buyers were looking for treasures and just about anybody was willing to take their money. As the author goes on his own treasure hunt for vintage aircraft he encounters the Russian mafia, the KGB and questionable dealers who always want cash in advance. Along the way he experiences the breakdown of just about everything in Russia. His focus on what he wants and a willingness to follow his dream when it looks like there is no hope brings the search to a surprising end.Recommended for high school, college and public libraries particularly where there is an interest in aviation and recent history."},{"Title":"Warbird Recovery: The Hunt for a Rare WWII Plane in Siberia, Russia","review":"Take a safe journey to Siberia Russia through the pages of Gordon's book.

Wow, few of us who view restored warbirds can appreciate the effort that goes into them. This is a rare look behind the scenes and is quite an adventure story. Gordon Page does a great job at transporting the reader in time an place to experience the journey to Russia along with him. The many side trips along the way are the real gems!

A million dollars wouldn't be out of order at all, depending on condition. Although there were some 3300 P-63's built, only a handfull remain, and most of these are not in flying condition.Would you go to Russia?Gordon Page did. And he found lots (30 perhaps) P-63's. From the photograph on the back, with the engine over here, the wings gone, the tail missing; I don't think that you can just put fuel in it and fly it away.His story of traveling to Russia leaves me with the impression that he is lucky to be alive. And he reports that his wife has refused to let him go again.Then after that, he made another trip, this time in search of a Me-109. He found it, he bought it, and another miracle, they shipped it. Not only did they ship it, but they included a second Me-109. Now, with a million dollars, you can get a flying Messerschmitt.I'm passing this book along to a friend of mine who goes to Russia (not far from the P-63's) a couple of times a year (gold mining) to see if he can find a P-63 -- it would be almost worth it's weight in gold.He went to Russia in 1993. This was one of the first to begin to try to do business in Russia.

Also well written for someone not familiar with the topic to jump directly to a specific section.It covers concepts of distributed systems, the object model, middleware, CORBA, uORB, object adapters, IDL, XML, WSDL, SOAP, UDDI. It is not an in-depth book in any of these, but provides a very good overview, and solid concept and foundation of all of those areas. Does contain some sample code to illustrate points discussed.Highly recommended for a quick overview of the technical concepts involved in distributed systems"},{"Title":"The Joy of Dating Again","review":"The Joy of Dating Again is a to-do book.

A given is the unity of the the political and the personal. In addition, there is a general agreement that the fragile individual's psychological health is specifically threatened by modern society's abject failure to provide adequate supports, which would provide a sort of societal &quot;holding&quot; environment. In addition, capitialism's destabilization of the old social structures is cited in &quot;The Culture of Uncertainty,&quot; by Paul Hoggett. In the background of many of these essays are the ideas of British stalwarts Winnicott, Melanie Klein, WR Bion. Many, many more thinkers are cited. Topics include nuclear war, racism, sexism, politics,cynicism, changing notions of the self, witchcraft (!) and AIDS. It's a set of complex and sometimes difficult essays, not polemical, but convincing - and well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Timeless","review":"I've read and enjoyed all of Shelly Thacker's books, and TIMELESS, a spin-off of one of her best titles (FOREVER HIS) is terrific! I was hooked from page 1, intrigued with the idea of Asgard Island and its mysterious inhabitants, and quickly found myself immersed in this magical place and time. Avril and Hauk are two people who each know the pain of love lost, and struggle with opening their hearts to that pain again. I found their journey toward a future together very satisfying and highly entertaining. Sigh...another keeper!"},{"Title":"Timeless","review":"I read quite a lot of romance books but I'm fairly new to the &quot;Fantasy&quot; genre. This has been my favorite by far. I'll be looking for more by this author."},{"Title":"Timeless","review":"Intriguing fantasy story set on Asgard Island. The author develops a society that in many ways seems an ideal one. Would have loved to see more of the action and story explore this society and how the people who live there feel about it. The interaction between the hero and heroine was nice...but perhaps not memorable, which was too bad as I did like the characters of the hero and heroine."},{"Title":"Timeless","review":"Shelley Thacker is one of my favorite writers, and TIMELESS spotlights her wonderful talent. If you're looking for adventure, romance, and a fast-paced read, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Timeless","review":"I enjoyed the story very much and the ending was just and satisfying. My only complaint, and it is indeed a minor one considering all the top-notch entertainment this book has to offer, is that the major characters are not well-rounded. The Hero of the tale, Hauk, is just a little TOO perfect. It may take the author only a paragraph or two to convince me of the existence of Asgard, the mystical island featured in her novel--but finding a man of Hauk's perfection? That's another story altogether. He's handsome to-die-for, kind, generous, sensitive, law-abiding, moral, sexy, and he can cook. All this from a Viking from the 1300's? Yeah, right. The heroine, Avril, can't cook toast but she can hunt, sail and fight like a viking despite being of the manor born. She's also beautiful, a devoted mother and fluent in several languages. One small unredeeming quality would have made both these characters seem more like real people. I wanted to care a little more about what happened to them but, gosh, they were so darn perfect to begin with! Still a good read, worth both the time and money for the book."},{"Title":"Timeless","review":"In 1303, twelve Viking set sail from Asgard Island for Antwerp in order to abduct brides during the annual Claiming Voyage, an action which seems to be part of the genetic makeupof these very special warriors. Leading the group, most of whom have never left the island before, is twice married Hauk Valbrand. Hauk has been on this voyage before and does not have the fever in his blood like most of the other crew members. However, an incident at Antwerp leaves a reluctant Hauk with a valkyrie, Lady Avril de Varennes, to marry.At Asgard, Hauk marries Avril, who makes no bones that she plans to escape the island. To Hauk's frozen heart comes summer heeat as he starts to fall passionately in love with his captive. Still, he must tell her the truth about Asgard and its people, and pray she will accept him anyway.Shelly Thacker's latest tale is a wonderful blending of a Medieval and a paranormal romance into a TIMELESS novel that will elate fans from both sub-genres. The lead protagonists are a charming pair and the superb support cast moves the story forward. However, it is Asgard and its warriors that turn this BRIGADOON-like romance into one of the best books of the year so far.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Timeless","review":"Again, this is the type of book I thoroughly enjoy! I sincerely hope Shelly writes more books as I would grab them up!"},{"Title":"Timeless","review":"This is a charming romance with a wonderfully magical setting. There could have been more love scenes, but I definitely liked the different obstacles that stood in the way of the couple being together forever. A great page turner; just a bit too much Viking aggression in some places, and too much coincidence, for my tastes."},{"Title":"Timeless","review":"From the back cover:Lost world...First came the erotic dream, so vivid it took her breath away. Then came the fierce Viking warrior who kidnapped her from Antwerp and swept her away to an enchanted island. Against her will, Lady Avril de Varennes wed her steely-armed captor, Hauk Valbrand. She vowed to escape even as he swore there was no escape from Asgard Island--a mist-shrouded land with a mysterious secret of its own. But why did he seem so familiar? Suddenly, she new. Hauk Valbrand was the passionate stranger of her dream come dangerously to life.Found love...Avril was as tempestuous as the season for which she was named, trouble for the man with something to hide, a kingdom to protect. To save her from an evil kinsman who threatened her life, Hauk Valbrand claimed the fiery beauty who divined his true identity, but not the secret that held her in his thrall forevermore. Hauk thought he was lost to love...until Avril awakened a passion so strong it brought him to his knees, forcing him to choose: between love and honor, between duty and desire, between now and forever.And my review:It seems I have a love-hate relationship with this author. When she writes a book I like, it's usually one that become one of my most treasured books. When she writes a book I don't like, I usually end up hating it. Unfortunately, this was a book that I did not love.Captor/captive romances are a tough premise for me. It's very hard to write a relationship that isn't bordering on abuse or exploitation. Cross that line, and I get disgusted. However, that wasn't the problem here. Yes, the heroine was the hero's captive, but he was not abusive towards her. He desired her, but never forced himself on her. He never raised a hand to her. I admired the author's restraint in this area.However, I felt that the romance was very weak. Honestly, I never really saw what the hero and heroine had in common apart from the great sex. The premise was just so cheesy: the women on Asgard can't have children, so men venture out to capture wives, and the wives end up loving the men because they are great in bed. Okay... If I didn't know better, I would think this was the plot for a porno flick. It's romances premises like this that give romance novels a bad name.More development was given to the paranormal aspects of the novel than on character development or the dance of attraction between hero and heroine. For me, instant, overwhelming lust does not satisfy my desire to see the sparks fly. I prefer things more subtle and slow-burning.I still love some of Shelly Thacker's books. I will still scour the used books stores for her novels. But this is not one that will make it onto my keeper shelf. Try some of this author's books, likeHis Forbidden Touch,A Stranger's Kiss (An Avon Romantic Treasure),Hearts Run WildorInto the Sunsetinstead."},{"Title":"Myths and Realities.

Highly recommended.Rainy Mountain, a &quot;single knoll [that] rises out of the plain in Oklahoma,&quot; is an old landmark for the Kiowa people. It is a land of bitter cold, searing heat, summer drought, and &quot;great green and yellow grasshoppers.&quot; It is a land of loneliness, where the Kiowa were drawn after a long journey from the northwest through many types of lands.The Way to Rainy Mountain is about the journey-in myth, in drawings by Momaday's father Al, in reminiscences, and in historical snippets. All reveal aspects of Kiowa culture, life, philosophy, outlook, spirituality, and sense of self-the beauty and the desolation, how the introduction of the horse revolutionized Kiowa life, the story of Tai-me, and the richness of the word and the past. It is a literal journey as well; Momaday, in Yellowstone, writes, &quot;The Kiowas reckoned their stature by the distance they could see, and they were bent and blind in the wilderness.&quot;This is a small gem of a book, beautifully written, illustrated, and designed. It has moments of insight, beauty, and sadness, as the ending of the Sun Dance, telling as the sun is at the heart of the Kiowa's soul-a soul that survives in every word and drawing of The Way to Rainy Mountain.Diane L. Schirf, 3 March 2002."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"THE WAY TO RAINY MOUNTAIN is a fscinating account of the Kiowa spirit's core through the poet N Scott Momaday's three voices: the collective tribal story-telling voice, the historic voice (based on historical documentation), and the poet's own experiential voice (Momaday retraced the migratory route of his ancestors from Montana to Oklahoma). These three voices work on the reader's imagination to produce a fourth voice on the stage of the reader's mind. THE WAY TO RAINY MOUNTAIN depicts an epic journey of the Kiowa people through space (Montana southward) and time (mythological to modern). The ancient Kiowa's psyche fuses with primal nature be it with dog persons, antelope beings, or the mythological (but very real) creature called Taime.Once in Oklahoma the Kiowa mastered the horse and became among the best of hunters on the Great Plains. Brave in spirit, sharing in heart, they became a proud people. But European civilization closed in and all but crushed them by killing off the buffalo, killing herds of horses and turning hunters into farmers. Yet the Kiowa people held their vital contact with the land in today's hectic world: &quot;Once in his life a man ought to concentrate his mind upon the remembered earth, I believe,&quot; writes Momaday. &quot;He ought to give himself up to a particular landscape in his experience, to look at it from as many angles as he can, to wonder about it, to dwell upon it. He ought to imagine that he touches it with his hands at every season and listens to the sounds that are made upon it.&quot; Momaday helps the reader do just that--gain an appreciation for the multi-dimensional land of North America"},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"Momaday's narrative comprises an elegy for Kiowa culture, drawn from his memories of his grandmother and other family members and from their memories of a culture now lost. And the book ends with a stunning poem, the likes of which one rarely finds in contemporary poetry. It's that closing poem that lifts this humble book into the realm of masterpiece. As Chaucer's Pandarus says, &quot;Th'ende is every tale's strengthe.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"This book is deceptively short: it can be read in about an hour, but you find yourself going back and reading its various passages and thinking about them long afterwards. Momaday tells a story of the Kiowa Indians by tying in three aspects: folklore, actual historical events and his own family history. The book's format underscores this, with the first, folkloric item printed on one page, and the historical and personal reflections in separate paragraphs on the facing page, all set in different fonts. Not meant to be a comprehensive account of the Kiowas, it is rather an attempt to express the author's own feelings and his own view of his heritage. In this he largely succeeds, as he writes poetry in a simple yet powerful prose form. The only shortcoming for me were the illustrations (done by Momaday's father), which seemed to add little to the overall narrative. Otherwise, \\"The Way to Rainy Moutain\\" is a very unique and worthwhile book."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"In his writing, Momaday creates a vibrant sense of how stories are expressed through living words within vital communities. His brillant blending of mythology, folktales, oral history, historical descriptions, and personal reflections all connect in a fascinating story about finding one's way in life's journeys. The writing is so vivid and the book is so animated that patient readers will connect with what Momaday presents, provided that they choose to share in the reflective silence that he offers on the way to Rainy Mountain."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"The Way to Rainy Mountain is one of those rare books that changed my whole persepective of the world. The beauty of his style and simplicity of his stories show what a firm grasp and love of the language Dr. Momaday has. I had the priviledge of hearing Dr. Momaday speak recently. Much to my joy, he speaks much the same way he writes--in clear, simple phrases. He doesn't take language for granted. Instead he cherishes every syllable, every sound. But not only did this book teach me about the language, but about a culture. The way Dr. Momaday views the world, nature, and other people is truly fascinating and insightful. He is a spokesman for a rapidly diminishing world of orators and storytellers. This book will live in the hallowed halls of literature for countless generations."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"The Way to Rainy Mountain is poetry for people who don't usually ready poetry. Personally, I really like the way *very* short stories are interspersed throughout - it's like something you'd hear coming out of the mouth of your grandparents (or great grandparents) as they talk about stuff they remember doing or seeing. There's all sorts of articles written about this poem, and you can see synopsis of them at:http://users.mwci.net/~lapoz/Momaday.html"},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"Momaday spins together pieces of Kiowa myth and image interweaved with tales he heard as a boy. Poetic, tragic, unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"Mr. Momaday's voice in his collection of stories is priceless. He tells of the Kiowa's legends, follows them up with facts, and includes his own reflections on what it means to be Kiowa, Indian/Native American, human. The inclusion of his father's artwork makes this an even more impressive volume.I was fortunate enough to meet Mr. Momaday at a Western Writers Conference where he gave readings from this collection. And, not being a writer myself I felt out of place. It was Mr. Momaday's voice (think James Earl Jones), and his notice of me (the only other Indian/Native American in the auditorium) that mesmerized me. I've been a fan ever since."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"What I love about this book is trying to figure out how the 3 stories on each page connect to each other. I bought it for a \\"Contemporary Native American Literature\\" class and it really complemented other books in the class. Definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"I enjoyed the book. I especially like the way Momaday wrote the book as if it had been written by three people. Not only did I learn about Momaday's journey to Rainy Mountain, but I also learned about Kiowa myths and legends. It showed the last years of the Kiowas as a people. The book was simple to read, although when thought about, I realized it was more complex. I would reccommend this book to people who like to learn about cultures and their myths."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"This book was a requirement for World Literature II. I will say this... Even if this had not been required for us to read in that class, I would have picked this book up and read it on my own time. Momaday eloquently incorporates the traditions of the Kiowa people in a way that draws you into each story that his poems tell. Though characteristically, it is a quick read, it is worth it to take your time and absorb every stanza within this book."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"I was introduced to N. Scott Momaday's unique book in a class this semester where we discussed the overlying themes and message of The Way to Rainy Mountain.Told in a three part process through myth, historical, and personal journey, Momaday relates the oral traditions and his own connection to the Kiowa people. They journeyed from Montana to their final settlement in Oklahoma over centuries of time, and in three sections (not counting the beautiful introduction and epilogue), he recounts their origin stories, the passing movement of the tribe, and finally the narrowing of the culture as it was eliminated through the diecide of the Tai-me.This is a deceptively small book, filled with quite a bit of white space, but do not let it fool you. It's rich in message, history, and myth - recording oral tradition that, before, was just one generation away from dying. And even then, it's a fragment of what could, if not already has been, be lost.I've read this book three times, the first in a linear fashion - myth to myth, historical to historical, personal to personal. The second in the way it is written, horizontally. And the last way thoughtfully, drawing connections throughout the book, tracing themes, investigating ideas, researching as I went. I recommend all of these ways in order to attempt to understand all of the importance of Momaday's message."},{"Title":"The Way to Rainy Mountain","review":"Excellent.

It provides more comprehensive practice of the language taught in Japanese for busy people II. The characters are quite amusing in places - a welcome change from the dry. corporate, lifeless stories in the sister book. This book isn\`t enough on its own, as it doesn\`t actually explain the grammar, it only provides tasks. However, for me some of the sentence patterns were much clearer after using this book than reading them in the sister book. I think it\`s an essential purchase for self-study students."},{"Title":"Japanese for Busy People II: Workbook (Vol 2)","review":"I started using JFBP level 2 after finishing the first book. I think this work book is better than the level 1 workbook. Instead of 2 or 3 longer exercises per chapter, this book has several smaller ones. I also like how this book tail makes the exercises to the grammar points discussed in the corresponding text book chapters. The best of which makes you construct sentences by filling in your own words around given structures Example: ______ is ______er than _______. (Bill is taller than Joe) This sounds silly... but its a great way to become familiar with new grammar structures.As others have said, this book is useless on its own. You need the text book!"},{"Title":"Japanese for Busy People II: Workbook (Vol 2)","review":"Our class used this text and it's companion workbook for college level Japanese I & II classes. It's a wonderful text book and very effective when used within the context of an organized language class.I struggled with self-study for a long time, but with the help of this textbook, I had learned to read/write Hirigana, conjugate common verbs & adverbs, use basic particles properly, comprehend the spoken langage more effectively and communicate in simple, grammatically decent, sentences.This set of books is not intended for self-study. I strongly urge individuals interested in the Japanese language for both travel, business and recreational purposes take classes for the following reasons:1) Discipline - assignments and repetition are necessary to learning a foreign language effectively.2) Accuracy - this book 'hammers the grammar'. If your English grammer skills are lax, you're going to need professional instruction.3) Pronunciation - CD language programs are fine for travel, but nothing beats a real-life instructor a linguistic reality check!4) Commaraderie - Classmates are crucial in foreign language study. Who else will tolerate your learning curve?5) MOST IMPORTANT - the language skills you'll learn in a real class with a wonderful book such as this will help you to speak and comprehend the language at a much higher level."},{"Title":"Japanese for Busy People II: Workbook (Vol 2)","review":"A great supplement to the Japanese for Busy People II -- good practice for self-motivated learners of Japanese. Each lesson (there's 20) is composed of three sections, Warming Up (preparation practice), Sentence Pattern and Practice (key learning objectives with plenty of practice in sentence patterns), and Challenge (a level above to give learners a chance to test their skills). There's fill-in charts and lots of cartoons. Note that Kanji with Furigana pronunciation guides have been provided only in some sections in Lessons 11-20. There's no additional vocabulary other than what's already provided with the main text --- a positive point, in my opinion. All lessons run parallel to the main text. I bought this workbook because I don't get much practice to speak Japanese. I've found that the sentence patterns from the workbook are less complicated than those from the text and repeating them has really helped to \\"cement\\" what I'd learned. There's audio tapes sold separately, but you need them only if you prefer extra listening practice."},{"Title":"Image in the Water","review":"A polished political novel about the British Conservative Party (set in the future) from a politician who knows all about it.

The author rather points out that when new scientific concepts moved from one culture to another (e.g., Greek to Roman) it was a migration of concepts, and the concepts did not always fit into their new home. Montgomery makes his point very clearly through his examples. When Greek astronomy moved to imperial Rome, the science was understood for its pragmatic value."},{"Title":"Slave Girl of Gor","review":"It's been 20 years since I read this book by mistake. (See, I thought it would follow the trope of slave-girl-breaks-free-and-kicks-some-ass). Let's get right down to it... the early plot builds up to the gang rape of a virgin (librarian, I believe). Who really enjoys being gang raped.She then hooks up with her first / dominant rapist (well, he buys her, she is a slave). And then it goes into a morass of Gor-politics and chest pounding.I am so horrified that this book is being rereleased for $20.00. It wasn't worth the $3.95 I paid in 1990, it's certainly not worth $18.95 now.Unfortunately, it's the sort of book you can't scrub out of your brain. 20 years later you will still remember this protagonist enjoying being gang raped. (And, additionally, not feeling any, you know, pain, as there's some drum music and that mysteriously turns her on.)Ughh. Scrub, scrub, scrub... it won't wash away.This should be shelved as S&M; Porn, under \\"Misogyny for Teenage Boys.\\""},{"Title":"Slave Girl of Gor","review":"This is my second John Norman book, and somewhat different to the very first book in his Gorean saga, written back in the sixties.

If you were expecting hearts and flowers and violin music, you just don't know Gor! Try instead whips, chains, cages, humiliation, degradation, brutality, and rape. Nevertheless, as hard as he tries,... Clitus Vitellius is unable to suppress his tender feelings, so unbecoming to a Master of the Warrior Caste, toward pretty little Judy. This is the second of the Gor novels to be told from the perspective of an abducted Earth girl enslaved on Gor. Judy aka Dina aka Yata is nowhere near the nasty piece of work that Elinor Brinton of Captive of Gor was. Also, she accepts her slavery much more readily than EB so you would think that her experiences on Gor would not be as harsh. Wrong! This book differs from Captive in several other ways. For one thing it actually has a plot. Unbeknownst to Judy she carries an implanted message to a Cosian agent of the Kurii that has bearing on the interplanetary struggle for control of both Gor and Earth. Of course, after an initial taste of this plot it stops for the next 300 pages or so in order to give the reader a look at what life is like for a slave girl on Gor. If your interest is Gorean lifestyle, you'll like this part. Otherwise, it can be slow going. Another difference from Captive is that there is a fair amount of action especially in the last 150 pages when Tarl Cabot again shows up as Bosk of Port Kar. (Rask of Treve briefly shows up again as well.) The revelation of Judy's hidden message sets up the next novel; however, there is nothing here that seems crucial to understanding subsequent volumes in the series. This is clearly a better novel than Captives but not as good as the action-oriented books."},{"Title":"Slave Girl of Gor","review":"Someday a literary study of sex slave books is going to be written, and this one is going to stand out as a milestone. This is not to say that \\"Slave Girl of Gor\\" is great literature, because it isn't. The writing alternates between tight and clumsy, often wandering into misogynist philosophical rants, and some of these can be downright irrational. But it is one of a group of books that have become both a part of the social canon of BDSM and perhaps the most reviled series in the history of science fiction and fantasy fandom. Yes, it's John Norman's \\"Gor\\", and \\"Slave Girl of Gor\\" might well be its most sexual and most provocative title.Getting past the rhetoric surrounding the series, this book is actually not that different from a traditional erotic romance novel, except for the more intense bondage elements and the philosophical ramblings that sometimes get in the way of the story. The sex scenes are not extremely explicit but are hot nonetheless: young, beautiful Judy Thorton wakes up one morning to find herself naked and chained on the planet Gor, and she has a variety of erotic and not-so-erotic adventures as she is trained as a pleasure slave and discovers her love for her \\"true master\\" and he gets it through his thick skull that he loves her too. It's all rich material for sex slave fantasies, as the widespread internet subculture based on the Gor books testifies. The extent that this series has influenced newer sex slave science fiction books like Susan Wright's \\"Slave Trade\\" or Karen Anne Mitchell's \\"The Usahar\\" remains to be seen, but it would be hard to imagine that such an influence isn't there, since Gorean words like \\"kajira\\" (slave girl) have become normal parts of the fetish community's vocabulary.But be warned as well: \\"Slave Girl of Gor\\" is at times appalling in its misguided assumptions about men, women, and human nature, which it reduces to a simplistic sociobiology that even with (or perhaps especially with) recent advances in the field, is completely untenable. This would be a stronger book without such asides, but Norman must be given some credit for at least tackling a subject that even today makes so many people uncomfortable.In short, if male dominant/female submissive sexual fantasies are your thing, this is a book to own."},{"Title":"Slave Girl of Gor","review":"This book details the experiences of an intelligent college girl who is taken from earth to the planet gor and there transformed into a gorean slave girl. The book for the most part is written from her perspective. As a submissive female myself, I was able to understand her fears and then joy at finding her personnal freedom in being allowed for the first time to be totally female. John Norman brings depth and understanding in this book as he explores the feelings of many women world wide who feel that todays society does not allow us to be the total creatures we were created to be. It is one of the better Gorean novels."},{"Title":"Slave Girl of Gor","review":"Okay, I think that Slave Girl of Gor is an important book in the history of erotic science fiction and fantasy, and even though it was badly written back in 1977, I was still able to get through it, and there was still some of the exotic world he had created present. And let's face it, back then it was pretty risque stuff, what with abduction and rape and Norman's endless efforts to rationalize his growing misogyny, which had been pretty muted in the earlier Gor books (which is why the first five are pretty fun to read if you want a good adventure story with some sexual naughtiness thrown in).But then came the internet, and then the fans of the Gor novels got organized, and then Norman decided to go through his books and rework them. Since I remembered Slave Girl of Gor from the old days, I thought I'd have a look at the new version. And I read it, and I cringed, because Norman, no master of prose before, actually managed to make the writing significantly worse with his revisions, which seem to consist mostly of adding the same sort of long philosophical diatribes that doomed the books before. Now maybe I'm foolish, but I would have thought that he might have put in more sex, since the limitations on that sort of thing are much more relaxed these days than they were in the 1970's. And let's face it, if you're going to buy a book titled Slave Girl of... well anything, you're probably expecting sex, right?To make matters worse, he actually took out some good stuff from the original; in one scene in a paga tavern, our heroine makes mention of another Earth girl who serves as a dancer in that tavern. In the original, this is one of the rare tight passages that says a lot in a short paragraph. In the new version, half of that paragraph has been taken out for no reason (if you're interested, it's on page 297 of the original and page 353 of the new version).So why two stars? Well, the basic story is the same, even though you'll have to skim through more babble than before, and the basic story is still a decent one. But be forewarned: Norman did his readers no favors when he decided to \\"improve\\" his work."},{"Title":"Slave Girl of Gor","review":"Ok, I have to say that this is the most horrible book ever. I was getting so frustrated trying to find out where I was at in the book, because it would say the same thing every other paragraph!. To say that this book is actually literature would be the biggest lie ever. The whole first chapter accounts for about 2 minutes of just struggling and crying, then talking about how the sky is soooo blue, and then some more crying. It sounds as if the character has ADD because she keeps \\"realizing\\" or \\"remembering\\" the same things every other paragraph. Please, somebody tell the author to consult an editor before writing a book."},{"Title":"Slave Girl of Gor","review":"I began reading the Gor series about six months ago and have so far collected 22 of the orginal 27 books. The bondage and S/M themes that gain strength in each book made me wonder as a male if Norman were simply presenting a kinky and overly masculine perspective.So I began to examine female writers beginning with Janet E. Morris' Silistra. And whaddayaknow? Norman has talented female counterparts praising bondage from a female standpoint! Amazing! So women do want sex as badly as men!&quot;Slavegirl of Gor&quot; is the most provocative of Gor's novels up to this point, and is the first to be devoted to the experience of bondage per se from a woman's point ov view. I actually found the depictions of a woman &quot;in her need&quot; unbelievable until compared the same experiences as related by female writers. They described the very same things, down to scratching their nails in the dirt or against walls when their sexual needs could not be fulfilled!While I am not prepared to follow Norman down the road of male-doiminance/female-submission and S/M, he is able to bring alive every violent, sweating, bleeding, painful sensual moment of the narrative in a way that no other writer does.Norman also has first-rate character-development, even if his punctuation needs correction. The wealth of historical, cultural and linguistic research that stands behind these books is fantastic, and I say this as a published scholar of ancient and biblical history and languages. It's a shame that the later books in the series are so hard to get."},{"Title":"Slave Girl of Gor","review":"Okay I've seen some pretty nasty reviews on this book. My take on it, it was a excellent read for bit of a fantasy and what not. I think all of his books are fit for a certain demographic. This is not the run of the mill book for most sci-fi or fantasy fans. These books are meant for a niche market and I love this book. If you are a fan, then you will definitely love this book. If you aren't a fan of John Norman or his books, then you will probably not like it. Read it and see for yourself."},{"Title":"Slave Girl of Gor","review":"Dont let the 4 star fool you, this book has problems.I hesitate to guess, no wait, that isnt true, I love speculating about the how and why...My guess is that EVEN for the time these were published (1966-1976) the author / publusher took heat for the rape and masochistic themes in the preceeding 10 volumes of this series. Though not really graphic, it would go along the lines of, \\"And they proceeded to rape her.\\" or \\"She was a well used slave that night\\" it had been largely male point of view, in the form of Tarl Cabot AKA Bosk of Port Kar as narrator. Though the theme of submission as the woman's choice also had been freely offered time and again, this volume presents the female point of view from start to finish.It has all the dominant male / submissive females we have come to love and expect in the series.I dont have a problem with the rape, as presented it really doesnt qualify as rape to my mind, as the woman is always a slave, and the man always incites her to passion, though often against her wishes to be so incited. That doesnt bother me. I have even come to grudgingly accept the detailed descriptions of items and institutions of Gor, given by a newcomer, or in other volumes than this one, someone who logically wouldnt have any reason to know the first thing about whatever it is they just rambled on about for 2 or 3 pages...My biggest problem with this book was the ENDLESS, CEASELESS & REDUNTANTLY REPETITIVE RESTATING of things already said over and over. And over. And over. Usually it isnt so bad, maybe because the total volume of the book isnt so long. But of the 552 pages of this one, I think it could have EASILY been cut in half, and not only would it not have detracted from the story, it would have ADDED to it in the form of making it more streamlined and easy to read. I found myself often thinking, why the hell did I read this tonight, it didnt get anywhere. I am in the smae place I started, but now I have heard several more times that her name is Judy Thornton, she is of Earth, etc...The basic story is interesting if somewhat (as usually) unlikely. But it gets so bogged sown in ruminations that it can be easy to just decide to put it down for awhile.Probly more like 3.5 than 4, but I couldnt make myself go 3, so there ya go."},{"Title":"Slave Girl of Gor","review":"The Slave Girl of Gor is a refreshing change in the usually male dominated worlf of Gor. Imagine a wakening confused alone and naked on an unknown world and being faced with death in the first few moments. This is the tale of the slave girl similar to Captive of Gor with a healthy dose of the joys of bondage and slavery, but that is the hallmark of the Gor books after the first 4 or so. It is a tale of love for both the slave girl and the man who claims her body heart and soul. There is action and high seas battles all from the point of view of the slave girl.The best part of this book is the continuing discovery of the slave girl supposed to reside in every woman. She travels the path of being lost and confused to recognizing the value of feminity as it exsists on Gor. She unfolds as the flower revealing more and more of her thoughts and actions as she moves through the savage landscape of Gor. We see also more of the different subcultures from the rough peasants to the opulent lifestyle of the Turian's and the seedy paga taverns. We are also given more insight to the role of the FreeWoman on Gor and the depths of cunning and skill she must posess to stay free of the chains of slavery. Like the romance novel this book does end happily in the slave girls eyes at least. There are some flaws early on in the book which may distract the reader from the story but these are easily overlooked to those who have read the other books in the series. I strongly recomend this book as it reads both as a romance and adventure."},{"Title":"Slave Girl of Gor","review":"Holy crap.

Like most of humanity, she is only worried about the impending doom from the Omega Clouds - which travel the galaxy destroying anything the seems to be created by sentient life - when she is thinking about it; but, since that confrontation is 900 years away, it seems remote and something for tomorrow.But, everything changes when a routine science expedition observes an Omega Cloud change course and head for an unexplored star system. They soon discover a world populated by a pre-technological civilization. Suddenly, the threat of the Omega Clouds become an obsession with Earth as everyone is moved by the plight of the cute and lovable humanoid creatures (a reaction not unlike people's reaction to cute and endangered species on Earth like the panda or koala). Hutch finds herself at the center of it all as she struggles to summon the spacefaring resources and technology of Earth in a desperate effort to save the unsuspecting planet from destruction - all while trying to not interfere with the developing species or reveal their presence.*Omega* is all action from start to finish, but of course it is also an intelligent science fiction story as all McDevitt books are.

In this setting, part of the rather loosely connected series of novel titled the Academy series, huge, many kilometer-wide entities called omega clouds or simply just omegas cruise the dark between the stars. Seemingly innocuous, they are actually a grave threat to all civilized life. For some reason not know to researchers, the clouds attack anything with right angles or too many straight lines. Using lightning, vast tendrils of cloud, and if on a planetary surface high winds and more, they utterly wreck anything they come across, whether it is a research ship that blunders too close to the clouds or buildings on the ground. Sadly, a number of ruin sites on various worlds had been destroyed by omegas, but fortunately resulting in very little loss of life.However, while on a research mission an Academy survey ship notices one of the omegas sharply veering towards an unexplored planetary system. That ship, while about to go home, is with apologies from headquarters diverted to the system to see what caught the interest of the cloud. While the Academy pretty much exists to find and study intelligent life, so very rare in the galaxy, they sincerely hope that sentient life, past or present, doesn't exist in this system.The omegas are indestructible. No one has been able to devise any weapons to destroy the nearly planetary-sized gaseous entities or even cause them any harm. If they are intelligent they do not respond to any communications whatsoever. They merely push inexorably towards their target, not satisfied until the object is annihilated. While some early successes had been had with diverting clouds, at least temporarily, research on the clouds is poorly funded. When the clouds were first discovered, there was quite a panic over them, as one was found to be heading towards Earth...in a few thousand years. Not exactly a pressing issue.When the survey ship reaches the system, they find suddenly that defeating the omegas is indeed a pressing issue. This world is a living world, one inhabited by a sentient race called by the discovers the Goompahs, a human-sized race with pale green skin, large eyes, and huge floppy feet, the name derived from a popular children's television show (the Academy pushed the name Korbs for the race after the alien's name for the world, which was learned later on, Korbikkan, but unfortunately popular perceptions and media usage of the name Goompahs stuck). While not a space faring or even particularly technological race, the Goompahs are quite a bit above the living sentient aliens discovered thus far, possessing a series of beautiful and peaceful trading cities complete with temples, sailing ships, museums, libraries, and bustling market places.The survey ship is charged with doing its best to help save the Goompahs from the omega, which will arrive in less than a year, doing what they can to research them, planting listening devices to record Goompah language so that linguists can learn to speak it, and generally obeying the Protocol, which forbids interfering with alien cultures, all while gathering intelligence and seeing if there was anything they could to do save the aliens.While the Academy, lead by the hero of previous books in the Academy series, Priscilla \\"Hutch\\" Hutchens, scramble to put together a rescue mission to supplement the hard work of the _William B. Jenkins_ (the survey ship) and race there ahead of the cloud, the survey's ships crew make a discovery. The Goompahs are deathly afraid of humans, as they closely resemble the form taken by the demons of their mythology. Under no circumstance will they stand to listen to human visitors, but instead run away screaming.Essentially the book is one long rescue plan, as the Academy struggles to save a race that they can't talk to (they learn the language rather well but have to face deep-seated prejudices against the human form) from a force they cannot stop and probably can't divert. Much of the book along the way is also an exploration of Goompah culture, which comes off as I thought a bit idyllic, even utopian, though explanations are offered at the end as well. The book is also a tale of the study of the mysterious nature of the omegas. What is their origin? Are they artificial or natural? Where do they come from?All in all a good adventure book, it had an interesting climatic ending."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"Finally, a book in the \\"Hutch\\" series that doesn't lean heavily on drawn out rescue after drawn out rescue. In this case, the entire book is a drawn out rescue ... and it works.In \\"Omega\\", a massive, moving cloud in space is threatening to wipe out a newly discovered civilization on a distant planet. The peaceful, quaint alien race must be saved - but without being aware that humans have intervened. What follows is an extended exploration of the alien civilization and a desperate attempt to save them without them being aware that they've been saved.\\"Omega\\" may be one of the best Jack McDevitts I've read so far. He stopped relying on tense-jam-everyone-must-get-out-of after tense-jam-everyone-must-get-out-of and started delving into ideas with more focus than he's shown in this series since the first novel, \\"The Engines of God\\". He raises some interesting questions about religion and human nature without beating you over the head with a message, and wraps it up in a pretty good yarn with some fine moments. Some aspects of the alien society he creates are a little difficult to swallow in that they're way too human - but in some ways, that's kind of the point. The civilization presented here are an innocent, almost idealized version of what we could be if we abandoned war and the like.All in all, a solid book with some good ideas, strong characters and enjoyable 'puzzles' for those characters to solve. It's not a fast-paced book, but in the context of \\"Omega\\" that works just fine.

A cloud has switched direction, heading straight for the previously unexplored planetary system--and its living pre-technological alien society.

The reader discovers that she has been promoted to Director of Operations and temporarily in place as Acting Director. Herein the reader is bombarded with meeting synopses of endless variety and endless irrelevance. When the discovery of an omega cloud careening toward a newly-found civilization, Hutch acts quickly dispatching a crack team of linguists and scientists to the planet. Hutch largely disappears from this scene, only being referred to in FTL messages. The emphasis is put on the landing team, who gather as much data as possible to send it to the crack team in 9-month transit, whose date of arrival is just short of the date of destruction by the Omega.The most interesting thread of this novel is the three-person contact team's attempts at understanding a new alien culture, not a dead civilization like in other McDevitt novels. However, the alien culture portrayed is anything but \\"alien.\\" McDevitt has transposed too many anthropomorphic traits onto the aliens, colloquially known as Goomphas as they resemble the Earth cartoon of the same name. The aliens are erect four-limbed two-sex bipeds with two eyes (in the visible light spectrum), two ears, mammary glands for the females, and similar facial expressions. Their material possessions of metallic coins, wooden furniture, beasts of burden, libraries with scrolls of papers, and the equivalent of tea and beer. There is hardly anything \\"alien\\" about the aliens at all, except for their green skin tint, awkward stature, duck-like waddle, and sexual behavior.*sympathetic woodwinds, country scene*With one or two alien facets to hypothesize on but only to be disappointed by the in-your-face explanation in the worst epilogue ever, the readers disappointment will settle in and their focus can shift to the mystery surrounding the origin and function of the Omega Clouds. The lead scientist in understanding the omega clouds dies early on in the novel, so only vague guesses by Hutch and her team are put forth. Only at the end does Hutch come back onto the scene to sprinkle fairy dust on the conclusion to make origin the omega clouds somewhat sensible... somewhat. Sadly, it reads like a dull knife stab into the thick carapace of a well-rounded novel--it bounces right off and the stabber stabs himself. Leave the novel with a knife wound and loss of pride.I've been critical of McDevitt before for his sloppy characterization. In Deepsix, McDevitt maniaclly describes EVERYONE'S height. Why, I haven't the faintest clue. McDevitt does this again in Omega--I keep track. He describes about 5-6 people as being short, one person as being of average height, and seventeen (SEVENTEEN!!!) as being \\"tall\\". He doesn't have enough creativity to use a synonym, but only uses \\"tall\\" a total of 17 times (pages 36, 52, 57, 60, 78, 91, 101, 118, 120, 159, 163, 289, 326, 343, 352 (twice), and 459). It's these senseless additions that makes me wonder who in the hell proofread this crap.*symphony of clowns with slide-whistles and noise-makers*Additional senselessness amid the pages of a McDevitt novel are found quite frequently, though not to the degree of filler as in Chindi. Some additions are just stupid: \\"Her first afternoon call went to Rheal Fabrics. Rheal specialized in producing a range of plastics, films, and textiles for industry. (They also had a division that operated a chain of ice-cream outlets.)\\" (52) But the coup de tte of senselessness comes from a seven paragraph reaction (159-160) to a character's viewing of a stereotypical horror movie (ala abandoned mansion, story weather, creaking doors and other strange noises). It are times like this that make me gently place the book down and collect myself.I don't like McDevitt's novels. They are a utter chore to get through when the reader has to slog through diatribes (like in Deepsix), song lyrics (like in Chindi), and petty nuances (like in Omega). I haveBook 5: Odysseyon my bookshelves but I think to myself, \\"How much more fractional senselessness can one man heap upon a novel to make the greater whole a failure?\\" With my head shaking, my hand trembling, my eyes screwed shut...

Over the past few years, I've picked this booked up and re-started it with about a year between each read. I keep thinking it'll get better, but it just doesn't. I really could use a visible outline to keep track of all the characters in this book and whether or not they are integral to the plot. Also, the author seems to go out of his way to make the female characters more prominent than the male. This is not a sexist statement, it just seems as if he goes out of his way to present it in that manner. Perhaps it is a way to show that in the future women can be completely equal in status, pay, etc. as men are today. Granted, I have a difficult time following movies with complex plot lines and fast moving events like Mission Impossible, but this book became my \\"mission impossible\\" to actually finish the book. With the third read I made it to page 225 in the paperback release.Spoiler alert to follow but will stave off disappointment if you read this book!Reading other reviews and learning that the origin of the clouds and their purpose is never revealed just gives me all the more reason to recycle the book. I'm sure this will be a good read for someone else, it just didn't do much for me."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"Try as I might, I just couldn't get into this one, much less make it through it. The book has an interesting premise, as we discover that the Omegas have deviated from their previous course and are closing in on a yet-unexplored solar system. There, low and behold, we discover a civilization which is seemingly doomed to perish from the Omega clouds.Despite a great overall theme, this book drags, and drags, and drags. There are annoyances as well, such as the decision to throw \\"the protocol\\" out the window almost immediately. I forced myself to read approximately over 250 pages of Omega, but finally gave up. This is only the second book in my lifetime that I've abandoned.Not an interesting read. Die-hard fans of McDevitt may find some interest here, but in general this book disappoints greatly."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"Decent enough read, but oddly enough, I think the books in this series stand better on their own, than in the context of the series, as there are too many repetitive cliffhanging themes... a lot of them involving ropes and/or nets."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"This was the first McDevitt book I've read, and I was very unimpressed. It was sort of an enjoyable read, but I expected so much more.The aliens are basically squat, ugly (but loveable!) critters that live on an Earth-like planet in an Earth-like historical period (middle ages). The author may have made them so human on purpose (to make us identify with them and care about them?), but he didn't have to make them 95% like us. If you want to read well-imagined aliens, I suggest &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot; by Vinge.&lt;MINOR SPOILERS IN NEXT PARAGRPH:&gt;This book also suffers from the 'no bad guy' pitfall. The Omega cloud is the only thing to root against, and despite suggestions it is not natural - it still acts very much like a random weather phenomena. The only human 'bad guy' is someone who is driven to an insane (yet boring) rage when he views an Omega cloud destroying some alien structures. That's a pretty weak source of motivation. Why not have that character's wife or kid get killed by a cloud?&lt;SPOILERS OVER!&gt;Finally, maybe faithful readers of McDevitt enjoyed this, but the constant references to previous McDevitt novels in this storyline got very tiresome. The first couple mentions were fine, but after awhile it felt a lot like propoganda.Overall, this felt like a very juvenile SF book. There's so much better out there - go elsewhere and only come back to McDevitt when you run out of ideas!"},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"By 2230, humanity has known about the Omega Clouds for a quarter of a century. They seem to hunt planets where signs of civilization exist. When they find them, they destroy all life forms and geometric shapes and angles. Even though an omega cloud is due to pass Earth in nine centuries, not much research has been done on them because humanity believes they have plenty of time to find a way of dealing with them.Time runs out when mankind discovers a sentient race of humanoids, so much like us they could be our cousins. An Omega cloud has diverted from its path when it finds the world of Goompahs and the masses on Earth do not want them killed. Linguists, scientists and socialists from all over the galaxy race to the newly discovered civilized world (technologically on a level with Ancient Rome) to try to find a way of destroying the Omega. Failing that they hope to convince the Goompah's to flee their cities and seek higher ground so that they will survive the coming catastrophe.It is great to watch a united galaxy use all its power to save a newly discovered sentient race (a rare find in the McDevitt universe) despite the danger they bring unto themselves. The society of the Goombahs is examined in such great depth that readers will feel they have actually visited their planet. As more is learned about the Omegas, mankind comes to believe they are not forces of nature but things constructed by an unknown entity. Mr. McDevitt is one of this decade's great world builders.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"Wow, just awful. The writing is not terrible, and neither is the setup. But this book could have been so much more. The beginning tantalizes a glimpse into large questions: why are there so few planets with intelligent life? Are the Omegas malevolent or simply indifferent? Who created them and why?And, sadly, the payoff is never forthcoming. None of these questions are answered in more than fleeting, trivial terms.What is endlessly, monotonously explored is the target planet, whose inhabitants are identical to humans, to within an engineering approximation, in almost every aspect. What a monumental lack of imagination!I actually put this book in the recycling when I was finished. I am bewildered by the other positive reviews here. To each his own, I guess, and truth be told, I'm not a writer and respect anyone who can put together a book full of words. But yikes..."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"The plot of _Omega_ is fairly cool and the book started off very promising. The story develops quite well but then suddenly plummets into a Care Bear meets Ewok expose on a remote and endangered planet. The \\"alien\\" creatures, the \\"Goompahs\\", turn out to be cute, roly-poly hillbilly-esque beings living in a 12th century English settlement displaced lightyears away from Earth. Lost me there.I recommend skipping this one. Unfortunately this book was boring enough to chase me away after investing some 200+ pages into it. Only one other book I haven't finished in over 2 years solid."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"*spoilers, but not really b/c there is nothing to spoil* the only reason i continued to read this book was i thought he'd have some tight explaination for why omegas exist, some sort of neat purpose for them that even if not plausible was intersting. Somewhere near the middle of the book he just gives up on writing about the Hutch side story of why the omegas exist and delves into over describing the alien society. I kept reading in hope that there would be some clues or mention, but eventually I gave up and was forced to skip to the end to see why the omegas exist, but no explanation is ever given! So, the premise for the whole series is concluded with \\"we don't know why omegas exist, sorry.\\" After reading series like hyperion with a actual mystery revealed (what is the shrike?) at the end of the series, this is just pathetic.i got this book as a present not realizing i'd read this author before (a talent for war) that book sucks as well. this is a good fantasy book but as far as sci fi is conserned it is utter crap. a good sci fi book can't end with a crappy explanation like that."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"Jack McDevitt's preachy and unimaginative morality tale, Omega, will appeal to fans of writers such as Robert Sawyer who use futuristic SF settings as childish allegories for the modern world. What it will not do is make anyone sit up and gasp at its author's inventiveness or perception.Although the story is set some 230 years in the future, its underlying assumptions are strictly those of the early 2000's. In the same way that much of 1950's SF is unreadable today (and was unreadable then to readers looking for something more from SF than 1950's characters and ideas sloppily glued into a future with rocket ships), Omega is rendered incredibly boring by its having no speculative ideas whatsoever.The author never tires of having his fictional third-rate intellects tear down paper tiger arguments propounded by fictional fourth-rate intellects. His readers may not all have such patience.McDevitt gives us bipedal, seeing, speaking, clothes-wearing, city-building aliens who are more human than human beings are. They are physiologically close enough to earth life as to not really seem alien at all. And the physical resemblance is only the tip of the iceberg - McDevitt laboriously pounds home what he clearly considers to be a profound point: the aliens are, at heart, Just Like Us. What then, the reader may ask, is the point of having aliens at all?The aliens (\\"Goompahs,\\" so named in the book because of their likeness to the characters in a popular children's show of 2234) will appeal precisely to those readers who regard Barney the dinosaur as a great entertainer.The book's plot consists of a straightforward though of course predictable scramble by humans to save the Goompahs from a killer space cloud (an Omega, one of many that mysteriously destroy civilizations throughout the galaxy). There is no real suspense, obviously - Barney never dies in his 2004 appearances, either.Frequent gratuitous character viewpoint shifts are annoying distractions, especially since much of the \\"action\\" reverts to recurring McDevitt character Priscilla Hutchins. Hutch is now a bureaucrat back on Earth. Betters authors than McDevitt would be unable to make a bureaucrat's daily activities seem exciting (if they were unwise enough to try), so it is not surprising that the story plods even more than usual when it is sidetracked to Hutch.Omega is not a book for adults or intelligent adolescents. Actual pre-schoolers would be better served by the real Barney."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"I started with McDevitt by reading Polaris, a novel about the disappearance of some passengers off an interstellar space yacht. Polaris sucked me in from the start. It had all the elements I like in a sci-fi story. It took place off-world, on distant planets; had plenty of pages devoted to time in space, and it involved a mystery, that is, trying to find out what happened to the missing voyagers, whom, if I recall correctly, disappeared while on a tour of a supernova or some other stellar conflagration.McDevitt has walked the walk as a retired Naval officer and in Polaris it was clear to me that he penned his space adventure/mystery with an eye glued on logic, technical accuracy, and, most importantly, an author's desire to keep the story moving forward. Reading the book, I was never diverted from feeling that I was part of a \\"Voyage.\\" As a bonus, McDevitt gave us an interesting archeological subplot, which, as I have subsequently learned, is an underlying theme in all of the McDevitt books I've read.In Polaris, the main character, Alex Benedict, is a dealer in antiquities. As a professional captain and a person who has some familiarity with antiquities, I could relate to this guy.In Omega, the main character, is Priscilla \\"Hutch\\" Hutchins. Hutch is McDevitt's Academy Series Person-in-Charge. (I think PIC fits better than main character. You'll see why later.)The Academy Series starts with (1) The Engines of God and then goes to (2) Deepsix, (3) Chindi, (4) Omega, (5) Odyssey, and (6) Cauldren. I've read all but the last two and I seriously doubt I'll ever pick them up.As the series evolves from The Engines of God to Omega, Hutch goes from being the pilot of an interstellar space ship to being an administrative desk jockey at the Academy. By the time we get to Omega, Hutch's personal adventures are about as exciting as watching glacial ice melt. In fact, she's a downright snooze, which leads me to wonder why we would even bother calling her the main character of the series.And herein lies the biggest problem for me with this book (Omega) and the series as a whole. There are tons and tons of characters who mean almost nothing to the story. McDevitt goes on ad nauseam with characters whose individual actions and stories lead nowhere or nearly nowhere. Everything is an abstraction. The beautiful, linear, exciting form of storytelling so evident in Polaris is absent here. Instead, we get ramblings and character ruminations about things that do nothing but sidetrack and derail us from the main point of the book and the series, namely, who are these alien races and people, what are the omega clouds, and where and how does it all fit together?[SPOILER ALERT!]At one point, about a third to halfway through Omega, the author introduces us to a character who claims he may have solved the mystery of the omega clouds. But he says he's not sure, so he doesn't want to tell Hutch about it. He needs a few weeks to do some more research and Hutch says OK. She doesn't press him. A few pages later, no kidding, this guy dies of a heart attack or a stroke or something, a completely boring, mundane death, with no ramifications whatsoever except to serve the author's need to give us a blatant, on-the-nose reason to keep reading.[END ALERT]This is not the first time I've had it happen that I've not liked a book so many others have liked. In fact, it seems to be happening more and more. Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm just impatient. Maybe I don't want to waste time knowing too much about the characters lives, especially when so many fictional characters are superficial and/or cliche.On the other hand, when I read a novel in which the author has introduced tons and tons of characters and backstory and all sorts of subplots, my immediate conclusion is that the main story isn't strong enough to hold the novel, or in this case, series, together. Moreover, I definitely don't like being sucker-punched by a transparent, gimmicky, literary device. (See above spoiler.)So, you may ask, what series have I read that compares or justifies my criticisms here? OK, how about Clarke's Rama series? Or Varley's Gaia series? Or Pohl's Gateway series. These are all series about space travel, alien races and terrestrial politics. But, in these examples, as opposed to McDevitt's Academy series, you'll find concise, pointed storytelling, efficient and effective characterization, and a guarantee that the story will move forward like a sixty ton steam locomotive."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"I only bought this book because it finally promised to reveal the secret of the Omega clouds. What a complete waste of a great premise! Although McDevitt doesn't actually confirm beyond all doubt that the \\"reveal\\" is indeed the truth, the idea is insipid, boring, a waste of something that could have been really interesting, and doesn't even really make sense when you think about it (SPOILER: why build clouds that zoom off course to planets light years away if you really just want them to drive to a certain point and explode ... makes no sense).Aside from all that, I found the characterization inconsistent, and frankly, boring. If you want to read something with real creativity and excitement, try something by Neal Asher or Peter F. Hamilton.This is the last McDevitt book I will ever buy. I collect SF books, and have an extensive library, but I can't justify keeping this one. Into the trash it goes."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"This book, like others from the 'Hutch' series, has a pretty cool concept behind the plot. The Omega clouds are one of the coolest ideas I've read about in a long time. This book promised to address some of the mystery behind the Omega cloud, and on top of that, the book describes a newly found civilization. The book addresses these big ideas and hashes out a lot of details. But then the book gets bogged down in useless 'action' subplots, like when one of the characters tries to save an alien from drowning. The end of the book ultimately disappoints in how it resolves the issues with the Omegas. Again, the cool idea behind the book deserves 5 stars, but the useless action sequences that cause the book to drag on reduce it back down to 4 stars.And like other books in this series, I really think it's about 100 pages too long. Cut some of the unnecessary subplots, and the book could have been greatly improved."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"I'll be brief. I've read most of Jack's work and have come to the conclusion that the more he writes the worse he gets. The first book I read, and incidently my favorite, was the Engines of God. My hopes were sparked when I read that in Omega he was returning to the universe created in the Engines of God. Well, I was downright disappointed. There was little of any hard sciece or more importantly no excitement in this book. At least in prior novels the book might drag on only to finish with a climactic squence. This book didn't. It was more about learning the social behaviors of the race we were trying to save and the inevitable comparison to human kind, than it was about hard science. It read more like Stranger in a Strange Land, which in my opinion, was not a science fiction book but resembled a disertation in social or behaviorial science.I may give Jack one more read but that's it. I may go back to read any earlier work that I've missed since that was when Jack was at his best."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"I have read several of Jack McDevitt's books and found them amiable, and usually engaging. His characters feel real, even if you would not want to spend a lot of time with them, not because they are bad, but they are just a little too sincere.There was enough in Omega to keep my interest, but I got the sense that McDevitt was not sure what kind of book he was writing. It had elements of a thriller, but not one to raise my heart rate. It showed some of the challenges of cultural anthropology, but the natives themselves were not particularly compelling, though I do not think I will get the image of their orgies out of my head anytime soon. The book had political challenges which were promising, but were abandoned by the middle. The allocation of resources for a future crisis is an issue that has implications for our own time, and I would have liked to have seen more discussion. If not, it could have been left out.I have noticed that McDevitt is good at creating mysteries and creating some interesting characters to pursue those mysteries, but the more time you spend with the characters the less compelling they become. The resolution to the mystery does not just remain hidden, but seems not to exist.All in all, reading the book was a pleasant way to spend a dreary winter afternoon. I would like to see McDevitt push us a little harder. I have not given up on him, but I do not think I will invest much more time if his next book or two is not deeper and more exciting."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"For 30 years now the Omega clouds have been on humanity's radar. These gigantic space-born clouds of unknown origin glide benignly through the galaxy, until they encounter a civilization. With little mercy the clouds then change course and annihilate the civilization. Priscilla \\"Hutch\\" Hutchins has seen it before...or at least the remains of the civilizations that have been struck by these clouds. She was on the mission that discovered the clouds 30 years ago. Now, a cloud has changed course and it is Hutch's job (she is director of operations for the Academy) to put together a mission to save a previously unknown, living alien civilization from the cloud.As usual, McDevitt does a remarkable job in eliciting a sense of wonder of the unknown; in this case, his description of the alien civilization...the Goompahs...is marvelous. The Goompahs (a human-coined word for the aliens) are wonderful beings. They are like and unlike us in numerous ways. McDevitt does extremely well describing those ways. He makes it clear, that some things are universal (like math and how they use it their daily lives, in their architecture for instance), while other things, like their political and sexual mores, are completely different.How would contact with a more technologically primitive culture than our own be viewed from the aliens point of view? How would it be viewed from our point of view? McDevitt asks and sets forth his own answers to these questions and more in a fundamentally believable way.The only disappointments in the book are minor. I would have liked a bit more contact with the Goompahs. The Goompah female Macao, with her part right, part wrong view of her physical world, was extremely interesting, and I don't think McDevitt took her storyline quite far enough. The only other problem I had with the story was that we never really find out for sure what the Omega clouds really are...only a suggestion. Also, there is no attempt to trace them back to their source to see who is behind them. While the clouds provide the underlying foundation for the story, they really take second place to the descriptions and interactions of the alien culture and how humanity views it...this was as it should be.Omega is what science fiction should be about. Discovery. The discovery of what is unknown, what is actually \\"Out There\\", and the discovery of ourselves, pushing our limits, and figuring out what we are really capable of. Omega is supposed to be the last of the Hutch novels...hopefully this will not be the case. Omega is highly recommended to any with any curiousity at all."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"Finally, a book in the \\"Hutch\\" series that doesn't lean heavily on drawn out rescue after drawn out rescue. In this case, the entire book is a drawn out rescue ... and it works.In \\"Omega\\", a massive, moving cloud in space is threatening to wipe out a newly discovered civilization on a distant planet. The peaceful, quaint alien race must be saved - but without being aware that humans have intervened. What follows is an extended exploration of the alien civilization and a desperate attempt to save them without them being aware that they've been saved.\\"Omega\\" may be one of the best Jack McDevitts I've read so far. He stopped relying on tense-jam-everyone-must-get-out-of after tense-jam-everyone-must-get-out-of and started delving into ideas with more focus than he's shown in this series since the first novel, \\"The Engines of God\\". He raises some interesting questions about religion and human nature without beating you over the head with a message, and wraps it up in a pretty good yarn with some fine moments. Some aspects of the alien society he creates are a little difficult to swallow in that they're way too human - but in some ways, that's kind of the point. The civilization presented here are an innocent, almost idealized version of what we could be if we abandoned war and the like.All in all, a solid book with some good ideas, strong characters and enjoyable 'puzzles' for those characters to solve. It's not a fast-paced book, but in the context of \\"Omega\\" that works just fine. McDevitt continues to prove he's one of the best idea men in science fiction today."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"In this latest space opera/hard sci-fi novel penned by veteran sci-fi novelist McDevitt Priscilla Hutchins a recurring lead character, has moved up in The Academy Hierarchy. Yet that doesn't prevent her from lighting this novel up the way she has lit up his previous novels.Omega is a malevelant(presumably) destroyer of civilizations, a space-cloud that had wiped out a couple societys in the distant setting in which the novel is based in, and there is an Omega clou heading to earth in oh about 900 years or so. Therefore nobody takes nuch notice of the far from imminent crisis, as they study the phenomenom in the most abstract terms. Until a sentient race is discovered on a planet due to be hit by an Omega in the very near future. The inhibitants or Goombahs as the media has dubbed them are a very cute and popular species making the effort to divert the cloud and save them even more politically intense. Priscilla almost launches a rescue mission of teams forbidden to break protocol i.e. letting the \\"Goombah's\\" learn of the human existence which makes the mission even more unlikely to succeed.McDevitt has been given due for his ability to create alien systems/races and planets. This is clearly a novel of him highlighting his strengths as a writer as the Goombah's are almost more fully characterized than their human counterparts. The reader is made to fully understand the workings of Goombah society, their daily life, entertainment sexual practices, religious maxims etc...I surmise the author went out of his way to use this book as an expression of some of his own beliefs and values, there were passages I drew an imaginary parallel to Gulliver's Travels. The Literati would probably be offended by such a comparision, yet I feel McDevitt echoed some of Swift's message in a far away setting in the far future. This is more than mere entertainment and high space drama, it is a story with meaning (whether intentionally inserted into the tale by the author or not the meaning is still evident to this reviewer and can be interpreted by any reader however they like.)There are no clear answers to the Omega offered by McDevitt but I think that was part of his point and should not subtract from one's enjoyment of this book."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"Still almost 900 years away from Earth, the Omega clouds - malevolent energy masses that drift through the universe, destroying any civilization they encounter - are nobody's immediate worry. Until an Omega veers toward an unexplored system, and a planet that happens to have a very appealing, pre-technological civilization on it.In the conclusion to McDevitt's trilogy (\\"The Engines of God,\\" \\"Chindi\\"), former astronaut Priscilla \\"Hutch\\" Hutchins, is now married, a mother and a Space Academy administrator. It's her job to figure out how to save the cute aliens, staying within Protocol if possible. Which means no contact that might disrupt or influence their development.Jack Markover has spent his working life seeking alien civilizations and the Goompahs - named after similarly appealing TV characters - are the first he's found. In nine months the Omega is going to obliterate them. He can't let it happen.David Collingdale saw the Omega's destruction first hand, and it left him obsessed with stopping them. When Hutch hastily throws together a rescue mission from Earth, he insists on leading it. But the mission won't arrive for almost nine months, so Markover and his crew have to try and convince the Goompahs to flee their cities, while feeding data back to Collingdale's scientists and linguists. Meanwhile the scientists back on Earth are working on the problem and the newspapers are clamoring for rescue.There are a lot of characters involved - in various spaceships and on Earth - and a number of subplots including a romance and mysterious exploding stars that were never stars. McDevitt spices his suspenseful story with plenty of humor and irony (only occasionally heavy-handed) and his characters are credible and sympathetic. The rescue attempt goes down to the wire, naturally, and McDevitt's characters pull out all the stops for an exciting, satisfying finish."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"After recently discovering McDevitt, I've been burning through the Hutch/Academy series, of which this is the fourth book. However, this one had brought be to a stop, at least for now.In many respects, it's a fine novel. Once again McDevitt has a good idea and the world he creates at the center of the book is interesting. Sure, it contains the usual McDevitt standards, like somewhat shallow characters and the inevitable \\"moment of chance that changes everything\\" that's plays a prominent role in almost all of his books, but regular readers aren't going to let those hold them back.So why didn't it work? For me it's because Hutch, the central character of the previous three novels, is not the central character here. Sure, McDevitt spends some time with her, but in the end it felt like she wasn't really necessary. Some other person could have filled the role. And instead of Hutch on the front lines, we get a substitute character, introduced in a previous novel in the series, who is basically a younger version of the same basic character.I understand why McDevitt did it, I suppose, but if he felt the need to ease Hutch out, he might as well end the series."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"I pretty much advance order everything that McDevitt writes as soon as it gets listed on Amazon. Omega is another one of his excellent books. It should be read in sequence after Engine of the Gods and it provides details filling in other McDevitt novels' plot lines."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"This is a great book as are all of McDevitt's works. However, I have never seen this before in all my years of reading, the copy I received from Amazon had a mix up in printing. Pages 83 through114 were missing. In their place were pages 371 through 402 which which were also in their right place in the book. So I never got to read 33 crucial pages of the book."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"After reading the first three books, Engines of God, Deepsix, and Chindi, Omega was a much faster pace read for me, I went through nearly half the book in a single sitting. I like the epicness of the overall story arc of the character, in that it takes so many books and so much effort to get through it all. It's like getting to watch all the Star Wars movies at the theatre for the price of one ticket. Although I'm very curious to find out what the wave on the cover relates to. It keeps me reading to find out. Very good, entertaining read in my opinion, much heavier on the action and scientific mystery plot advancement, than previous titles. Almost Indiana Jones-esque."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"I've read three in this series now and I'm a bit tired of there never being an \\"ending\\"...i.e., you never find out what the Engines of God are, or what the Chindi is, or what the Omega's are. After three, 300 page or more, books and still no \\"understanding,\\" I'm over the series. I kept reading, thinking the explanation would come in the next book, but it never did. Also, while I loved the concept of this series, I started to skip pages of long, detailed, space rescues of people. It seemed each book contained rescue after rescue after rescue."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"McDevitt's books are good, and I like this one, but he should seriously consider getting a new editor. I keep finding fairly significant errors in his books. For example, using the names of characters that were killed off earlier in the book, misspelling key technical terms that he makes up (\\"Fleckinger\\" vs. \\"Flickinger\\" for example), and more. I know it sounds like I'm picking nits, but seriously, how hard is it for someone to just make sure everything is consistent?"},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"I have read this book twice now and even liked it better the second time through. There are really three good stories going on here. One with the clouds themselves, one with the ground operation, and one with the politics at home through Hutch. Hutch makes a far better administrator than I ever enjoyed her in the field.The best part about this novel is that it really gives us what we wanted from McDevitt all along - another race! He's mentioned the Nok, but we know nothing about them. We've been through ruins, seen hints, but never before do we get a different culture and society out of it.As well, it moves quickly and is enjoyable to read. I highly recommend this book. It may not change the world, but it's great fun."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"Without having read any other stories in the \\"series\\" first, I very much enjoyed this novel. I was quite taken with the planet and the people described, and was sorry that there was probably not going to be any sequel using the same setting.One of his themes is \\"No True Aliens\\", whereby the aliens are pretty much just like us in mind. This is contrary to the current trend which is to make aliens as different as possible, getting away from the less imaginative aliens of previous generations.More recently, I read Engines of God, and found it to be a much weaker book. I noticed the same themes of \\"No True Aliens\\" and the technology-hunting clouds, and figured he reused the plot elements in somewhat different form. I didn't know at the time that they are in fact part of the same series. I also didn't have the problem of missing the connecting character who is present only in a secondary role.Certainly, Omega stands alone as a story. If you've not read any of this series, don't worry about reading them in order. This is a much stronger book, better written and engaging. I would say it's one of the most enjoyable SF novels I've read in the past two years."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"Set a couple of centuries from now, after mankind has begun to explore the galaxy, this novel is about deadly clouds of energy called omegas. Their purpose seems to be to wipe out any civilization they encounter. A cloud is heading for Earth, but it won't arrive for another 900 years. While research continues into what makes omegas tick, it's a problem for future humans. It becomes an immediate crisis when a survey ship reports that the cloud has turned, and is heading for a previously unexplored system. It just happens to contain a thriving, pre-industrial civilization, and the cloud will arrive in a few months.In many years of diligent searching, mankind has found a number of dead civilizations, but only two living ones, neither of whom are interested in Contact with anyone. Saving this civilization suddenly becomes Top Priority. An exploration ship already in the area is able to sneak on to the surface, and the personnel plants many audio and video pickups, beaming language to a ship full of linguists, already in transit. Their ship, in bad need of an overhaul, is pressed into service too early, and breaks down before reaching the planet. A supply ship is able to join the exploration ship, and an attempt is made to fool with the planet's weather, hiding the cities under thick clouds. All attempts to stop the cloud, or alter its course, fail.For the humans already in orbit, how do they tell the inhabitants that they must immediately flee their cities? Who do they tell? Will their warnings be heeded? How do they do it without violating the Noninterference Directive?As usual with McDevitt, this story is first-rate from beginning to end. It has good characters, and few, if any, wasted words. It does a fine job of holding the attention of the reader."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"He's one of the best writers in modern science fiction. He explains his technology somewhat, but not to the point you need an advanced degree in physics to understand (that might even hurt!) and has very character driven stories."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"Omega is a nice round up for the series. Chindi and Engines of God were both very good, and Omega is no slouch. It follows the same course of the other two books in which there is a long buildup and an explosive ending. McDivit is amazing at portraying the possible direction of extraterrestrial civilizations. His portrayal of the peace loving Goombas in this book is very extraordinary and yet lends itself to inductive reasoning. Simply an enthralling book."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"Most novels follow a story relatively tightly, and generally the relatively few characters are important throughout the whole plot.\\"Omega\\" is not such a novel. There are two main threads, loosely linked. In the far future, a destructive cloud called an 'Omega' will wreak havoc on Earth. The first thread is what most people would imagine would be the primary thread, the discovery of just what these Omega Clouds are. Instead, it's the second thread, the efforts to save another planetary civilization from another Omega Cloud, which takes center stage.For those who find Priscilla Hutchins their favorite character in this 'series' (a loose series at best, as it's generally possible to read any given book without reading the others), disappointment likely awaits. She's relegated to a much different, and lesser, role than in the previous books. McDevitt also generally introduces a great many characters in his books, and this is no exception. Many of the characters are described and appear in what seems a prominent role, only to be relegated to the sidelines. Characters die, sometimes with shocking suddenness. Questions are brought up and then seemingly ignored (although he rather 'tidily' answers all questions at the end in an odd 'voice'. It's written much like the text that appears at the end of movies, describing what happens to everyone after the main events, and feels a bit jarring.Other than what felt like a jarring ending, the book was well done. The writing style is clear and evocative, and I like that there are touches like 'newspaper headlines' at the end of some chapters to give a hint at the kind of world the characters live in outside of the events of the story. The characters are well defined, in spite of the number of them, but sometimes inconsistency in their reactions occur. At least they appear inconsistent because we as the reader, don't get enough time to learn about most of the characters in depth due to the sheer number of them. The pacing goes from slow and leisurely to fast and furious.In short, this doesn't come across as a highly technical, tight, piece of writing. It comes across instead much as life does. There are flaws yes, but it's worth a read for those wanting intelligent, thoughtful sci-fi."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"I've just finished Omega. It's been a couple of years since I last consumed all his previous works and there are two things that stay consistant in Jack's writing.First, he's created what has to be one of the most original universes in SF. Second, he always leaves a major plot twist unaddressed in his writing.While this is not his best work, Omega continues both his habits. He starts dropping hints on the alien's absense of children, but that leaves open the question of their longitivity which is never addressed.It's also implausible that the Monument Makers, with over 2000 years to stop the Omega clouds never tried what the heros tried to save the people of Lookout.Oh well, we all have to eat, and Jack's going to make his royalties off this one, but he could have done better. He's one of the best writers in the business right now."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"Jack McDevitt is one of my favorite writers and that's why I was so dissapointed after I read this book. While it wasn't bad by any means it was nowhere near as good as Chindi or Deepsix or Infinity Beach. I think the problem that I had is that most of the book is taken by description by this alien civilization and how they live and act. Its rather boring and personally, I couldn't wait for something exciting to happen. I only hope his next book will be more satisfying."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"Jack McDevitt's &quot;Omega&quot; is a clever sci-fi story about dark clouds that roam the universe, threatening to wipe out intelligent life in their paths. One such cloud has Intigo in its crosshairs, and the loveable Goompahs are at risk of annihilation. The premise for who built these clouds and why is a little loosey-goosey, but the plot was sufficiently intriguing to keep me interested throughout. One could argue that McDevitt explores deeper themes in &quot;Omega,&quot; like human capacity to help others, the perils of arrogance, etc. But I won't go there. I read &quot;Omega&quot; because I wanted to enjoy a decent sci-fi book. I was disappointed by the dialogue and some hoaky relationships that McDevitt develops. But the concept of &quot;Omega&quot; was interesting enough to warrant three stars ... and a trip back to the bookstore to buy another McDevitt novel."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"I enjoyed this book, because it's part of the series about the omega clouds, and I've enjoyed the other books, and was looking forward to a good conclusion.However, I felt this book wasn't quite as strong as the other &quot;Hutch&quot; books that McDevitt has written (Engines of God, Deepsix, Chindi, ...). The problem, as some other reviewers have pointed out, is that there are far too many minor characters to keep track of. You never really get to know any of them, and it really becomes confusing trying to remember who is who, and why you even care what happens to each particular character.It's hard to really figure out who is the main character in this book. It certainly isn't Hutch, as she spends all of her time in an administrative role back home.The other main problem is that I felt the book kind of bogged down and got a bit slow towards the middle. The main characters were spending most of their time observing an alien civilization, and there really wasn't much action. They observed minute details about the aliens, such as who was going to marketplaces, who was going to lectures, etc, and it just really wasn't that interesting. When the action finally picks up near the end, everything is very predictable. It's not as good as Deepsix or Chindi where you were really drawn into the struggle of the characters.The final attempt at an explanation of what the omega clouds purpose is was a little weak. I won't spoil things by giving away any details, but I sure wouldn't mind if McDevitt forgot this ending and wrote another book that offered a better attempt at a final explanation.McDevitt also kills off minor characters far too easily. I swear in each of his books, theres been some bonehead character who takes a laser cutter to some alien artifact with obvious results. I mean, these people are scientists, explorers, archaeologists, etc -- they should have more sense than they do.All that being said, I would still recommend this book, especially if you've read the others in the series. The writing is good, and entertaining."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"...but still a very good read.Maybe I'm just not very bright, as some other reviews might suggest, but I enjoyed McDevitt's story mainly because the &quot;Goompah&quot; characters were as human as they were (no, I don't enjoy Barney).McDevitt left most of the &quot;wonder&quot; of discovery out of this story, deciding instead to tell the tale of a race about to face the Omegas rather than repeat the story of finding planets and remnants of civilisations that have already fought and lost their battle with the clouds.I thought it was well done, and will continue to enjoy McDevitt's future work."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"General Outline:Priscilla \\"Hutch\\" Hutchens is just trying to enjoy her new directors job at the academy when one of those pesky omega clouds (if its not natural the cloud descends on it and destroys whatever intelligent life it finds, space ships, planets,etc) turns up. Unfortunatley since they were first discovered, by her on her first mission, there hasn't been much progress on doing anything about them. After all what's the big deal, it's 1000 years away from earth, its sombody elses problem. This cloud though does not want to follow the rules and it turns when it detects life on a planet the humans were not aware of. So starts the race to either destroy the cloud or turn it away from the defenseless planet and maybe finally understand what the clouds are exactly.-------If you like books that have a lot of detail but keeps the story moving you proably wont be able to put this book down. If on the other hand you dont like a story that bounces around a bit between the numerous characters with a few fast forwards and then rewinds and then slows down towards the middle... don't put the book down the end makes up for when the omega cloud finally reaches the planet. Then its *focused*. I really like this book, these type don't seem to come around much where the author makes the nuts and bolts of things really interesting. The only thing that was a little annoying was the fact that most of the main characters from the previous books are older, therefore in some cases they can't do what they want due to careers (Hutch), tunnel vision(David), and various other minor charaters(this book is definetly THE END for some characters)it may be realistic but its annoying because there annoyed that they cant go out there beat the alien baddie up.

If you've not read McDevitt, and are at all a fan of Science Fiction, you need to go out there and find yourself a copy of 'The Engines of God,' 'Infinity Beach,' 'Deepsix,' and 'Chindi.' Now. If you're not a huge fan of Science Fiction, let me tell you, though there's some astrophysics in there, McDevitt writes a lot more sociologically, adventure-action, and philosophically than nearly any other contemporary science fiction author I know, with the exception of Robert J. Sawyer. That said, his style is quite deft, as is Sawyer's, and a lot of people just don't 'get' it - as is obvious from some of the reviews written here. I happily suggest reading a chapter in the store prior to purchase, though I've yet to meet someone while working in my bookstore's Sci-Fi section who didn't like McDevitt.Okay, fan-boy praising hereby endeth.The story picks up the character of Priscilla Hutchins (who, now married and with a kiddy, plays a much more administrative and planet-bound role) and the storyline of the Omega clouds. Strange clouds that pop up, find anything remotely geometrical (especially, say, buildings), and blast them to bits. They're all over the universe, but why worry, as the one heading towards earth is not due for another, oh, nine hundred years. Yawn.But one of them being tracked by the Academy makes a right turn, and this time, in McDevitt's nearly lifeless galaxy, seems to be setting its sights on levelling an alien race who are somewhere around the Ancient Greece level of evolution. In about nine months.The race is on - but to do what? Try to stop the cloud - no one knows how. Try to save the race - again, how do you save a race that's about to be hit by tsunamis, tidal waves, tornadoes and all the other horrid things the Omega clouds do? Obviously, it would be wrong to step in, break protocol, and talk to the natives?Right?The story is very high paced, and as is always McDevitt's style, you never know who will make it to the end (he is not above killing off a character in a completely realistic fashion - by which I mean there's no hero capable of dodging all the bullets all the time), and his tendancy to through in a few philosophical characters absolutely shines in this book. McDevitt, as always, delivered a solid adventure worthy of any Sci-Fi buff's attention, but in a manner accessible to those who don't read Sci-Fi on a regular basis. Superb!"},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"Strangely enough (the book was released quite a while ago) I've found myself to be the first one to review it. Everyone's waiting for paperback? (I've actually tuned in to READ opinions on this one, but since there are none - I'll put my two cents.)This book is rather typical for Jack McDevitt of late. I'm a huge fan of his, and to me his best work is still _A Talent for War_, with _Infinity Beach_ and _Ancient Shores_ coming very close. In his best efforts he creates an intriguing mystery and explores it with us through main protagonists. This scheme fully applies to all the books in the _Hutch trilogy_: _The Engines of God_, _Chindi_, and the last one, _Omega_ (well, there's also the _Deepsix_, but it's more of a _rescue-them_ thriller and doesn't feature any grand ideas). Space archeology is intriguing subject indeed, but unfortunately the scheme works less and less with each subsequent book. McDevitt has an increasing tendency to bury the main plot (i.e. archeology, Chindi exploration, or omegas themselves) under some rather mundane adventures and constant attempts to rescue one or another character from various (but not terribly creative) dangers, mostly self-induced, which after a while gets incredibly tiresome. This, to a lesser extent, was also the problem of _The Engines of God_,but that book still had great sense of wonder. However, the fundamental problem of the book is that these ordeals constitute the major part of it, with so little space given to the mystery of the omega clouds, that the solution to it feels almost as an afterthought (and, frankly, quite tedious one - but no spoilers here). Also, I have to say that, within the context of this solution to the origin of the omegas, some of the events of the two previous books just make no sense to me.Ultimately, the book reads as a mixture of _The Engines of God_ and _Deepsix_, with far more of the latter in the mix. This might sound like a good combination, but it really isn't. For a fast-paced _rescue-them_ thriller it's far too slow, and for a book of discoveries on a grand scale it doesn't really have anything new. Oh yes, McDevitt introduces a whole new civilization of Goompahs; however, he fails to describe it in any convincing way, and at best they're still _men in funny costumes_, to put it in great Star Trek tradition. Honestly, rather sketchingly presented Noks from the first book feel much more compelling. So, if you loved _The Engines of God_ and _Chindi_ (doesn't seem to be very likely, this one), then you don't need an invitation. Others, who are new to McDevitt, might want to try his earlier books, they're well worth it."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"\\"Omega\\" is the fourth novel in the Priscilla Hutchins series, and quite possibly the last, though I hope not.The archaelogical mysteries which were prevalent in the first three books are gone, replaced by a xeno-sociology/rescue mission.

He may take technological shortcuts at times, but McDevitt is a master at creating exceedingly human characters and seeing what they will do in futuristic sociological situations. In Omega, the story revolves around a newly discovered, intelligent alien race - one that unknowingly lies in the path of imminent destruction.McDevitt's readers have followed Patricia \\"Hutch\\" Hutchinson through some wonderfully exciting adventures (in The Engines of God, Deepsix, and Chindi). In what looks to be the final Hutch novel, the focus shifts considerably. The intrepid hero of past jaunts now finds herself behind a desk, serving as the Director of Operations at the Academy, when word comes in that intelligent life has been discovered on a distant planet. Mankind had come close before, finding two exceedingly primitive alien societies, turning up lost artifacts on a number of worlds left by the mysterious Monument-Makers, and discovering a gigantic ship that served effectively as a museum of past interstellar races. Overshadowing everything was the discovery of omega clouds, wholly mysterious entities roaming the universe and destroying life-bearing planets. One of these omega clouds is headed for Earth, but governments and scientists have put little money into research efforts because the cloud is not due for another 900 years. The newly-discovered inhabitants of the planet unceremoniously dubbed Lookout, however, have a mere nine months before seemingly inevitable destruction.Hutch coordinates the rushed effort to get people out there to do what they can to save lives. Because of their resemblance to a popular children's cartoon character, the inhabitants there are dubbed Goompahs - and the people of earth fall in love with them (which raises all sorts of issues in and of itself). The first Academy personnel to reach the planet surreptitiously stash recording devices all over the place, allowing scientists and linguists to begin trying to interpret the language and understand the culture based on recorded conversations, debates, plays, etc. The Goompahs are unusual in that they live comparatively simple lives seemingly free of war and full of play; their cities all cluster around a central isthmus, and they seem to have no desire to expand across their seas. They are, in essence, many a scientist's dream come true - but they will all be dead within the year unless mankind can figure out a way to save them (and to do so in such a way that they are not alerted to mankind's presence).An intensive effort is made to destroy or divert the deadly cloud - and to camouflage the Goompah cities in the event the cloud does hit. As disaster draws nigh, brilliant minds try to figure out a way to warn the Goompahs of the coming cataclysm and evacuate them to higher ground - Protocol or no Protocol. Everyone involved becomes fascinated by these noble innocents and their simple yet enlightened Goompah philosophy of life. This is the equivalent of a sociological study of an alien culture - and McDevitt works his way through all sorts of ethical dilemmas and provocative questions in his typically deft, insightful manner. As the cloud closes in, the pace of the story goes into overdrive, and true heroes emerge on both sides of the alien divide. It feels strange not to have Hutch out there making more of her patented miracles happen, but the scientists on the frontlines of this unprecedented effort grow into well-developed characters capable of producing some on-the-fly magic of their own.Omega does have a few small faults, however. Technology such as light-benders (allowing for invisibility) makes things far too easy for the scientists, a couple of human dimensions of the story (especially the early death of one of the project leaders due to another person's moment of utter stupidity) don't have the lasting impact they should have, and the ultimate explanation of the omega clouds themselves is rather disappointing. Still, McDevitt never fails to sweep me up in the events he describes, and I enjoyed this novel just as much as the author's earlier works in the Hutch series."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"Omega is the fourth novel in the Hutch series, following Chindi. In the first volume of this series, Priscilla \\"Hutch\\" Hutchins piloted the expedition that discovered the omega clouds in 2202. Twenty-eight years later, an omega cloud turned from its path and approached Moonlight (Brinkman IV), an iceworld with extensive ruins. David Collingdale led an Academy team that tried to destroy the cloud with nuclear weapons. Although the bombs tore great holes in the cloud, it recovered and carried through the attack, yet missed one city hidden within a blizzard.In this novel, four years later, Hutch is acting Director for Operations at the Academy. She receives word from Broadside that another omega cloud, 3000 lightyears away, has turned from its path and that an academy ship, the Bill Jenkins, has been diverted to check the target system for artificial structures. Elsewhere, other Academy ships have been investigating the omega clouds. The Peter Quaqmor team find something unusual directly in front of their cloud: a 240-sided vessel that looks like a hedgehog. When the team drills a hole into the vessel, however, everything in the vicinity disappears in a great flash.Academy ships soon find that hedgehogs are leading every omega cloud that they have investigated, with one exception. The cloud that recently turned aside does not have a hedgehog in front of it, but one was found on the original path. Apparently the clouds normally follow the hedgehogs, but can change directions after detecting objects with right angles, such as artificial structures, in order to attack those objects.When the Jenkins reaches the target system (which the team names Lookout), they find that funny looking aliens dwell in a limited area on the surface. Since Hutch has been anticipating this situation, she sends two more ships to Lookout. One contains a team of linguists and nabobs and the other is a freighter carrying rainmaking gear, holographic projectors and a huge box kite. The mission chief is David Collingdale, who is determined that the cloud will not destroy the homes of this civilization.In this story, the aliens, who look like the Goompahs in a popular children's show, catch the interest and sympathy of the general public, prompting a number of movements and activities to profit from the situation. For example, a drive to provide assistance to the natives is well funded from public donations. However, various firms also produce dolls and other products based on the alien society. Moreover, the media and other entertainment industries want footage of the aliens during the crisis to titillate their patrons.Hutch is squarely in the middle of the efforts to analyze the omega clouds and to avert a catastrophe on Lookout. The Commissioner stays as far away from these efforts as possible to avoid any fallout from a possible failure. Hutch gets to talk to all the flaky, greedy and narrow-focused opportunists who want transportation to Lookout.Meanwhile, Digger Dunn and the team on the Jenkins are getting to know the Goompahs. They have been provided with lightbenders, so that they can walk invisibly among the Goompahs, setting pickups in public places to collect data for analysis by the linguists on the al-Jahani. They start in the city which they have named Athens, due to its architecture, but called Brackel by the natives.This story is the best so far in a particularly good series. The aliens have many human attributes, but seem to mostly lack any form of bigotry or fanaticism. They seem to be more flexible in their thinking than humans. However, they are terrified of the human image because of the resemblance to a type of demon in their mythology. They run off screaming whenever Digger appears, which rather depresses his mood.Highly recommended for McDevitt fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of alien societies and first contact.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"I was a bit shocked to see such an angry review of this book by an earlier reviewer. I guess some people just dont get mcdveitt. Some people didnt understand heinlein either i suppose.I'm not saying Mcdevitt is on par with heinlein, but the style of writing is very similar. If you are looking for hard SF, with science driven stories, this isnt for you. If you like character and idea driven stories, with a SF background, this is an ideal book, although not as good as some of the earlier in the series (The Engines of God, Deepsix, Chindi...although it really isnt neccessary to have read any of them before this one. While they do follow a sequence, they're stand alone books as well, the older books would just provide more background)The plot is more or less summarised in the reviews above, so i wont go into that. If you've liked Mcdevitt in the past, you will enjoy this as well. If you havent liked him, well, his writing hasnt changed, and probably wont. I'd reccommend the book to those who havent started in on Mcdevitt yet, but would reccommend starting with The Engines of God first as i feel it's a better starting point that jumping into this one."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"Chindi was the first &quot;Hutch&quot; novel I read and I suppose it's only natural that others are judged against that book. Jack McDevitt writes with the flair of a scientist. His novels deal with humans and our exploration and encounters with other alien lifeforms. He paints on a broad canvas with large strokes and this almost magisterial presentation covers up a few faults, both of which are common to many writers.By far the worst error is the use of too many characters. It is not that they are not interesting but the abundance of people (and having to follow their small storylines) gets in the way of the &quot;real&quot; story. For example, in this book there are the group at the Academy, her family, three separate ships and the group that has landed on the planet.Secondly, scientific progress is startling but society and politics seems static for 200 years. The many references to composers and authors of the 18th-20th century is just not realistic. The reproduction of headlines is a really BAD idea -it approaches parody.But that is not to say this is not an excellent read. The writing is, of course, literate, no obscenities, knowledgable and always interesting. The presentation of Hutch's saga, now with Tor and their daughter, was just the right touch, almost understated in tone. The love story between the explorers was another good point. The Goompahs were too human-like but that is part of our anthropomorphic tendencies. The ending was, like much else, delivered at low key only with a touch of poetry. The tie-in between Tor, Hutch's view on life, the alien's purpose for the Omega and art was a tour de force."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"A quiet, contemplative read. Readers accustomed to McDevitt's earlier works will enjoy this book. His style tends to resemble that of Asimov's books. The book is hard science fiction, but far removed from the grand space opera of clashing Dreadnought fleets in David Weber's work, or the technopolistic beepings of William Gibson. The action scenes in Omega, while well done, are comparatively low key. It is the idea that dominates, that of robots (or somethings) going from star to star, destroying civilisations that make buildings. In some ways a toned down version of Saberhagen's berserker hypothesis. The Omega clouds do not try to kill all life. And given that Saberhagen has not published anything recently about berserkers, McDevitt's musings are the best that you will find, from a current major author.The descriptive prose is minimal. Again you can see the resemblance to Asimov's works. The planetary scenes include several in the countryside of an inhabited world. McDevitt's sparse sketchings of this stand in utter contrast to the baroque lushness of Steve Stirling's rural worlds."},{"Title":"Omega (Engines of God)","review":"Chindi was the first McDevitt book I read and I was hooked. I was really looking forward to this book and was not disappointed. Between reading Chindi and Omega, I read all of his books except Moonfall which I am still trying to get.I think the best thing about McDevitt's writing is that he does include so many characters and not every one is important to the story -- hey, welcome to life! How many people are in the \\"story\\" of your life, you know their bio, they come and go, but they are not integral to the plot.He is simply a superb writer. I have brow-beat two people in my life who have no interest in reading sci-fi to read his books and they are also hooked.No book is perfect, so take all the criticisms with a grain of sand. Read anything and everything Jack McDevitt has written. Omega is not a bad place to start."},{"Title":"Mary Colter: Builder Upon the Red Earth (Grand Canyon Association)","review":"&quot;Builder upon the Red Earth&quot; is not the slick tome of expensive color photographs and analytical drawings that Mary Colter's unique contribution to Twentieth Century American Architecture deserves. However, this essentially biographical book is the only one in print showing pictures and telling the history of Mary Colters extrodinary talent.It is not clear if Mary Colter's obscurity is due to the fact that she was a woman practicing architecture in a time when the field was dominated by men or if the remote Southwestern locations of her most interesting works kept them hidden form view, but it is high time more people took a serious look at her work. Colter's projects, which are &quot;built ruins&quot; foreshadow the work of Western deconstructionist architects like Antoine Predoc or Tom Maine. Showing the work of Colter which is almost 80 years ahead of its time &quot;Builder upon the Red Earth&quot; should be in every young architects library."},{"Title":"Mary Colter: Builder Upon the Red Earth (Grand Canyon Association)","review":"This book is exactly what you'd expect from a book purchased at a gift shop at the Grand Canyon, bland.It is by no-means in-depth and spends more time describing the antiques that Colter decorated her buildings with than with her life. Colter was a fascinating woman and I would have liked to learn more about her than this book provided.Being as how Colter isn't exactly someone you're likely to read more than one book about, I would recommend purchasing something with more pictures and information than this one, which is more just a basic outline."},{"Title":"Mary Colter: Builder Upon the Red Earth (Grand Canyon Association)","review":"Mary Colter was an amazing woman. As an architect, she built structures that blend into the native landscapes in ways that enhance the landscape rather than detract from it. Her sense of style is still very much with us today in her love for Native American furnishings and artifacts. Her attention to detail has been largely responsible for the recognition of Southwestern art by those of us who live outside the region.That said, the book is a bit lean. It seems to be written for the casual reader rather than the scholar. But, given that it is marketed to the reading tourists, this is most probably appropriate. The many pictures (about half the pages) really help to bring the text to life.This book is a wonderful souvenir from the southwest, especially the Grand Canyon. This is its scope. Much more could have been written about Colter as one who broke through gender restrictions, about the spirituality that informed her work, and other topics. Depending on the reader's interests, this could be a plus or a minus. To this reader, it was just about the right level of detail."},{"Title":"Mary Colter: Builder Upon the Red Earth (Grand Canyon Association)","review":"Although I agree with the reviewer who says that Mary Colter deserves a far better book, I still highly recommend this one, as at least it fills in a gap that's almost the same size as the canyon where Colter's buildings still stand today. More people should read it so that some will be inspired to write more!"},{"Title":"Original Cause: The Unseen Role of Denial","review":"As with Right Use of Will, this book is not for everyone, but for the daring readers that are curious enough, and serious enough about recovering True Heart, this is certainly an authentic place to begin. The words are full of integrity and you will be challenged to see yourself and everyone around you with such insight as to be shocked into feeling your emotions, and to accept them and give them their rightful place in your life; to discover your True Essence."},{"Title":"Original Cause: The Unseen Role of Denial","review":"I've read Right Use of Will twice before reading Original Cause: The Unseen Role of Denial. RUoW was one of the most transformative works I've ever read. I didn't know what else could be said in 7 other books, as RUoW seemed so comprehensive, but now I'm beginning to understand how much more there is to say, and I feel kind of scared but also compelled to hunt down the others to read.Original Cause is another channeled book supposedly with the voice of God (the same one as the Biblical one) and goes through the process of creation from God's point of view, beginning with Himself (Spirit-Mind) and then detailing the birth of the mother-polarity (Will), Heart (the balance between spirit-will) and Form, then the various groups of entities--The Ancient Ones, orders of Archangels and Angels, and the Rainbow Spirits--representing the chakras of God. It was really repetitive reading this part (which constitutes most of the book) and I have to admit, boring, but its purpose was to show where \\"Lost Will\\" was created in the process of Creation in order for the reader to be triggered anywhere where s/he might find a reflection in what was happening. So even boredom is a trigger.The last section is more like RUoW in its exposition and thus provides more interesting reading. It talks about sex, death, and why there are so many people on earth--how many people contain only fragments of spirit or more lost will, and they aren't actual incarnations of spirits that were in other bodies before. A depressing thought to me, but a very interesting and unique viewpoint that deserves serious consideration at the very least for its worth in triggering the reader's emotions. The book also throughout tells you how to release the emotions that are coming up, thus by the end you could literally be a different person."},{"Title":"Original Cause: The Unseen Role of Denial","review":"This is very profound, although it is not for skeptics. I think it is best not throw one's total belief in any one writing, but his book does have interesting thoughts. Some parts are quite unbelievable and should be taken with a \\"grain of salt\\". All of these books can be obtained from the author at a web site under \\"Right Use of Will,\\" or can be found used at Amazon or ebay. If this is really from Source, it might help to understand who \\"God\\" really is although many will not want to give up the rosy image of God that they already have. There are some parts that have me doubting."},{"Title":"Kevin and Kell the Roleplaying Game","review":"Kevin and Kell the RPG is a licensed role-playing game based upon the popular comic strip by Bill Holbrook.This game allows players to play characters from the comic strip, or to create their own characters and put them into the world of Domain. The players spend points to make their character, and with the simple system are able to make their furry character anything they can imagine.It is a lot of fun, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Kevin and Kell the Roleplaying Game","review":"I got this for the webcomic's characters and their specifications.It is stuck before about 2005, and has some of the desired character sheets.It does have a complete role playing game in it.While you can not have a qualifier for everything, this comes close, and anything new can be considered in the light of what is here.I accurately gets the feeling of the webcomic.I am still not sure that I could predict the outcome of a fight between Kell and RL, though."},{"Title":"The Two Tone Story","review":"I've owned this book for years, and I keep going back to it. Incredibly comprehensive and makes my love for the history of ska increase each time I pick it up.Typical George Marshall style, he has lots of facts, stories, quotes and PICTURES!!!!! Lots of really great visuals you can't find any place else.I love this book, and I wouldn't trade it for anything!A must have for any rudie."},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"Mullen tells it exactly as it is. Gold in the Water is a must-read for all competitive swimmers and gives an inside picture that will fascinate readers who haven't realized the complex physical and emotional issues involved in training at an elite level."},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"\\"Seabiscuit\\" is not about a horse. It is about the people around the horse and their competitive desires, ambitions, and very interesting lives. In exactly the same way, \\"Gold in the Water\\" is not just about the sport of swimming. It is about a handful of compelling people living the Olympic Dream and trying to learn the elusive secrets of being great.Quite simply, I could not put this book down the first time I read it. After a second reading, I believe this is the best true-life sports drama I've ever read. The message is as strong as Lance Armstrong's \\"It's not about the Bike\\", and the writing is far better.Personally, I think businesses could benefit from the motivation messages. Young people would do well to emulate the strong character of the books subjects, particularly two swimmers who don't even make the Olympics, Kurt Grote and Dod Wales. I thought the coach, Dick Jochums, is too hard and stubborn in places. But he got me to start working out again, so he can't be all bad. This is definitely a book to put on your list."},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"Mullen is magnificent! He took me where no other writer has even previously done. He made it personal and made it as emotional as all hell! Congrats.As an avid fan of phyiscal sports and rarely a fan of soft individual type sports, such as swimming, tennis, and dancing I was entralled with the dedication and the courage of these immortal athletes. Time and time again Mullen sent CHILLS down my back!!Have you ever found your self throwing fake punches while watching Boxing on ESPN or while watching the Rocky movies ?Throughout the 300 some odd pages I was throwing jabs and crosses into my pillow because of the extreme adreline rush of Kurt's and Tom's swims, and throwing upper-cuts towards the accusations of Dara's enhanced swims.Gold in the Water is GOLDEN and it often left me looking at the ceiling and questioning whether I had ever really pushed myself to greatness...or if I ever could. Keep them coming PH!!"},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"This book shows the price that must be paid to be the best. The facet that stands out the most to me is the turmoil these men put themselves through in the process of preparation for the Olympics. Everyone already knows it takes a great deal of physical effort to be an Olympian, but PH Mullen shows how heavy the emotional burden must be as well.The characters are almost too distinctively defined - they seem like players in a Dickens novel. From the hard working underdog (Wilkens), the confident veteran (Grote), the cold technician (Wales), or the scarred phenom (Blahnik), anyone who reads this can find a person and a situation that they can relate to. The book is so much bigger than just swimming; it describes the process and pitfalls, the \\"agony and the ecstacy\\" of choosing to follow a dream.I have never attempted to compete at the Olympics, but I have won and lost my share of races. The author uses his own firsthand experience as a competitive swimmer to provide surgical insights into the emotions of the athletes. He discusses the hunger for victory, the confusion of failing to meet expectations, and the eventual tedium of training as only a person who has felt it for himself can.I would recommend this book to just about anyone, but especially anyone interested in studying how different personalities face a challenge."},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"All I can say is that it is one of the best true-life sports accounts I've ever read. As I came into the final chapters about the Trials and Olympics, I could literally feel my pulse quicken and the fight-or-flight part of my nervous system dump adrenaline into my system.Having personally been down the road of Olympic training for rowing, I could really identify with the characters and what they were going through. If anyone thinks the depiction of the pressures and exhaustion the athletes face in training for the Olympics was &quot;played up&quot;, they are sorely mistaken. If anything they were toned down. Training at this level is utterly exhausting-- physically, mentally, and emotionally. The emotional side is the most draining as it is the aspect that must be kept in control constantly as it either instills confidence or lets self-doubt creep in. And I know many elite athletes (including myself) whose personal relationships were destroyed as a result of the intensity and single-minded dedication required to excel at this level. There is a tremendous amount of sacrifice involved that most people never see.But back to the book....I thought Mr. Mullen did a magnificent job of getting into the minds of the athletes and coaches...in a way, swimming really was really just a backdrop to what I felt was the true story- the interaction of the players and their motivations, fears, desires, etc. At the same time, I was never left wondering about some technical aspect of the swimming.A must read for everyone, especially young people who think that school or any other challenge is &quot;too hard&quot;."},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"I hate Chicken Soup for the Soul books. I'm not interested in reading a book that makes you feel warm and musy for three seconds and then allows you to live your life the same way thereafter. So normally, I won't read an &quot;inspirational&quot; book. But this book was amazing! First of all, it didn't just talk about who we would expect, like Moses or Krayzelburg. This just went into detail about one swim club, and shared the stories of the top swimmers from there, even though they weren't all gold medalists. Further, you got to see all sides of their story. How they got into swimming, what the press thought of them, how they interacted with each other, how they did at other meets. The whole book is so interesting, and you will laugh and you will cry. Most importantly you will stay up until 4AM all week until you finish it because this is not a book you can easily put down!"},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"If this book can reach a wide enough audience, it will finally elevate swimming to the status it should enjoy in the United States. For a century, the US has produced the world's best swimmers (and this book shows who they are, and how it's done). And yet, unlike Australia, where swimmers enjoy icon status, swimmers in America are considered &quot;soft&quot; (as one reviewer put it), or simply not considered at all. This fabulously detailed and riveting story reveals the incredible attributes, and glaring flaws, of the swimmers and coaches whose lives it depicts. This is a wonderful contribution to sports literature, and a long-needed depiction of how swimming programs in the U.S. produce great athletes and great people."},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"I feel like I have been to the Olympics. This book is as grand and awesome as it is deft and smart--It presents a snapshot so intimate and truthful about the elite athlete and the drama of every day &amp; every minute counting. A friend (former swimmer) gave me an early copy of the book and said I would learn to love swimming by the time I was finished. She was right. I almost jumped out of my seat to shout encouragement and I didn't what it to end. That's how affecting and personal this story is. But more to the point, the book reminded me why I loved sports in general. Like Chariots of Fire, Hoop Dreams, and sports books like Lance Armstrong's &quot;It's Not About The Bike,&quot; the athletes here are heroes whether they win or lose. Should be required reading for any sports enthusiast!"},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"P. H. Mullen writes in his book, &quot;Gold in the Water,&quot; that due to the nature of the sport, most competitive swimmers dream of Olympic glory. Our 13-year-old son is no exception. When this book was advertised on the USA Swimming website I knew it would be a winner with him as a Christmas gift.The book gets into the heads, minds, and hearts of the coaches and swimmers from the Santa Clara Swim Club as they prepared for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. Mr. Mullen also is able to make the reader understand some of the complexities and paradoxes of competitive swimming--which made us nod in agreement as we read. Why, for example, is it that a swimmer who finishes first in a race can be disappointed while one who finishes sixth (or even dead last) may be ecstatic?When the book arrived at my work, I glanced through it and was immediately drawn in.... so much so that I ended up reading the book before giving to our son. I carried it around in a plain manila envelope so he wouldn't see what I had. I couldn't for the life of me remember how these swimmers faired in Sydney so for me it was a race to the end of the book.In addition to telling the story of the men of the Santa Clara Swim Club, &quot;Gold in the Water&quot; explores both the heartache and joy of the Olympic dream including the intense amount of training required before one can even begin to live that dream.I've recommended this book to all the swim parents at our local Aquatic Center and also to friends who &quot;just don't get it&quot; when it comes to understanding what the world of competitive swimming is like.As for our son, he, too, enjoyed the book, spent his free time during Christmas break reading it, and used it for the basis of his book report due when school resumed in January."},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"It's hard to describe just how great this book really is. I picked it up after reading the Amazon reviews and within the first 5 pages I was hooked; it had already started elevating my heart rate and getting my blood coursing through my veins. I've often preached to my friends that non-fiction is incredibly boring and I usually only read fiction but I'll tell you that no book has ever been this exciting for me. I read it over the course of a few weeks, reading a chapter or two a day and the emotional ups and downs that this book provided were something else. I would often read before a workout or a swim and every time I would end up hitting the gym a little harder or swimming a little faster. I am so grateful that a book like this even exists.I didn't really get a chance to play sports in high school because I went to so many different schools so when I finally got to junior college I decided to pick up swimming at the ancient age of 18. Knowing little about the sport, I fumbled around trying to pick up on everything as fast as I could. I'm so glad that I picked up this book because now I know so much about the swimming world and I can be confident around the team and coaches and know what to expect during workouts and practice. It's true that I'll never be an Olympian or even a really great swimmer but I'll still get to experience a little of the thrill of competition and a lifetime of good fitness. I think this book taught me about the life of a professional athlete and now I don't have to feel like I missed out because I can still enjoy the fun of the sport without the heartbreak and back-breaking hard work.I could go on for longer but I don't feel like writing a three page review and I'm not really a good writer so I'll just say that I recommend this book to everyone but especially athletes and ESPECIALLY swimmers!"},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"This will go down as the best swimming book ever written.

The people written about, coaches and swimmers alike, are covered with the development you would expect from a seasoned fiction writer.Elite swimmers - Human?

He's the oldest on the US team over there - but not to be deterred!"},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"Mullen writes well and provides insights that only a former competitive swimmer could convey about the physical and emotional rigors of elite training. Overall, I loved the book and was fascinated to learn of the sacrifices made by coaches and swimmers alike as they prepared for the olympic trials of 2000.Mullen's detailed description of the inner thinking of Coach Jochums of the Santa Clara Swim club is enlightening, but also somewhat disturbing. Though Mullen provides much evidence to suggest that Jochums coaching practices are often punitive and even abusive at times, Mullen minimizes the potential harmfulfulness of Jochums' behavior and appears to overvalue Jochum's impact and effectiveness, even referring to Jochums as one of swimming's best motivators. I also wish that Mullen had focused more of his attention on some of the other, less well known swimmers who were training and swimming at the time.Despite these drawbacks, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about swimmers' depth of committment and intensity of training and preparation during the months and weeks leading up to the Olympic Games"},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"The book is amazing.

But the book is well written and I enjoyed reading it - author did a great job of making an entertaining and interesting read while exposing some real characters of the swimming world."},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"At long last, an up close and personal look at USA elite swimmers. Mr. Mullen tells an engrossing tale of the odyssey of four young men striving for berths on the Olympic team, Australia 2000. Most Americans are unaware of the depth, strength and long tradition of the USA's predominance in Olympic swimming. US teams are so strong that unfortunately, we have to leave at home as many deserving finalists as those who go. Only two representatives of each individual swimming event are allowed for each country. (It used to be three, but the powers that be were tired of the US taking gold, silver and bronze in every event.)The lead actors are All-American Tom Wilkens, multi-faceted Kurt Grote and everyone's dream or nightmare of a coach, Dick Jochums. Supporting roles showcase super controlled Dod Wales, son of an acclaimed Olympic swimmer, and burn out Tate Blahnik who has it all, but is tired to death of competitive swimming. The author follows these magical four for eighteen months culminating in the 2000 Olympics. The front cover calls these four \\"ordinary men.\\" I strongly disagree; they are unique and extraordinary athletes. Tom Wilkens, in particular, grabbed my attention, affection, and awe.This book is a page-turner; I read it in one sitting. It is not just for swimming aficionados, but also for anyone who likes to read about what it takes to become a champion and the inevitable burdens on the strength and psyche of the contenders. A glossary of terms would have been helpful, but the author is masterful in his explanations. As a parent of a former age group swimmer, I can attest that this is no puff piece; Mr. Mullen tells it like it is."},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"This book is a compelling and engrossing character study of a group of super-achieving athletes with congruent but sometimes competing aspirations. It has an excellent narrative drive that made it a real page-turner, and perhaps because it pulls no punches in its treatment of its focal characters, the reader is left with a deep appreciation for the complex and usually (but not always) admirable qualties of elite athletes. Swimmers tend to be smart, and this is an intelligent treatment of both swimming and competition in general: this book is to the standard sports expose as collegiate swimmers' GPAs are to the GPAs of (pick your contact sport) players. Although I read this on the recommendation of a friend who is a serious swimmer, I feel it deserves an audience far beyond the competitive swimming world, for which I'm sure it will be required reading."},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"I am not a swimmer, so I was amazed to find myself hooked by Gold in the Water from the first lines on Page One. This incredible book has everything you will ever want in a sports tale--drama, rivalry, flawed character, human emotion, and high stakes. The characters themselves were so real you feel like you're their teammates. I've never read a book that comes remotely close to chronicling so much intimate, personal details about world-class athletes. Surprise (not): Deep down, they're like everyone else. I can't remember the last time a book could make my andrenaline race AND make me cry (more than once). The final pages were full of surprises. That made the unexpected ending all the more triumphant. Gold in the Water sets the standard for describing the pure beauty of athletes chasing an impossible dream with all their hearts."},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"I was attracted to this book because my son is a competitive swimmer. He's not a voracious reader, but he zipped through Gold in the Water in a few days. Then he started passing it around his swim team. Last month, I read it. Mullen brings together a combination of understanding of the sport, empathy for athletes and coaches and a journalist's attention to truth and detail in putting together this book. The story of these athletes preparing for a year and a half for the two minute-event that will decide whether on not they make the Olympic team has all the emotion, conflict and suspense of a great novel. This is the best sports book I have read since Boys of Summer."},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"Mr. Mullen's writing is lucid and completely engrossing. The book is about the Syndey Olympics, but it opens several years earlier in the middle of a race between a \\"newcomer\\" and his older and more cagey mentor. I started reading about them while standing in a crowded bookstore lobby, and became so involved that I had to sitdown and read the first chapter. Wow! What a race! .... When I got it, I finished it over the weekend and the story only got better & better. It follows one Calif team and their Lombardi-esque coach for 2 years. The coach's story alone is enough to carry the book. You learn everything about swimming you never knew--what's a fast pool, why they wear Spiderman outfits to race, how they train. Sometimes the information is excessive but it never bogs down. This is definitely a sports book for non-swimming fans. If the book has a weakness, it's the Afterward, which takes place only a short time after the Olympics. All and all, this was 1 of the best sports books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"As an athlete and the parent of a swimmer who's \\"Gold\\" is making it to the NCAA Championships one day, I believe this book is one of the few that truly captures the highs and lows of the swimming world. P.H. Mullen brought tears to my eyes with his compassionate, yet brutaly realistic retelling of SCA swimmers going for the gold. This story helps you appreciate what happens everyday with every swimmer who truly dedicates themselves to being the best! The emotional and physical sacrifices made by swimmers all over the U.S. are not paralled in very many other sports. This book should be read by every athlete who has a dream!"},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"If you are not a swimmer already, you will want to be after completing this book. If you are a swimmer, then you will be thankful that someone has captured the essence of what those elite athletes at the other end of the pool do while you slog it out at 5 AM in the morning.Mullen does an unbelievable job capturing the unrelenting workouts, the devastating highs, the excruciating lows, and reality of what happens when you stick your neck out there to pursue a dream.Finally, as a competitive swimmer, Mullen is able to capture the awesomeness of these Olympians and at the same time showing that these people are indeed mere mortals. Most of the Olympians that I have seen train and have had the opportunity are much like Tom Wilkens: hard working, determined people who love their sport and are very approachable."},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"Most people have no idea what an competitive swimmer has to do to qualify for the olympics. My children have been swimming competitively for 7 years now at local and state events and even to us this book is an eye opener.I recommend this to anyone who is even remotely interested in swimming as a sport or the olympics as a whole. The general public sits in front of our TV's and watch the olympics and say \\"wow that swimmer swam really fast\\". It becomes so much more than that. What makes a swimmer? Is it his natural ability to swim fast or is it the one who trains the hardest swims the fastest. This book clarifies that it is a combination of several factors that carries a person to the olympic dream.After reading this book I guarantee that all of us will look upon Olympic athletes in a different light. I commend the author and the swimmers of the Santa Ana Swim club for opening up their doors and lives so that the rest of us can get a glimpse of what it is really like to strive for the ultimate goal.

Mullen's Gold in the Water is a story that i first came into contact with a couple years ago. It is a fast paced true tale about average men trying to accomplish their goals. Reading the story over and over has helped me get through the hard times in and out of the pool. You don't need to be a swimmer to appreciate this story, but it does help. As I am in film school now, this is one story that can inspire more people then Remember the Titans with the Olympic power of Miracle. I encourage every athlete, Olympic fan, parent, or anyone who has a goal to accomplish to buy a copy of this book and one for their coach or mentor. It is a book to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"wow, this book reads like a novel and makes you care about the outcomes. it should be a movie. what i liked best was how humble and down to earth the characters were. every one you root for and care about.

If I had any nits, I would say that at times, the book verged a bit on the melodramatic side and at other times seemed to repeat itself (not literally but in retelling, for example, the battles betwen Jochums and his swimmers) so that I felt as if I were reading the same scenarios more than once. However, one of the things I had intended to criticize actually turned out to be a feature I liked about the book (and this gets into why I say this review is for those who have read the book).On page xiii of the Introduction, the author tells us that the 2000 Summer Olympic Gammes &quot;were the most successful in history&quot;, that &quot;15 U.S. national records were set&quot;, and that &quot;the Olympic Games serve as this book's final exclamation point.&quot; (He does also say that &quot;this book is not about that story&quot;, but then adds &quot;at least not at first&quot;, implying to me that it IS about that story at the end.) As I was reading the book, I kept thinking back to those words, and mostly with annoyance. I kept asking myself: Why did the author tell us right at the outset how the story was going to end? Why couldn't he have kept us in suspense? Now we already know that the Santa Clara swimmers he profiles are all going to win gold medals. I figured that if the Games were so successful for the U.S. athletes and the author is focusing on these particular swimmers, then it is a foregone conclusion how the story ends.Thus, when I got to the end of the book and realized that the Olympic Trials and Games were more of a nightmare than a dream for most of the dramatis personae of this book, it actually improved my opinion of the book alot, not only because I felt that the author had cleverly thrown me for a loop back in the Introduction (even if that was not his intention), but also because it really reinforces the notion that life does not always end happily after after and the merely being the hardest worker and the most dedicated person and maybe the most worthy person (think especially Wilkens and Grote) does not always make for the Disney ending. In fact I wonder, if the author had his druthers, and could have created any ending he wanted for the 5 or 6 main swimmers profiled, whether he would have chosen for them to swim to gold medals in world-record times at the Olympics or whether he would have chosen the ending as it actually occurred. I feel that, perhaps from a standpoint of the personal affection he obviously had for swimmers such as Wilkens and Grote and Wales, he obviously would choose the gold medal option. However, from a standpoint of pure literary merit, I also feel that the ending as it actually occurred made for a better book."},{"Title":"Gold in the Water: The Extraordinary Pursuit.","review":"This book was an excellent example of human will and the sacrifices an athlete makes to achieve a dream.

The author makes a very strong case for one based on ethics, as opposed to one based on dogma and creed, which appealed to me on a lot of different levels. I recommend it to anyone trying to construct a faith that they can truly believe in."},{"Title":"The New Fish Cooking Encyclopedia","review":"\`The New Fish Cooking Encyclopedia' by Kate Whiteman is a combination of two earlier volumes, \`Great Fish and Shellfish' and \`The World Encyclopedia of Fish and Shellfish'. Since all three are titles published in the UK, it is unlikely that an American book buyer would have one or both of the earlier titles.There are many excellent general books on fish cookery, the best being \`Fish' by Mark Bittman and \`Fish and Shellfish' by James Peterson', and both of these books are a bit better for the typical American home cook than the volume currently under consideration; however, Whiteman's book still has a lot to recommend it to the professional cook and the serious foodie. I will mention its primary weaknesses first, so if you are adverse to these facts, you can stop now and go on with something more useful.First, the print in the book is quite small. Even with my reasonably good corrected eyesight, I would find the fine print annoying in the kitchen, and even in an easy chair. Second, true to its \`Encyclopedic' moniker, it is intent on covering just about every fish preparation method there is, even those which require a lot of work and special equipment, such as steaming a whole Fluke or making terrines. This makes the book a great source for the professional, but less interesting to the '30 Minute Meal' crowd. Third, while the recipes all include both Imperial (standard in American cookbooks) and metric measurements, the dual presentation is just a bit noisome, especially coupled with the tiny print. For example, an American may have to do a little head scratching to figure out what is meant by \`strong white bread flour'.On the other hand, there is much to recommend this book. Foremost is its thorough coverage, with excellent photographs, of many standard techniques in the professional kitchen. It also has full coverage of many species of fish not covered in less \`encyclopedic' works, such as cuttlefish, crayfish, barracuda, carp, garfish, eels, and \`prairie clams'. A second dimension of the book's comprehensive approach is that it covers virtually every fish preparation technique and recipe one can think of. While this may be of little value to the quick cook, it is essential to the professional. Even better is the fact that both general techniques and many individual recipes are illuminated by excellent photographs, although, like the fine print, the pics are sometimes just a bit small to fully reveal the details to the squinter among us with aging eyes.I especially like the organization of recipes into the eight chapters covering:SoupsAppetizersMousses, Pates and TerrinesSaladsEveryday Main CoursesPasta and Rice DishesLight and Healthy DishesElegant Dishes for EntertainingIf you have room for only one or a few books dedicated to fish cookery, this is certainly an excellent choice, especially if you can get it at a good price."},{"Title":"New Daily Study Bible: Complete Set (New Daily Bible) 17 vol. set","review":"This is a wonderful resource.

A very good commentary source."},{"Title":"New Daily Study Bible: Complete Set (New Daily Bible) 17 vol. set","review":"This edition, with minor changes and corrections, is essentially the same as the revised edition issued in 1975. What this edition and the previous revised edition fail to inform the reader of is that it does not contain all of the commentary text written by William Barclay.While the 17 volumes of the previous 2nd edition (published in the 1950's) contains a total of 5,195 pages, the revised edition has only 4,541 pages, or a reduction of 12.6%. The reduction is most noticeable in the 2 volumes on Revelation, which is reduced from 528 to 415 pages, a reduction of 21.4%. In Ephesians, the revised edition contains 30 fewer pages, a reduction of 19.1% (157/127). The Gospel of John is reduced by 87 pages, a reduction of 13.7% (634/547). In the commentary in Revelation 3:1-6 (Sardis: A Lifeless Church), well over 50% of the material written by Barclay in the 2nd edition is removed in the revised edition.This reduction in pages is not solely due to differences in formatting. It is largely due to the deletion of many portions of Barclay's commentary contained in the 2nd edition. I first noticed the selective deletion of portions of Barclay's original commentary in the commentary for John 13:33-35, in which Jesus speaks of loving one another as he loved us. In the 2nd edition, Barclay so beautifully states the following: \\"He [Jesus] knew all their [his disciples] weaknesses and yet He still loved them. Those who really love us are the people who know us at our worst and who still love us.\\" However, these two sentences, along with four other sentences, do not appear in the revised edition, and they do not appear in this edition. Repeatedly, key sentences and phrases are deleted from this edition. At another point in this commentary, Barclay states that: \\"It is when we live with people that we find out their moods and their irritabilities and their weaknesses.\\" Although this sentence is contained in this edition, the sentence that immediately follows it in the 2nd edition will not be found in this edition. That sentence is: \\"And others have the same experience with us.\\"Furthermore, the changes in the revised edition are not the work of William Barclay, but as William Barclay states in the introduction to the revised edition, \\"the work of revision and correction has been done entirely by the Rev. James Martin.\\" Clive Rawlins, who wrote an authorized biography of William Barclay, stated in the biography that it was especially questionable for Barclay to allow republication without his own personal revision (due to Barclay's physical decline, Rawlins indicates that Barclay was unable to make the revisions himself). Rawlins was very critical of the revisions by Martin, stating that the nature of the original work was not always respected. At one point, Rawlins stated that Martin's elimination of two key phrases was a great pity and lessened the force of Barclay's statement. In the introduction to the book of Romans, Rawlins stated that it was strange that Martin should have so completely missed Barclay's emphasis in the revised edition prepared by Martin. Rawlins stated in the biography that the reduction of approximately 600 pages in the 17 volume set was because of \\"vigorous pruning\\" of Barclay's writing. In conclusion, Rawlins found that the revisions made by Martin in the revised edition \\"are not of the highest order.\\"One change unique to this 21st century edition is that the editors have completely rewritten what Barclay said about homosexuality. This can be found in the commentary on I Corinthians 6:9-11. When the material has been completely rewritten, the editors have an obligation to inform the reader of this fact and explain why the changes were made.On the other hand, I cannot emphasize enough the value of Barclay's commentaries. His knowledge of the Greek language, the Jewish culture and religion, and the Roman occupation during the New Testament era is phenomenal. Furthermore, he has a unique ability to convey this immense knowledge in a manner which is very easy for any reader to understand. William Barclay has the ability to convey to the reader not only what that passage meant to the people to whom Jesus spoke to 2,000 years ago, but what those passages say to us today. On countless occasions, I have felt that Barclay was speaking to me personally as he discussed the relevance of the passage in his commentary.William Barclay's New Testament commentaries are the most insightful and meaningful commentaries that I have ever read, and I cannot recommend them highly enough. He has both challenged and inspired me; William Barclay's writings have truly changed my life. However, if you want to read all of what Barclay actually said instead of what some editor thought was important enough to leave in, then check with a used book store or do a used book search on the internet to get the 2nd edition of Barclay's Daily Study Bible."},{"Title":"New Daily Study Bible: Complete Set (New Daily Bible) 17 vol. set","review":"The Acts of the ApostlesThe Gospel of John - Volume 1 Chapters 1-7The Gospel of John - Volume 2 Chapters 8-21The Gospel of LukeThe Gospel of MarkThe Gospel of Matthew - Volume 1 Chapters 1-10The Gospel of Matthew - Volume 2 Chapters 11- 28The Letter to the RomansThe Letter to the HebrewsThe Letters of James and PeterThe Letters of John and JudeThe Letters to the CorinthiansThe Letters to the Galatians and EphesiansThe Letters to the Phillippians, Colossians and ThessaloniansThe Letters to Timothy, Titus and PhilemonThe Revelation of John - Volume 1 Chapters 1-5The Revelation of John - Volume 2 Chapters 6-22"},{"Title":"New Daily Study Bible: Complete Set (New Daily Bible) 17 vol. set","review":"My dad who was a Pastor for over 40 years had the entire collection of William Barclay books.

Written about 50 years ago, much of the background information and schalorship in his commentaries are outdated. Sometimes he stretched historical/cultural background too much to explain the text. Conservative readers should be aware that Barclay was a universalist (one who believes that all people will be saved ultimately). He does not believe in miracles and tries to explain them away in his commentaries on the Gospels. However, his comments on the relevance of the Bible can still be very valuable for discerning readers. His volumes on Hebrews and Revelation are still among the best commentaries written for lay believers on these two books in the New Testament, and are therefore still worth getting.Conservative beginning students of the New Testament might try Holman New Testament Commentary series as an alternative for Barclay's. More exciting, yet very accessible to students at all levels is Tom Wright's \\"For Everyone\\" series, though some will disagree with his interpretations/theology. NIV Application Commentary series is generally a very good series for evangelical readers. Mainline/liberal students should try New Interpreter's Bible."},{"Title":"New Daily Study Bible: Complete Set (New Daily Bible) 17 vol. set","review":"Interesting, insightful and a must have for exogesis.

A short author bio at the end of the book notes that Huynh was born in Vietnam and eventually moved to the United States. This book is a wonderful account of growing up in rural Vietnam.Huynh describes his life in a village on a riverbank, with a jungle and mountains nearby. The book is divided up into several short vignettes that describe the lives of the people and animals of this world. Although the danger and violence of some sections may be upsetting to some readers, I get the sense that the author is trying to present a truthful portrait of rural life.There are accounts of many interesting people, such as Huynh's opera loving, karate fighting grandmother. But I was particularly fascinated by the many accounts of the domestic and wild animals of Huynh's homeland. I loved the descriptions of animal behavior and the accounts of the interactions between animals and people, between animals of the same species, and between animals of different species. We meet monkeys, otters, a fearsome crocodile, and many other creatures. It's a rich tapestry of life that is described vividly by the author. One of the most memorable animal characters is Huynh's water buffalo, Tank, a creature of great strength, loyalty, and courage.This is a wonderful book that is written in a very effective, straightforward style that is ultimately quite poignant. It's sort of like a Vietnamese response to Laura Ingalls Wilder's beloved \\"Little House\\" books. I recommend \\"The Land I Lost\\" to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"the land i Lost: Adventures of a Boy in Vietnam","review":"I couldn't put this book down, and now that my 9 year old is reading it he can't either.

I learned so much about so many creatures I have never encountered. I kept wishing the book had been longer.Quang Nhuong Huynh lead such an interesting life. I would like to know more about his adult life and army service with the South Vietnamese. Sadly, that will not be possible (even though he has several unpublished pieces), as I found that he died in 2001.For those parents who don't review books before their children read them, you may want to know that opium is mentioned in the book.

There is a great scene where the author and his sister catch some little birds. I won't tell you any more. Oh, if you are not comfortable with the death of animals and some villagers from snake bites and wild boar attacks, then I wouldn't recommend this book. All in all it's a pretty good book."},{"Title":"the land i Lost: Adventures of a Boy in Vietnam","review":"I am a student teacher in the University of California, Davis credential program and am currently student teaching an English Language Learners class at Florin High School in Sacramento.

Though some chapters are funny, others are quite disturbing and gruesome. It is also not very well written. The chapters are disjointed, different tales within chapters are not made to flow together, and the end simply 'ends'; there is no final summery, no statement of the author's purpose, no nothing. Though only appropriate, in my eyes, for children ten years and older, it is written as if it was meant for seven year-olds. Perhaps this is because the author was only about seven when many of these things happened, but still, he should have realized that the average seven year-old has not had to face anything near as disturbing as the things he recounts in this book! All in all, I'd say, if you're really interested in Vietnam, then read it. It will give you information that history books don't give. Otherwise, skip it."},{"Title":"the land i Lost: Adventures of a Boy in Vietnam","review":"I am a student teacher...(and) am currently student teaching anEnglish Language Learners class...

If you didn't, you should read this book. The book \\"The Land I Lost\\" is set in Vietnam. The author's past life produces the source of the book. His name is \\" Huynh Quang Nhuong.\\" The main character lived in a hamlet in Vietnam. Mostly this book shows nature, and how they adapt, and how they live together. During summer they work on farms, and during winter they hunt for their food. They keep animals like cows. They use to them for agriculture and to protect themselves from the wild animals who come down to their shelter. Also when the wild animals come down to their hamlet the villagers make groups and catch them or make them leave their hamlet. Sometimes they hunt animals and train monkeys or birds...etc Mostly they lived very peacefully and joyfully.But why is this book called \\"The Land I Lost.\\" That is what you have to think about. The end of the last chapter, a battle was going on, so I think that's why the author said land I lost... I didn't like the way the author wrote about the battle story, because it was really short, so it didn't make me understand why they lost their land.But I could see the other ways of life like the hamlet villagers. These days everybody sits on their chair and plays computer games, by this time, instead computer games we can see the difference between rural and urban and how they relate with nature and their given environment.

The author of this book is the main character in this book and he experienced how to survive in a village where there are dangers. This book was telling about how it feels and what danger to live in a village a long timed ago. Huynh was still a little kid at that time and he lived with his grandma, grandpa, and his cousin. There are some dangerous parts where he and his cousin have to deal with the wild hog, python, horse snake, crocodile, and other animals. He also had a friend and it feels like a family, which is a bull named Tank.I like this book because I'm interested on how the people from past live.

He was, and is, the English and Canadian counterpart of Lewis and Clark. He visited the Mandan villages on the Missouri River in 1798. He crossed the Continental Divide in 1807 and spent five winters on the west side of the divide trading with the Indians. He explored the Columbia River from its origin to the Pacific Ocean. He kept complete journals. He was a better writer than Meriwether Lewis, although not Lewis' equal as a naturalist. He took astronomical readings and did his own computations of both latitude and longitude. Because of this, his maps were much more accurate than those of William Clark. Later in his life, Thompson helped survey the boundary between Canada and the United States. Thompson's story is also the story of Charlotte, his half-Indian wife of 57 years who bore him 13 children. She and the first few children traveled with him in his explorations, including his first crossing of the Continental Divide. Jack Nisbet is also the author of \\"Sources of the River,\\" another book about David Thompson. \\"The Mapmaker's Eye\\" is a bit more readable and is better illustrated"},{"Title":"The Mapmaker's Eye: David Thompson on the Columbia Plateau","review":"Mapmaker's Eye is the amazing biographical chronicle of the adventures of David Thompson, a Canadian fur trader, explorer, and cartographer respected as a hero in Canada yet largely unknown in the United States.

Following his exploration days he transformed the mathematical notations from his dozens of journal notebooks into the first accurate maps of the northwest quadrant of North America. Some of his mapwork was even used by the Lewis and Clark expedition.

In many prophecy books the author will say \\"Well, it could be a pre-tribulation rapture or it could be a mid-tribulation rapture...or....\\" The author will tell you what he believes and backs it up with scripture. Then at the end of each section he has a Scenario. Basically a storyline that helps you understand what he's talking about. ---After you read Revelation Revealed you won't be able to read the daily newspaper the same way again.

His only social outlet is a solo school, consisting of himself and four other players, which meets every Wednesday night in The King's Head pub.One night it emerges in conversation that everyone in the school hates Christmas, and from there they develop a hare-brained plot to &quot;sabotage Christmas&quot;. Bateman is acutely concious of the misery of the lonely at Christmas time, and he becomes effectively the chief tactician for this campaign. The stated target is Christmas, but Bateman's real targets are his upbringing, his father, his native town, and everything else that he blames for his arriving into middle age in such a sad and miserable state.Bateman is a pathetic figure, and the unrelieved misery of his existence is offset by two wildly eccentric characters, one a cross-dresser and the very picture of outward respectability, the other a lino fetishist.This is in many ways a very sad book, and culminates in a truly moving scene involving Bateman, his father and his godfather, in the front room of his father's house. However, you will do a lot of laughing on your way to this denouement. In particular, the speculations of a police seargent about the possible benefits available through the National Health Service had me in stitches.Michael Curtin assembles a gallery of disturbed characters who twist and turn their way through their difficulties and their mad-cap plot en route to striking their blow for The League Against Christmas. The one quibble I had with the book was Bateman's tiresome soliloquays, but otherwise this is a well-plotted, very funny and engaging book that is well worth reading."},{"Title":"McCurdy and the Silver Dart P","review":"Douglas McCurdy, born in Canada (Nova Scotia) was an aviation pioneer; he was Canada's Orville Wright. Besides being a skill aviator, his life was sprinkled with luck. As a child he had the good fortune to be semi-adopted by the great inventor Alexander Graham Bell. Though the paperwork for adoption never was completed (due to some family members protest), the relationship between Alexander Graham Bell and Douglas McCurdy grew throughout his life and created the foundation for McCurdy's future in aviation. McCurdy was the first to fly in Canada, the first to fly out of sight of land, and the first person to fly from the United States to Havana, Cuba (1911).This book pedantically lays out McCurdy's rise and recognition as one of the world's aviation pioneers. The writing style is less than engaging, and except for those most enthusiastic about flying, most primary school children may lose interest. Sadly, the book lacks diagrams. When Les Harding attempts to describe how McCurdy and his team developed the \`aileron' for their airplane, (this was McCurdy's most important contribution to aviation) there is no diagram. The verbiage he uses to describe the \\"little wings\\" is inadequate for a child to understand. The dozen or so black and white photos at the beginning of the book were wonderful but they stop midway through the book and needed to go on to help children understand the world at the turn of the 20th century and McCurdy's place in it.Overall, if your child is an aviation buff then this would be \\"a good book\\" to explain the little known Canadian aviation history. This book, along with the Robert Redford video \\"The Great Waldo Pepper,\\" would be a perfect evening with the kids. Recommended. 3 stars"},{"Title":"Under False Colours Hb","review":"Drinkwater plays a different role for the Royal Navy, acting on a special mission which involves unusual hazards, with great risks and little chance for personal gain. This mission takes him to Helgoland and the Elbe River during the winter of 1809-1810. This book covers an interesting facet of the war with Napolean's France. The book is well researched and well written.

Next spring we will do the first three and the rest will follow in chronological order.Sheridan House ===="},{"Title":"Under False Colours Hb","review":"Richard Woodman's Nathaniel Drinkwater series has always had a dark Gothic air about it. The darkest entry was undoubtedly Under False Colours' predecessor A Private Revenge. Series readers will be happy to know that this entry is nowhere near as dark and tragic as A Private Revenge. It is perhaps more similar and related to the earlier Baltic Mission. It's like Baltic Mission in that it is more cloak and dagger than sea story.However, Under False Colours is not a rewrite of Baltic Mission in a different location. Much has happened to Nathaniel Drinkwater since Baltic Mission and Under False Colours is the conclusion of events that were initiated in Baltic Mission and which propelled the action through In Distant Waters and A Private Revenge. A Private Revenge left Drinkwater a deeply psychologically scarred man. In Under False Colours Drinkwater begins to heal the deep wounds left from the horrors of the earlier novel.This entry begins with an attempt to deceive the French by getting them to believe that Britain is supplying military aid to the Czar in defiance of Napoleon's Continental System and his treaty with the Czar. Things go awry and Drinkwater leads a trading mission into Hamburg and as is typical of this series, twists and turns fall more twists and turns. The climax occurs at sea following a tense build up and chase.Under False Colours does not have the same level of blood letting that some of the earlier entries in the series had and all Bolitho novels have. Instead it gradually builds up tension while exploring the conditions in Napoleonic Europe. What I found particularly interesting was the role of Jewish merchants in Hamburg and London. The Jews of Drinkwater's Europe have an underground communication system that acts as a conduit to and from the continent. Woodman nicely underplays Drinkwater's surprise at being treated so well by Jewish merchants. The kindness of the Jews would have come as a very pleasant surprise to a Christian of Drinkwater's era, not because we wouldn't expect them to be kind but because the Christians of that era wouldn't. One can see barriers beginning to fall, as paradigms are broken.Under False Colours is an entertaining novel with some nice surprises in contrast to the nasty ones of A Private Revenge. It's a worthy entry in the series but not one of the best. I suspect that it is a bit of a respite from desperate action to follow in the last three years of the war as Woodman brings it home for the reader."},{"Title":"Under False Colours Hb","review":"I bought all fourteen of these Nathaniel Drinkwater books sight unseen, purely because they were compared to O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series. If you think that's crazy, understand that I bought all twenty of the O'Brian books in the same manner, because they were compared favorably to the Hornblower novels. I was certainly never disappointed in the O'Brian books; so I thought this to be an acceptable gamble.This series cannot live up to the richness of language in the O'Brian books; but I have to say I have not been disappointed in them at all. The characterizations are sharp and dependable, but not rigid. Humans are infinitely capable of surprising us. Drinkwater himself is thoroughly drawn and believable. The action is realistic, and historically-based.I have read them in order, and without intervening books. I tend to do that with series', if I can. I have never been bored by them, and it is always a pleasant feeling to know that you have one of these books sitting on the bedside table with a bookmark in it.This particular novel takes Drinkwater to the fledgling United States, before the breakout of the War of 1812. It's not the very best of the series; but it has great things to offer! I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"Under False Colours Hb","review":"Richard Woodman has spent most of his life at sea, is an eminent Naval historian and the author of several books on Naval history, plus many fictional books. This background and a superb command of the English language make his books a joy to read. His intimate knowledge of square-riggers takes you inside the ship - you are THERE with the crew, battling the elements or the enemy, feeling each blow.This book expands on the theme of the struggle against Napoleon - Nathaniel Drinkwater, now Captain, is increasingly involved in espionage and subversion as the Secret Service draws on his special talents to undermine Napoleon's empire-building.Following orders from Lord Dungarth, head of the Secret Service, Capt. Nathaniel Drinkwater adopts the disguise of a dissipated merchant mariner (almost too successfully) to sow the seeds of a threat to Napoleon's Russian alliance. It all turns sour and plans are wrought afresh, landing Nat in French custody and meeting an old female adversary. Not much in the way of action, but the tension and intrigue more than make up for that.As usual, excellent descriptions and tension-building make the pages fly by - and the author's notes fill in the facts behind the tale. A series to read, savour and re-read.*****"},{"Title":"Under False Colours Hb","review":"Chapter 13 starts on page 154, and next page is 167 -- 13 pagesare missing.

Mine is copyright 2001, it was purchased at Borders for $9.99. First off, I wanted a companion to share Moby Dick with as I read it. Not having that, I reached out to Cliff's Notes. I am glad that I purchased it, and would do so again. However, it was disappointing in the level of scholarship. I won't do a detailed rebuttal of the whole product here, but will focus on the glossary sections and the text analysis.The glossary sections are the weakest part of this book. They include words that are typically understood before one goes to college. Granted, vocabulary acquisition in the US is extremely variable. It can be variable among siblings in the same home. The glossary level seems to span elementary school level to perhaps high school.The text analysis is about at a junior high or high school level for the most part. That said, this level would still be challenging for many students at local area community colleges. Again, there is such a variation in learning in this country.For those reasons, I think this version of Cliff's Notes on Melville's Moby Dick, while a good addition to the home library, it is not a great addition. It can help younger or less experienced readers understand Moby Dick to a far better degree than most people in the United States. Considering the place that Moby Dick holds in American literature, anything that helps more people understand it, the better."},{"Title":"Moby-Dick (Cliffs Notes)","review":"A little disappointed with the 2000 version.

After reading \\"Presumed Innocent,\\" which I consider one of the genre-breaking books in crime fiction during the past 20 years, I turned to this. The beginning starts off brilliantly as the first chapter is the perfect mix of pathos and plot setting. Everything, however, goes down hill from there. A self-pitying (sexist) protagonist, aimless flashbacks, odd occurrences (and re-occurrences) by weak characters, and a plot that is convoluted (and seriously dated by today's financial standards), the book grows increasingly painful until the final page.

Who would have guessed that an unrepentant, reprehensible cad would suddenly suffer the pangs of conscience? Besides I was rooting for Sonny and Sandy!"},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"When I first started this book, I didn't know if I would keep reading it. I am compulsive - when I start a book, it is extremely rare for me not to finish it even if I don't like it. I thought about putting this one down, but decided I need to give it more of a chance. I was very glad that I did. Once I got into the subplots, I found it hard to put down. The subplots went a little too far in my opinion, but it made for a very interesting story."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"Although the book wasn't as enjoyable as some, it wasn't bad. The main character, Sandy Stern, is likable enough and still naive in many ways of the world. While trying to hunt down the reason behinds his wife's suicide, his brother-in-law comes to him for help in straightening out some financial trouble that he has gotten himself into. However, unless you are into finance, the market, and other areas such as these, most of the book will be dry and hard to get through. It was for me. The thing that kept me going was Sandy's continuing search to find out what was going on with his wife. As I said, the book didn't exactly have me glued to it, but it wasn't bad, either."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"In most of his novels, Scott Turow enjoys mixing several plotlines, the past and the present, and the internal worlds of several characters, and almost always makes it enjoyable or at least intriguing for his readers. Unfortunately, in this book he ends up tripping over his own complications, to the extent that the story becomes boring and hard to follow. In an overzealous attempt to create more plot twists as the story develops, Turow throws out new discoveries about his characters that after a while become too contradictory to be plausible.Possibly the book's greatest failure is its insufficient development of its central character, Alejandro \\"Sandy\\" Stern. His cultural background (born and raised in Argentina, with parents who fled Eastern Europe ahead of the Holocaust) and experience as an immigrant who enters the local elite through the law is barely glossed over (a frequent failing of American authors: insufficient research of or insight into the non-American experience), while his sexual adventures and romantic self-exploration after his wife's death can be interesting but receive more than their fair share of pages. In addition, the widower who realizes after his wife's death that he barely really knew her is a clich&eacute;; Stern's relationship with his wife is also insufficiently explored.Turow has developed several high-quality novels with some of the characters who are also present in this book, but here his effort to create a further story about his characters comes across as more of a forced effort than an engaging story and eventually falls under the weight of its world-weary cynicism. He definitely can provide better reading material and has done so many times."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"There is no need to describe this book's plot in any way, shape or form--the book is just that _GREAT_! Any Scott Turow fan will fall instantly in love and read through every page like a maniac. I couldn't put this book down, and finished the massive 515 pages in 2 days. Just simply amazing.- Delaney"},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"I thought the author slipped a bit with this book, not as good as some of his others. He constructed a good book with a step-by-step progress to the end and he can weave in a sub plot of two. I just did not like some of the writing; I found it a bit forced or dry. Overall he always delivers a good story, I would read his work over many others. You do need to pay attention with his books, they are an easy ride - he wants to keep you involved to then need. He is good at this form of book and if you like him you will like this one."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"This was a great fun ride. I began reading with some trepidation that the ending would somehow mess up the journey -- but Turow did a great job tying together a fairly involved plot into satisfying finale."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"This book is not necessarily a great courtroom drama, but more of a character study with some mystery thrown in.Much better than Grisham."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"He is probably the best, not for writing a suspenseful book, but because he has an amazing gift for words and it is very difficult to predict in which way his books will go. Grisham may provide a faster read, but you do not get as much out of it. However, Burden of Proof is not as good as Presumed Innocent because it takes a while to build momentum and the details of Dixon's business become a little stifling."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"The plot of Burden of Proof twists in a way that keeps you reading on. The story about a lawyer and the death of his wife is down to earth and the main character is refreshingly straightfoward about life in general. There doesn't seem anything fictional about it. A must read."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"Turrow is a master of plot twists in this drama, but his characters are less than endearing. The descriptions and interplay among lawyers and clients are exceptional, and they support the center plot throughout. In the family interactions, which are frequent and central to the story, Turrow struggles. One wants to get to the fierce competitiveness and fine secrecy of the law story, but finds himself plowing through the uneasy muck of insecure relationships and misplaced affections. It still makes for a good read, but at times you will find no trouble putting the book down and going to bed."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"Turow knows how to through it out there. I really enjoy legal thrillers. This one had me. I usually can figure things out, but this one caught me off guard. Well done."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"I purchased this book because I enjoyed Presumed Innocent and Innocent by Turow. The Burden of Proof has different characters but the premise is somewhat the same: dead wife, family secrets, and legal thrills. No one does this kind of novel so well!! This author will not appeal to everyone, in spite of the popularity of Presumed Innocent. If you are expecting JUST legal thrills, look elsewhere. If you like excellent writing and complex characters you will love these books. He's a master of character motive and plot twists.... Not an easy read, no action but I could not put this book down."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"Scott Turow's THE BURDEN OF PROOF receives a fine narration by stage and screen actor John Bedford Lloyd, and tells of a defense attorney facing an emotionally shattering event as a family is caught in crimes and secrets. This gripping story is a top pick for any library where legal investigative action thrillers are a hit."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"I read this book in 4 days when it usually takes me 3-4 weeks to finish a book. It made me a big fan of his, eventhough I have never considered myself a mystery reader. I really enjoyed this book and would say it was in my top 3 favorites, along with Jaws and Les Miserables. I also dislike legal bologna. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"Burden of proof is almost like a sequel to the Turows previous novel \\"Presumed Innocent\\" with different angle of Plot, which is telling a great story about puzzling moment of Sandy Stern personal life as a father and a legendary advocate.In this novel, Mr. Turow had again; succeed creating a strong plot to the novel, which made it look so realistic, understandable and rich of moral message.Unbelievable Story, He did it again!...Must read novel to any Lawyer who like to know, how does it feels if we dealing with conflict of interest on our professional obligation as an \\"officium nobile\\" (respected profession)"},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"Scott Turow is an outstanding writer; no doubt about it. His character development is on a level way higher than Grisham. I like both writers but if you want something that goes deeper; go with Turow. Grisham has good plots but his characters are often weak. Turow has good plots and interesting characters. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was becuase I feel Turow goes a bit overboard with the verbiage and the reader gets the feeling he wants to show that he is the master of the dictionary."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"Stifling details are intertwined in this thriller that could use less flowery description and more thrills. The story itself is not bad, but the ending did not make this a satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"Clearly, Turow is a skilled writer, no question. But I would submit this bit of unsolicited commentary: Sometimes wanting is that elusive quality which rivets the reader's eyes to the book, well past The Late Show : Burden of Proof is a sort of plodding read, page by page (though it does - ever so gradually - gain momentum).One wonders how a young author can seemingly incorporate the perception of age, wisdom and experience in his characters to the degree that Turow has. As brilliant as his multi-tiered allegories are, I miss the slight but frequent spreckles of humor that I've seen in some other good novels. This, by no means the principal requisite to greatness, is nonetheless a trait I've really come to admire in some of the other authors. Burden pays off at the end, and rewards the reader with increasing tension along the way."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"This was the first Turow book I read and I found it interesting. I admit that I had to read the book for school. However, I found the story line made me want to read more. If you like Grisham books than you will probably like this book. The two seem to have similiar styles. However, with this book, you really get to understand the main character better. Sandy Stern, the protagonist, was a very interesting and believable character. The various other characters make the book even better. I would definitely recommend reading this book. It is not great, but it is still worth the time."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],W={key:0},D={key:1};function B(n,o,s,c,r,i){const u=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",E,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(u,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",D,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",W,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const C=d(M,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-aafaef38"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/59.md","filePath":"people/59.md"}'),P={name:"people/59.md"},q=Object.assign(P,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(C)]))}});export{R as __pageData,q as default};
