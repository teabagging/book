Many are so well written and observant. I did not read all 212 so maybe I'm going to repeat what someone else has said before me. I apologize if that is the case.I took the novel in small pieces. I stopped and thought about what was being presented to me. I actually researched the names of the individuals named in the novel. I would suggest that anyone who reads the novel do the same. It is historically accurate which adds to the quality of writing.I will not over elaborate on the story told in the book as that has been done already. I can say, however, that the novel will have many different meanings for each who read it.(sorry for that) I find that chapter 35 is really effective in mitigating my anger when I think I am really ticked off. I simply read that chapter and then I realize that there is no good reason to actually be mad about whatever trivial issue that may be on my mind. How dare I even consider a rant when there is chapter 35...[...] everybody but the people and then be damned careful what they turn into when they have power.\\"That is some serious medicine.

To Hemmingway, war is futile. We all lose. Agree or disagree with the morality, the story captures Hemmingway's ability to lay emotions bare with strong minimalist prose and dialogure."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent. One of the best war novels I've ever read. Now I know why Hemingway is known as one of the greatest writers of all time. I absolutely loved \\"The Old Man and Sea\\", but when \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" fell a little short, I had my doubts. This was the one that finally clinched it in my mind that Hemingway deserves all of the accolades he's received over the years. It's a love story that takes place up in the mountains of Spain during the Spanish Civil War which took place in the 1930's. The main character Robert Jordan, is a young American dynamiter in the International Brigade. Back in the State's Jordan used to be a college professor. Jordan's grandfather used to be a great war hero, but since his father was labeled a coward, he has set out to try to redeem the family name. It becomes his assignment to travel into the mountains of Spain, hook up with a band of guerillas, and to blow a pivotal bridge during an upcoming campaign. Not being as familiar with the Spanish Civil War as I would like have been before reading this novel it was a little hard at first to try to figure out who was fighting and what side Jordan was on. I then found out there are the Fascists vs. the Republic and Jordan is on the side of the Republic. At first I thought that members of the Republic were Communists with the ideals they were preaching and since the Russians were advising them, but then when they said some disparaging things about Communists that made me think otherwise. The guerilla band he joins up with is led by a man named Pablo who at one time used to be great leader, but recently has lost his nerve. He no longer is as interested in the cause as he once was, and now would rather tend to his horses instead. He once led this band on a successful assault on a train and everybody in the band still seems to consider this their crowning achievement. Pablo is still very smart, but nobody now knows if he can continue to be trusted to lead them. His female companion Pillar is really the one who has held the band together for the last few months of the war, but she lacks Pablo's cunning. She says she has a little bit of gypsy in her and at times she tells people's fortunes, not all of them however are good. She is very feisty and was probably something in her day when she used to date several matadors. The rest of the band is made up of an old man named Anselmo who Jordan loves very much and is one of the few people he really can rely on. Then there is a few younger men, a pair of competent brothers, plus a strong and loyal man named Agustin, as well as a gypsy who for the most part everybody considers useless. Finally there is the young girl named Maria. She was rescued from the fascists during the raid on the train. She is the daughter of a former Mayor. Her hair had all been cut off and she isn't as beautiful as she once was, but Jordan immediately falls in love with her the first time he lays eyes on her. In war a few days can sometimes seem like a life time and the pair make the most of what time they have together. Pillar had taken Maria under her wing and had been teaching her how to one day be a good wife. She approves of Jordan and Maria's union and after the fighting is over she wants him to take Maria away from this place. As the battle nears there are several scrimmages and some great fights. El Sordo's last stand is very memorable. Hemingway's descriptions are magnificent. At times Hemingway switches back and forth between Spanish and English but it never seems to be a distraction as he always provides a translation. There are things wrong with the Republic that eventually will lead to their downfall, but at this point in the war Hemingway shows them as just little inconsistencies. For instance, the Republic doesn't seem to believe in religion, so it is ironic that all of the band still say their little prayers every time they are in the middle of a battle. The people also want to rule themselves rather than be ruled by the government, but they have no trust in one another. If you are not from the same town as these people you will always be considered an outsider and an enemy. There are too many fractions in the Republic. They have some good ideals, but they are unable to really bring any of them to life. Jordan figures even if they win they would probably need to get rid of most of the leaders since the majority of the ones remaining are all incompetent or murderers. Both the Fascist and the Republic come off as being very brutal at times. I wonder what Hemingway's political views really were. I believe he probably had some of the same ideals that Jordan displays. This book will make my list of the top 100 books of all time."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I had to write this review because of the review someone else wrote...This person said it was about Hemingway's support for anti-communists and young americans going over to Spain during the civil war to fight the communists...He must not have read the book. The main character of the book went to fight against the FASCISTS, not the communists. He hated fascism and wanted to stop the fascist regime from taking Spain. Fighting on his side were many communists, or Spanish backed by communist nations, such as the spanish generals trained by the communist Russian nation, so how on earth this reviewer could think it was against communism if he read the book is beyond me. Also, this book is about much more, it explores moral issues and covers themes from love to the truth of war. Hemingway really makes you see the tragedy and pointlessness of war."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway is one of the best known authors worldwide and with good reason.

I can only add my voice to those praising the wonderful cadence of Hemingway's dialogue and the haunting, descriptive narrative as he works through how the politics of war have changed all his characters, reducing them to little more than animals living in caves, sometimes predators and sometimes prey. Hemingway was sympathetic in real life to the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War (against the Fascists), but he does not completely spare them in his portrayal of the levels of brutality men stoop to in a war pitting citizens of a single country against each other. Hemingway also spares little sympathy on the ignorance and stupidity of some in command of the Republican Army, nor the callousness of those on the elite periphery, as preparations are made for the novel's pivotal moment.The narrative in the audio version is by Campbell Scott. He is a very soft spoken performer who took some getting used to. I imagined this novel would be read in a more forceful way, more like I imagined Hemingway himself might have read it, but Mr. Scott's voice is very measured and while heroic, virile male characters like the republican guerrilla fighters, characters like Pablo and El Sordo, may have been slightly underplayed, his careful narration allowed him to give depth to female characters, especially Pilar.I have listened to many audiobooks and one of the most annoying things can be male narrators trying to do female characters and completely blowing it. A failure on this level can take you right out of the story and completely ruin the experience of listening to the book. Mr. Scott avoids this and is able to voice the female characters without it sounding like a parody. This is incredibly important with this book because the female characters are prominent and very strong. Another problem some narrators encounter is accents; again, a failure here ruins the book. Mr. Scott never overplays any of the characters, giving each one of them credible distinctions without ever descending in stereotype.When I had finished listening to the book I realized that Mr. Scott, by achieving this balance with supporting characters, had given nearly perfect voice to the measured, methodical and logical voice of American Robert Jordon, the main character. Since much of the book is introspective reflection and dialogue by Jordon, Mr. Scott's narrative style was, for me, the perfect fit.All in all, I highly recommend both this book and this audio version. If you are not a reader or don't see yourself ever being able to attack this long book, try the audio version. You will be carried away to the treacherous gray, stony mountains north of Madrid by an author who knew not only how to live but also how to die."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Well, I'm embarrased to say that it took me until late in life to finally get around to reading this gem. And oh, what a gem it is. Robert Jordan is one of those characters that just stays with you. I found myself a bit envious of his adventure, at least for a while (don't want to give anything away). For me, having never fought in a war, the sense of romanticism, mingled with the clear tragedy, seemed a realistic picture of what it must be like.Ultimately, I admire the sense of duty and honor so many of these characters display, and I wonder how many people share that kind of personal commitment today. I like to think it's still a high number (certainly we see it our military men and women), but I can't help but wonder.......This book is a 5-star read all the way around. Read it. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Beautifully written, human drama during wartime. The horrors and the beauty of humanity under impossible conditions.An excellent read. Hemingway at his best."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"My body and most of my brain is in Calgary, but there is a part of me at the foot of a limestone cave in the mountains of Spain watching a man named Robert(o) negotiate aide in a war I'd never learned about.Vaguely, I was aware that in the last century Spain had a civil war. I was not aware it was Republicans vs. Fascists. I can't say I knew it was wedged right between the two world wars. I had, from time to time, wondered why Spain was left out of the second but having never asked - I forgot about it.In Hemmingway and Steinbeck both, I'm beginning to understand the very weight of the Communist issue in 1930s America. Accusing someone of being a communist was a very serious charge. Even in Spain (Robert is an American on the Republic side of the war) a man is called a communist and reacts as though it was his life he is protecting in denying the slander.I think that period writers such as these are really instrumental in keeping history alive. The books are much easier to read than Non-Fiction (for me at least) and there aren't enough people around from that time to talk about it anymore.The flip side to appreciating what a fictional author can bring is that, as in this, only a few players are introduced. Hemmingway's Roberto was a fantastic character who held dread on equal weight as hope. In the three days the book spanned I felt as if I was living along side Roberto. I watched him plot his offensive; understood as he explained it to his comrades; rationalized the perils of the pending attack. Mostly though, I fell in love with him as Maria did and fell in love with her equally.As exciting as all that is, the repercussions of war were heavily felt as I edged on the last pages of the book. It is heavy material and it wasn't as quick to get through as I have found other books that I have loved.The 470 could have easily been 900 pages and I would have read it still, devouring every word. Give yourself the time to read it, as you may have to put it down a few times in the process."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom the Bell Tolls, by Ernest Hemingway, tells the story of Robert Jordan's mission to blow up a bridge during the Spanish Civil War and takes places over the four days prior to the blowing of the bridge. This fictional war novel which takes place in the pine covered hills of Spain, discusses the themes of the futility and barbarity of war, death, and friendship.Robert Jordan is an American fighting in the International Brigades against the fascists in Spain. The orders he is given are brief: \\"To blow the bridge at a stated hour based on the time set for the attack\\"(13) \\"so that no reinforcements will come up over the road\\"(14). With these orders, he slips across the battle lines and meets up with a band of gorilla fighters led by Pablo, an experienced gorilla warrior. This small band of fighters is to assist him in taking control of the bridge so he can blow it up as ordered. Over the next three days he lives with Pablo's band and learns about true friendship. He also learns about true love when he falls in love with a girl named Maria. Robert Jordan reflects \\"I wish that I were going to live a long time instead of going to die today because I have learned much about life in these four days; more, I think, than in all the other time.\\"(402). Jordan, feeling that his time is limited, lives life to its fullest in the four days and firmly believes that he has been lucky. \\"And you had a lot of luck, he told himself, to have had such a good life. You've had as good a life as any one because of these last days.\\"(491). Ultimately, the end of the novel leaves an optimistic and pessimistic feeling with the reader; Hemingway leaves it to the reader to decide how they feel at the novel's conclusion.Hemingway brings forth several themes in this novel. The foremost is the futility and barbarity of war. Nowhere in the novel is this stressed so well as Pilar's account of Pablo killing the fascists in the town of Avila. Pilar says of it: \\"all of it [is] ugly. Even that which is glorious...it is brutal\\"(112). The fascists who were in the town were \\"beaten to death with flails and thrown from the top of the cliff into the river\\"(116). This story is the most brutal example of war in the book and successfully shows that \\"war is a bitchery\\"(489). Another important theme is death. Death is discussed before El Sordo, the leader of another band, dies in a standoff with the fascist calvary. \\"One's death is difficult to accept. Sordo had accepted it but there was no sweetness in its acceptance even at fifty-two, with three wounds and him surrounded on a hill.\\" He goes on to think, \\"Dying was nothing and he had no picture of it nor fear of it in his mind. But living was a field of grain blowing in the wind on the side of a hill\\"(330). The novel reinforces the fact that death must occur, but shows that life is far more pleasing. Lastly, the novel discusses friendship. Jordan finds true friendship among those he has known for four days, but must fight alongside. Jordan notes, \\"Anselmo is my oldest friend. Agustin, with his vile mouth, is my brother, and I never had a brother. Maria is my true love and my wife.\\"(402). Ultimately, it is shown that those which life and death occur with, understand each other the best and become the closest together.Hemingway constructs an extremely believable story with the novel. In part he does this with the style he uses. Hemingway uses a formal diction for the narration and a informal diction for the dialog. The informal diction fits the characters well since one would expect them to speak in that manner. Hemingway also uses Spanish words intermingled with English to remind the reader that they are in Spain. This technique is done effectively, although one must guess at some meanings if one does not know Spanish. Hemingway also effectively paces the book. Robert Jordan spends only four days with Pablo's band, however, the pacing is slow enough to include a lot of imagery of the setting and enough detail about the characters and the war to develop the themes. Hemingway is able to stretch the time out, especially before the battles, just as a person living through them would experience it. As a result, the reader gets a slight indication of what life in war is like. With this in mind, if Hemingway's goal was to write a beautifully narrated, well paced and believable war novel which causes a reader to think about the themes it brings up, then I believe he achieved his goal.Ernest Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls is not simply about blowing up a bridge during a war. It is about who we are as people and what it means to live and to die. I believe Hemingway sought to leave the reader with an enjoyable story and an education, just as Robert Jordan received when he lived his life in four days. The title comes of the book is an allusion to \\"Meditation XVII.\\" \\"Any man's death diminishes me because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.\\" Hemingway sought to leave the reader with an appreciation for mankind. For when one dies, everyone dies; and when pain and suffering is brought on one it is brought on all. Without a doubt Hemingway effectively and pleasurably presents these ideas while narrating a tragic but wonderful story. I would highly recommend this book, as it is a true classic."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"As a 15-year-old high school student, being reccomended to read one of the longest books for summer reading wasn't all too appealing to me. Now that I have read the book, I'm glad that I chose to read For Whom the Bell Tolls. It is a great book if you want to get the perspective of a foreigner in another country fighting a war. Being very interested in history myself, learning about the Spanish Civil War was quite intriguing. Hemingway was very good in expressing his feelings about the war in the country which he once lived. Although the middle of the book can, at times, be quite a drag, the rest of the book was very enjoyable. The war/action scenes in the story were very well written by Hemingway. After reading this book, I look forward to reading more Hemingway novels in the future. If you want to read a war story, I fully reccomend reading For Whom the Bell Tolls."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is a unique novel in the Hemingway collection, it has a plot. This is the longest of his novels though the easiest to describe. The Hemingway style is not as lean as in earlier works, one might even say it is pleasantly plump in comparison (as Papa himself was at the time of writing). I'll never forget my first reading of this book. One of those books you put down and just hold your breath with the memory of it all. This might best be described as Hemingway fare for non Hemingway fans. Though Hemingway fans like it too, but it will always be number three to them. The Sun Also Rises is perhaps one of the more difficult books to summarize and Hemingway's style is so new in it that the book created a buzz that has still not died down. What was not said in that first book left some feeling a bit famished. Others were intrigued by this new kind of writing that held its cards so close to its chest. In this book you get a more conventional novel of a novel though the events described in it are very powerfully told. (It is fun to see pictures of Hemingway as a reporter at this time. A world famous novelist in the field.) This book along with A Farewell to Arms prove no American knew better how to convey by written words that nasty busines of war better than Hemingway. Robert Jordan is one of the least talked about Hemingway characters ever. Perhaps because he is a character invented to serve a plot. You will love this book of fighting and love in the Spanish mountains. John Donne himself I think would have proudly read and enjoyed this."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway is a stickler for details, and it really shows in this book.

He is led to a cave by Anselmo an old man, early sixties, where there is a camp. Pablo is the drunken leader and Pilar is his wife. Robert Jordan is very inner sociable, he talks to himself a lot, only when he is alone usually, it clears his mind.This book was truly amazing from the first word to the very last word. Truly amazing, Hemingway is one of the best authors there ever was. It would seem that he was actually there to get the details he put into this book, and you can actually see where he is and what he is talking about, and that is what the best authors do.Reading reviews on Amazon could not make this book any better or worse, so just buy this book and read it, I gurantee is will be hard to put down.Mark_Sigel"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemmingway is a literary master and displays it in this book.

When I later picked up For Whom the Bell Tolls, the scenery, imagery, characters, situation, sense of place was so vividly drawn, painted, portrayed, that I could describe it decades later.... It is as if I have been there. The setting is Spain, during the Spanish Civil War. You have many very fine reviews here that can tell you about the story itself.

In at least one Hemingway short story, the female lover cuts her hair like a boy to please her man; in THE GARDEN OF EDEN both women cut their hair like boys to please the man; in A FAREWELL TO ARMS, Catherine Barkely cuts her hair like a boy to please Frederick Henry. What's the deal??? One could make some rather interesting conclusions about Hemingway himself while pondering this recurring detail in his work!!!) Anway, about TOLLS, F.

Unfortunately, that gimmick runs out about half-way through.If you consult a synopsis of this book like I did, you'll realize that the first 200 pages consume more than 3/4ths of the plot description! That leaves nearly *300 pages* wherein *less than a quarter* of the substantive events occur.

He has written many other spectacularly historic books like The Sun Also Rises, Farewell to Arms, and numerous other accounts of his real adventures covering other major historic events in American history. Hemingway's characteristic laconic, terse and fluid prose and dialogue shine radiantly throughout this book giving off his unique style of writing. There are layers and layers of emotion, passion, and personal pain. You are transported to the mountains of Spain with Jordan and a band of Spanish guerilla fighters. His description of the characters is so incredibly real, that the reader feels as though you could find their names in a history book.For Whom the Bell Tolls begins and ends in a pine-scented forest, somewhere in Spain all in sixty-eight hour period, in which he meets up with the guerilla group, falls in love with a Spanish girl named Maria, and blows up a key bridge behind enemy lines. The year is 1937 and the Spanish Civil War is in full swing. Robert Jordan, a demolition expert attached to the International Brigades lies \\"flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees.\\" (1) The sylvan setting, however, is at sharp odds with the reason Jordan is there: he has come to blow up a bridge on behalf of the antifascist guerrilla forces. He hopes he'll be able to rely on their local leader, Pablo, to help carry out the mission, but upon meeting him, Jordan has his doubts: \\"I don't like that sadness, he thought. That sadness is bad. That's the sadness they get before they quit or before they betray. That is the sadness that comes before the sell-out.\\" (85) For Pablo, it seems, has had enough of the war. He has amassed for himself a small herd of horses and wants only to stay quietly in the hills and attract as little attention as possible. Jordan's arrival--and his mission--have seriously alarmed him. Hemingway touches on, among other things, love, loyalty, sacrifice for the greater good, rape, suicide, altruism, and social injustice.For Whom the Bell Tolls is an excellent book, which breaks down the tragedies of war and the emotional struggles that come along with it. Hemingway is definitely the best author of his era, with a different approach to a story idea. The reading makes it hard to go through the book, but the story line keeps the reader connected with the book. I enjoyed Hemingway's unique style and hope to read more of his books with pleasure."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This book is an excellent book. But, if you really want to understand it, spend part of your life living in Spain like Hemingway. Then, you can finally appreciate how he writes in &quot;Spanish&quot; and translates literally to English, especially the cursing. You will love the country much more than reading books or visiting Madrid or Barcelona..."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"The Spanish Civil War was surely the most brutal and tragic civil war of the twentieth century. It not only pitted Spaniard against Spaniard, but became a kind of bloody curtain-raiser for World War II, with Nazi Germany and Mussolini's Italy lining up on the side of Franco's insurgents and the USSR backing the embattled left-leaning Republic. (The Western democracies - who might have prevented Spain from going fascist - followed a pusillanimous \\"hands off\\" policy which only emboldened the insurgents and their supporters.) Into this vortex came many writers and intellectuals. They were to witness brutality, betrayals, great valour, the corruption of ideals, and the consequences of ruthless Realpolitik.So with all that in mind, here's an interesting question. If you were an author trying to write the great Spanish Civil War novel, would you choose to (1) sequester your handful of characters up in the mountains away from the main action; (2) write 500 pages covering a mere three days during which time nobody has anything to do; and (3) make the central character non-Spanish?500 pages about three days of waiting is the book's central problem. It turns the novel into the opposite of an epic. To have taken a canvas as sweeping as the three years of the Spanish Civil War and shrink it down to such a compass-point was an unfathomable decision on the author's part. From this self-inflicted literary ambush there is no escape for Hemingway: you either need excellent descriptive prose or superb psychological insight to carve a good story from such crooked timber, for, after all, what else is left to describe in such a situation save inner musings and the outer landscape?The prose is the next problem. Much has been made of Hemingway's 'deceptively simple' writing style. However, I found it impossible to read \\"For Whom the Bells Tolls\\" without forming the impression that that his reputation for putatively well-masked complexity is itself the deception. Consider the following extracts [from the Vintage edition]:A hole in a hillside is described as:\\"both deep and profound\\"[p. 444]Characters exchange such dialogue as:'Well, then. Oh, then. Oh, then. Oh.'[p. 166]'Maria.''Yes.''Maria.''Yes.''Maria.''Oh, yes. Please.'[p. 272]'But use thy head. Thou hast much head. Use it.'[p. 444]Which brings us to the Hemingway penchant for meaningless repetition:\\"In an impossible situation you hang on until night to get away. You try to last out until night to get back in. You are all right, maybe, if you can stick it out until dark and then get back in.\\"[p. 174]\\"So a woman like that Pilar practically pushed this girl into your sleeping bag and what happens? Yes, what happens? What happens? You tell me what happens, please. That is just what happens. That is exactly what happens.\\"[p. 175]Followed by some impressive run-on rants as the author becomes completely carried away describing love scenes (How many women - even in the thirties - were seduced by being repeatedly called 'rabbit'?)My favourite passage is when one of the characters reveals to Joaqu&iacute;n that la Pasionara has a son in Russia. Instead of naming the character, Hemingway chooses to write the following clanking line:\\"'If we insult them a little?' the man who had spoken to Joaqu&iacute;n about la Pasionara's son in Russia asked.\\"[p. 324]On and on it goes like this. For three days. In a cave. This book has now gone into the umpteenth printing and neither the spelling nor grammar have been corrected (\\"... the flakes was dropping diagonally ...\\" [p. 185]; \\"... and then brining it down ...\\" [p. 213]; \\"... the felling when the Ingl&eacute;s gave the order ...\\" [p. 380]; at one point Andr&eacute; Marty is referred to as \\"Mary\\" [p. 437]).So it needs to be said openly. Hemingway pundits who make excuses for this sort of thing have a lot of explaining to do: otherwise they are obliged to defend similarly poor writing when they find it outside the world of Nobel laureates."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"In case you stumble upon this review amidst all of the other droning articles, I'll try to keep mine short.This was my first Hemingway, I finished it just recently, and man is he overrated. There are moments of greatness within the pages, and as for the simple act of creating a story, placing characters and orchestrating a chain of events, the guy wasn't bad.Unfortunately his pretentious writing style bleeds through on nearly every single page, so absurdly that it disrupts from the actual story. I loved the characters, I was intrigued by the plot, but halfway through I realized that I was FORCING myself to continue reading because the poor old bastard kept getting so far gone on his cheesy tangents of love, and of the minor backstories of characters found only within the backstories of supporting characters (Pilar's matador's tale that consumed four or five pages) that the story suffered greatly.Hemingway fancied himself a wordsmith I suppose, and therefore managed to crowbar the word \\"now\\" about fifty times into a single paragraph, often repeating the word up to four times in a row, and the truly funny part is that people regard him as a genius for it.So after experiencing Hemingway I can honestly say that I won't be going back, and I can only envy his success."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Over the years I have read a lot about Hemmingway and how important of a writer he was, so I figured it was finally time for me to read one of his books. To be honest, I chose this one because I was familiar with the Metallica song that was named after this book.I found this to be one of the most difficult books I have ever read; not because of the style or because I didn't like it but because simply it was just a difficult story to read. The novel is full of strong themes about death and honor. Robert Jordan, the main character, is a man who does not get caught up in any causes or seems to hold any passionate views. Through the whole book he questions his beliefs in the socialist cause; his only concern seems to be defeating the fascists. All of this changes when he meets Maria. The two fall for each other immediately and suddenly Jordan is confronted with the real prospect of the fact that he will not survive his mission.What made this story so difficult to read was that Hemmingway comes across as a nihilist in the writing of this story. His characters are completely controlled by fate and feel powerless to stop the events that are put into place. It seems as if Jordan would have been better off had he not met Maria and cared about her.Overall, the story is very good. I would highly recommend it anyone."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"In FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS Hemingway again reveals how war affects the lives of the average citizen. The ones who are called on to fight and die in the war. The people who have no power in declaring the war and above all who don't want the war at all. The ones who are for the most part forgotten when it is over. A lot has been made over his unconventional and individual style but it is really Hemingway's experience that make his books important. He gives us a window into a time and place none will ever again visit and it is in this that we can begin to appreciate what war actually did to a country and it's people and why freedom is a precious commodity. Incidently, to quibble over why a character in a book of this stature would cut her hair is not only to miss the point of the work, but to not even try to find it. If you think you can do it better than Hemingway then write a couple of novels and we'll see if they become standards of American literature."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I just can't get with Hemingway, and I have trudged through five or six of his allegedly best works.

The characters are as unsympathetic as they come, with the 2-D Maria who has probably never entertained a thought in her head, she is so stupid and empty, except to please Robert Jordan, who spends hundreds and hundreds of pages just thinking random thoughts, and walking from place to place. I thought that Anna Karenina was long and drawn out, but even at 800 + pages that book was less drawn out than this wprthless piece. It was completely unnecessary for it to be so long--one of Hemingway's short stories, about an old man on a bridge during the spanish civil war, at less than 3 pages is ten times more movign and poignant than this book. And it doesn't even really paint the Spanish civil war all that well--if you really want a glimpse of what it was like, go rent and watch the classic movie \\"La lengua de los mariposas\\" or \\"Butterfly\\" in English, which will give you a better idea and much mroe enjoyment at the same time. This book also isn't really that action-packed at all for a war book--I'd say fighting and battle takes up maybe two-fifths fo the book at the most, it's mostly just talking, long stories, long ten page thought streams of RJ, or just walking from place to place, describing things with some of the longest run-on sentences I've ever seen (anyone who tells you that Hemingway's style was just short and simple sentences is full of it in regard to this book).In short, this book is not worth your time--read one of Hemingway's short stories if you must, but not this long, drawn out, boring yarn."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Well, I read a short-novel by Hemingway in junior high and thought it was really well written and interesting. So, as Hemingway is considered a great writer, I thought it was time to read one of his novels.

However, Hemingway's English translations were so irritating, trite, and immature that I could not get past them. The use of \\"thy\\" and \\"thou\\" to indicate the ud. form is ridiculous in 20th century English. Quoting the characters as asking, \\"How do you call yourself?\\" instead of \\"What is your name?\\" is downright silly. If Hemingway really wanted to convey what the characters were saying literally, he should have simply quoted them in Spanish and provided a translation in parentheses or in an index. Regardless, who needs a literal translation? How is \\"How do you call yourself\\" better than \\"What is your name\\"? And is it really important to know who uses ud. to whom when this form doesn't even exist in modern English? I found these \\"translations\\" so distracting from what was going on that I couldn't continue past chapter 2. I get the impression that the hundreds of reviewers who have raved about this book over the past 65 years don't speak Spanish."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Simply put, this book, and Hemmingway in general, is overrated. There is nothing unexpected in the prose nor storyline, just a typical page-turner or \\"best seller\\" -- and that is *not* a compliment!

A lot of bull. This book is a rambling piece of blige. Hemingwasy was a good writer, but not all (and I should say most of) his books are dull as ditch water. This is a perfect example of dull writing. His &quot;personal property&quot; was bull fighting and the Spanish Civil war...give me a break. If this thing tells you anything about the civil war you are too dumb to be counted. Hemingway is ok, but come on, hardly the &quot;Great Writer of the 20th century&quot; that he wants us to believe.

Skip this one."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway is my favorite all-time author and I love his writing style but this book drags on for the entirety. The only excitement I can remember was some dialogue from a character named Pablo who made some threats. How this is considered to be a classic I have no idea. I slowly plodded two thirds into this book and simply gave up. But then again \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" considered another classic, was brutal but also boring and basically a pamphlet.I urge everyone to pick up Hemingway's Complete Short Stories. Those are really his best work and I have read all 500 or 600 pages TWICE. That is how brilliant and fascinating the stories are. They never get old, there are endless lessons about sadness, life, loss in those short stories that ANY GENERATION can relate to. He simply masterfully sums up in less words what it would take most writers much longer to express. As a matter of fact, they would not be able to express them in nearly the same way.Hemingway I am convinced is better served as a short story writer than a novelist. I have tried to read 7 or 8 Hemingway novels and have given them a chance but the only one's that impressed me were the books that were actually collections of his short stories."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"the book is censored ! not original text , should be removed, and replaced with the un-edited original version. why are altered books being sold ?"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I very much enjoyed this book, it is not one of my favorites, but I am very happy I read it.

I had not read any Hemingway books so I figured that I would give one a try. I read quite a few reviews of For Whom The Bell Tolls and I don't remember reading anything negative.I figured that I couldn't go wrong. Well, to begin with don't place much creedence in the reviews that you read. I found this book to be very uneventful and boring. I was tempted to put it down but I have a difficult time abandoning a book once I've picked it up. As I was reading this book I couldn't help but think of it as a poor man's version of Shakesphere. The repeated use of the words \\"thee\\", \\"thou\\", \\"whilst\\" etc. by a gypsy group living in the woods just seemed to me to be a contradiction. I plan to give Hemingway another try but I am not sure of when.

Thanks in advance for any clarity on this."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"There is nothing wrong with Hemingway's skill and technique. What I fell in love with in his writing is all here, except his conciseness. This story could have been 200 pages shorter and all the better for it. But Hemingway was responding to critics that accused him of the very conciseness that made his other works a rhythmic masterpiece of storytelling narrative. Hemingway understood technique better than any writer, and why he let criticism overrule better judgment destroys the pace and rhythmic flow of this story. For a three day period, 470 pages is a lot of cave dwelling, talking, eating and drinking. The stories of Pilar while important also drag the story in pacing. Robert Jordan's train of thought - well let's just say that is a mighty long train. The relationship between Jordan and Maria is a quick and welcome breath of distraction from the mundane cave proceedings.This is still worthy of a read, but you are going to have to spend some time with it and, dare say, slug through some excessive chapters where the rhythm and flow of the story comes to a crawl."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I love to read and very rarely put a book down but I had a hard time staying interested or excited about this book.

Trusted service, fast, cost effective.My husband wanted this book and is quite enjoying it."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom the Bell Tolls is a great book with large themes: war, love, devotion to duty, and the clash between modern, rational values and more traditional ones. At a higher level, it is about connections between people: indeed, the book opens with the following quotation from John Donne:. . . any mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.Hemingway takes us inside a guerilla band during the Spanish Civil War, mostly through the eyes of Robert Jordan, an American professor-cum-demolitions expert. Jordan is a Communist - at least he is strongly drawn to Communism - who has come to Spain to fight fascism. He has character and a sense of duty. Since, from our vantage point, at the beginning of the 21st century, it seems that not many people do, this gives the book a kind of \\"long ago and far away\\" feel. Readers in 1940, when the book was published, no doubt experienced it in a more immediate way.This book includes many memorable secondary characters: among them Pilar, the wise leader of the band of partisans, Pablo, her drunken, amoral, but capable husband, and Maria, the love interest in the story.Like every Hemingway novel that I've read, this one is well written. Hemingway uses the archaic English \\"thou\\" for the Spanish \\"tu\\" and translates literally from Spanish to English to better convey an impression of Spanish dialogue to English readers. These devices are initially distracting but are actually very successful at taking the reader inside the minds of the Spanish-speaking characters in this book.This is a distinguished work and an exciting one. It deserves its acclaim."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"The book chronicles an American dynamiter's mission to blow up a bridge controlled by Spanish fascists. The book doesn't focus on the war as a whole but rather on the toll war takes on the people living in it. The main character, Robert Jordan, bands with a guerilla group of which the war took its toll. One man once a great fighter has now become a hopeless drunk who's only form of comfort other than the bottle is taking care of horses left behind. His wife who had been beautiful once now has aged and lost her vivacity. Another young woman lost her parents in a brutal confrontation with fascist forces and dehumanized in the process. Hemingway's style of writing was a little too wishy washy but some of his emotional descriptions of the things that happened were intriguing. Two of the more emotional scenes were some of the characters flashbacks of what they had gone through during the war mainly having to do with killing an enemy and being captured by an enemy. There have been many stories about war and although war isn't something anyone can be used to this book took a perspective that has been thoroughly explored by today's standards. At the time the book was written there was a lot of censoring where the word \\"obscenity\\" was substituted hence the book was intended for a wide audience. During Hemingway's time it is understandable how this book can be grappling to an American audience. But since then World War II and the Vietnam War have pushed aside this conflict in the minds of Americans with their tales of calamity and loss and pretty much reiterating the themes of Hemingway's book. This is the reason why a typical American reader may not find pathos for the book. Maybe if the book talk more about Franco, ideologies and the bigger picture of the context of the war then it may be more interesting to contemporary readers. But this book still has a story that will be valuable for future generation. In other words, this is a good book for students."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway is a wonderful tale of a young American who has come to fight in the Spanish Civil War. Robert Jordan has come to fight for the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War against the Fascists from being a Spanish professor in America. As an explosives expert, he is assigned the task to destroy an enemy bridge for an important offensive attack by the Republicans. He travels behind the lines and meets up with a Guerrilla band lead by a war weary veteran, Pablo, who is troubled by his bloody past. Also present at the camp is an escaped prisoner named Maria in which Robert falls in love with. Over the 3 days that Robert is present at the camp, he, as well as the guerrilla band, battle toil with fears concerning blowing the bridge. Pablo and his bold wife Pilar can both feel the tragedy that is certain to come at the bridge, but unlike Pilar, Pablo is not devoted to the cause and tries disable the mission before changing his mind and coming back. This, along with Robert's growing emotions towards Maria and his own struggles over death pose the real conflict throughout the story. For Whom the Bell Tolls is an amazing love story as well as a war novel telling the story of the anguish of war. This book will forever symbolize the grimness of war."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"My third Hemingway book. I had been intimidated by it for a while (mostly by reputation), tackling his smaller, less dense works instead. Finally I picked it up and never regretted it. It took me a while to get through the middle section, but once I got through that I couldn't put it down. While on vacation in Chicago, I even took it with me and read while at a bar with friends. Every book I've read since pales in comparison."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"If you're a Hemingway fan, then you should not miss this book. There's a reason why many people feel this is his best novel. The scenery, character development, plot and overall picture in words make this a masterpiece. With the Spanish civil war as his launching point he makes great strides in making the reader feel the grip of ANY war past or present. What you get here is a lot of his philosophy on war, life, love and death. A theme with which he was more than passively familiar having had several near-death experiences until he finally took his own life. Compared to many of his other works, the ending is also somewhat of a fresh surprise. The John Donne quote cited in the fly leaf speaks volumes about the current troubles in the world today. Like all great literature, despite being written more than sixty years ago, this book still feels fresh and new."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway expertly begins this book with John Donne's poem... \\"No Man is an Island...\\" The main theme of this story, to me, is centered around our connection to others. No matter if they are right down the street or across the Atlantic Ocean from us. As Donne said... (I paraphrase weakly) \\"Whenever someone in mankind is hurting, it hurts me because I am part of mankind and mankind is part of me.\\"This book has several interesting elements:1. Robert Jordan's strong sense of duty.Why does a Spanish professor from Montana decide to leave his obiviously comfortable life to fight with the anti facist guerillas in a far away country? What compels him to give up himself so completely to fight for a people that he seemingly has no connections to? Where does Robert's commitment to duty come from? These questions are addressed and answered expertly by Hemingway in the thought process of Robert, conversations he has and lived out in his very relationships.The book is dominated by Robert's \\"thinking out\\" of his actions in the face of what he has to do. I really enjoyed this facet of the story. I think it adds to the length of the novel but it is definitely worth reading.2. The demise of Pablo's sense of duty and passion.When we meet Pablo in this story, he is a man on the downside of his effectiveness. He no longer has convicitons. He no longer has a will to accoplish his goals. Pablo's lack of determination plays directly against Robert's and Pablo's wife Pilar. It is interesting to look at Pablo, the old leader of the rebel band... and how he is losing his influence over these people. His pride even causes him at times to hurt the anti facist cause, which he once felt so strongly about. Robert and Pilar are both on fire for the cause and it consumes them. Pablo has lost all his fire for the cause and is now apparently useless. (Pablo does experience some redemption in the end...)3. The blossoming relationship between Robert and Maria. Love in the face of impending doom.I'm not usually a big romance guy... at least in the books I read. But the love story between Robert and Maria is beautiful.It grows out of a most impossible situation, Robert the foreign freedom fighter finds Maria the ravaged former war prisoner. She does not necessarily look beautiful on the outside but Robert loves her anyway. He loves who she is, and what she becomes to him.Interesting internal discussions happen for Robert about her. I love the one that talks about how he has to in essence live a whole life with Maria in 3 days. All because he is unsure of whether he will live to have a life with her after the war. These two people really loved each other and would do anything for each other.4. The ultimate sacrifice... Self sacrifice.I don't want to get into the details of the conclusion of the story. Hate to spoil a good read. But the theme of self sacrifice comes through loud and clear. To me, this is the theme of life. We make a real difference when we give up on our sense of self and make an impact on others. Whether they are people we are closely and intimatly related to, or people we have never seen before. Robert Jordan gets it... he puts others first and gives up all he has.Read this book... it is a rewarding experience. It is a war novel, but you will notice I rarely mentioned the war. It is so much more than a war novel. I loved it ... I think you will too."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This book is beautiful. I don't know what else to say. It is also extremely sad. Don't be surprised if you finish this book at 1:00 AM, on the floor, crying. Although I don't have a copy of the book in front of me, it has a quote along the lines ofEveryone must do what they can, you can do nothing for yourself but perhaps you can do something for another.This is a main theme in the book, though I think that it is even more - it is directly applicable to each of our lives. The beautiful thing is, is that this help that we can render to each other is not some lofty political idea of either the right or the left. It teaches us that each one can do his/her best, but that is all that they can do. Robert Jordan, the main character, vividly demonstrates this. From the United States, he has given up a safe job as a Spanish Professor at a University in Montana, to become a demolitions expert for the Republicans (anti-fascists) in the Spanish Civil war, in the 1930's. Pained by the loss of his father to suicide, he refuses to end his own life prematurely, choosing instead to delay the pursuers of the guerrila group he has fallen in with, when he has the chance of surrendering to them and saving his own life.As much as I want to, I cannot describe the beauty of this book. In three and one-half days, he falls in love, is betrayed by the guerrilla group's leader, strikes a blow for the Republic, and makes himself the All-American hero. But the real beauty is reading about someone who just enjoys the beautiful things of life, the air and the meadow and Maria and the sandwhich of meat and cheese with wine to wash it down that he eats in the countryside in a time and place when people were as human as they are now. Among the many tragic elements of this book are the leaders at the top of the Republic, who seem to spend their time smoking and drinking and letting military secrets slip that cause untold anguish for those beneath them. Also tragic is Jordan's reading of the letters to a dead Fascist soldier (that his group had killed). This soldier has a woman waiting at home for him and worrying for his life and...it just all ties together, showing us, as the quote at the beginning indicates, that \\"no man is an island\\", even the enemy is human, was born, will live with the same fear and pain that we do, and will die. We hate each other but are so similar that it's painful when we discover that someone else on the \\"other\\" side could have been our own brother. The Fascist soldier and the Republican aren't really that different, and the woman that waits at home for him cries just as much as Maria does. This book is so big and terrible and inspiring and real. This book strikes a blow for a kind of pragmatic idealism. Realize that the world is a messed up place but that eveyone can do what they can."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Short, tense, meaty sentences are just the beginning of this book. Hemingway does a wonderful job with the images in his book, from the brown of Jordan's uniform to the dust of the innumerable towns of Spain, everything is tightly written. At times I found myself wandering, but I was always brought back by Hemingway's descriptions of the characters and their activities. Truly Hemingway is one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, and FWTBT is irrefutable evidence."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"&quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; is no disappointment to a fan of Hemingway's terse, truthful prose. Here he employs it to explain the events of a few days during the Spanish Civil War. The plot is simple: an American fighting for the republic joins a small guerrilla unit in the hills, under orders to blow up a bridge at the beginning of a great assault on the fascists. The American also falls in love with a young Spanish girl, thus allowing Hemingway to explore his favorite combination of themes, love and war.Hemingway is, in my view, one of the most moving and profound writers of all time. In this novel, he aptly captures the emotions and motives of those who risk their lives at war, and along the way, offers some extraordinarily memorable stories of both bravery and brutality.To me, the novel's main weakness is the love story. The protagonist's love interest, as in all of Hemingway's novels, is young (19 years old, in this case), beautiful, naive, and ignorant. She worships Robert Jordan, and obeys his every command much as a puppy. Having no mind of her own, she is wholly contented by serving Jordan in ways such as washing his socks and and drying out his sleeping bag.The only other oddity in the novel is Hemingway's habit of translating Spanish literally. For example, he uses thou and you to differentiate between the Spanish speaker's use of &quot;tu&quot; and &quot;Usted.&quot; He also uses such nonsensical phrases as &quot;I have much hunger&quot; as a translation for the Spanish &quot;tengo mucho hambre,&quot; and &quot;What passes with thee?&quot; for &quot;Qu&eacute; te pasa?&quot;. I found that a bit distracting.On the whole, however, I found the novel remarkable. Hemingway's ability to pare down complex ideas and events into such simple, powerful prose is unsurpassed."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This book, which I've just finished, is incredible. To the reviews already posted I can add very little, they say the things I would say, only more eloquently. The one thing I would like to share with readers is a point about the dialogue. The dialogue seems to be written very strangely. Lots of thees and thous. I think it is because it is written as Spanish is spoken, and it is good to keep this in mind as one reads, or it can become tiresome."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This book is the fiction novelization of the Hemingway's experiences in Spain during the civil war. But the book is more than an historical novel (in fact it does not have many historical description) or a war novel; it is just a novel with adventure, with love, and with the background of poor but proud suffering people.The novel narrates the story of an American international brigadier fighting for the Republica in the Sierra (mountains) of Madrid. The novel is clearly divided in two parts: the first one that is about the guerrilleros, a slow paced part that mostly cares about feelings, love and suffering. The second part, fast paced, is almost a classic war novel with the goal of blowing up a bridge.The first part, although maybe too slow sometimes, relates feelings, how the guerrilleros feel about the coming of a foreigner and how they finally get use to him. The most interesting point of this part is the feeling of fear, of quite calm, of the stressful waiting that Hemmingway transmit, nothing happens although they are in the middle of the war. To transmit this feeling, Hemmingway narrates the experiences of the guerrilleros at their villages, some passages are specially moving.The second part of the book is the planning for blowing up a bridge. This part although more entertaining is more typical, is fine though as you get inside the planning and have the feeling of the excitement at the war.If there is something to criticize about the novel is the too much stereotypic description of the Spanish folks. Although poverty, pride, racial and impulsive behavior of Spanish people are well depicted (like Lorca, Cela or Baroja successfully did), somehow it is like if they were actors, too much gypsies and folklore. Hemingway mixes mastery descriptions with others less moving, more artificial. At some passages it is easy to see that Hemingway was not Spanish, and much of the culture is left outside the book and/or simplified (gypsies and folklore).Summing up is a mastery piece where the simple writing style of Hemingway yields a colorful depiction of feelings and actions, although sometimes Hemingway is not capable of transmitting the complexity of the Spanish country."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"As a writer myself (ROZ: The Story of a Jamaican Lolita)there is much of Hemingway in my work.

This book just grabbed me and I had to read it until I finished it. The trademark Hemingway style of silence is present here. The landscape and environment are as much a part of the story as the characters. It took getting used to pages of describing the landscape so deeply, but once I went along for the ride I enjoyed the novel immensely. The plot seems conventional, that's fine for me."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This book is the ghost of what was once Heroic about men from a time long ago. It is anti-douche bag and, thus, probably not popular in modern times."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"The decades since Hemingway's death have not been kind to his legacy. While still revered as a pillar of English literature, his life seems to have chipped away at his work. Most find Hemingway's writing too dry or his stories clustered with masogny and booze. To be fair the critiques have some relevance, but behind every Hemingway story lies a heart fractured, but aspiring for peace. For Whom the bell Tolls was my fourth Hemingway and I can honestly say my favorite. There is so much to marvel at that my meager attempts at a review do the book no justice, but it's the way Hemingway writes and the subtle beauty that he evokes that made this novel so enjoyable for me. Hemingway's prose style is so intricate it at once appears etched in stone, but light as a feather. Hemingway shows how war not only changes the way we feel and act, but the bonds we form with the ones around us. Robert Jordan's relationship with Maria is one of the few hemingway's love stories that I felt connected to, and while a bit dated in today's world I still was touched by the love they bore one another. Maria is encapsulated in a blanket of femine weakness, but she is bolstered by the mighty Pilar. I find Pilar to be one of hemingway's most fascinating women. Endless papers can be written on her alone, and I found her to be so multifaceted. Besides being one of hemingway's best novels, it's also one of his longest. At first I was daunted by 400 pages of dry Hemingway prose, but by the end I was looking for more. Besides shining light on an area of world history few even know existed(the Spanish Civil War), Hemingway's story is universal in it's telling by including themes of fraternity, nationalism, and the multifaceted definitions of courage. I have a new respect and love for Hemingway after reading this remarkable novel. While Hemingway may not be everyones cup of tea, but those looking for a good and memorable story should look no further!"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS: Immediately after I read For Whom the Bell Tolls, the next book I read was For Whom the Bell Tolls.

I spent 3 years reading them. I choose to read those I had not been forced to read in college--some of the works were written by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, William Shakespeare, Steinbeck, William Faulkner, Melville (Moby Dick), Shelley (Frankenstein, which is much different than what one sees today), Ralph Ellison's remarkable Invisible Man, Dickens, Hemmingway, etc.I read to many authors to list. I enjoyed most of what I read.FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS: Immediately after I read For Whom the Bell Tolls, the next book I read was For Whom the Bell Tolls. It is that great.It has many plots, but mainly, it is a love story. \\"Roberto Jordan\\" and \\"Maria\\" are drawn together from the first day (in the book). He is a brilliant dynamiter, she is a 19-year old beauty that has been treated with extreme harshness by the fascists and, via the work of others, escaped and ended up with those that fought against the fascists. And they meet, drawn to each other in spite of the conditions they are in, or perhaps because of them. Each reader can make that judgment.It is Hemmingway's ability to seemingly place me in the fictional location and see what is happening that makes this book so remarkable. He paints a vivid picture with his words; the most vivid I've seen in any novel. His other works are also very good.This is his best and imho the finest novel I have ever read."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Ernest Hemingway does not write inferior books. Having just read a book concerning the Spanish Civil War, I was interested in learning his outlook as he was present in Spain at that time. He was also able to give some insight into the lives of some, (real or imaginary), participants in the conflict. It is an enjoyable book, and one that is easily read."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is a novel about the Spanish Civi War, specifically the story of an American who works with a group of partisans to sabotage a bridge. The story takes place over three days but the book runs in excess of four hundred pages. As a result, the pace can get slow at times. No background is given on the war, but Hemingway's sympathies are clear: the fascists must be defeated, and the worth of personal sacrifices is determined in how they further the greater good. Hemingway develops some interesting characters, particularly \\"Pablo,\\" a disillusioned partisan leader whose murderous actions in support of a noble cause lead him to alcoholism and defeatism. The American protagonist is most interesting: a cynic who still believes in a cause outside himself. The romantic relationship between the American and a Spanish girl was not the novel's strength; Hemingway did not make his career drafting love stories. Although a bit slow, some of the scenes are fantastic. In particular, the flashback to the murder of fascist sympathizers in a small village is one of the most horrifying chapters I have ever read. Likewise, an account of a partisan group's last stand on a hilltop puts most Hollywood action movies to shame. Liked the book but did not love it. Probably for people who really dig Hemingway or want a bottom-up look at the Spanish conflict."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I am not usually a literature guy (preferring non-fiction and popular novels), but I read this because it is a classic and I wanted to experience Hemingway beyond my high school reading of \\"The Old Man and the Sea.\\" (and honestly, because while dating my wife she revealed this as one of her favorite books and that aroused my curiosity.)This is a story that deals with the larger questions of life (and essential truths) and man's place in the world or at least in a challenging situation. So that qualifies as literature according to my wife's definition when I asked her what made literature \\"literature\\" a while ago.Protagonist Robert Jordan is an American volunteering with the Republicans fighting Franco's Fascists in the Spanish Civil War. A demolitions expert, Jordan's task is to blow a key bridge as part of a larger Republican attack. While waiting with a small band of guerilla's he meets and falls in love with Maria, a victim of the war and symbol for all innocents caught in aggression's path.Thus we have a literary work that addresses commitment to cause, love, and the battle between individual wants and the needs of and obligations to a larger cause.Hemmingway has a way with description and his prose is very well done and evocative - particularly one passage I liked when he described holding Maria's hand with ripening grain in an untrammeled field. His story is slow, however, for my tastes and the descriptions and inner conversations of Jordan are much more prevalent than scenes where anything called action could be said to be occurring (though the action scenes are pretty good when they do occur). I imagine the ending will be unsatisfying to some, but for literary minded folks be the source of discussion as to how the final scene may have played out and what it meant in terms of tying the story's themes together."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"In my humble opinion For Whom the Bell Tolls is one of Hemingway's greatest books. Well, at least it is my favorite of his books. The imagery, the writing style, and the language are simply breathtaking. If you have not read this Great book, do yourself a favor and add it to you bookshelf."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I hate this book no one should ever have to read this book, that is my opinion and if you you dont like it i dont care. This is a bad book dont read it."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls is undoubtedly his greatest work, and arguably the greatest American novel of the 20th Century. Told in Hemingway's unique style, it is easy to understand but keeps the reader thinking for hours. Robert Jordan, the novel's main character, enters the Civil War in Spain, his mission being to destroy a supply bridge. He soon falls in love with Maria, a young girl whose life was almost lost in the war.At the conclusion of the novel, after the bridge has been destroyed and Jordan is attempting to flee, he is injured and it becomes apparent that he will soon die. Maria, who is in love with him, refuses to leave despite Jordan's pleas for her to do so, until he finally convinces her that he will always be with her. His words bring to mind the sermon by John Donne that the title for the book was taken from. Donne states that everyone is part of one big entity, part of the &quot;island&quot; of humanity, and we are reminded that Jordan is part of Maria, and all the rest of humanity"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This novel bored me. And I like Hemingway's work. Pilar's tragic stories go on and on, as do pointless conversations in caves with desperate people swearing at each other and hitting each other in the mouth (which, alas, only encourages more conversation instead of silencing it). The constant use of &quot;obscenity,&quot; &quot;muck,&quot; etc. instead of the real swear words is truly wearying, and the translation of Spanish terms into &quot;thee,&quot; &quot;thou,&quot; and &quot;less bad&quot; mean nothing at all to the casual English reader.Nor is Robert Jordan (why does Hemingway keep using his full name throughout the novel? That's irritating too) much help, being a typical Hemingway strong-and-silent-type who drinks too much, enjoys bullfights, and lives to sleep with pretty 19-year-olds. &quot;The earth moved&quot; is the best he can do in the supposedly passionate and brief love scenes with Maria, who enjoys pouring him more wine while washing his feet. His doubts about doing his duty are neither profound nor convincing. Until well into the novel he's a too-typical freedom fighter who justifies duty over Eros in dreary inner conversations. Like another reviewer put it, I wished a quarter into the novel that he'd spare me his musings, blow the damned bridge and go home."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"On the back cover of this paperback it's noted that Hemingway is known for his \\"terse\\" sentences. Did the person writing this \\"blurb\\" read the book? Probably not. In parts of this novel the author writes as if possessed by James Joyce, in a stream of consciousness style with long sentences. That's OK, or would be, if they added to the novel but, sorry, they don't. The author is also repetitive, repeating the same point over and over in some cases. But there is no reason in terms of the plot in writing the same point over and over in this book except to (in my opinion) stretch this novella out into almost 500 pages. The first couple and the last couple of chapters are essentially where the action is. One has to ask why this story is so revered and I think the answer is because the author was so admired. The press especially hero-worshiped Hemingway and perhaps this explains the too-much praise for this work. Still, not a bad book and when it's good, it's very good."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway spans quite range. If you have just finished reading The Great Gatsby and are interested in the jaded, bored-with-life, spoiled and rich who drink and drink, read The Sun Also Rises. If you've just finished Dr. Blade #57, you like senseless action, and just want to say you've read Hemingway, try To Have and Have Not. But if, like me, you come from a background of JRR Tolkien, RL Stevenson, HG Wells and Jack London, and perhaps you have already read a few Nick Adams tales or The Old Man and the Sea, then don't be daunted by this story's length - this is your book.While it's true this book slowed down a few times, that rang true. It mirrored the reality of my military experience. Then again, there are some chapters of this book burn into the memory: how the Communists first dealt with people after taking their hometown, the stand they took on the hilltop, the final scene, and others. There characters were clear, the action realistic, the inaction tense. Read it."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I read this book when I was in middle school and really enjoyed it. I think it is a great pick for anyone, but especially young boys and Hemingway fans. I plan to reread it soon."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald himself said of this novel: &quot;It has all the profundity of REBECCA.&quot; REBECCA being a sleight novel. This book reads like a 2nd-rate journalist's attempt at writing a novel. It lacks the subtlety of Hemingway's other novels. I love Hemingway. But I didn't love this book."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Ernest Hemingway is really good in making his story easy to read and understand. The way he writes makes everything simple. Also, his storyline is very clear but the image he is portraying in the story is very complex and interesting. He describes everything in a manner that you get the clear image but at the same time not bore you reading a description of for example a road. Unlike Charles Dickens, Ernest Hemingway is really good with descriptive sentence. Hemingway also excels in letting the reader decide for himself teh outcome of the story or how a character will od in a situation by during the course of the book he inserts certain images or otehr character's decision in a given situation and how they reacted. He covered a wide array of ideas from love, war, human relationship, death, and independence while remaining focused on his plot. His plot is very simple and clear but he also has the kind of themes that goes deeper to a point that it tackles human behavior itself. For Whom the Bell Tolls is a really good reading. It is good for any age but the subject matter ranging from passion and death might not work well with younger kids. In all, Hemingway's For Whome the Bell Tolls displayed clearly the life of people while they are at war but at the same time he is ble to show the emotions and experiences that humans go through while they traverse the hard life of WAR."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"It has always been my 'reading style' to pay less attention to plot as to detail and interpretation; perhaps i just want to the world to be more interesting. With that inclination, i found my first Hemingway book to be an outstanding read.While i admit that i have read very little in my life, i thought that Hemingway reminded me of a long-winded Ondatdje.So, while at first it seemed pointless narration, it made a lot more sense when i stumbled upon the John Donne quote hidden as a preface. Specifically, Hemingway has an interesting way of tossing together all sorts of situations to fit his themes. The battle, war, politics and love are thrown in a careful attack on his intended targets: self-necessity (i am nothing/i am everything), courage, and what it means to live."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"\\"Are there no pleasant things to speak of?...Do we have to talk always of horrors?\\" asks Maria at one point in For Whom the Bell Tolls.Good question.To be fair, For Whom the Bell Tolls isn't ALL about horrors. It even has some pleasant moments. But ultimately, it's about the selfless nature of war---which, though Hemingway clearly intends us to admire the acts of sacrifice to which the war incites his characters, I think is the greatest condemnation of war.But Hemingway's portrayal of this theme is quite powerful. He isn't always consistent, but he is about as consistent as it is possible to be about such a theme and much more so than most, which is of great artistic value.It's also generally very well written, much more so than (and something of a relief after reading) a lot of faux-Hemingway like John Steinbeck or Cormac McCarthy. And I thought this was much better than the only other Hemingway I've read, A Farewell to Arms. But there are a few passages that miss the mark, such as this almost comically bad sex scene: \\"...They were having now and before and always and now and now and now. Oh, now, now, now, the only now, and above all now, and there is no other now but thou now and now is thy prophet. Now and forever now. Come now, now, for there is no now but now. Yes, now. Now, please now, only now, not anything else only this now, and where are you and where am I and where is the other one, and not why, not ever why, only this now; and on and always please then always now, always now, for now always one now; one only one, there is no other one but one now, one, going now, rising now, sailing now, leaving now, wheeling now, soaring now, away now, all the way now, all of all the way now; one and one is one, is one, is one, is one, is still one, is still one, is one descendingly, is one softly, is one longingly, is one kindly, is one happily, is one in goodness, is one to cherish, is one now...\\" blah blah blah.The mind-numbing repetitiousness of this \\"description\\" (if one can call it that) is especially unfortunate as it echoes another passage just a few pages earlier which is intended to have quite a different feel: \\"...muck this whole treacherous muckfaced mucking country and every mucking Spaniard in it on either side and to hell forever. Muck them to hell together, Largo, Prieto, Asensio, Miaja, Rojo, all of them. Muck every one of them to death to hell. Muck the whole treachery-ridden country. Muck their egotism and their selfishness and their selfishness and their egotism and their conceit and their treachery. Muck them to hell and always. Muck them before we die for them. Muck them after we die for them. Muck them to death and hell...\\" It goes on like this at some length.But in the end, Hemingway affirms that there are \\"pleasant things to speak of\\": \\"That is in Madrid. Just over the hills there, and down across the plain. Down out of the gray rocks and the pines, the heather and the gorse, across the yellow high plateau you see it rising white and beautiful. That part is just as true as Pilar's old women drinking the blood down at the slaughterhouse. There's no one thing that's true. It's all true. The way the planes are beautiful whether they are ours or theirs.\\" But the horrors win out in the end: \\"The hell they are, he thought.\\"Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I was excited to read my first Hemmingway book. I labored through the extremely cumbersome and boring narratives hoping that eventually it would pay off, unfortunately it never did. I know it's fiction and everything but the way Hemmingway has Pilar describe past events for pages and pages is very unrealistic. The book finally gets good about 34 Chapters into it whith the raid on El Sordo's band which is the highlight of the book. Maria is annoying. The narrative is confusing. If you are looking for a classic I recommend skipping this book. I plan on reading \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" next. Hopefully Hemmingway will redeem himself in that book. I honestly do not see why people consider this a classic. It was a waste of time."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemmingway paints an interesting picture of guerilla activity on behalf of the Republic during the Spanish Civil War and offers convincing insight into what motivates a soldier--particularly one who isn't even a native of Spain.But, like most of the &quot;great&quot; American male writers of the 20th century, his grip on love and women is loose at best. The &quot;girl&quot; Maria who wins his heart at first sight is barely 19, &quot;moves like a colt&quot; and repeatedly vows to please him in every way--&quot;I will wash the socks for thee, and fix thy supper,&quot; etc., etc.--as soon as this pesky war is over with.Yes, yes, Pilar is a strong female character with an interesting past and clearly defined motives. But she's not worthy of being loved because she is no longer young and never was beautiful. Hemmingway even puts the words into her own mouth.Perhaps Hemmingway was trying to be too ambitious by throwing a love story into this book--either he was too lazy to make it very believable, or he really didn't understand love or women anyway (his personal life might attest to this). In any case, perhaps he should've just stuck with the war in this novel.I much preferred the interesting relationship depicted in &quot;The Sun Also Rises.&quot;"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I picked this book up a day after reading Catch-22, perhaps the most drawn out, most asinine ridiculous over rated book ever written, and For Whom the Bell Tolls is the second.I found this novel silly, a glorified, and tamed sex novel one might find at the grocery store. The love making scenes were ridiculous, what was this \\"thou, oh, oh thou oh oh oh\\" garbage? It took me a week to get through this book, which from reading other bad reviews is pretty quick work of this novel.This novel wasn't all bad, which is more than I can say for Catch Number 2 (that was not an error). The three action packed scenes (The murder of the \\"fascists\\" at Pablo's town, Sordo's battle, and the blowing of the bridge) were actually pretty entertaining. These were the fastest chapters of the book though they were the longest. I did a little research on Hemingway and found that he had a minimalist style and liked verbs more than adjectives, and didn't like flowery language, I feel the man could have used an adjective or two to liven up this dull dead book.Oh and watch out for that long drawn out paragraph that goes something like this \\"Now, all now, and now I say now all we have is now and then now this is now and now i what we have\\" that's pretty close to what he wrote and it continues with the \\"nows\\" Then there was the DIRECT translation of Spanish. What was that all about? \\"Less bad\\"? That's \\"menos mal\\", which means literally less bad, but in English it sounds STUPID. It's different when you read this book and are fluent in Spanish you see why the English is not less bad but all bad. And what of the Thees and thous? And Nays? I get it, they were speaking archaic Spanish, one sentence at the beginning telling us that would have been sufficient, now I have to feel like I'm reading a 15th century novel. The whole Robert Jordan thing was also annoying, just call him Bob or Robert or Jordan. Lastly, what's with te glorification of communists?

The Scribner publication (paperback) of this Hemingway Novel wasn't the one I believe most people read. This was spattered everywhere with \\"Thee\\" and \\"Thou.\\" That really detracted from the story. Unfortunately I don't think even with out that distraction the story wouldn't have been much better. It also would have helped me had I known more about the bigger picture. I'm not that familiar with Spanish history and wasn't sure who represented what. Also a strange personal quirk; I keep thinking of the protagonist Robert Jordan, and transposing him in my mind with Di Vinci Code protagonist Robert Langdon.

Much to my chagrin, however, For Whom The Bell Tolls came up somewhat short of a satisfying read. One of the biggest problems with this novel is that it is a five hundered word novel that could easily be written in a modest one-hundered and fifty: only a couple of days go by throughout the duration of the novel. Another flaw I found in Hemmingway's For Whom The Bell Tolls is the trivialness behind the main character's job and even personality. For five hundred pages the reader is forced to read about a simple man who has the simple job of traveling from America to Spain to blow up a specific bridge when given the order. In the mean time, the main character, Robert Jordan, lollygags around in the woods with a few other Spanish rebels whose sanity/motivation becomes a bit doubtful. In the end, Robert Jordan ends up dying under a dead horse opposing enemy fire. Although I was hoping to recognize some of the insight behind this \\"timeless\\" classic or its author, I was disappointed as I found For Whom The Bell Tolls to be nothing less than an average novel written in an average style.

It did not materialize into the kind of idealized Spanish government that many had sacrificed for. The fascistic Francisco Franco ended up ruling an isolationist Spain until the 1970s.

Hemingway's short but powerful prose is in perfect form. I actually find Hemingway and Gabriel Garcia Marquez similar in their ability to capture a thought completely in one sentence- even though their actual sentences are different.Hemingway perfectly captures poignant emotions, and the sentence sparsity adds to the strength and description beautifully.I also agree with one of the other reviewers above, in that my appreciation is probably helped by age. A lot of the emotions of loss, doubt, disillusion and love I only felt in my post high school years. It's a good adventure story nonetheless, but might lose its power for a youger audience."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I really thought this was a pretty good book. Its full of a lot of action dealing with war and it describes the different emotions and feelings people thought while fighting in the war. Reading this book made me think a lot about war and it got me to think if I ever had to go to war, and what it would be like. This book was a little hard to understand at first, but once I started reading more into it, I could never put it down. So anyone you want's to read about being in a war should deffinetly read this book, it could change your mind."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This book has had more of an effect on me than any other I have ever read.

Once again, he takes us right into his mind and the hearts of each of his characters, revealing their thoughs, fears and emotions. I must caution, this book is rather lenghty, so don't attempt this unless you're sure you can finish it, but it is well worth the effort. If you're new to Hemingway, you might want to try another of his works first. This is a great book to everyone, whether doing summer reading for high school or just for a book to curl up with. You won't be disappointed!!"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I'm a middle-aged middle-class guy. I read this recently, since it has a reputation as one of the great Amerian novels, and my particular HS required no Hemingway. I figured the time had come.So now, having read it, I think For Whom the Bell Tolls was an important milestone, something of a product of its times. There was not yet such a body of anti-war or humanist literature as there is now...perhaps Hemingway played a role in creating that. Still, it is not just an anti-war book; intelligent people have known a long time, as Sherman put it, that war is simply \\"brutality\\" that cannot be made pretty. So this is not Hemingway's main point. If anything, he even sounds pro-war in the brief sections that justify the Spanish Civil War and the fight against the Fascists. (He seems a little blind to the pact the Spanish Republicans made with the devil, i.e. the Russian communists, but history had not yet proven the bloodthirstiness and corruption of the Soviet Union.)Hemingway's main theme in this book is personal honor, and how personal concerns affect one's perceptions and may override original, idealistic motives. The hero, American dynamiter Robert Jordan, has snuck behind Fascist lines to help destroy a bridge and aid a planned Republican frontal attack. But three things happen - his guerilla teammates are led by a very disillusioned old veteran, who argues bitterly with his tough old wife; and Robert falls in love Maria, with a refugee they are sheltering, raped and nearly killed by the Fascists. Finally, his spying reveals the front is losing the element of surprise. In this dangerous situation, he wants to call it all off, and retreat to a life of happiness with Maria. Sorry, no further plot will be revealed here....This way we get to study two different couples. We learn that Pablo and Pilar, the guerillas, have killed many people, up-close and personal. Pablo seems to have enjoyed it. Pilar did less hands-on killing but she and the others are still dedicated to the cause. Now here comes an outsider, a handsome young American with no real dog in this fight, bringing the front closer just when Pablo has had enough. Even worse, he falls for Maria, and sleeps with her in his own bag, outside the cave. (The love scenes, though not very graphic, are pretty juicy for their time.) Pilar tries to bolster Robert's resolve, even plotting against her husband. Maria is lost without Robert, and will follow him anywhere. But where will Robert end up going? He has committed himself, and he wants to fulfill his duty as a matter of honor. What destiny will bring the best honor for both himself and Maria? Having sacrificed so much so far, what further sacrifice do any of these people need to maintain their honor?Unlike many contemporary books, FWTBT does not have a big, overwhelming climax. Instead, the ending unfolds in a way that you might have expected, as you read it. This unfortunately left me a little cold, unable to decide whether I Love the Book, the way I do some others. But it is an indispensable milestone. Perhaps better read if you are not already so jaded or anti-war that you can't conceive of a cause worth fighting for."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"The presentation of this book is enjoyable own excellent work, which can be read nimbly and with some ease and this time."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This book has great passages, as other reviewers have pointed out, like Pilar's tale or El Sordo's last stand, but is otherwise too long. It has three major flaws:1. The hero's love interest, Maria, is a uninteresting and unattractive. Most of the other characters feel like flesh-and-blood, flawed people, but, for reasons I can't fathom, the author gave Maria the psychological depth of a pet.2. The hero's dialogs with Spaniards are in a distracting and ridiculous form, resulting in lines like \\"Eatest thou always onions for breakfast?\\"3. The characters' swearing is clumsily bleeped out, with lines like \\"Obscenity thy mother!\\" At first, I thought that the Kindle edition I was reading had been censored, and returned it. I switched to Scribner's 1968 print edition, and found the same. I cannot believe that Hemingway actually wrote that way.Another strange passage that is also dating the book is one where the hero views himself as \\"taking part in a crusade,\\" adding \\"That was the only word for it although it was a word that had been so worn and abused that it no longer gave its true meaning.\\" And what exactly is the true meaning of \\"crusade\\"? Historians have long known that crusaders were nothing but thugs rampaging through the Middle-East. Even Voltaire wrote about it in the mid 18th century;The Crusades Through Arab Eyes, 23 years ago. Yet Europeans and Americans have, until recently, used the crusades as a symbol of a generous and benevolent undertaking. EvenCrusade in Europereferred to the liberation of Europe as a \\"crusade.\\""},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Thanks you very much for your work. It was fast, good and on time. We did nor expect such a quick shipment."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"&quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; was the first Hemingway I ever read. I was a high school kid in the early 1970s, working on my campus newspaper, newly graduated from Jack London but not yet ready for Jack Kerouac.To my young eyes, it was a good action story: Robert Jordan, the passionate American teacher joins a band of armed gypsies in the Spanish Civil War. He believes one man can make a difference. The whole novel covers just 68 hours, during which Jordan must find a way to blow up a key bridge behind enemy lines. In that short time, Jordan also falls in love with Maria, a beautiful Spanish woman who has been raped by enemy soldiers. The whole spectrum of literature was refracted through the prism of my youth: Good guys and bad guys, sex and blood, life and death. For me, just a boy, the journey from abstraction to clarity was only just beginning.Re-reading &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; at 42 (roughly the age Hemingway was when he published it), I have lost my ability to see things clearly in black and white. My vision is blurred by irony, as I note that two enemies, the moral killer Anselmo and the sympathetic fascist Lieutenant Berrendo, utter the very same prayer. For the first time, I see that the book opens with Robert Jordan lying on the &quot;pine-needled floor of the forest&quot; and closes as he feels his heart pounding against the &quot;pine needle floor of the forest&quot;; Jordan ends as he begins, perhaps having never really moved. I certainly could never have seen at 16 how dying well might be more consequential than living well. And somehow the light has changed in the past 26 years, so that I now truly understand how the earth can move.As a teen, I missed another crucial element, even though Vietnam was still a seeping wound. Three pivotal days in Jordan's life force him to question his own role in a futile war. He wonders if dying for a political cause might be too wasteful, but he ultimately believes that dying to save another individual is a man's most heroic act.The book's title is taken from John Donne's celebrated poem: &quot;No man is an Iland ... and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.&quot; It was not about loneliness and aloneness, as I once had thought, but about the seamless fabric of all life: What happens to one happens to all.I am not blind to Hemingway's flaws. He was a good short writer, and what was short was almost always better. Pilar's tale on the mountainside has been widely acclaimed as the most powerful of Hemingway's prose. Her story within a story is nothing less than a contemporary myth.&quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; has also been regarded as Hemingway's capitulation to critics who barked that his innovative style was too lean, and as a consciously commercial exercise for which Hollywood might (and did) pay handsomely. Robert Jordan, in so many respects, was a tragic mythical hero in the vein of Achilles, Gawain and Samson. &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; ranks as one of the great American war novels in a country that has always struggled with the concept of good and bad wars."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This novel certainly deserves its billing as a \\"classic.\\" The action takes place during the Spanish Civil War (of the 1930's), and the story follows a group of guerilla loyalists, who are fighting against Franco's fascist forces in the name of the Republic.The entire novel only covers a span of three days, so the reader truly gets a sense of the time passing. Because of this, it feels as if the events are actually occurring as one is reading. Each moment is important, and there are few discontinuities in the story. Also, the novel is written in an interesting format where the climax doesn't occur until the final pages-this adds quite a bit of suspense. What really makes this book so excellent is the delicate combination of action and lull, and love and hate, which Hemingway builds into the story. There is a very beautiful (if only slightly unrealistic) love story carefully interwoven with murder, conspiracy, and disaster.It is impossible not to deeply care for each individual in the story because there are few characters, and they are all extremely well developed. The reader can find a piece of somebody that he/she knows in every character. Hemingway also deals effectively with emotion. It is always easy to understand exactly what each person is feeling. With Robert Jordan, specifically, Hemingway uses a unique series of monologue-type passages so that the reader really can \\"get inside\\" Jordan's head. Somehow, Hemingway manages to do this while keeping out that uneasiness one gets when reading a play monologue. The novel has an anti-war feel to it, but it still contains several enthralling battle scenes. If only the love story were a bit more believable, this book could be truly fantastic. &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls&quot; is definitely a worthwhile read right from the opening quote by John Donne all the way to the very last page."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Usually, even with the best books, I would say that &quot;this book is not for everyone.&quot; Not so with this novel. I truly believe that this book IS for everyone. Unlike so much other 20th century literature, one need not be well read to get something out of it.The story is of two of man's most cherished and hated traditions: Love and War. The tragedy is that we have had so much of the latter and so little of the former. We see much of both in &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls.&quot; It is a tender story of two young people who just want to live a &quot;normal&quot; life together during the Spainish civil war, but who are prevented from doing thus due to their being in the wrong place at the wrong time.It is incredulous to me that there were other reviewers who found this book &quot;boring.&quot; I can only surmise that anyone who would find a novel such as this boring will not find anything &quot;exciting&quot; unless it has Arnold Scharzenegger swinging around a machine gun. But that, I believe, is the fault of the reader's lack of attention span and cannot be blamed on Hemingway.The author writes that &quot;The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for and I hate very much to leave it.&quot; I would agree. Anyone else who agrees, and anyone who has a passion and zest for life should read this book. One of the best examples of American literature in the 20th century."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom the Bell Tolls is quite simply one of the best novels ever written. Honestly, I had relatively low expectations before reading it. I read A Farewell to Arms and found the terse, repetitive prose and stilted dialogue underwhelming. For Whom the Bell Tolls is superior to A Farewell to Arms in every way. This is a complex novel with some of the most memorable characters in modern literature.This mesmerizing novel neither glorifies war, not does it vilify it. Hemmingway's detached prose is world weary, exposing both sides of the conflict, allowing us to see that war, inevitable and futile, is never simple. Characters on both sides of the conflict struggle with their own fears and regrets. Both sides commit, and are subjected to, the atrocities and horrors of war. As different as each side may think they are from the other, in the end, they are all human and are not as different as they think.For Whom the Bell Tolls is riveting and powerful, easily one of the ten best novels of the 20th century. I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Set during the Spanish Civil War, Ernest Hemingway's \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" tells the story of Robert Jordan, a young American who is serving as a demolitions expert for the Republican cause. The novel follows his experiences with a band of guerrilla fighters as he undertakes a mission to blow up a strategic bridge. The whole novel, except for some flashbacks and reminiscences of various characters, covers just a few days.Although the novel focuses on a small number of characters in a fairly compressed time period, Hemingway attains a real epic feel with this book. The novel is fairly lengthy (471 pages in the 2003 Scribner edition), but I found it to be a swift read--indeed, often difficult to put down. There is much that is noteworthy about this novel. It offers a compelling perspective on war from the viewpoint of guerrilla forces, rather than conventional forces (interested readers might want to check out Mao Tse-Tung's \\"On Guerrilla Warfare\\" for some theoretical and historical perspective). The novel also deals with the phenomenon of ideologically committed foreign forces in Spain's Fascist-versus-Republican conflict.Hemingway deals with the issues of love and sex in a combat zone, as well as with the roles of women in a guerrilla force. Other significant issues include loyalty, leadership, communications, military hardware, the impact of weather and terrain, and the connection between guerrilla and conventional forces. Particularly interesting is Hemingway's portrait of Robert Jordan as a technically and tactically skilled guerrilla fighter, and as a leader of guerrilla fighters. Thus the book should interest not just lovers of literature, but also serious military professionals and students of the history of warfare.Hemingway offers a grim and graphic look at the brutality of 20th century warfare. War is not glamorized or sanitized, and atrocities are described in unflinching detail. The characters explore the ethics of killing in war. As the story progresses, Hemingway skillfully peels back the layers of Jordan and other characters to reveal their psychological wounds. But the book is not all about pain and violence. In the midst of war Hemingway finds the joy and beauty that keep his characters going. He also incorporates storytelling as a powerful motif in the book; his characters share stories with each other, recall missing untold stories, or resist a story too hard to bear. In Hemingway's world storytelling is as essential a human activity as eating, fighting, and lovemaking.Hemingway's writing appeals to all the senses as he creates some vivid scenes. He demonstrates his mastery of the art of fiction; he continually makes interesting choices and creates some really striking and beautiful passages. \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is an exceptionally haunting work of literature; I consider this rich and rewarding text to be an essential volume in the canon of war fiction. For intriguing companion texts that also deal with the Spanish Civil War, I recommend \\"Spain's Cause Was Mine: A Memoir of an American Medic in the Spanish Civil War,\\" by Hank Rubin, and \\"The Confessions of Senora Francesca Navarro and Other Stories,\\" by Natalie L. M. Petesch."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"The last time I read Hemingway's novels was some ten years ago in Spain. I thought I was pretty cool. I read \\"The Sun Also Rises and A Farwell to Arms.\\" I don't recall what I thought of them. But one thing I do know is that it is sometimes difficult to separate the legacy or mystique of certain writers from the work at hand.I thought most of the book was very well done. The reality of war was crafted in a way that compares well to more modern portraits of war (\\"The Things They Carried,\\" \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" \\"Deer Hunter,\\" \\"Jarhead\\"). The true violence of humiliation, dehumanization, and violation are hauntingly evoked. There are scenes in this novel that I will not forget: the killing of the fascists in Pablo and Pilar's village, the rape of Maria and the murder of her parents, the death of Anselmo at the bridge. The portrayal of men and women, those who try to hold on to some sort of moral clarity and those who lose their bearings, was brilliant. When it comes to men at war, the book shines.A technique that I found interesting was the way that Hemingway created the absent character of Kashkin. He serves as a counter point to Robert Jordan and as an example of all that could and eventually does happen. The absent character adds depth to the novel; it gives a skeleton upon which to hang the clothes of the past.However, there were places in the book where I felt uncomfortable, like watching the awkward intimacies of adolescents. The love scenes in the book were failures. And I keep trying to figure out why.One reason perhaps is that they happened without enough development. Like some romantic comedy, the two lovers see one another and almost instantly fall in love. Granted, the entire novel takes place in three days, but every other part of the narrative is carefully developed. Though the timeframe is compact, there is plenty of space in the narrative. The book is nearly 500 pages long. The sex, the declarations of love, the intimacy, it all seems hollow.In every other place in the novel there is complexity, nuance. But when it comes to romance, to the issue of love, the novel falls into absolutes and clich&eacute;s. Robert Jordan is too righteous in his love for Maria. He is too loyal, too gentle. They love each other fully and doubtlessly. And in a novel that creates such a real portrait of war and moral ambiguity; complexity in loyalty, politics, allegiance, nationality, and idealism, to offer the reader such an ordinary, pop-song rendition of love nearly justifies skipping every section where one sees the words \\"little rabbit.\\"Hemingway attempts to integrate language into the story by employing the occasional Spanish word along with an antiquated sort of English, full of thou and thee. This is supposed to simulate Catalan. But it does not work. It just makes characters that talk funny.But of course, it is after all Hemingway. And everybody should read it."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"\\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" has long been my favorite Ernest Hemingway novel. A compelling action adventure, this is a tale filled with mystery and suspense, peopled by a cast of extraordinarily vivid characters. It is also the author's finest, and most emotional love story. Although his use of language seems simple, it is deceptively so. Hemingway deals effectively with broad themes here - love, loyalty, trust, courage and honor are some. And of course, \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls,\\" set against the brutal violence of the Spanish Civil War, is probably the definitive work of fiction about this pivotal period in European, and world history.Generalissimo Francisco Franco's fascist troops invaded Spain in July 1936 in order to overthrow the newly established Republic headed by the Popular Front, (composed of liberal democrats, socialists, anarchists, trade unionists, communists and secularists. (If I have left anyone out, I am sorry - this was a truly complex and unique political situation.)The country was basically divided into Red Spain - the Republicans, and Black Spain, represented by the landed elite, committed to a feudal system and Franco's cause, Fascists, the urban bourgeoisie, the Roman Catholic Church, and other conservative sectors. The number of casualties is only an estimate, but suggests that between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people were killed. Many of these deaths, however, were not the results of military battles, but the outcome of brutal mass executions perpetrated by both sides.During the war in Spain, 2,800 American volunteers took up arms to defend the Republican cause against Franco, who was aided by Hitler and Mussolini. Those who fought with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, from 1937 through 1938, believed the defense of the Republic represented the last hope of stopping the spread of international fascism. These Americans fought alongside approximately 35,000 anti-fascists from fifty-two countries. Most of the volunteers were not political, but idealists who were determined to \\"make Madrid the tomb of fascism.\\" Hemingway's protagonist Robert Jordan, an American professor of Spanish from Missoula, Montana, was one such volunteer.Robert Jordan, an explosives expert, has been ordered to make contact with a small band of partisan fighters in the Guadarrama Mountains of fascist controlled southern Spain. His mission, of critical importance, is to blow up a bridge, at a specific time, to facilitate a simultaneous Republican attack on the city of Segovia. Most of the novel deals with Jordan's relationships with members of the guerilla fighters, including the girl Maria with whom he falls in love. Jordan is described as, \\"a young American of slight political development, but a great way with the Spaniards and a fine 'partizan' record.\\" Neither a Communist nor a Marxist, he is anti-fascist. As is the case with most foreign fighters, he is under Communist discipline/direction, because, in the conduct of the war, they eventually run the \\"show\\" and provide the most effective opposition.Pablo is ostensibly the band's military leader. He has become disillusioned with the fight, cynical and bitter. He is no longer willing to die for any cause. A smart man, but brutal, and cunning in a mean way, he is a complex character. He does have a conscience. Pablo spends much of his time in an alcoholic stupor. When Robert Jordon enters the picture, Pablo's level of animosity reaches new heights, and his comrades, along with Robert, are afraid he will sabotage the mission. He undergoes several changes during the 3 days and 3 nights in which the story takes place.Pilar is Pablo's woman, an extremely strong and savvy person, she is steeped in gypsy lore and superstition, and is probably the novel's most colorful character. She is a fine warrior who can be counted upon to cover one's back in battle. Pilar possesses a big heart. She has cared for Maria and brought the girl back to health. When Robert Jordon joins them, Pilar takes the leadership position over from Pablo, whom she no longer trusts, but still loves. She commands the allegiance of the guerrilla fighters and organizes them into a temporary alliance with \\"El Sordo,\\" another exceptional character. She is the force behind many of the novel's events - stimulating movement, motivating or manipulating people to take action - but for good purpose. Pilar, relates various war stories, and anecdotes, which reflect the cruelty and inhumanity of civil war.Mar&iacute;a's life was shattered by the outbreak of the war. Her father, the mayor, along with her mother, and many of the local citizenry were shot before her eyes by the invading Fascists. Since her mother was not a Republican, but a devout Catholic, she shouted, \\"Viva my husband, the town's mayor,\\" before she died, rather than the more typical, \\"Viva La Republica!\\" Maria was then taken away and brutalized, physically and emotionally, by Franco's soldiers. When the guerilla band blew up the train on which Maria was a prisoner, they carried the dazed and broken girl to their mountain hideaway.A thrilling subplot is developed when Andr&eacute;s, a guerilla, must take an urgent message across the lines to a Republican general. Roberto's entire mission, and much more importantly, the offensive, depends upon the successful and timely delivery of the dispatch. Another important character is old Anselmo, for whom Robert develops a strong attachment.A major portion of the novel is told through the thoughts of Robert Jordan, with flashbacks to meetings with Russians in Madrid, and some reflections on his father and grandfather. Jordon's inner monologues fascinate and clearly demonstrate Hemingway's skill with language and character development. Jordan, at one point comments to himself, that he is his own best companion. Because of his wartime responsibilities, he cannot allow himself to be overcome by emotion, which he considers a luxury. Whenever he feels anger, deep love, disappointment, foreboding, fear, anything that will distract him from his purpose, he talks himself down and refocuses. In such a relatively brief period, he begins to love life as never before, because of his feelings for Maria. Even here, however, he accepts that if anything happens to him, he is fortunate to have experienced a lifetime in three and a half days.Again, I cannot write enough in praise of Hemingway's use of language. It is sparse, direct, and extremely beautiful in its descriptiveness. He translated the Spanish intimate \\"tu\\" form into English. I speak Spanish, and although this may seem a bit awkward initially, it gives a much more accurate feel for the local idiom and the dialogue between Maria and Roberto, (as he is called), and between Roberto and the partisans.This is not only an extraordinary novel, but is one of the most important in American fiction. Hemingway worked as a correspondent in Spain during the Civil War, as a reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA). He raised money for the Republicans in their struggle against the Nationalists under General Francisco Franco.JANA"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"It's difficult to point at one work of a writer like Ernest Hemingway and claim it to be the best, but that is the claim that I would make for \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\"This is a story that captures both the true spirit and the doubtful minds of war. It portrays both courage and cowardice, in the beautifully descriptive words that Hemingway was known for. His main character Robert Jordan is an American college instructor who leaves his job to take part in the Spanish Revolution, with a strong conviction in his heart and truly believing that he can make a difference. The story encompasses a time frame of slightly less than three days, during which he plots to blow a strategic bridge at precisely the right time. In those three days he falls in love with a young Spanish girl in the encampment where he is awaiting that moment and is involved in a character conflict with one of the guerrilla fighters by the name of Pablo.This is a well paced story and never boring, with action suspense and romance, all coming together in a setting where you can feel the cold and smell the forest in the way that only Hemingway can describe it. A splendid and beautifully told story that I would recommend to anyone of any age or gender. For that reason I would place \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" at the top of the heap among all of his works.In my opinion this great story is the pinnacle of Hemingway's talent. A must read for anyone interested in great literature."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This novel is considered by most to be one of the great novels of the 20th Century, and its author to be one of the greatest authors of all time; there are undoubtedly reasons for this. Yet, Hemmingway is also considered to be a &quot;love him&quot; or &quot;hate him&quot; type. I tend toward the former, though he isn't one of my personal favorites.The plot of this novel is relatively straightforward. American Robert Jordan, a member of the International Brigades fighting with the Republicans against the Fascists during the Spanish Civil War, is given the task of blowing up a bridge to prevent the Fascists from bringing up reinforcements to repel a Republican offensive. But while the plot is uncomplicated, the depth and breadth of Hemmingway's story telling are not. There are layers and layers of emotion, passion, and personal pain. You are transported to the mountains of Spain with Jordan and a band of Spanish guerilla fighters. The characters are so incredibly real, that you feel as though you could find their names in a history book. For those who have never read Hemmingway, I'd say give it a try."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"It cracks me up how Hemingway refuses to write swear words and the word &quot;obscenity&quot; becomes a verb, ie. We are obscenitied!The obvious Spanish syntax is interesting as well and I imagine that those not fluent in Spanish would find the English both twisted and awkward at times.(example, Hemingway writes, &quot;For a favor, do this!, which seems a direct translation of &quot;Por favor&quot;.Another example is &quot;How many years to you have?&quot; (Cu&aacute;ntos a&ntilde;os tienes) instead of the proper English &quot;How old are you?&quot;. It's as if Hemingway wrote the dialogue in Spanish and then translated it word for word into English. I'm not sure if this is genious or annoying.Regardless of this goofy English, the novel is a good read and I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS takes place in the space of three days, and Hemingway narrates nearly every moment in 471 pages. When reading large sections in one sitting, I really felt the weight of the experience settle on me. The novel also begins to feel increasingly existentialist as the absurdity of the structures of war and death play out for the characters involved. During &quot;marathon&quot; reading sessions on three different days, I came to see this as a literary, &quot;real time&quot; adventure, as Hemingway details almost every moment in the characters' lives.The novel starts out with the protagonist, Robert Jordan, lying on the forest floor. Jordan, an American, is in Spain fighting on the side of the Republicans in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. Jordan is apparently a &quot;code hero,&quot; a protagonist of Hemingway's who lives according to a code of behavior. He is a Spanish teacher from Montana who loves Spain, and is fighting, carrying out explosives missions, against the Fascists, who have a vast war machine.At the beginning of the novel, Robert Jordan is teamed up with a band of guerrilla fighters in the mountains near a bridge he must blow as part of a Republican offensive. Anselmo, an old man who knows the land well, helps Jordan scout the bridge. Other members of the band include Pablo, a formerly great fighter, we are told, who has now &quot;gone bad.&quot; He cares primarily for his horses. His &quot;woman&quot; Pilar is a leader of the band, and she narrates on the first full day that Jordan is with them how the Republicans rose up against the Fascists in her town. The story is brutal and demonstrates the atrocities committed by the Republicans in the war as they bludgeon the town's Fascists to save bullets. Others in the group include Agustin, Eladio, Andres, Fernando and Rafael, a Gypsy. And Maria. Maria is a young woman who was the victim of atrocities in her town. She was rescued by this band of Republicans and now lives with them in the mountains. She is the &quot;love interest.&quot;I love Hemingway's voice, and this novel continues to demonstrate his ability, with that spare, journalistic style, to narrate loneliness like no one else. The seemingly simplistic style evokes a real pathos, and is especially suited to writing of war and the human spiritual conflicts such situations impose upon its participants. The reader is explosed to the morality issues of war, how characters feel about killing, what is its necessity, when is it moral, when is it wrong, etc.The story becomes existential, very Kafkaesque, as well, when one character's interactions with command are relayed by Hemingway. I laughed allowed at the absudities, but was struck by the dire consequences of these ridiculous desicions and actions. These situations show the war machine's indifference to individual human life and the ridiculous scenarios that arise from various leaders' individual conceits and worries.I think that the book's time frame of only three days makes a strong point about war and the people one serves with. For the reader, the band in the mountains are basically the only people Robert Jordan knows (though there are brief flashbacks). One can see how those who fight together can bond so deeply in a short period of time, as practically every moment is laden with portent and their fate as a group turns on such small things as an evening snowfall.I unequivocally recommend this book."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"It is not by mere circumstance that a novel is considered a classic. It takes years and years of the work standing up to critique, criticism, public response, and the test of time. The latter is perhaps the greatest of example of why Ernest Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls is labeled among the great works of the twentieth century. This novel's moving and intense story has not lost meaning over the years of its existence. The romance and adventure appeals to fans of many different genres, but to call this book a war narrative is missing the scope and depth of the work by a long shot. Hemingway, as he does in many of his books, brings into view some of the most basic questions and sought-after answers that have always been at the heart of the nature of man. Hemingway explores the very simple yet profound principles of death and honor in this work, and his conclusions are by no means simple reflections.While only occurring over the course of several days, the events that take place in For Whom the Bell Tolls, along with the superb style of writing, draw the reader into the world of Robert Jordan, the book's protagonist, while he attempts to destroy a fascist-controlled bridge, and along the way discovers humanity, love, and himself. This is possibly Hemingway's greatest feat in the novel: the creation of a connection between oneself and humanity; that we all share a responsibility with each other and that our honor lies in the hands of our neighbors.As a fairly long book, For Whom the Bell Tolls is by no means a story for inexperienced or pedestrian readers, and even an older audience might find the plot tedious at some points. However, there is ample swashbuckling to satiate the thirst for adventure of any war genre fan, and plenty of romance to keep a reader of softer disposition happy. The journey is well worth the effort, and I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of great literature."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is one of the greatest modernist novels to deal with the subject of war. Set during the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, this novel explores war as it really is, not as what it is glorified or vilified to be according to the whims of a journalist or novelist. There is very little of the actual war in the foreground of the plot--the entire novel spans only about four days--but the relationships of the characters and their interaction with one another allows the reader to see what war is like from the viewpoint of those who participate in it. Like Crane's The Red Badge of Courage, this book deals with the psychological and human ramifications of war.The hero is Robert Jordan, an American idealist fighting in Spain on the side of the \`Republic,' or Communist, party. Opposite the \`Reds' are the so-called fascists. At the beginning, Jordan has an unflinching and unwavering duty to the cause, but the people he meets and a girl he falls in love with alter somewhat his outlook. The bulk of the novel deals with Jordan's own philosophy, but also with the philosophy of the band of guerillas he is assigned to complete a mission with. Through his love for the girl, Maria, and his interaction with the scheming rebel leader Pablo and his wife Pilar, Jordan learns much about life and war.The plot moves quickly enough, and all leads up to the final climactic battle at the bridge. This is perhaps Hemingway's finest moment, and his treatment of the battle and fate of the group is nothing short of masterful. The quote from John Donne \\"never send to know for whom the bell tolls\\" looms ominously throughout the novel, and the battle of the bridge and the final, chilling moment of truth for Robert Jordan drives home the harrowing fact that is the reality of war: \\"it tolls for thee.\\""},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Perhaps the bell tolled for Ernest and his bid for literary greatness with the passing of this book. Did Hemingway exhaust all his courage, strength, and virility in this work?FWTBT is leagues away from The Sun Also Rises, taking themes from A Farewell to Arms to another level. To the extent that Hemingway wanted to reach the apex of truth in storytelling, and to find a suitable language to express it, this book is a great achievement. Hemingway chooses Spanish modulation of English words to power his narrative - from the start, the reader senses the honor, strength, and spirit every sentence spoken carries with it.Ernest is not just translating from Spanish to wow us; the reader feels that when he wrote this book, Spanish was the only language that could express his happiness, his sadness, his pleasure and suffering. Maybe Spanish contained the words and meanings Hemingway and those involved in the war for Spanish liberty sought desperately every night by the campfire - words of fear and love.To me, this book was Hemingway's most significant attempt at articulating his life philosophy. It is ominous in the hero's struggles with his personal and family history - of duty, resignation and death, inability to hope or believe, or believe that happiness can last. You might argue that El Sordo's last stand is followed by Hemingway's personal literary last stand - against fascism, fear, and life's various illusions. This is Hemingway's last battle. Thereafter, he is honorably discharged to a life of fishing and beautiful memoirs."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Robert Jordan is one of the most exciting, interesting and principled fictional characters I've ever had the pleasure to read about. Set during the fascist take over in 1930s Spain, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a novel that will easily stand the test of time (not much of a prediction since it was written in 1940) and is one of the finest books in the English language. Jordan, an American, is the main character who comes to Europe to fight the good fight against Franco's military thugs. The reader is given a fascinating in-depth look into his psyche, where he reflects on his fellow soldiers, plans for warmaking and the justifications and rationalizations along the war trail.Pablo's another character who is burned into your consciousness long after you've finished reading. A fellow rebel (they weren't rebels in the true sense, since they were fighting for a government they had duly elected; however, they have all the characteristics of guerrillas in that the Spanish military waged an immediate and violent war against that very democratically elected government), the reader is left wondering just how committed he is to the cause. There is an incredible flashback story detailing Pablo's orchestration of the sadistic torture and humiliation of a group of wealthy fascist sympathizers. The vivid description involved in this passage is nothing short of extraordinary.Of course the true democrats, fighting for the Republic against the well financed and better armed fascist military, eventually lose the war, but having that foreknowledge does nothing to detract from the cliff-hanger like feelings brought about by the various battles and journeys the rebel crew embarks on.This is the best, and most accessible of all of Hemingway's works. If someone is interested in reading Hemingway, For Whom the Bell Tolls is the perfect starting point. As for Hemingway's style of prose, what more can be said, except that it's brilliant, enthralling and readily accessible to the common reader, unlike Joyce and Faulkner. In my opinion, every American should give some time to Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls. Commitment, intelligence, sacrifice and fighting for the well being of your fellow man is all there along with a terrific love story. Given that the average American attention span is like a ferret on a double espresso (Dennis Miller), very few will give books like For Whom the Bell Tolls a try with the mass of pop TV garbage out there.An excellent companion to the book is the documentary film \\"The Good Fight\\" narrated by Studs Terkel. It gives a mini history lesson of the Spanish Civil War and specifically focuses on a group of U.S. citizens (the Abraham Lincoln Brigade) who heroically went abroad and fought along side the democrats against Franco and his fascist military thugs."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read. In it, Hemingway deeply explores the main character, Robert Jordan. The reader is able to get a thorough understanding of this remarkably realistic character. His philosophy is that war is horrible, but necessary at times. He does not wish to execute some orders, but knows that he must. He does not like his fate, but he accepts it. I quickly found myself caught in the strong plot, and enjoyed Hemingway's rich detail. The book is elegant and yet gruesome; there is a stark contrast between the love of Robert Jordan and Maria, and the atrocities of war. This book is excellent. It will make you feel a myriad of emotions and will keep you turning the pages. I strongly recommend this book to all who love Hemingway's novels, because it is simply his best work. Hemingway goes deeper into the characters and their nostalgic reminiscences than any other. For those of you who are not familiar with Hemingway's novels, I strongly recommend that you read this book and become familiar with an outstanding author."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Just about anything Hemingway ever wrote was pretty good and you really can't go wrong with him if you're looking for a good read. He is at his very best, though, in this one. It was written at the peak of his power and is rightly considered one of the great novels of the twentieth century.Like all great novels it gives you new insight as you reread it over the years. When a teenager, I recall being enthralled by the love story and the pure adventure of it. As a young adult, it was the tragicomic nature of the characters which was so engrossing. Later on as an adult, I was struck by Hemingway's view of the bleak, futile nature of human endeavor. This time around it was the political discourse I found to be thought-provoking; sections of the novel that in the past I had pretty much glossed through.A lot of the talk--from all of the characters--was that in order to make change, it was necessary to kill those who stood in the way of it. Each of them to varying degrees agreed with this. And it struck me that this was the prevailing worldwide philosophy of the time. Hitler and Stalin, of course, were the extreme examples, but this kind of thinking was prevalent here as well. There was an awful lot of sympathy in the good ole U. S. for what the Soviet Union was trying to accomplish, and although we never got to the point in this country where people were getting killed, FDR wielded his power like it was his personal possession. The point, I think, is that there is always someone in the world who is absolutely sure they know what's best for you. When someone like this gets in power, watch out.In any event, Hemingway is pretty even-handed about it and this commentary is actually only a small part of the novel. The story, as everybody knows, is about American Robert Jordan, who is sent by his communist masters during the Spanish Civil War to the mountains in order to blow up a bridge. There he is assisted by the guerrilla band led by Pilar and Pablo, which is comprised of the most memorable set of characters you will ever meet in literature.There is old Anselmo, perhaps the noblest of them all, dedicated and faithful to the cause, who agonizes over those he must kill and prays that he will be forgiven. There is Rafael the gipsy, incapable of staying at his post as he delightedly snares a couple of plump rabbits. There is the stolid and dull Fernando, oblivious to wit or double-entendre. There is the fierce Augustin, utterly committed to the cause.And then there is Maria, the nineteen-year old refugee--with deep, horrible secrets--and with whom Roberto falls hopelessly in love. It is the kind of love affair that is utterly captivating to the reader and the kind of thing that only great authors are able to pull off. Robert is drawn to her coltish, long-legged grace; her cropped, red hair; her brown, swarthy skin. Hemingway spends a lot of time on Robert's thoughts about her, and a lot of time with the two of them together. Their spoken endearments to one another--often playful, sometimes silly, occasionally solemn--could have easily slipped into the realm of the ridiculous, but never does under the sure hand of the great Hemingway. It is instead extremely moving and it should be mentioned that this is extremely risky to pull off.And Pablo. Once the fiercest of the Republicans, he is now well-fed and content in his mountain hideaway, has a dozen or so horses that make him rich, and knows that the actions contemplated by Roberto will bring an end to his safety. He is a schemer, Pablo, a clever, ruthless wretch, and many of the plot twists stem from his machinations.And finally, Pilar; the spectacular, magnificent Pilar; Pablo's wife. Her character is justifiably recognized for her description of the smell of death, and her description of the day that the loyalists drove the fascists out of her town--by forcing them to jump to their deaths, one at a time, over a cliff--but to me it is the smaller things that make her such an unforgettable character. She is bitter when the young man turns away from her when he is asked to kiss her, understanding that she has never been beautiful, and knowing now that she is, to him, repulsive. She describes in memorable detail her love affair with a matador in Valencia, and how she drank cold beer with the sweat dripping off the glass while he napped in the room behind her. She is coarse and often crude, but never cruel; she is hard as stone, but as deeply compassionate as anyone. She is a gipsy and a saint and the greatest creation of Hemingway's career.There is much more to talk about. The style of course, is all Hemingway, typically descriptive and insightful. But this novel is much richer. For once, with his excellent use of interior monologue--a practice he had been experimenting with for years--we finally get to know his characters in depth, rather then just viewing them from the outside like they are on a movie screen.Typically, his use of language is direct and to the point, but again, he is at his best in this one, so much so that he occasionally treads into the realm of the delightful. For example, by design or by necessity, Hemingway did not use obscene words in the novel. His creativity, though, in expressing the vulgar is nothing less than a thrill. Here are the first words out of Pilar's mouth, early on, as she castigates the gipsy: \\"What are you doing now, you lazy drunken obscene unsayable son of an unnamable unmarried gipsy obscenity? What are you doing?\\" Absolutely hilarious, and there is no way this could have been done better using any kind of vocabulary.Plot, characters, theme, everything. One of the greatest at his best. A novel not to be missed."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is the second Hemingway book I've read, the first being Farewell to Arms. This book is about 200 pages too long. There are some wonderful bits washed out by blinding repetitiveness. Over and over again Robert Jordan talks in circles around his head, Pilar nags and curses, Maria and Robert compete to see who can proclaim their love the best. Say it right once, clear, simple and powerful. Do not say it a thousand times so your words are an echo of an echo of an echo."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Very good, thought provoking piece of literature. I do not think I can say much to add to what has been said about the content. However, I would point out that I really like the Scribner Classics edition that I purchased. They are well-bound with tight pages and clear print. The dust jackets are a matte finish instead of glossy, and they look very good on the shelf. If you enjoy the feel of a real book in your hand and the clean look of a collection on the shelf, you'll appreciate the Scribner Classics."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I was expecting to loathe this book. It was nothing like I expected.Yes, For Whom the Bell Tolls is about war. There are all the horrors of war in this book. But nothing was extraneous, gratuitous, undeserved.

It is a great book."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemmingway is amazing, completly captivating the reader with his beutifuly descriptive sentences. My all time favorite book"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I first read this book a couple of years ago, and it developed, for me, a love of reading. In this book, Hemingway combines everything which makes him a great writer: a powerful story, wonderfully developed characters, and twists, which you don't expect. I recently reread this book and found it to be better than the first time I read it. I can honestly say it is one of the top books I've ever read, and definitely the best Hemingway novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway relates his experiences as a journalist during the Spanish Civil War in the form of a novel that is his own inner wish of life as he wished he knew it. The story is of an American scholar/warrior, working behind enemy lines (it's hard from the present to understand that the Stanlists were &quot;good&quot; and the fascists &quot;bad&quot;, both turned out to be evil, rotten at the core in the end) with a Spanish guerilla band. Many noble, brave acts are performed - even falling in love, having sex is a noble act, as Papa writes it into the plot - the hero dies valiantly, the true heir of an American Civil War hero. Why, in Hemingway's hands, this is regarded as first-rate literature (the stuff of a Nobel laureate?), while in the hands of someone such as a Graham Greene or John LeCarre, it would be regarded as merely well done escapism, is beyond me. There is the usual nonsense on the false, macho bravado of bullfighting and other Hemingway stereotypes appear at intervals. There is certainly enough of the Hemingway literary power to carry the reader through to the end, but in the end I was left convinced that Papa should have stuck to short stories - where he left his lasting mark. As usual, Hemingway is a man trying too hard to prove that he is a man - never becoming one."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is Hemingway at his best. This story develops rather patiently, but every sentence is a jewel. The story itself could probably be a short, however Hemingway insists that we live through the fear, love, and pain step by step, day by day, hour by hour . . . and, of course, it works. The power and beauty of this story truly lays in the journey."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It is such a dense novel, telling the story of the Spanish Civil War from many geographic and political perspectives. The plot flows well and is an easy read for 500 pages. I found Pilar's story of the massacre of the fascists one of the more disturbing descriptions of mob violence -- as vivid as &quot;The Battle Royale&quot; from Ellision's &quot;Invisible Man.&quot; Only the hokey, sexually-charged descriptions of Maria prevent a five-star rating."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway brings the chaos and passions of twentieth century political war vividly to life in this epic.

And I hope you love it half as much as I do."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"A brilliant display of Hemingway's ability to write in a terse, concise and brutal prose. A love story inside the guerrilla warfare against Franco's fascists in the Spanish Civil War. A gospel of the courage, integrity, and sacrifice of an American demolition expert in the International Brigades. 72 hours of emotions, life and death decisions, and fate in an insignificant battle in the Spanish Sierra in &quot;the last hope of stopping the spread of international fascism&quot;. I cannot decide whether this or &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is the best novel I have read. The paragon of what a novel should be!"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I find many people that review this book critically begin by slighting the broken spanish Hemmingway uses so expertly. Mostly those who speak the language who wish to flex their bilingual muscle. However, as with anyone who has read much--if any--Hemmingway, you have to realize that everything is done for a reason. It's all about point of view. He's painting the picture. He wants you to see it the way it is portrayed, no matter his reasons. People who have problems with his techniques have a problem with the author. Similarly, many people describe the relationship discourse (as it were) to be manufactured or absent any real genuine human emotion. Again, that would be called typical Hemmingway. As he has been known to be quite cynical and distrustful of women; some women even think of him as a misogynist. This distrust is what is portrayed in the novel, very well I might add. Basically, either you love Hemmingway, you don't, or you don't get it at all. And if you are the latter, sit down and shut up, because he's here to stay. This book was incredibly well written and it should be among the greatest works of the century."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"The author's style is strong and detailed, but with so little happening over so many pages, I found myself becoming impatient with the story. Perhaps just a sign of the times and my own personal taste, I put the book down after reading only half of it. In reflection, the characters, the settings and the building of the story line are all quite beautiful as a whole, but the pace was just too stretched out for me to endure. Perhaps I'll pick it up again sometime."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway's magnificent novel has something for everyone: an action tale, an anti-war protest, a love story, subtle ironies, a magnificent short story within the novel, political criticism of communism and fascism, a philosophy of life, and beautiful descriptions of life that leave you gasping. You will learn a lot about yourself by considering which elements you notice most strongly. Reading For Whom the Bell Tolls is like holding up a mirror to your soul.On the surface this is a book about 3 days and nights of war. But with the action packed into that time and extensive use of flashbacks, it becomes a tapestry of all humankind. After you start to notice the individual threads in the tapestry, be sure to step back and see the whole. For the remarkably balanced and connected artistry of the themes and directions in the story is what makes this book great.If you are disturbed by descriptions of violence, brutality, and inhumanity, you will not enjoy this book.Robert Jordan is an American who has joined the republican side of the Spanish civil war. In normal life, he teaches Spanish. Now, he is transformed into a demolitions expert who can blow up trains and bridges. With an offensive coming, he moves behind the fascist lines to join a guerilla group to blow a key bridge during an offensive that begins in 3 days. The rest of the story covers the action of preparing for and attacking the bridge. Along the way, you will become acquainted with the characters in the guerilla band as well as Jordan. Jordan will find himself moved in many ways to become more alive and fully connected than he has ever been before. He will experience the full range of human emotion and life within these 3 days.If you don't know about the Spanish Civil War, you should be aware that it was the main warm-up for World War II. The fascists under Franco were supported by Hitler and Mussolini. Hitler wanted to try out his new weapons and fine-tune tactical theory before attacking the rest of Europe. Communists from around the world flocked to the republic, as did pro-democracy volunteers. The republican forces had great popular support but had little war materiel and fought a losing campaign that created great anguish in the international community.Civil wars are one of the worst forms of human conflict. Because the people are so much alike, they tend to behave with greater savagery towards one another. With modern weapons of mass destruction, the effects can be awful beginning with the American Civil War. Hemingway does a great job of showing the essential sameness of the forces on both sides in human terms, and takes away the meaning of their causes to show the greater importance of their humanity. The book reminds me in this aspect very much of All Quiet on the Western Front, the great ant-iwar novel about trench warfare in World War I.As is usual with Hemingway, the writing is spare, effective, and graceful. Stylists will be delighted!Why should you read this book today? You will probably not fight in a civil war. Or will you? For in fact, humans are as divided in their competitions as ever. They just normally don't involve bloodshed. There is great glory in the conflict, but even greater potential in their cooperation. Ask yourself about where you compete now and what could be accomplished if you focused on constructive cooperation instead. Think about this concerning your family, your love, your work, your hobbies, and your volunteer activities. Like the quote above, wherever there is one of us the other is present. If you start to represent each other's interests and connect with one another, the sum of mankind is greater and so is each person. You will also love life more!"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is a tough book to write about. How many ways are there to say \\"brilliant\\"? This was a re-read for me of a war story and love story. The book far surpasses both. It was the first to describe war as it really is: with flawed heroes, horrible treatment of the civilian population by both sides, guerrillas who are both cruel and afraid, madmen in commanding positions, etc. It also tells about the Spanish Civil War, so for people are unaware that there actually was such a war, it is an eye-opener on the prelude to WWII.

You just lost a friend."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I wanted to re-visit the work that established Hemingway's reputation, dated though it obviously is. Certainly his unique use of the English language and dialog as narrative still astounds. It's also a thoroughly good read, if a little sentimental by today's standards (whatever they are). He was that most entertaining of writers - a great story teller, telling stories of what he knew ( write about what you know, and not before you know it, was always his advice to anyone wanting to write).I can't give it 5 stars, so much that is good has happened to the novel since then, but of its time, it is timeless."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom the Bell Tolls is a Hemingway less affected by his modernist tendencies than To Have and Have Not yet not as uninfluenced as The Old Man and the Sea. Also, there is a good deal of sexual discussion and activity, though all of it is done in an explicit-yet-entirely-implied manner exclusive to Hemingway's style. This story of the American professor who joins the Spanish Communists in their fight against the fascists explores love, morality, Communism, duty, awareness of death, and bravery in the face of death. Specifically, impending doom expedites and deepens the life and love of the characters. A good first read but not necessarily worth a return."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is another book you must read before you die if you have such a list in the making.

The main character (Robert Jordan) goes from being an unemotional advocate of war to hating it, hating the loss of life that springs from it. His lack of caring for life, caring for anything, is whirled around and manifested into a zest for life when Maria enters his world.

Every word has a meaning. The story in itself is excellent, although Robert and Maria's romance is sometimes somewhat unrealistic. This book is a great examination of self doubt and belief. This book shows us that we must believe in ourselves and believe in others to survive. It is not about faith in god, but about faith in man, which I think is a wonderful thing.

The fortuitous nature of existence, or the unbiased treatment of fate, or the luring equivocation of individuality? In the pitifully short three days, no, better be accurate, two and a half days during a crucial advance for the republic forces in Spain, Hemingway leads us toward the bullpen, behind which hid a chimera that is to hunt us all our lives with the echo of Donne's famed line.Hemingway draws every little details together as a pounding fist-beating recursive chimes into the readers' ears. And with the slower, more passionate journey into Jordan's memory and future in a way, we become enthralled as well to the question of choice. How will he choose? Jordan, a formal Spanish professor in the University of Montana, chooses to foresake the capitalist luxury of America and pursues the life as a republic dynamiter in Spain.There is no question of individuality, only a question of choice, a choice between masses and not identities. All this remains intact until Robert's own vision is no longer able to see between simple black and white in the Spanish mountains where he prepares to blow up a bridge during a republic offensive. His comrades are not all communists, nor are his enemies all fascists; these men die not for an ideal, but for an idea. And as he grows to love the rough Spaniards around him: shrewd yet cowardly Pablo, thoughtful hunter Ansemlo, strong and foreseeing Pilar, and most of all, a young woman ravaged many times by fascist soldiers, Jordan starts to doubt the path he chooses. And between life and death, ideal and reality, he waivers.Pablo is a sharp thread that seams between characters and draws Jordan on with questions; he appears cowardly despite his heroic records as a guerilla leader, and his own dawdling conviction towards the idea of republic pricks Jordan's own sense of duty. Especially with more and more emotional involvement (dependency) on Maria's love, Jordan is wondering whether enough killing is enough killing for a vague concept. Pablo's seemingly growing discontent, as a part of a mass, is complemented by his woman Pilar's undying strength. She reads palms and smells death, and it is through her strong faith in the union of freedom seekers that the guerrilla group stays together. But exactly \\"for whom\\" the bell tolls? For the Spaniards who shed blood among themselves with visible strings from Moscow? Yes, warfare befalls all, no one is missed by the silent blow although some can smell its scent and others shun its path. A dangerous sadness identifies Pablo while an optimistic cheerfulness characterizes Pilar, why are they essentially the same \\"lot\\" then? Because Hemingway shows us, through the interaction of specter of differences, a single vibration enlivens every frequency on the scale. Robert Jordan is a mere node not knowing which direction to lean towards, especially as he is starting to doubt the vibration.America hasn't had her share of good wars, but what happens in one war is reflected in the next, or isn't it? If one strong man's mentality comes tumbling down because the buttress isn't strong enough, why shouldn't the next one fumble as well? It tolls for thee, and there are a million \\"thee\\" out there blindly believing they are the only \\"thee\\". They hear the same ringing, although each believes he is able to distinguish a unique frequency; and they die, their deaths as mere statistics. Thus it is actually an oxymoron Hemingway presents through Robert Jordan's developing anxieties; he feels \\"tricked\\" into believing the impact he himself can make in the war, as a part of a hovering mass, instead, he recovers pieces of individuality when he is physically and emotionally removed from the same mass. So at the beginning, he lays on one stretch of pine forest floor and hears this bell chime calling him to begin, he joins the guerilla band; at the end, he is wounded and is left behind to lay on the same stretch of pine forest floor, and he hears this bell chime calling him to end. The integration and disintegration mark his journey from blindness to sight.Two and a half days, who ever lives out their entire existence in such a short period? Jordan does, and he sees so far into the pattern of living that he does regret the ultimate choice he makes, not as a soldier, or a leftist, but as a man redeemed through the moral bath of contemplation."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway wrote many good things, but this isn't one of them. The title refers to a poem by John Donne, in which the poet seems to suggest that the tribulations of any humans are the business of others as well. Hemingway has applied this notion to the Spanish Civil War, of which he was a first-hand witness. The plight of the Spaniards here should be the concern of all of us. The problem is, his point is clearly made by the title, and the rest of the book does nothing to improve upon it. This long tome about rebels trying to blow up a bridge ends poorly; the characters don't arouse too much sympathy, and the whole thing goes nowhere, except where the fine title has already taken it."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I found this book, which takes place during the Spanish Civil War, interesting in its descriptions and although it is excruciatingly slow in its development (five hundred pages detailing three days worth of events), somewhat compelling in its own way.And yet in the end, \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is ultimately a novel with a fatalistic outlook and few, if any, redeeming messages for humanity, in spite of all the commentaries it makes about human nature. To me, the story was the most interesting as a reflection of Hemingway's own experiences and strange outlooks on life.For example, one would assume that Robert Jordan, the main character, is a reflection of what Hemingway deems heroic. Like Hemingway, Jordan is a rugged, somewhat independent sort. Jordan characterizes the literary period's allure for the expatriate life and Hemingway's fascination with Spain and dislike for the Spanish Fascist. But yet, one has to wonder what compels Jordan, an American college professor from Montana, to be involved in this Spanish Civil War to the extent that he has become a demolitions expert and is ready to kill Spaniards (regardless of what side they happen to have fallen upon) without any conscience. What busness, really and truly, is this war of his?Further, how do you root for a hero, who is fighting for, and willing to give his life while following orders from, Communists that Hemingway makes clear are every bit as brutal as the Fascists?Notable is the fact that the Jordan character feels shame for a father who committed suicide, just as Hemingway's own father did. And for Hemingway to commit suicide 20 years after this book was written parallels the sense of inevitable doom that is a pervasive theme of this story.This book demonstrates that Hemingway had a way with descriptions and dialogue that can be at times entertaining and at other times irritating. For example, his conventions for speech that is a more literal reflection of the Spanish language is rather clever. However, as the story progresses, Hemingway's usage of the King James-style \\"Thee\\" and \\"Thou\\" to indicate that a more formal Spanish dialect is being used becomes distractingly gimmicky and wore quite thin by the end of the book. At least, it did for me.This is a story about people who are flawed to the extent that they will kill without hesitation...people who have abandoned God and Godly virtues, and look to themselves for their own salvation. What little is left is a cause whose means and ends don't seem to differ from the alternative, and an appeal to virtues of loyalty to the band, or one's responsibility to follow his duty. The trouble is, these appeals are made among characters who Jordan - as Hemingway's voice - often considers untrustworthy, repugnant and treacherous. Rather contradictory, I would say. And Jordan's fatalistic sense of duty to a cause of questionable politics and in a country that isn't even his own is just plain strange to say the least.Interesting as character study, and a microcosm of the Spanish Civil War, but very depressing."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Please don't dismiss me as one of those idiots who can't spell and says a book is &quot;boring&quot; because it's long and they'd rather be listening to heavy metal music. I read &quot;Moby Dick&quot; and did not find it boring. I read &quot;Bleak House&quot; and did not find it boring. I read &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; and did not find it boring. But &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; is, well, boring. Here's why: I never gave a damn for this Hemingway hero Robert Jordan. He seems like a pretty aimless tough guy, making love every fifth chapter and cussing around trying to be cool. The ending was entirely unsatisfactory - we end up having gone just about nowhere. Fortunately, Pilar is an interesting character who adds some spice to the proceedings. The only real point to this novel seems to be conveyed by its fine title, a reference to a John Donne poem. Loosely, the poem conveyed the idea that whatever happens to any human being ought perhaps to be the business of all of us. In the case of the novel, Hemingway draws attention to the largely overlooked Spanish Civil War and its suffering. But he does so with the title page alone; the rest of these 400 pages add little to this noble premise. Hemingway needs a better plot to devote his fine style to."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I entered this book thinking highly of Hemingway, having read some of the Nick Adams stories as well as The Old Man and the Sea. But Bell is quite a disappointment. The 1930s-era characters seem to be speaking an off-putting and unwieldy gringo Shakespeare (\\"Thou hast crossed the arroyo, Ingles\\"). Moreover, the revolving themes of duty and honor and the instrument of war / administration vs. the individuals who carry out the specific deeds don't seem to develop. Rather, the reader is subject to endless conversations with rather boring people, then Robert Jordan muses in an unenlightening manner upon the conversations he's had. About 1/3 of the way through the book I was thinking \\"just blow the damn bridge up, make love to Maria, and go home.\\" Having skimmed the Cliffs Notes, apparently it takes a few hundred more pages for that to happen; pages I am unwilling to read."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I have 2 degrees in English Lit and this is my all-time favorite book.

Really slow. I'm also with those who are annoyed by the constant use of Robert Jordan's full name. He's the only \\"Robert\\" or \\"Jordan\\" in the book, so why can't Hemingway just pick one and stick with it?An abridged version (taking out half of the flashbacks) would have kept up the pace of the story better, and at 300 pages or so this would have been a much more enjoyable read. I finished the whole thing (500 pages) in about 3 days, but I'll admit to skimming through many of the flashbacks (the obvious exception being Pilar's flashback about Pablo killing the Fascists).Overall - not great, but good enough to get through. Would love to see an abridged version."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I read this book a couple years ago and loved it.

AND MANY MORE"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"The book was not boring, but it was neither any fun to read. That's all"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I read the first 100 pages and the plot of blowing up a bridge was fine, although the plot is exceedingly slow. Hemingway does a good job with describing the details of the surroundings. The main character Robert Jordan will have an observation of another character that is insightful. Then the old guide Anselmo will have the same observation. Then the old woman Pilar would have the same observation. Then the guerrilla guard will have the same observation. Why is everyone talking about the exact same observation? It seems pretty bad writing and a poor understanding of human nature for everyone to be echoing Robert Jordan's thoughts.But that amaturish style wasn't what turned me off of the book. It was the horrible love story. I'm a woman in my 30s and maybe this kind of tripe would appeal to guys, but the love story was not only exceedingly unrealistic, but also stupid and insulting to women. I was curious how this horrible love story would end, so then I read the last 20 pages of the book. The ending of the love story was even worse than the beginning.This book was not only not insightful about human nature, it actually ran counter to human nature.I do like Hemingway's book \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\" That book is a simple story, but well done. I recommend that book over For Whom the Bell Tolls."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"According to the book's jacket, 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' is Hemingway's finest novel. I disagree. While the book does a fine job of describing the life of a partisan, its 490 pages only cover a few days' time. So, don't expect a lot of fast-moving action. This novel is basically a character study of the different persons in American volunteer Robert Jordan's hosting partisan band. Therefore, if you enjoy character studies then you will indeed enjoy this book.The plot is that Jordan is sent to blow up a bridge in the Spanish hinterland. He is to contact a local partisan band and secure their assistance in helping him destroy the bridge. Once he arrives at the band's secret refuge internal power struggles immediately begin as Jordan's mission will endanger the survival of all the band's members. In addition, there is the inevitable romantic subplot between Jordan and the mysterious Maria.Utilizing the flashback as a vehicle, Hemingway defines each actor's traumatic personal history, his/her decisions, and his character. Jordan the idealistic young American university professor becomes the daring, charismatic, and ideologically indifferent demolitions expert. Pablo the angry peasant becomes the murderous, avaricious guerilla leader. Pilar the ugly yet happy wife of a diminutive bullfighter is widowed and becomes the overbearing, honorable wife of Pablo. Maria the fragile, innocent virgin becomes the emotionally-scarred, vulnerable lover of Jordan. Anselmo the venerable old peasant becomes the determined, brave guerilla fighter. And so it goes with many of the other book's characters.The book is a good character study and portrait of life as a Spanish partisan, but I found it to be much too slow moving for my taste. This is decent novel, but it's not really a war novel. In my opinion, Farewell to Arms is a much better war novel and is Hemingways's best book."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This story is moderately good. Rather than weaving eloquent statements extolling the author, the plot, and the style as most reviewers do, I will simply state the pros and cons, perhaps in a tone that will be worthy of Hemingway himself.First, I have two major criticisms. I found the plot to be interesting, but unoriginal. Countless novels have been written about guerilla forces fighting behind enemy lines, and a substantial percentage of those books revolved around blowing up a bridge. Fine, it makes for suspenseful (no pun intended) reading. However, I would have thought that he could have come up with a better approach to a war story. Secondly, I found that the sex scenes detracted substantially from the story. While the romance between Robert Jordan and Maria was an integral part of the plot, the sexual content was wholly unnecessary and was at an extreme juxtaposition with my Christian values. I felt that the story would not have lost anything by eliminating those elements.I did, however, enjoy many things about this novel. Hemingway's style is always intriguing to me, and I love his clipped, terse tone. The Spanish words and phrases scattered liberally through the dialogue added a nice touch as well. More than that, though, I thoroughly enjoyed his social commentary on Spain, and the connections to the poem by John Dunne. Death is really the overriding theme of the book, and I found the philosophy of the interdependency of mankind even in death to be thought-provoking. Lastly, I always appreciate an author who is willing to write about overlooked periods or viewpoints in history. While I found his story to be fairly trite (guy goes with guerilla band to blow up bridge, falls in love with girl, and half of the people die), I loved the setting of the Spanish civil war. I've read very little about that era in history, and so I found it to be informative and inspired some interest in learning more about it."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I love Hemingway, but this book bored me to tears. I'll concede that I watched the movie first and knowing the ending took some of the fun out of it. Go read A Moveable Feast. You can always come back to this one later."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"\\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" was the first Hemingway I ever read. I was a high school kid in the early 2000's, working on my campus newspaper, newly graduated from Jack London but not yet ready for Jack Kerouac.To my young eyes, it was a good action story: Robert Jordan, the passionate American teacher joins a band of armed gypsies in the Spanish Civil War. He believes one man can make a difference. The whole novel covers just 68 hours, during which Jordan must find a way to blow up a key bridge behind enemy lines. In that short time, Jordan also falls in love with Maria, a beautiful Spanish woman who has been raped by enemy soldiers. The whole spectrum of literature was refracted through the prism of my youth: Good guys and bad guys, sex and blood, life and death. For me, just a boy, the journey from abstraction to clarity was only just beginning.Re-reading \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" at 18 (roughly the age Hemingway was when he published it), I have lost my ability to see things clearly in black and white. My vision is blurred by irony, as I note that two enemies, the moral killer Anselmo and the sympathetic fascist Lieutenant Berrendo, utter the very same prayer. For the first time, I see that the book opens with Robert Jordan lying on the \\"pine-needled floor of the forest\\" and closes as he feels his heart pounding against the \\"pine needle floor of the forest\\"; Jordan ends as he begins, perhaps having never really moved. I certainly could never have seen at 16 how dying well might be more consequential than living well. And somehow the light has changed in the past 1 years, so that I now truly understand how the earth can move."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is a great book if you are interested in the history of the Spanish Civil War. It is also useful if you are seeking insights into Hemingway. So much of the novel is taken directly from the author's experiences as a foreign correspondent in Spain for the North American Newspaper Alliance.There are many facets of the book which contribute to its outstanding reputation. Hemingway's treatment of Robert Jordan, the protagonist, is exceptional. Jordan is a very complicated man who is radically transformed by the events described in the book. He is also the first Hemingway hero to contemplate suicide.El Sordo is a leader of another guerilla band which is operating in the same territory as the band in which Jordan serves as an aide. The description of El Sordo's last stand on a hill against the Nationalists is an example of Hemingway's best writing."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Slowly slowly, little by little, the tensions between the characters of this novel build to reveal the incredible and hopeless predicament they find themselves in. I can empathise with those who do not like Hemingway, he is an acquired taste. But push on with this novel. It is far FAR better than the endlessly dull Farewell To Arms, the scene where the old woman recalls the way the Fascists were executed by the peasants is just electrifying, and haunts me to this day. Of all Hemingway books I've read, this is my favourite."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"i had to read 'for whom'for school, and being a female teenager i did not like this book. i found that the description was unnessecarily long and that a large portion of the book was Robert Jordan's thoughts which i found to be totally unrealistic and boring. the highlights of this book are the chivalry of El Sordo and the story told by Pilar about the brutality of the war. i found maria to be a shallow ditz. the characters are realistic but the plot is lacking and there was no character that i felt i could really relate with. but then again i'm not the biggest fan of hemmingway."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"There is no way to cover in 1000 words everything that this book has to offer. Centering around one man who must undertake one mission with the help of some guerillas in the Spanish Civil War, this book is in fact the deepest most complete work on war that has ever been written. Although, as I mentioned, the whole book is only about Robert Jordan blowing up a single bridge, the book widens in scope as it goes on allowing us to see the war from more and more angles, through more and more people, on both sides of the fight and of all rank and position. It drives homet the point that the title of the book suggests. Ask not for whom the bell tolls, the bell tolls for thee. This refers to the church bells that would be rung to announce a death and is part of a larger quote which begins familiarly enough, \\"No man is an island.\\" Simply put, there is no such thing as isolationism, there is no way to not consider yourself a part of the human race. When you hear of someone!'s death, there is no need to wonder whose death it is, for whomever it was, they were a part of you, and so their death is in a way your death. Their jouney was your journey. Thus this book does not allow us to leave any vantage point of this war and this battle unturned, and every character relates and reacts to every other character, every action has a reaction, for no man is an island, as this beautifully crafted book points out time and again."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For most readers the jury is back on Hemmingway; you love him or you hate him. For fans of Hemmingway's prose this novel is a true masterpiece, but even those who aren't particularly fond of Hemmingway's sparse style will find lots to like in For Whom The Bell Tolls.Wrapped in a brisk plot of pre-combat suspense and the ensuing battle Hemmingway has hidden the definitive anti-war novel. In the three days that we follow Robert Jordan's efforts for the Republic against the Fascists we watch him develop a love of incredible intensity with the girl Maria, then willingly throw everything away for a senseless fight between two equally irrational forces struggling for power in the eve of WWII.The most powerful account of brutality and inhumanity is not attributed to the Fascists, but is Pilar's tale of the early days of the revolution and atrocities carried out by the Republicans - the side for which Jordan is risking his life. Although moved by the tale and by Pilar's excellent account (indeed as most reviews comment this self-contained story of Pilar's is the strongest part of the novel) Jordan cannot veer from the path that has been set for him, both by his war hero grandfather and by his father; Jordan views his father as a coward because he died by suicide - a them which runs through the novel. Even his unexpected discovery of Maria and true love cannot deflect him from his course of self-destruction.As an anti-war novel For Whom The Bell Tolls is elegant and subtle. Hemmingway, in typical fashion, lionizes the warriors. The American Jordan and the guerilla leader El Sordo are depicted as noble men of principle. Even his treatment of the fascist lieutenant Berrendo is sympathetic. Hemmingway's commentary is an attack on the senselessness of war (or this particular war, anyway) but those who fight that war are largely treated as tragic figures.The characters are among the most complete that I've encountered in a novel. In that they're developed using Hemmingway's sparse style makes the feat all the more impressive. The novel perhaps is a bit long, and there are in my opinion some extraneous elements that could have been omitted, but the conclusion is a masterpiece. There are not many novels that have had as great an emotional effect on me. A must read."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I have just finished reading the Kindle edition of \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\" In this book, Hemingway speaks from the point of view of a third person omniscient narrator, that is, the narrator sees into the minds and emotions of all the characters from whose point of view the story unfolds. In this way Hemingway demonstrates his genius for having accurate and sensitive insight into the human spirit.I am impressed by the way he is able to express passion, especially in the sex scenes, under the constraints of early 20th century censorship. I read this book simultaneously with Sandra Brown's \\"Hello Darkness,\\" reading six chapters of Hemingway to every five chapters of Brown so that I would finish both books at the same time. This truly provided a contrast of how human passions were expressed in early 20th century novels compared with how they are expressed today. You should try it! It's an eye-opener! What some would judge as repetitive prose in Hemingway was actually a literary device he used to bring the reader into the experience, and in my opinion (and of course, the opinions of countless other readers and critics) Hemingway succeeds famously. I also found it very amusing to read how Hemingway skirted around the expression of \\"unprintable\\" language, a hindrance contemporary authors no longer need to be concerned about &lt;g>Another device Hemingway uses in this novel is to make his characters \\"think\\" in Spanish but \\"speak\\" in English. This is not easy to accomplish successfully. Because I am bi-lingual, I found the rhythm of the prose quite natural, but I wonder how the experience would be for an only-English speaking reader.This is my second Hemingway novel and I am so grateful that I have been introduced to Hemingway on Kindle. Because I read this on Kindle for PC, I was able to conveniently and quickly look up not only the definitions of words I did not know but also the translations of Spanish phrases with which I was unfamiliar. Thank you, Kindle! It made reading this book much more interesting and informative. It has also spurred an interest in the history of the Spanish Revolution which took place in the decade before I was born. Of course, Kindle has satisfied that curiosity as well.This is more than a worthwhile read for anyone who enjoys war novels. One learns so much from reading; I've always said fiction is the best medium for speaking truth, and Truth (whatever that means to each one individually) abounds in this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is the first Hemingway book I've read, and I recommend it. For Whom the Bell Tolls covers a period of three full days during the Spanish Civil War, following (primarily) a young American professor of Spanish working as a guerrilla explosives expert on the Communist side (although, as we discover, not a Communist himself). The book is well-written, as one would expect of a classic, although not quite as terse as I expected given Hemingway's reputation... but certainly missing the flowery language of many earlier classics, and I suppose that's the point.On the merits of the story alone, this is a good book. It's a war story, but don't read it for the action scenes, which are few and far between--far more time is spent getting to know the characters, their lifestyle (living in a cave in the mountains behind fascist lines), and their relationships. There's some backstory dealing with the start of the war and some philosophizing on life, love, the morality of killing in wartime, and so forth. Philosophizing in a novel generally bores me, but kudos to Hemingway for writing these passages the way a person's internal voice (well... mine anyway...) would actually sound; Robert Jordan's thought processes sound like they come from a rational, self-aware sort of man in a war zone rather than an author writing essays in the comfort of his home. There are a couple windows on the \\"larger picture\\" as well; my favorite section of the book deals with the myriad difficulties one of the guerrillas has getting into and through territory controlled by his own side.The characters here are quite well-developed, especially the protagonist... although his love interest, Maria, seems like little more than a vehicle for masculine wish-fulfillment most of the time (except for the priceless scene where she informs him that she's too sore for sex). At least there is another, much better-developed female character to balance that out. Descriptions, while not flowery, are quite vivid. I learned a bit about Spanish culture and history, although my feeling is that Hemingway was writing for an audience who already knew the basics of the war; his story is a microcosm of the conflict, requiring readers to do more research to really understand it.I would have liked to see a bit more resolution at the end (who survived the day, at least?), but my only real gripe is Hemingway's direct and sometimes inaccurate rendering of Spanish dialogue. His goal--trying to give readers a feel for the Spanish language--is reasonable, but it results in characters saying stilted things that sound ridiculous in English, and sometimes are just plain incorrect. For instance, they say \\"rare\\" when they mean \\"strange,\\" that they don't want to \\"molest\\" someone when they want to avoid annoying them (\\"raro\\" in Spanish means \\"strange,\\" and \\"molestar\\" means \\"to annoy\\"... one would think that a writer like Hemingway must understand the concept of false cognates). And while I understand his use of the \\"thou\\" form in an attempt to show the difference between formal and informal forms of address in Spanish, he uses it inconsistently, and statements like \\"I love thee\\" in a novel set in the 20th century are just bizarre. For me the translation quickly became annoying and distracting, jolting me out of the story as I found myself translating characters' statements into Spanish to make sense of them.Still, if you can get past what another reviewer has aptly called the \\"goofy English,\\" this is certainly a worthy read. Lovers of classics are likely to approve all of Hemingway's editorial decisions, and for the rest, this is a fun way to get to know one of the most famous literary novelists of the 20th century. Even if you didn't like classics in school, this one is worth a shot."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom the Bell Tolls (FWTBT), is a masterpiece especially combined with Campbell Scott's superb reading.

But after listening to FWTBT, I became interested in the little known Spanish Civil War and purchased a book about it, read it and then listened to FWTBT again.

Jordan and Maria fall in love and it is a compelling story but Jordans relationships with the guerilla leader Pablo and his wife Pilar as well as the other loyalists are also compelling.

Jordan is one of Hemingways most compelling heroes and he carries the novels. You see Spain through his eyes and Hemingway makes you believe you are in Spain in late 1938. This is a great novel and I recommend it highly"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Covering a period of just under four days,this riveting story tells of a doomed offensive against the facists in the Spanish civil war. Robert Jordan seeks the help of partizans in the mountains to blow a bridge. Amongst them is Maria...What can be said of this great work that hasn't been said a million times? It is a fantastic thriller,a close account of the Spanish war and culture,of love, of death,of political stupidities....But for me,this is the book that finally tuned me into Hemingways style and power-his laconic but highly descriptive prose that press all the right buttons in the imagination;the use of 'Thee' and 'Thou' to properly give the feel of the peasants dialect;the way he builds up complex characters with just the briefest of story lines,even the way Robert Jordan is always refered to as Robert Jordan seems to add to his character.Its wonderful and each chapter excites and adds.When I was about 11 or 12 I foolishly tried to take on 'Farewell to Arms' and simply didn't have the reading ability then to take aboard Hemingways style (although I see now how many imitators it has) This prejudiced me against him. I didn't go overboard with the 'easier' 'Old Man and the Sea' but warmed a bit after reading 'Men Without Women' and thought I'd give Hemingway another go some time and am so glad I did with this one.The complexities of this book are reflected in Hemingways own life;the preoccupation with death and suicide,of beauty and brutality.A great book; a book in the true sense of the word.Persist with Hemingway as when you 'get' him the experience is truly wonderful."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This beautifully written book is often compelling and occasionally trying. At nearly 500 densely written pages, I found my edition of the book perhaps overly long, but nonetheless admirable. It is the story of an American named Robert Jordan who fights in the mountains outside Madrid during the Spanish Civil War.I read the book at least once when I was young, but that was at least thirty years ago. Upon picking it up again I found I remembered little except that the earth moved, and that something went amiss during the final scene. I perhaps also remembered, at least faintly, an extraordinary tale told by a character named Pilar about the fate of the fascist in a Spanish village.Hemingway makes it abundantly clear that he wants to write a true book. By this, I think he means that he wants to tell us the truth about the people who fought in the Spanish Civil War, and in that goal I believe he succeeds. After reading the book, I feel a little as though I was actually there, a combatant in the war, and that I knew others who fought beside me. This is small \\"t\\" truth, synonymous with words such as realistic, or factual. Hemingway was not trying to tell the Truth about God.Refusing to romanticize the soldiers who fought for the Spanish Republic, he tells us what is good about them, and what is bad. It is possible, though unlikely, that I could write truthfully about the kind of highly educated Americans who I lived with most of my life. But I could never write so vividly, or so convincingly, about the kind of illiterate, or semi-literate, Spanish townspeople who inhabit this book. One understands exactly why the good guys lost this war, and yet somehow one loves these struggling, obscene, dirty people all the more for their faults.There are several obvious accomplishments in this book. One is the amazing character Pilar, a woman in her late forties or early fifties who comes vividly to life as complex, frequently contradictory character who is simultaneously admirable and intolerable. The description of the fascists being slaughtered in a small town by the drunken Pablo is perhaps one of the better passages in all of Hemingway. Another description of a fight on a hill is impossible to put down, and of course no one is ever going to forget the scene when the earth moves, or the beautiful language that adorns nearly every page of this book.After reading this book, I read Of Mice and Men and then picked up Typhoon, two beautifully written books which are perhaps significantly better than For Whom the Bell Tolls. Yet neither Conrad nor Steinbeck writes as beautifully, as lyrically, or as movingly as Hemingway at his best. It is odd, perhaps even ironic, that a man so obsessed with violence and manly courage should have such a lovely, moving prose style. Hemingway inhabited the English language with an ease and skill, that even at this stage in his career, produced prose that rates as one of the glories of the English language. Some of the descriptions of nature in this book are among the finest I've ever read, particularly when Hemingway turned his attention to pine trees!Hemingway's openly admitted love of violence mars this book, as do several long meditative passages about the vagaries of life, or the character of the rebel soldiers who fought with the Robert Jordan. To his credit, Hemingway's main character finally concedes that though violence is compelling, it is nevertheless evil. It is even possible that Hemingway loved not so much manly strength, as the ability to survive without giving in to the fear that can destroy a man's character, and lead him to let down not only himself, but those who work beside him. Fear must have been a torture to Hemingway, sending him into wild fits of depression and chaotic ruminations. He loved, and wrote beautifully about, those times when one feels calm, and brave, and settled. I'm not sure one really needs to face down a bull in order to achieve such a state, but I have sympathy for Hemingway's goals, if not his means.A true description about an historical event like the Spanish Civil War is a wonderful gift to bring to a reader, and one to savor and enjoy. And at the heart of the book are two characters, Robert Jordan and Maria, who are tough and admirable. Though I think some of my feminist friends would criticize me for it, I nevertheless found Maria believable, and I think that there are young women in this world who are as innocent, good and true as Maria. If there are really people in this world like Robert Jordan, I've never met them, but I suppose it is unfair to fault Hemingway for creating such an admirable hero.I should confess that I didn't really want to like this book, mostly because I don't always care for the tone adopted by so many of the people who most passionately admire Hemingway when they begin singing the praises of their hero. But though I found the going tedious at times, nevertheless I was won over by this flawed book. Somehow the lives of the poor Spaniards who lived in the hills of Spain and fought the fascists seem more real, and more worthwhile, than the lives that most of us in America live today. We are many times more sophisticated, but perhaps not quite as likable, and I have to admire Hemingway for bringing these people to life so vividly, and in such beautiful prose. It must have been extraordinary to know and work beside people who fought to bravely for such a worthy cause."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway published FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS in 1940, just after the end of the Spanish Civil War. Surely, one of Hem's goals in writing this novel was to capture in fiction the full human and political complexity of this war, which was, for a time, the great international cause. This may explain why this novel, despite its great craftsmanship and virtuosity, reads a little long. Hem, you see, had to get everything in.IMHO, the best feature of this terrific book is its wonderful Spanish characters. These participate in the war, which is a great cause for Robert Jordan, the novel's protagonist. But they participate because of family loyalty, fascist war crimes, or class rage and soldiering is mostly peripheral to their personalities. What the reader remembers is not their support of the Republic but the integrity of Anselmo, the dignity of Fernando, the humor of Agustin, the simple loving sincerity of Maria, the harsh surface of Pilar, and the murderous treachery of Pablo. These are, basically, ordinary Spaniards caught in a gruesome tragedy, not ideologues or idealists who are transformed or energized by the cause.Hem also handles Robert Jordan skillfully. When Jordan first appears, he seems to be concerned only with his duty to the cause, which, on this mission, is to blow up a bridge. But quickly, Jordan meets the loving Maria. Then, through this relationship, Hem explores Jordan's thoughts and feelings on life and death. While Jordan is not an extraordinary man with breakthrough thoughts, he is an extraordinary character who, thanks to Maria, both examines the rationale for risking his life and identifies the beauty of what may be its final few days.There are many great scenes in this novel. Among my favorites are the appearance of the planes and Pilar, at fireside, telling the story of her matador lover. And--surprise!--Hemingway is funny in FWTBT, not in a hilarious Robin Williams style, but with the dexterity of a witty companion. With Hemingway's misogyny, competitiveness, alcoholism, and depression now raised to critical prominence, I was surprised to see that the man could be a good guy.FWTBT is number 74 on the Modern Library's list of 100 Best Novels... a bit low in my estimation."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"It took me a couple hundred pages to get through the opening slump of reading this book. It didn't become interesting to me until about half way through, at which point the reading went much faster. At first, I was only able to read 50 pages of it a day, this increased to 100. Problems I used to have with Hemingway's writing have significantly decreased over the years. I still saw this story partly as an assertion of the masculinity in war, but there was softness in it. It also contains very strong female characters (Pilar, and to an extent Maria). Some of the engrossing, romantic elements of A Farewell to Arms are present, and the novels end similarly (For Whom the Bell Tolls has more of a 'glorious' conclusion, I'd say). The chapters are paced slowly, but the attention to detail is pacifying, not irritating in its conciseness. The novel is concerned with the dedication of human effort to causes which seem important on an individual basis. Robert Jordan is a patriot for a country that is not his own, and while he struggles through his political alignments, he centers his thoughts around the mechanization of war and his confusion over which moral path is correct. I feel that the love story is added in partially as a side note, Hemingway creates a bright infatuation to off-set the political themes of the novel. I don't think this would be a good introduction to Hemingway, but is great to have read after several of his other novels."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Filled with complex and interesting characters and written in Hemingway's characteristically simple, but effective style, For Whom the Bell Tolls is Hemingway at his best. There are few novels I would recommend more highly.Hemingway's fascinating characters, from the American, Robert Jordan, to Pablo and Pilar, often referred to \\"the woman of Pablo\\" (if there can be one criticism of Hemingway, it is that his female characters are often simple; however, this is not true of Pilar), make this novel so wonderful, along with Hemingway's vivid descriptions of everything from the characters themselves to the horrors of war (one scene that comes to mind particularly is Hemingway's description of the execution of a group of fascists, who are beaten to death before being hurled from a cliff).Although it is not a tale for the faint-hearted (forgive the cliche), For Whom the Bell Tolls is arguably Hemingway's greatest work. Anyone who enjoys Hemingway, McCarthy, or Faulkner should enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"The ur-text for today's wartime adventure novel, \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" remains a standard bearer for pulse-pounding action fiction, and one of the true masterpieces by the most celebrated American author of his time.Robert Jordan is a Spanish-language instructor from Montana who, now in Spain, has a job of another kind: blow up a critical bridge under enemy control before his comrades, the Republicans of the Spanish Civil War, mount a critical attack. He falls in with a band of motley guerrillas, discovering the joy and passion of life even as he must make peace with the real possibility of his death.When published in 1940, there was little need to explain the title: the bell was tolling pretty loudly for just about everyone outside of Sweden and Chile as the Axis powers led by Nazi Germany rolled up giant chunks of the globe. Germany's three-year dress rehearsal had been the Spanish Civil War, where they helped Spanish fascists and monarchists overthrow the Marxist-led Republicans while Western democracies watched idly. Ernest Hemingway, a strong supporter of the Republican cause, lost arguably the only country he ever really loved.\\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" could have been an exercise in told-you-so or score settling with the right-wing victors Hemingway despised. Yet the story is so engaging - so raw and sweeping in its style, so visceral in form, and undogmatic in outlook - that it is hard to know from reading it just how bruised a champion Hemingway had been for the losing team. The most drawn-out, brutal section of narrative deals with atrocities committed by Republicans, not fascists. Rebels and Republicans alike appear oddly human.\\"Do you think you have a right to kill any one? No. But I have to. How many of those you have killed have been real fascists? Very few. But they are all the enemy to whose force we are the opposing force. But you like the people of Navarra better than those of any other part of Spain. Yes. And you kill them. Yes.\\"That's one of many internal monologues Jordan has with himself in the course of the book, which may annoy some expecting more wall-to-wall action but works fine by me. It's easy imagining oneself pondering similar questions in similar situations, and the running stream-of-consciousness adds to the nail-biting tension.Hemingway also does very well by the secondary characters, especially the guerrilla band Jordan takes up with. Their leader, Pablo, was a once-ruthless killer of fascists now reduced to drink and train-robbing. \\"There is not enough of you left to make a sick kitten,\\" says Pablo's bitter woman, Pilar, herself a tigress and Jordan's chief ally. Pilar is both supporter and scoffer of Jordan's budding relationship with Maria, a teenaged rape survivor rescued by the guerrillas. This is not a merry band of outlaws; their very fractiousness draws you in.As a Sam Peckinpah fan, I was struck by how pleasingly similar \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" was to the classic Western desperado saga \\"The Wild Bunch\\". Both are straightforward action yarns with a lot of backstory, vivid characters and setting, and a storyline that cleverly pulls you in even as it seems to ramble.\\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" is less concerned about the bridge itself (where or when precisely this action is occurring is never spelled out) then the feelings that surround warfare, and how and why one man must do what he can, for as Rick said in \\"Casablanca\\", the problems of one man don't add up to a hill of beans in this crazy mixed-up world. Hemingway's ending is less Hollywood but just as stirring, and a fittingly open-ended climax to this singular story."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom the Bell Tolls is a novel about love, deception, war, and trustworthiness. Author Ernest Hemingway can be seen as the perfect writer for this book. All novels are not created equally and this one outshines most.This novel starts off in the midst of the Spanish Civil War in May of 1937. Robert Jordan, the protagonist, is seen in the beginning of the story as an American scientist that wants to blow up a bridge that is being used by the Fascists. The Fascists are people in the war fighting against the Republicans or rebels. Jordan is blocked to this path by a man named Pablo who will not help him with his plans for blowing up the bridge. Pablo, so called leader of the rebels, is the opposite of Jordan by seeing the whole plan as a danger zone for the safety of his men. Pablo's wife Pilar, real leader of the rebels, seems to enjoy the plan and decides to help Jordan out with it. Pablo has been demoted as the leader and now his men blame him for all of the calamities that happen throughout the story, such as the killing of troops just for their horses.As the story progresses, there is the smell of love in the air when Jordan meets Maria in the rebel camp. Maria is a woman who has been raped by the Fascists and seeks revenge upon them. Maria and Jordan have several \\"sexual sensations\\" throughout the novel and they imagine themselves living a normal life after the war is over. This is ironic because things do not work out the way they want to.By the end of the story, the bridge has been blown apart by Robert and the rebel band, but some people do not make it back alive. Robert Jordan progresses throughout the story as a stiff and unchanging character. He develops a sense of distrust even though he supports the Republican side. Hemingway sets the tone for an appetite of destruction and leads it off into a sense of love and sensation at the end.This novel can be seen as a great attribute to war fiction by incorporating love and hate into the war zone. Many people should decide to read this book because while reading this book it brings home war in a realistic manner."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"In the past few days I have finished reading the internationally acclaimed book \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" by Ernest Hemingway. Before I began reading this book I had heard and read from many that the book was a classic and a very good read; after finishing the book I have to say that I completely agree. This book well deserves the praise that it has been given over the years; it is a classic in every sense of the word.From Hemingway's unmatched descriptions of the beautiful Spanish countryside to the deep inner thoughts and struggles of the people. Hemingway has captured the true inner feelings of the Spanish people in their struggle for their idea of freedom, from the gripping oppression of fascism.Yet he goes even further, in the unlikely relationship that develops between Robert Jordan and recently rescued Maria. He is still able to show that there is always some good even in some of the darkest situations. From betrayals and tragedy to unlikely and unexpected aid Hemingway covers all spectrums and interestsThe only criticism I can give this book is concerning the ending which I personally found unsatisfying but that is for you to decide for yourself. In conclusion I find this book to be a great read for any who feel they are a skilled enough reader to fully appreciate the majesty of this work of art."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I do enjoy the book. My issue is not with the book but with the people who altered it to suit their sensibility. If you don't like the langauge used in the book that is fine, but don't change every curse word to \\"unprintable\\", \\"unmentionable\\" because you and want you and your children to live in a bubble. You are ruining something that is perfect as it is. You lack the creative ability to create anything on your own so you believe changing curse words into clever terms makes you an artist. Whoever edited this book need be shot, and be sent back to whatever community college academic standpoint they came from where they believe the world is fair and things should all be politically correct.NEVER CHANGE THINGS TO SUIT YOUR SENSIBILITY!"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Half of this book is a brilliant, visceral portrayal of war and the men and women who are swept up in it. It shows the different ways through which men confront their own mortality, and exposes the inherent dirtiness and corruption of war, and how this destroys hope and idealism.While some right-wing critics of this novel accuse Hemingway of romanticizing Communism, anyone who actually reads the book can see that this is simply not the case. On several occasions, the novel's main character, Robert Jordan, a volunteer soldier in the International Brigades, flashes back to his time in Madrid. In these flashbacks, we see how Robert became disillusioned with Marxist doctrine after seeing the extent of Soviet control and corruption that was rampant in the city, and how the Soviets lied to the Spanish people. One of these flashbacks includes a thinly veiled reference to the Moscow show trials, when a Soviet journalist mentions the name of Zinoviev, an executed Bolshevik, to Robert. Hemingway also shows how Communist Party structure doomed the Republican effort through the character of Andre Marty, a paranoid, inept French Communist leader who, in his power and stupidity, assigned men to impossible missions.It is shown that most of the left-wing Republican fighters were anti-Communist socialists who simply wanted to be free and to be governed fairly. Hemingway even manages to insert a criticism of American racism, when, after being told a story of how the guerilla group he has joined attacked a village and allowed the inhabitants to murder their right-wing neighbors, Robert recalls a childhood experience of seeing a black man lynched by a group of whites (this part of the story may have been inspired by Hemingway's friendship with the black poet Langston Hughes).If this book was nothing more than the parts that I just described, I would have awarded it five stars.However, roughly half of this book is the horribly unconvincing love story of Robert Jordan and Maria, a girl who the guerilla band saved from the Fascist forces. Maria is a flat, one-dimensional character whose only goal appears to be to submit to Robert's wishes and to pleasure him. She is weak-willed, and, for the most part, air-headed. These parts of the book drag terribly, and their only redeeming quality is Hemingway's beautiful, vivid descriptions of the mountains of Spain. For these failings, I am forced to say that this novel does not deserve five stars."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Having read two Hemmingway novels, I was not impressed. Frankly, I was surprised that I did not enjoy them. After growing up and hearing about the great Hemmingway, the man's man, I found his characters weak and whinny. Ready to give up, I gave him one more try and I am glad he did. This is a magnificent novel.Set in the Spanish Civil War during the 1930s it tells the story of Robert Jordan, an American volunteer fighting against Franco and his fascist allies. This is first-rate story telling, it grabs the reader from the offset and pulls him into the story. Unlike other Hemmingway novels (i.e., The Son Also Rises), these are heroic characters that we deeply care about.The imagery is magnificent. I can still see in my minds eye, the retreating Republicans, the panicked soldiers, the horses out of control and the cartridge casings spilled in the road way. If you are unfamiliar with Hemmingway, read this book first. All the others will pale in comparison."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I love almost all of Hemingway's novels, but this one was a daunting effort. Line by line, or a paragraph at a time, the writing is Hemingway at his best. Yet, inexplicably, I found that as one chapter segued interminably to the next, the story and style became muddled and could not sustain my interest. There is much, however, that is worth the time...themes of monogamous love, war/conscience, life/death. The heart wrenching finale illustrates the notorious he-man's mastery to convey softer, &quot;feminine&quot; sensitivity. Definitely not the one to kick off a reader's Hemingway exposure."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I only started reading Hemingway last year, yet he's become one of my very favourite authors. Of course I am humble enough to I ask myself &quot;What more is there to say about &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; that the reviewers and others haven't said already?&quot; Yet here I am... writing another review about Hemingway's masterpiece...&quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; is the tale of two of man's most cherished and hated traditions: Love and War. We enter the story somewhere in Spain, in 1937, under the Spanish Civil War. We follow Robert Jordan -the American (teacher, now a demolition expert), and a group of guerrilla loyalists; Pablo leader of the group, his woman Pilar and the girl Maria (a prisoner rescued by Pablo).We follow the group, and especially Robert's, effort, fighting for the Republic against the Fascists. The entire novel only covers a span of three days, so we truly get a sense of the time passing. While the story develops we recognise that the real leader of the group is not Pablo, but his woman, Pilar. We watch Robert develop an intense love for the girl Maria and reading the part where Robert and Maria are taking farewell brought tears to my eyes...It is not possible to not genuinely care for each individual in the story, because the characters are few, and they are all very well developed. In fact, they must be the most complete characters that I've found in any novel that I've read. They say that good novelists write books with strong main characters. Great ones make even the minor characters memorable. And so it is with &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, the old man Anselmo is as well developed as Robert Jordan or Pilar.From beginning to end, &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; held my attention. This novel shows Hemingway's masterful command of the English language, and I think this novel is one of the best anti-war novels of the 20th century. &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; most definitely deserves its &quot;true classic&quot;-label.I couldn't recommend it more highly!"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom the Bells Tolls is quite possibly one of the most beautiful books ever written. After reading Clancy and Grisham for a while, I decided to move on to a classic. This perfectly quenched my desire. This is the tale of an American who fights in the Spanish Civil War. Love and War are both perfectly captured in this book. I have never read such a &quot;smart&quot; book that looks into one of the character's mind. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This version of the book has been censored to the point where parts of the dialog are difficult to understand. Anyone who is familiar with Hemingway should know to expect some profanity. The book itself is very good. I'm only about half way through it and I like the style; the pace tends to drag a little in places."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom The Bell Tolls is a tour de force in more ways then one and ends being Hemingway's best work because of how accesible it is to a general audience.The first time I read this book I was 17 and I couldn't put it down which is a stark contrast to some of Hemingway's other works. Works like The Sun Also Rises, and Farewell To Arms I think require a bit more maturity to appreciate but FWTBT is a good pick for a more advanced high school student. The novel is more plot driven than Hemingway's other works and thus a bit more exciting and readable for the general public. Hemingway's story of an American demolition expert caught up in a mission amidst the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War is both compelling, suspensefull, thoughtfull, brutal and heartwarming all at once.Like many \\"classic\\" this book excels in most elements that are required for an amazing piece of literature. The charactization is superb. Robert Jordan and the supporting cast are fully fleshed out three dimensional characters. Of course the book is written in the classic Hemingway style. His own style of prose will put you into story as you live this three day adventure with the main characters. Finally there are many layers and themes to this book as it has something to say about war, man, personal honor and the usual Hemingway themes.This was Hemingway's second to last novel and the last of his more well known works. Having read most of his books, I think Hemingway really hit his peak here and fine tuned his craft. A truly amazing piece of work, FWTBT should really be read by everyone. If you only read one Hemingway book in your life this should be it. You don't need to be \\"well read\\" to appreciate this.Bottom Line: There is a reason why certain books are deemed \\"classics\\". FWTBT is the perfect example."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemmingway opens his classic account of Robert Jordan and the anti-fascists guerillas he helps, with the surveying of a mill and bridge. Through Hemmingway's superb writing skills we find out why Jordan is on this particular mission and the basis of his mission in Spain.Robert Jordan is sent to Spain to help an anti-fascists guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain. There, in the mists of war, he falls in love with the beautiful Maria. In his description of war and what the tolls of it are, Hemmingway forgets nothing. In his excellent account of El Sordos's last stand he leaves out nothing, and provides multiple viewpoints of the situation. All forty-three chapters are written without flaw and provide the reader with a true story about war and the devastation it causes. From page one to page 471 the reader's senses are bombarded with a colorful array of writing. This perhaps is Hemmingway's best work and was published at the height of his career. This book is guaranteed to give you your bang for your buck, and doesn't come close to A Farwell to Arms or The Sun Also Rises. Everyone should read this book and be exposed to one of the most influential American writers ever."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"An interesting historical novel set in the context of Revolutionary Spain, but classic Hemmingway, it carries with it the important lesson of activism over apathy, especially pertinent to today's world. It teaches that ideals transcend political boundaries and that if you believe in something strongly, then you owe it to yourself to protect that ideal in any part of the world and at any cost, even that of your life. Intwined is a beautiful love story. One of my top 5 greatest books of all time. Thats a rave, baby. The poem by John Donne at the beginning makes the book worth buying.A 5 because it is a great story with an invaluable lesson. If you gain nothing, you still read beautiful prose by one of the greatest authors ever."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"There never has, and never will be, another writer with the lucidity and inestimable genius of Hemingway. Hemingway's characteristic laconic, terse, and fluid prose and dialogue shine radiantly throughout this book for the ages. Seeing our country in the midst of the war on terrorism and a growing divisiveness amongst Americans, I feel, regardless of one's stance on war, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a great book to pick up right now.To stereotype and routinely categorize this great work as nothing more than a \\"war book\\" is to do it a grave injustice. Hemingway touches on, among other things, love, loyalty, sacrifice for the greater good, rape, suicide, altruism, and social injustice. For Whom the Bell Tolls manifests itself as a book that speaks to the reader in many indescribable ways. Hemingway's character development is masterful and unparalleled in literature. We come to know not only our intrepid protagonist Robert Jordan, moreover we come to know the inner thoughts and feelings of Anselmo, Maria, Pablo, Pilar, and Lieutenant Berrendo as Hemingway ingeniously flips from 3rd to 1st person narrative and then back to 3rd perdson on the drop of a dime.Perhaps the only negative of the book is the annoying censoring of curse words throughout the text such as, \\"I obscenity in the milk of science.\\" Ironically, Hemingway's hero Robert Jordan fights for the Communist Republic(which of course mandated censorship), and his own book ends up censored. Go figure. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this powerful tour de force and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"In this novel the sum is more consequential than the parts. That is, if you read this novel chapter by chapter expecting to find some amazing answer or significance it probably is not there or very subtle at best. However, if you spent some time reflecting after having read the novel for a bit, then the novel has a greater deal of substance to it, mainly for the larger issue that is covered in the book-- what death and duty means for individuals in war time. We see this issue repeatedly in both the dialogue and inner thoughts of Robert Jordan, and Hemingway has a superb way of intertwining these two forms of prose and narration, something most authors probably couldn't do as effectively.Perhaps the biggest negative in the work is the depiction of Maria as too submissive and shallow. She seemingly just goes along with whatever Robert Jordan wants and is not able to speak a stronger voice against anything the characters are experiencing. Not only this, but she doesn't bring anything to any of the other characters, and has few lines of importance. Certainly, the fact that she has had a rough background and has endured personal tragedy (being raped, the death of her mother and father) plays a part in her submissiveness, but there are times that she comes across as just a \\"stock\\" damsel-in-distress type who will do anything for the hero, or, in the case of Robert Jordan, tragic hero.Robert Jordan appears to be a tragic hero because he questions many times why he is there, and why he is seeing this mission through. He goes back and forth in his conscious about what blowing up a bridge means, and contemplates the duty of why people kill when they have to in a war time setting. He doesn't appear to be completely sold on this cause in Spain, and while he seemingly never leaves this area physically, mentally he challenges the essence of being there time and time again so he can reassure himself that this is the just thing to do, and for the right cause.This is not an easy read in the sense that there is much more to what is going on than meets the eye. There aren't big explosions every page or intense actions scenes with many fighting war; most of the action is internal and underscored. However, this is a powerful book in many points, if just for the effort of Hemingway to really get inside a protagonist's mind and show the insight that goes with it.One final note about this particular edition (Scribner paperback edition from 1995): I don't know if other's editions were the same, but there were a few typos in this one. For this reason, if you plan on getting For Whom the Bell Tolls, I recommend you choose another edition."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Ernest Hemingway - For Whom The Bell TollsFor one who wants to read the book that has it all I recommend Ernest Hemingway's For Whom The Bell Tolls. Friendship, strife, security, terror, love, war, good, evil; this book has them all. It is the story of Robert Jordan, a sympathizer of the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, whose duty is to lead a band of guerrillas in blowing up a bridge as part of a Republican offensive. Along the way Jordan will learn the revolting pasts of several of the guerrillas, fall in love with one of them, and spend quite some time meditating on \\"truths\\" he was once sure he knew.No sooner has Jordan met with the guerrillas than he discovers that one of them, fearful of being hunted down by the fascist forces, stands against him and threatens to take the entire group away. This first taste of tension is mirrored several times over in Hemingway's gripping novel as Jordan's quest to destroy his bridge turns into a contemplation of whether his cause is truly worthy or not.Much of what Jordan sees recommends the latter. Jordan's guerrilla partners are not simple adornments to his crusade; they all have livid pasts and he finds much to learn from them. Even as they curse and spit at the fascists several of these guerrillas communicate, through their stories, arguments against the futility and cruelty of the war they have willfully taken up. Others, too young to realize what they have gotten into, create commentaries on war through their nave brashness.Additionally the humanity of the guerrillas makes Jordan question the commands from his isolated, detached superiors. In time Jordan forms strong bonds with his friends and discovers that the thought of sending them into harm's way is not a simple abstraction. This is further complicated by a girl Jordan meets and falls in love with and Jordan's own questions about the worthiness of his orders.Like Robert Jordan we, as readers of For Whom The Bell Tolls, are invited to meditate on many of the thoughts that so bother him. What need a person do to live a full life? How important is it to stay true to principles, even when fighting in vain? What are the limits of brutality? These are a few of the questions Hemingway grapples with in his book. The answers are so well bound with the narrative that often one hardly notices a metaphysical discussion has occurred, but those who give the text a second look will find a philosophical subtext as gripping as the plot line.As for the story, Hemingway creates out of his assortment of characters a narrative of breathtaking beauty. For Whom The Bell Tolls has the power to move one to tears, wet hands with sweat, and force page after page of devoted reading. Hemingway's language is not the most beautiful, but in lieu of poetics his writing has the next best thing: crisp clarity.Perhaps the best thing to say about For Whom The Bell Tolls is that at nearly 500 pages (which glide by in a snap), scarcely one has been wasted. It is a war novel laced with the drama of a Henry James piece and a drama lacerated with the carnage of war. In other words this fine book of Hemingway's manages to transcend two genres and end up at some unknown point in between, but certainly above both."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"What more is there to say about this masterpiece that hasn't been covered in over 100 reviews here, not to mention the shelves of critical essays and examinations since this book appeared in 1940?Precious little, probably, yet what a strange \\"Great American Novel\\" this is! To begin with its set in Spain, in the midst of an all but forgotten conflict, the Spanish Civil War. Then there's our hero, a young university lecturer Robert Jordan, linguist and fluent in Spanish, French, and probably German.Jordan is one of the most likable people in American literature, in many ways the all-American hero. Yet he's fighting for the communists...under a Russian general, with a guerilla (terrorist?) group that seems distinctly low on ideals, and high on banditry and brutality.Then there's the novel's philosophy, which the title implicitly states, which supports the notion of community, and co-operation, and the importance of individual sacrifice for the common good. Foreign and un-American indeed, yet brilliantly handled - even a Fascist Officer becomes someone we can sympathise with (and is probably Robert Jordan's last victim).A curious feature is the pervasive irony, so absent from much current American writing and conversation. Its manifest in many episodes, and provides much sly humour, such as when Robert Jordan speaks of machine guns jamming or running out of ammunition but does so in English. When his Spanish comrades ask him what he's talking about, he simply replies \\"just looking into the future in English.\\"Hemingway's main innovation is a simple yet brilliant: Render the Spanish dialogue in English, but make it a simi-literal translation; so for instance \\"What's your name?\\" becomes \\"How are you called?\\" Its a little awkward for the first few pages, then we adjust, but never forget that Robert Jordan is speaking Spanish to Spanish speakers.Good novelists write books with strong main characters, great ones make even the minor characters memorable. And so it is with this book, from the uneducated yet thoughtful old man Anselmo, to the half deaf leader of a neighboring guerilla band, El Sordo.Finally, in an era of up-beat feelings and the importance of positive thinking, For Whom the Bell Tolls is an extraordinarily pessimistic and downbeat novel...Truly an American classic, maybe the strangest of them all."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"\\"Flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees.\\" This is very typical Ernest Hemmingway diction in his book, For Whom The Bell Tolls. He always manages to use very descriptive imagery in his writing. In this book, Hemmingway tells a story of group conflict and romance.In this novel, Hemmingway tells the story of a man named Robert Jordan and his life as a guerilla soldier in the mountains of Spain in the year of 1937. In his journeys, Robert Jordan is allied with another soldier, Pablo, his lady, Pilar, and a girl named Maria. Robert Jordan is sent to these mountains on a mission to blow up a bridge. In his time with his these people, Jordan deals with conflict within the group and his growing interest with Maria.Ernest Hemmingway is very effective in telling the struggles of Robert Jordan when he is trying to blow up the bridge, and the romance he has with Maria. Hemmingway's descriptions of the bridge and the mountains of Spain creates a crystal clear image of the setting Robert Jordan is in. \\"The mountainside sloped gently where he lay; but below it was steep and he could see the dark of the oiled road winding through the pass.\\"Hemmingway's character description in this novel is terrific. Each character is described with vivid details of their personality and physical characteristics. When talking about Robert Jordan, Hemmingway says, \\"The young man, who was tall and thin, with sun-streaked fair hair, and a wind- and sun-burned face, who wore the sun-faded flannel shirt, a pair of peasant's trousers and rope-soled shoes..\\" Hemmingway provides each character with their own individual description and background in this book.The plot of this novel is one of courage, loyalty, and romance. Hemmingway tells about an American man in an International Brigade who shows bravery in his mission to blow up a bridge. Hemmingway also describes his loyalty to his comrades in his time in the mountains. Most of all, Hemmingway tells of Jordan's growing love of the girl Maria. \\"Her teeth were white in her brown face and her skin and her eyes were the same golden tawny brown. She had high cheekbones, merry eyes, and a straight mouth with full lips. Her hair was the golden brown of a grain field..\\"Ernest Hemmingway uses wonderful diction throughout the entire novel. Hemmingway uses Spanish words and phrases often in this book such as, \\"Hola\\", \\"Salud\\", and \\"Dentro de la gravedad\\". All of these examples give more detail to the characters, and the Spanish culture as well. Hemmingway also uses imagery very well in this novel, always trying to give you the best mental picture possible of the situation. \\"..and the four knelt, looking very awkward with their heads against the wall and their hands by their sides, and Pablo passed behind them and shot each in turn in the back of the head with the pistol, going from one to another and putting the barrel of the pistol against the back of their heads, each man slipping down as he fired.\\"For Whom The Bell Tolls is a fairly easy-reading book and tells a very good story. This is a perfect example of Ernest Hemmingway at his best. He delivers a great account of one man's adventures in the civil war of Spain, while tying in romance and the brutality of war along with it."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I've read this novel seven, perhaps, eight times, and with this last reading I opened my eyes and was allowed yet another glimpse into the depth of Hemingway's mind. Others have called this work simplistic, its title unrelated to the book's content, something to be idolized by high school English teachers. Ha! If you read only to be entertained, you will miss some of the most poignant features of the work.For me, the characters come alive in the book. They live and breathe as human beings most certainly did during the Spanish Revolution: Golz, Anselmo, El Sordo, Pablo, and Pilar. And although Robert Jordan's intimacy with Maria is cloaked in euphemisms to get it past the censors when the book was first written in 1939, I got the point: the two of them, as sometimes happens once or twice in life, were inexplicably drawn to each other. It's not something carnal or obscene; it's something divine, and that which one should be eternally thankful for. Certainly, Hemingway must have realized this when he created the characters of Robert and Maria.The ending was written some thirty-eight times in an attempt \\"to get the words right,\\" and that speaks volumes about the author's diligence in producing a work of literature that will last the ages. The love which Robert Jordan had for Maria is evidenced in his desire to see her safely away, to give up his life that she may move on and live her life. He knows he is \\"mucked,\\" yet he kindly but forcibly tells Maria they will always be together. Now, that's love!I give this work my highest rating."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Of course For Whom the Bell Tolls is in English, but everyone speaks Spanish. Hemingway tries to create Spanish sounding English by stretching the syntax of English nearly to its breaking point, by rendering Spanish-ism into odd English phrases, like \\"what passes with thee?\\" for que pasa, a common Spanish greeting.Hemingway also uses archaic English usages to present forms that exist in Spanish, but are gone from English, like thee and thou for the second person pronoun. It makes for strange but captivating reading. Here is a writer rendering English into Spanish forms. The results are startling and not always enjoyable; but it always gives you the impression that you have entered another world.If the novel was written in more fluid English, the result would not have been so unusual. The very clumsiness of the language reminds the reader that this is a novel that is taking place in another, somewhat more formal language. And the English bears that imprint.When we read For Whom the Bell Tolls we can see English both reaching into its past to create diction of current usage, as well as using an odd and foreign syntax to give the illusion of another language. Often, this effect was criticized. But an open reading of this novel shows what an effective technique this is and how well it does the heavy lifting of expressing another culture's values on the level of language from one tongue to another."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I do not like to give too high merit to anything, be it book, movie, CD, simply because I think the imagination can conjure up things reality cannot deliver on. But I feel a responsibilty to share my thoughts - my true impressions of the book, unbridled by any fear of corruption by doing so.Maybe it was the John Donne quote, maybe it was the writing style, or maybe it was the incredible, moving story that made me, directly after finishing the book, put it down and think it was one of the greatest things I had ever read. Trying to say WHY would take too long and probably not make much sense to anyone else. But I suppose I owe it to readers to try.Here is what you need to know. This is a love story, a war story, in a sense, a God story (but not what you probably are thinking). It powerfully, deeply, honestly portrays the human experience, in all its doubting, hating, loving, sorrowing fullness.Read this book. And give it time, because it starts somewhat slow and may turn current readers, who want all action and want to be told plainly everything (they don't like to think or discover meaning for themselves!) Even if you don't like it, you won't be the worse, and at least you can say you've read one of America's best novels (that I have read)."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway is a master storyteller, and FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is a fine example of that mastery. The strengths lie in character development, and thematic presentation. The weaknesses lie in it's style, and language. For example, the use of what passes for colloquial Spanish, particularly in it's profane form, seems artificial and clumsy. I also think elements of the plot tend to weaken or dilute the overall effect of the climax, like when Pilar reads Jordan's palm to tell his future, thus foreshadowing events to come.That being said, this is a very inspirational book, and Hemingway has a knack for grabbing the reader's attention, and keeping it. He is especially good in his short fiction, and an excellent example of that can be found within this novel, when Pilar tells the tale of her village. It is perhaps,the single most riveting and effective part of the novel.FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is of course one of the great novels to deal with sacrifice for righteous causes, and devotion to higher ideals. It reminds me, in a way, of A TALE OF TWO CITIES, in that respect. It is a great noble work, and an indictment of war. There is also a great personal love story here. Hemingway writes (maybe intentionally) very cinematic novels."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I love this one. Great book. Ive read it 4 times now and each time it gets better and better. You begin to see things you didnt at first and then everything is more clear and its just great. A must have for every book lovers library"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"If you read only one, perhaps this should be it. I am not a trained student of Hemingway, or of literature for that matter. I know what I like, and I can recognize junk. You don't have to be an expert or even fully understand the author and his times to appreciate what a superb novel this is. As I was reading it, I could realize why Hemingway was so honored, even during his lifetime. The story is basic, though the setting is in unsual one for most American readers (who today probably would guess that the \\"Spanish Civil War\\" has something to do with General Lee and the Alamo). The main character, Robert Jordan, is an American leftist attached to a guerilla unit in the Spanish mountains. Like Hemingway, Jordan is intelligent, deliberate, controlled, passionate, and motivated by his ideals. Through him the reader encounters the chaos of this amateur war that is being played by foreign professionals. The entire book, which is of some size, revolves around one mission and take places over only a couple of days. In addition to a political statement and a philosophical autobiography, this is a superb war novel. The book build up the mission (to destroy a bridge) so much that by the closing pages of the book, as the mission is unfolding, my heart was literally racing and I could not put the book down. I won't spoil it - but this one ends like so may of EH's books, and like EH thought life itself would end . . . .Great book - don't miss this classic."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"\\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is a perfect example of what makes Ernest Hemmingway one of, if not the, preeminent writers of the first half of the 20th Century.Although his machismo style does not appeal to everyone, (especially the feminists who find his portrayals of women to be degrading and unrealistic) this is a perfect example of his style and of the cruel realities of the world of his time.Hemingway's signature terse writing style lends itself perfectly to the telling of the story of the loyalist guerillas during the Spanish Civil War. His writing style perfectly captures the way of thinking one would have while in such a situation.Although undoubtedly the love story between Robert Jordan and Maria is weak, yet it doesn't detract from the overall beauty and poignancy of the story, for first and foremost this is a war story.Hemingway does what he does best in \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\", which is to capture a slice of life from a bygone era. Although set 70 years ago, Hemingway's story has as much meaning in a modern setting as they did when they were written. It is a true classic in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I had put off reading this book because I felt it would be \\"boring.\\" I was so very, very wrong! Granted, I have not read everything Hemingway has written, but I find it difficult to believe he could have written anything to surpass this novel. I am thankful that I read \\"A Farewell To Arms\\" and \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" before reading this book, as it would have set the standard too high.In the previous books by Hemingway that I've read, he didn't seem to develop the characters fully and many of the scenes were only the sparcest of details. It seemed much had to be filled in by the reader. But 15 years after writing \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" Hemingway breaks through with \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls!\\" In this book, Hemingway gives depth to his characters - the reader comes to know, understand, and identify with each character in this book. Hemingway also provides a wonderful description of the area. One can almost envision the mountains and villages and the bridge, which plays a central role. During the scenes involving fighting, the reader can almost hear the gun shots and watch the anguish of those injured or killed. Even in the quiet times of the book, the reader can easily place themselves at the same table as the characters and truly feel they are a part of the story.The ending is easily figured out, but that doesn't seem to matter. Even though the reader might suspect or even know what is to happen, the events leading up to it keep the reader enthralled.This book is a real page-turner, and Hemingway at his best. This is not just a \\"guy's book\\" - not at all! This is a story for both genders. Treat yourself to a literary masterpiece! You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"First off, I am not a literature expert and do not claim to know all the finer details present in this book. What I do know is that as an engineer, I enjoy reading, especially classics, and this book has given me confidence in Hemingway as one of the best authors in American literature.My first and only experience with Hemingway before was &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; in high school. Part of the problem may have been in high school, but I was honestly not impressed. However, since that time I watched the movie &quot;In Love and War&quot;, I have found Hemingway more interesting, but still didn't have time to read him until I found &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. I think this book is just fantastic. The detail that goes into this narrative makes the book hard to put down and very full of meaning.The conflict that the hero, Robert Jordan, goes through internally, externally, and mentally form the basis of what has to be one of the best character studies I've seen in a novel. I also find the historical perspective quite fascinating as a person who enjoys history and culture. The Spanish Civil War is something that is overlooked in our education, and I find that even the fictional account here gives insight into the larger issues faced, even if the story is focused on the inner conflict of the main character.This book really shows the inferiority of modern novels and will definitely drive me to continue to read Hemingway. The only question is what next. I can't imagine anything being better than &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. My only complaint is in the style of the ending. While it serves an interesting purpose, I don't feel it quite lives up to the quality of the rest of the book, but the concept is fantastic."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom the Bell Tolls is a fantastic book. Hemingway writes heroes with fears, doubts, and faults so well that I feel a deep connection with them. Not every man is a John Wayne; passing through life clear of purpose and without second thoughts. (But watch a little tv and you'd think it were so.) Hemingway creates characters I can understand, appreciate, and connect with. Also, Robert Jordan's love interest reflected my own with my fiancee. The book was fantastic for its story, its plot, the characters and the way it made me feel reading it and afterwards."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This book is about an American, Robert Jordan, who joins the Republican Army (communists) to fight the nationalists during the civil war in Spain in the 1930's. He joins a guerilla-group which is given the mission to blow up a bridge to obstruct the fascists' offensive. Although he has a bad feeling about the whole situation he persists.I found the character pilar the most interesting, fulfilling a key role of telling the background story (her experience in the war sofar) as well as being the one who keeps the whole group together (her insights give the American, Robert Jordan, some information about Pablo, the member of the group who can't be trusted).Although it has bothered a lot of people (read the other reviews), for me the translated Spanish words and little sentences really added something to the atmosphere of the book as well as to a better depiction of the characters."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"No book has had as powerful an effect on me as this one. I have never read as effective a treatment of loyalty; love; fear; courage. When I reached the last page, after Jordan's injury forces him to leave his love Maria to carry on and he must await his death from the pursuing Fascists, he lies in the pine-scented forest (I can still smell it), lining up his rifle on the leader of the soldiers, the pine-needles pricking through his shirt as he lay, he waited for the officer to enter the sunlit area ... when I read this I wept. A tremendous, heartstopping novel."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is one of Hemmingway's best. It is about war, love, and the endless fight for the opportunity to be human. It has a heartwarming love story that is beautiful without degenerating into a sappy Danielle Steele novel. Perhaps the main thrust of the book can be summed up in one of is most famous lines: &quot;The world is a fine place and worth fighting for and I hate very much to leave it.&quot; For those who grow weary of 20th century novels that are driven by stream-of-consciousness and herky-jerky narrative, they will find Hemmingway's straightforward, lucid yet eloquent prose quite refreshing. This is a very well done book for the ages."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"In the most obvious sense, this book did a fine job of outlining a historical situation that, until I read this, was unknown to me. On a broader level, it was a compelling characterization of both the horrors and romance of war. It also blatantly reveals the heavy toll that responsibility and power have on an individual. This is a classic because Hemingway was able to enthrall the reader with intense detail."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I'm writing this review as the result of an experiment. I decided to test my theory that no matter how good a book or symphony or painting or aria or whatever have you, someone somewhere is going to think it is a piece of crap. I have observed this phenomenon in my one thousand plus speaking engagements where typically I will receive hundreds of glowing reviews and then there will be one disgruntled person who thinks I should be thrown out the window or fed to the alligators.Here you have my favorite novel from a lifetime of reading voraciously -- Hemingway's FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. A novel that has it all: story, character, historical background, description, dialogue, love story, thematic subtext. And above all that, it is pure poetry. And yet in reading the reviews on Amazon, I see not merely one but several poor souls who just never got it. One lady had to keep a dictionary next to her to get through Hemingway's vocabulary. Too many syllables for her, I guess. (How many syllables are there in \\"ignoramus?\\") One example of how subjective it all is: Hemingway writes as though he is speaking Spanish even though he is writing in English. I am in awe of his ability to do this, and in fact one of the reviewers, a native Spanish speaker, confirms that Hemingway is perfectly accurate in his translation. Still, another brilliant reviewer doesn't get it, thinks that Hemingway must be illiterate.Am I being a snob? I prefer not to think so. I just think it illustrates a wonderful quality of human beings, that they can and will disagree on just about anything. I simply want it to be known that this reviewer gives this book a ten-star review. More than any movie, FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck. The reaction is visceral (look that up in your dictionary). If you have not read it, don't wait -- order the damn thing right away. It will enrich your life beyond description...or not!"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway is the best American author ever. He says more in fewer words than anyone else.

It is one of the top twenty-five books of modern times."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Ernest Hemingway wrote another great adventure story with FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. His style is very vivid, and reading the book is like being on the scene of the Spanish Civil War itself. Prior to reading FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, I had read all his short stories while taking a short story course in college, then THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA. The short stories vary in style, except that they are also written in short sentences, just as Hemingway preferred. THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA tends to be boring, but FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is fascinating throughout.

I prefer the unabridged versions which in this case was quite long.I found the subject matter mysteriously complex ( who doesn't find love complex ) yet simplistic in it's exposition true to Hemingway's style.Each character is carefully developed and his/her relationships meticulously crafted and consistent with their dispositions.Hemingway explores humanity and allows us a glimpse of it in the most trying circumstances....love and war.It really is very hard to discuss the book without ruining details and the outcome so I will stop here.I would suggest getting the audicopy on ipod and listening to it on your next long journey overseas."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is Hemingway's virtual personal account of the Spanish Civil War at the ground level. The central character is an American from Montana who speaks fluent Spanish and is known as the \\"dynamiter\\". He sides with the republicans, as did other Americans such as the Lincoln Brigade and many other westerners and soviets pitted against the Fascists supported by the Nazis and Italians. The American, referred to as Roberto or Ingles by the guerilla band, joins the band behind enemy lines with the expressed purpose of blowing up a bridge to coincide with a republican offensive. The brutality of war is evident by Maria, with the band, who was brutalized and raped while her parents were shot just because they were republicans. In contrast, demonstrating that war is brutal on both sides, Pablo, the band's soddened leader, is traumatized with guilt and feelings of defeat that haunt him with own past butchering of townsmen that were friendly to the Fascists. There is a general feeling of despair as the band attempts to regenerate itself to action in the face of an enemy well supported by aircraft and weaponry. Another key character is Pablo's lady friend Pilar who, once associated with a famous bull fighter, speaks often of manliness and she takes over the leadership temporarily vacated by Pablo's morose fall into a drunken stupor. The discussion of Spanish views of manhood provide an opportunity for Hemingway to expose his fascination with bull fighting and machismo that is both courageous and revolting. Time is fleeting, although the paperback is almost 470 pages, within in the book as an accelerated romance develops between Roberto and Marie that heightens an expectation of loss as the two fall deeply in love. Hemingway consumes the bulk of the book with dialogue within the personalities in the band such as the gypsy and the old man who seems the most dependable and balanced member. Action picks up toward the end of the book as Pablo's band prepares to take action while the Fascists search the mountains for Pablo's associate and his band on a neighboring mountain. As Roberto and Pablo's band seek to destroy the bridge, the republican attack formes in the distance. There is an expectation of great loss and the book climaxes with the attack on the bridge and you feel an uncertainness of doom for the central characters as the end is abrupt and almost shocking. The book is a classic and very realistic, it may be too long for younger readers but it certainly outlines the tragedies of war and perhaps underlines the horror of Civil War. One of Senator John McCain's favorite books as noted on the Imus in the Morning radio show last week."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This rich novel explores many fundamental human themes including love, duty, perseverance, and sacrifice. Like all great literary works, it transcends the era in which it was written and speaks to readers for generations after the author has passed away. This is a great novel by a great writer, and I can't understand how anyone would rate this less than five stars. The novel spans only a few days, and contains the story of Robert Jordan, a volunteer in Spain who is sent on mission to blow up a key bridge with a band of guerillas behind the Nationalist lines as part of a Republican offensive. The novel is primarily a dialogue between Jordan and the members of the guerilla band. The tension builds to the final confrontation at the bridge. There are several extensive sidebars not directly relevant to the main plot, including the discussion of the fate of Pilar's village, and the last stand of El Sordo's guerilla band. These are probably the best written, most detailed, sections of the novel. Some would say that these distract from the main story, but I argue that they add richness and depth to the characters and to the events of the main plot.EH writes with a direct, readable prose. His characters are complex and multi-dimensional, and often conflicted. One may argue as to whether this is his best work or not, or whether he was a better writer of short stories or novels. What does it matter? This is one of the greatest war novels, indeed one of the greatest novels, ever written. In terms of richness and depth, only Zola's La Debacle is comparable to this work.One thing in particular struck me about this story that make it an unconventional war novel. Most war novels either take the philosophic position of patriotic glory for the homeland or war as a pointless exercise in destruction. Robert Jordan has a unique perspective in this book in that he is an outsider fighting for a cause, not for a country or a government. He isn't driven by patriotism, or love of country. He isn't fighting for the national army of his homeland. This gives him a unique perspective to question why he is fighting and what he is fighting for, particularly after he falls in love."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom The Bell Tolls takes place in the mountains of Spain during a time of suspicion, suspense, and danger. Robert Jordan comes into the novel during the Spanish Civil War preparing to assist the side of the Republic in the fight against the fascists. To do so he is given the task of blowing up key bridges behind enemy lines with only a small band of guerillas to help him. The novel only covers a four day time period the book takes its readers into the minds of the soldiers and through a world that is both physically and mentally destroyed by the war. The action in the book may seem slow at first but that is because the action is portrayed through the underlying themes within the book. Battles are not fought only physically but mentally, as each character must battle mistrust, fear, and remaining moral in such a time of destruction. The conflict is not only with the fascists but also with each other. Hemingway takes these themes and challenges readers to put themselves in the character's shoes, and step into their world.Hemingway himself has had plenty of experience in way from WWI, the Spanish Civil War, WWII, and other wars. In WWI he spent four months in France as an Ambulance driver. He was wounded by a piece of shrapnel. He returned to war in 1922 as a reporter to cover the war between Turkey and Greece. In 1937-1938 Hemingway went to Spain four times to cover the Spanish Civil War. There he witnessed atrocities by both sides, leaving him with little respect for no one.This leads into the ideas behind For Whom the Bell Tolls. The theme morality, good versus evil, and the dangers both mentally and physically of fighting a war come out into the opening during the first few pages of the novel.Good and evil is not defined in this novel as the traditional hero v. villain role. Instead it questions whom the good and bad guys are within the war. In the end it shows that neither exist. Both sides have committed many sins throughout the war, and show little compassion for the other. Robert Jordan finds very quickly that the republic he fights for has endorsed acts of terror and brutality. Especially during the massacre scene were the men \\"were armed with fails\\"(104) designed to beat the prisoners to death or when Marty \\"was sorry for them as human beings if it should be necessary to liquidate them\\"(421). Robert Jordan discovers that neither good nor evil exists on either side, only acts out of self-perseverance.This idea of survival also ties into the theme of morality. In For Whom the Bell Tolls each character must make their own decision on their basic principles. Pablo originally chooses selfishness when he \\"took some dynamite\\"(369) and ran off, but showed a little bit of morality when he returned later. The rest of the characters had their own moral debate as whether or not to \\"sell Pablo to the fascists\\"(219) or just kill him. The book is filled with little moral debates and decision that must be made by the characters.The danger of fighting in a war is very straightforward in this book. The precautions taken by Robert Jordan with the bridge and his continually questioning of sentries portrays the danger. Pablo does not want to blow the bridge because he is for \\"the good and safety of all\\"(54) while Robert Jordan and the others analysis the risks behind the task. In Gaylord's bar back in Madrid all the characters come a swap stories and comment how \\"dangerous it is to make jokes in jokes\\"(246). The dangers of war are grave and the consequences of failure are harsh.At the beginning of the book all the themes and ideas that are seen through out the book were introduced. The concept that there is not true good or evil in war, only two different opinions, has great value and weight within the book. It has great effect on the main characters later in the book as they get set for their final objective. They must make choices choosing whether the republic was worth all of this death and destruction. The book accurately portrays its themes with interest and excitement. It brings the reader into the campground and builds the appropriate connects and attitudes with certain characters. The book touches on issues such as gender, control, death, and other important issues. Hemingway writes this in his traditional style, with short choppy sentences. But with his style creates a world full of imagery and symbolism. His simple sentence structure develops a complex environment of destruction and survival. Each and every character within the book has their importance, as there are few. Through his writing the readers develop a certain connection with the mountain and the characters that reside there.The book For Whom A Bell Tolls is a great read for anyone interested in the effects and complications of war. It has many great lessons within it and an abundance of information to be learned from. The book is written by a man who experienced many similar situations in his lifetime and who came close to death working in various wars around the world. This book is simply a classic novel that captures the true form of humanity at both its greatest and its worst."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom the Bell Tolls, by Ernest Hemingway is an excellent story of trials, courage, love and sacrifice. In this book, Hemingway tells the story of a young American professor of Spanish while he works as a dynamiter in the Spanish Civil War. His mission: to cover the attack of the Army of the Republic on a pass in the mountains by blowing up a bridge to prevent reinforcements from arriving at the front. Through the course of his mission, he will experience a roller coster ride of emotion, from the heights of love to the depth of sorrow. In this book, Hemingway gives us excellently developed and rounded characters. Their histories are bared to us, as they tell of the horror that is civil war. For Whom the Bell Tolls is an excellent book for any high schooler wishing for an amazing book, or for any adult who wishes to have an extremely well written book to read."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Author Ernest Hemingway spared little in this searing look at the Spanish Civil War. Readers see that hatred, loyalty, doubt, atrocity, ideals, and emotional wear were all part of this tragic conflict. The story centers on American volunteer Robert Jordan and his anti-fascist comrades, a band of Spanish Loyalist guerillas operating in the hills behind enemy lines in 1937. Jordan is planning to blow up a Fascist-held bridge as part of an upcoming Loyalist/Republican offensive. His comrades include Pablo, a once-dependable leader now unstable and sick of war, Pilar, a woman of remarkable fiber, and Maria, a victim of fascist atrocities with whom Jordan falls in love. These guerillas hide in the hills while Hitler's bombers fly overhead helping the fascists. Readers learn of atrocities committed by both sides, and see that ideals can die along with those that fall in battle.This 1940 novel makes a powerful statement, despite losing some effect from Hemingway's wordiness and too-lengthy descriptions. Despite this flaw, readers see the cruelties of war, and sense the author's heartsickness at this dreadful conflict."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This book is simply amazing.

The final scenes are very, very powerful and the drama he creates from beginning to end is great. As with all great novels, you care about the characters and get involved with the story.

When i read how Pilar explictly descirbed the accounts of the killings, it made my heart ache and i felt like i was part of teh trio sitting on the hill listening to her retelling the story. The part i found most moving was when Robert and Maria, had to say goodye to eachother.

Hemingway tells us through his work that ultimately, our brief moment in the sun is nothing more than a chance to do something special and worthwhile, and it is up to us to seize the moment or let it pass. For Whom the Bell Tolls reads far better than The Sun Also Rises, and even though the settings are completely different, I think the same themes about hard-edged valor come through in both. Feminist attempts to emasculate Hemingway (as in other reviews here) seem rather cynical and pointless to me. I enjoyed this book very much. Hemingway has some profound things to say about life. You may not find the bitter message politically correct, but the truth has a way of being enlightening even if unpopular."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For whom The Bell TollsFor whom The Bell Tolls is probably my favorite novel by Hemingway.

Jordon's inner monologues fascinate and clearly demonstrate Hemingway's skill with language and character development. Jordan, at one point comments to himself, that he is his own best companion. Because of his wartime responsibilities, he cannot allow himself to be overcome by emotion, which he considers a luxury. Whenever he feels anger, deep love, disappointment, foreboding, fear, anything that will distract him from his purpose, he talks himself down and refocuses. In such a relatively brief period, he begins to love life as never before, because of his feelings for Maria.

Give this a read."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom the Bell Tolls, written by the well respected and one of the greatest authors of all times, Earnest Hemingway, is based on Hemingway's experience in the Spanish Civil War during 1937, when he went to cover it for the North American Newspaper Alliance. He has written many other spectacularly historic books like The Sun Also Rises, Farewell to Arms, and numerous other accounts of his real adventures covering other major historic events in American history. Hemingway's characteristic laconic, terse and fluid prose and dialogue shine radiantly throughout this book giving off his unique style of writing. There are layers and layers of emotion, passion, and personal pain. You are transported to the mountains of Spain with Jordan and a band of Spanish guerilla fighters. His description of the characters is so incredibly real, that the reader feels as though you could find their names in a history book.For Whom the Bell Tolls begins and ends in a pine-scented forest, somewhere in Spain all in sixty-eight hour period, in which he meets up with the guerilla group, falls in love with a Spanish girl named Maria, and blows up a key bridge behind enemy lines. The year is 1937 and the Spanish Civil War is in full swing. Robert Jordan, a demolition expert attached to the International Brigades lies \\"flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees.\\" (1) The sylvan setting, however, is at sharp odds with the reason Jordan is there: he has come to blow up a bridge on behalf of the antifascist guerrilla forces. He hopes he'll be able to rely on their local leader, Pablo, to help carry out the mission, but upon meeting him, Jordan has his doubts: \\"I don't like that sadness, he thought. That sadness is bad. That's the sadness they get before they quit or before they betray. That is the sadness that comes before the sell-out.\\" (85) For Pablo, it seems, has had enough of the war. He has amassed for himself a small herd of horses and wants only to stay quietly in the hills and attract as little attention as possible. Jordan's arrival--and his mission--have seriously alarmed him. Hemingway touches on, among other things, love, loyalty, sacrifice for the greater good, rape, suicide, altruism, and social injustice.For Whom the Bell Tolls is an excellent book, which breaks down the tragedies of war and the emotional struggles that come along with it. Hemingway is definitely the best author of his era, with a different approach to a story idea. The reading makes it hard to go through the book, but the story line keeps the reader connected with the book. I enjoyed Hemingway's unique style and hope to read more of his books with pleasure."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"The political passions that drove Spain to the brink and over the brink of national insanity have almost been forgotten now, but Hemingway's great novel of those times remains. Both fascism and communism have been consigned to the ash heap of history, but we still get here some sense of how the people of that nation were clawing at each other for barely understood reasons. Hemingway's handling of his material is almost beyond praise; it's a genuinely great novel, and a full workout of his trademark and massively influential prose style. The only flaw is the character of Maria and the instantaneous love affair the author cooks up between this refugee and the American interloper Robert Jordan. Amidst the dramatic and desperate events of the story it just doesn't ring true. I would rate this Hemingway's second best novel, after &quot;The Sun Also Rises.&quot;"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"The complexity, depth and beauty of this book are immeasurable. I have never read a more moving book."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This novel brings one into close contact with the forces in dreadful conflict during civil war--Solidarity versus Brutality; Hemingway portrays both thoroughly. The story told by Pilar in this book seemed to haunt me for a few days, the images were so clear, and as one will find by reading it, it is a story which has a very grave lucidity, as if you wished Hemingway would drown the scene in a sea of lifeless and complex words. The descriptions of the love story and Jordan's internal motivations immediately soothe the unsettling images of war, and the novel as a whole works paradoxically to the point where both sets of images collide, and leave the reader both unsettled and fulfilled simultaneously."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway used his experiences as a journalist during the Spanish Civil War to build the structure for this novel. His descriptions of the settings are superb. The novel is a great introduction to the Spanish Civil War, a war with which many Americans are unfamiliar. Hemingway used characters like Pablo to show how people lose their humanity during war. The story is powerful. His main character, Robert Jordan, begins to question whether anything good will come of all the fighting.Despite its many wonderful attributes, this novel has some problems. The dialogue is stilted. The romance (as in all Hemingway novels) is unbelievable. Finally, Hemingway should have stuck to English. His use of Spanish in this book is embarassing.Nonetheless, in my opinion, For Whom the Bell Tolls should be required reading for all U.S. high school students. It's truly a classic."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I thought that this book was very good. Ernest Hemingway was very clear and you were able to even picture how it was in the war.

I think that it had a very good ending and it was very well written."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"There is a Japanese proverb: &quot;The Zen Master strikes the bullseye by not looking at the center of the target.&quot; Hemingway strikes the bullseye of his aesthetic in FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS; in the process, he continues to transform our lives and the literature within them. Nothing any other writer of his generation wrote, and few of any generation, can compare to many of the sentences in FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. Consider such jewels as El Sordo's reflection on life and death when he knows, for good and for sure, that he will not see another dawn: &quot;Living was a hawk in the sky.&quot; Robert Jordan's reflections throughout the book give us insight, as other readers have noted in the reviews in Amazon.com, into Hemingway's philosophy but also into Hemingway's ability to create and develop a well-rounded, full-blooded, fully-dimensional man. Hemingway based Jordan on Robert Merriwell, an American guerrilla fighter in the war who disappeared in the Guadarrama mountains while on a mission behind the Fascist lines. Merriwell, like Jordan, was from Montana and formerly, a college Spanish professor. But &quot;living was a hawk in the sky.&quot; Yes. Hemingway reminds us in FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS that life is ever more precious for the dreams we dare, the love we share, and the lives we save (most importantly, our own). Jordan possesses none of the nihilism and preoccupation with the self of Hemingway's earlier protagonists. For anyone who thinks this novel does not relate to our so-called cynical age, I would urge them to take a trip to the Thai-Burmese border. My literature students in Northern Thailand said this was the one novel I assigned them--they read THE GREAT GATSBY, IN DUBIOUS BATTLE, FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, and MAN'S FATE--which they could deeply identify with.FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS could've been over 1, 000 pages and it still would read as compelling, as intriguing, and as wise as it does in the original 471 page first edition. It speaks to the oppression of the human spirit, an oppression that continues to haunt mankind. It will speak, both as a testament to love and courage and hope and as a warning against indifference and selfishness and cowardice, for all time. Hemingway does in this novel what he continues to do in THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA: teach us that literature is at its best when it gives us life lessons, and not merely reflections on living. Viva Hemingway."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I revisited this book in my early 40's and came away resold on Hemingway as one of America's greatest writers and an artist who stands the test of time. It's a shame, in fact, that Hemingway's caricature-friendly persona, life and writing style have sometimes obsured his work. Forget the macho image and the stories of drinking and hunting. He is an artist of the first order.For Whom... is a novel about the important things -- life, love, death, fear, the attraction and horror of war. What struck me throughout was how innocent the characters are and how genuinely Hemingway depicts the most difficult subjects, be it war (in this case the Spanish Civil War) or the love between Maria and Robert Jordan.Hemingway is a writer we need in our times. He focuses on the big, important issues without cynicism, and never shies from exposing what is in our hearts and minds. A classic."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"It's difficult to point at one work of a writer like Ernest Hemingway and claim it to be the best, but that is the claim that I would make for \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\"This is a story that captures both the true spirit and the doubtful minds of war. It portrays both courage and cowardice, in the beautifully descriptive words that Hemingway was known for. His main character Robert Jordan is an American college instructor who leaves his job to take part in the Spanish Revolution, with a strong conviction in his heart and truly believing that he can make a difference. The story encompasses a time frame of slightly less than three days, during which he plots to blow a strategic bridge at precisely the right time. In those three days he falls in love with a young Spanish girl in the encampment where he is awaiting that moment and is involved in a character conflict with one of the guerrilla fighters by the name of Pablo.This is a well paced story and never boring, with action suspense and romance, all coming together in a setting where you can feel the cold and smell the forest in the way that only Hemingway can describe it. A splendid and beautifully told story that I would recommend to anyone of any age or gender. For that reason I would place \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" at the top of the heap among all of his works.In my opinion this great story is the pinnacle of Hemingway's talent. A must read for anyone interested in great literature."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Evocative, tragic, brutal, bitter. Using the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s as his backdrop, Hemmingway critiques warfare from the political abstractions and distant generals to the individual lives it destroys, and renders all in frighteningly powerful detail with every crosscurrent coming to bear on each character in ways that are viscerally wrenching, complex and yet clear. Every shade of character and dynamic is captured as several dozen people act out a small part in a large conflict in the two-and-a-half days of a mission to blow a bridge.Robert Jordan, an American in the volunteer brigades, arrives deep in the mountain wilderness of Spain with orders to recruit and employ the services of irregular militia hiding out there in the vicinity of a small bridge that will be key to an impending offensive. His task requires that he win the hearts and minds of these locals in order to secure their loyalty so that he might have an effective small force for carrying out his mission. But this group of people are of conflicting feelings and understandings about their place in the conflict and what it means to each of them. Some are wary and some callous, some dedicated to the fight and others only dedicated to themselves.We have real people-Anselmo's natural and true goodness, Pilar and El Sordo's dedication, Pablo's treachery, Maria's repeated loss of innocence. We have the politics and forces behind it all-selfish and hollow, or abstracted until it's no longer human. And we have warfare-sudden death, alone in the mountains, alone with your last thoughts, with the smell of burning flesh, with your last blood running silently into the dirt.Hemmingway spares us the simplistic narrative style of describing each character's feelings. Instead, he offers the scenes themselves with such insightful observation and flawlessly rendered detail that every one of the many conflicting shifts of allegiance happening in Pablo's scheming mind is writ in his every gesture and expression and telling silence. Neither the characters nor the narrator ever need discuss these in so many words. The tensions among the characters as they huddle in their cave hideout are a fascinating web of unexpected assessments of each other, shifts of power and influence, tactical and strategic wins and loses. Though never spoken of, the delicacy and danger of Jordan's human task is clear. As a contrast there is Maria, at first seeming too childish until we realize Jordan's love for her is love for lost innocence, and that she in turn-only seventeen-has every right to her emotional fragility and her desperation.And then there is the war itself, and here again Hemmingway's powers of observation and prose composition startle. Every action bears on every other, and the individuals are placed firmly in context from the cave to the local mountains to the whole of Spain to the abstractions of global political movements. Without a syllable of pedantry the author draws the relationship between each detail of individual action and the whole of the conflict. And vice versa, with ideals or their absence making each person's motives a little different, and often making helpless puppets of them all.There is very little in literature to compare with For Whom the Bell Tolls. It sees humanity at its very best and very worst simultaneously, and sees it directly in vivid, glimmering images and beautifully textured emotional nuance, without wordy narrative telling the reader what to think and when. The fact that Hemmingway yet controls our understanding with absolute ease and clarity is only half of the writer's art. His critique of warfare and its human toll, expressed in Jordan's arc of hope and tragedy and resignation, is as brutal as the fear and blood on the ground, and ultimately contemplates the interconnectedness of life and the sacrifices made to sustain it. \\"No man is an islande, intire unto itselfe... Ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.\\" Among the finest literature we have."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"There never has, and never will be, another writer with the lucidity and inestimable genius of Hemingway. Hemingway's characteristic laconic, terse, and fluid prose and dialogue shine radiantly throughout this book for the ages. Seeing our country in the midst of the war on terrorism and a growing divisiveness amongst Americans, I feel, regardless of one's stance on war, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a great book to pick up right now.To stereotype and routinely categorize this great work as nothing more than a \\"war book\\" is to do it a grave injustice. Hemingway touches on, among other things, love, loyalty, sacrifice for the greater good, rape, suicide, altruism, and social injustice. For Whom the Bell Tolls manifests itself as a book that speaks to the reader in many indescribable ways. Hemingway's character development is masterful and unparalleled in literature. We come to know not only our intrepid protagonist Robert Jordan, moreover we come to know the inner thoughts and feelings of Anselmo, Maria, Pablo, Pilar, and Lieutenant Berrendo as Hemingway ingeniously flips from 3rd to 1st person narrative and then back to 3rd perdson on the drop of a dime.Perhaps the only negative of the book is the annoying censoring of curse words throughout the text such as, \\"I obscenity in the milk of science.\\" Ironically, Hemingway's hero Robert Jordan fights for the Communist Republic(which of course mandated censorship), and his own book ends up censored. Go figure. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this powerful tour de force and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Robert Jordan, an American, joins a guerrilla force fighting against the Facist government in Spain. It is 1937 at the peak of the Spanish Civil War and Jordan has been sent to blow up a bridge.Jordan is a dynamiter who knows weapons and military strategies. Among the gurerillas is a young woman, Maria, who becomes attracted to him.A man named Pablo appears to be in charge. However, it is his wife, Pilar, who is the real force behind the group. Pilar, is Spanish for pillar and is a symbol of the steadfastness of the group. During the early action of the story, it seems that Pilar's resolve for fighting has changed and he often resorts to drinking.Amidst the talk of killing we follow the activities of Robert and Marie. This mixture of love and war is a significant juxtaposition used by the author. With the tender moments of these two characters, it is as if this might be what the guerrilas are fighting for. The government's totalarianism attitude cannot tell them what to do and that gypsies like Rafael, foreigners like Robert, women like Pilar and Marie can all work and live together as equals.Hemingway has a master's givt for dialogue. We don't just read the words but are transported to the Spanish mountainside and are listening to the scenes such as Pilar and Pablo discussing a matador that Pable had seen and admired. It is so real that we can almost hear the crowd chant ole'.Hemindway was a reporter in Spain during the Civil War and his characters are honest in their actions loyal to one another and Spain and are described in great detail.The story mixes historical fact and speculative fiction in a most entertaining manner. Readers will enjoy the novel and feel as though they have read a work of extroadinary literary significance."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom The Bell Tolls by Ernest HemingwayBook Review by Benn BellThe title \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" is taken from a poem written by John Donne wherein he makes the claim that because of our common humanity, every death necessarily diminishes each of us, therefore, ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee. This is a book about death and dying set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War.Hemingway's novels and stories present a certain kind of hero: \\"The Code Hero.\\" This individual lives by his own code and struggles gracefully and bravely against death and annihilation. Another consistent theme found in Hemingway is courage under fire or dire circumstances, whether it is in the bull ring, behind enemy lines, or hunting man-eaters in the green hills of Africa. Cowardice is particularly loathed.The novel begins in 1937 at the height of the Spanish Civil War and takes place over a four day period. The chief protagonist is an American named Robert Jordon who has been tasked to blow up a bridge behind enemy lines in the Spanish mountains. He is aided in this task by a band of guerrillas headed by Pablo and the woman of Pablo, Pilar. We also meet the beautiful Maria. A young Spanish girl whose parents were murdered by Fascists soldiers who then raped and abused Maria. Some say that Maria represents Spain and her gang rape represent the despoilage of Spain by the Fascists.Robert and Maria fall in love at first sight. This is another recurring theme to be found in Hemingway, that humans can find salvation through romantic love. The couple makes love together in Jordon's sleeping bag on the ground outside the mouth of the cave where they are all hiding. He asks Maria \\"Did the earth move for thee?\\" This is the earliest I have seen this terminology in print and is now considered a clich&eacute;, but it may be that Hemingway coined this usage.Hemingway's use of language was controversial in this novel. Many Spanish words and phrases were translated literally word for word which gave a sense of the Spanish but sounds archaic and stilted to our English hearing ears. For example, the Spanish characters in the novel referred to each other as thee and thou. The traditional second person singular in English is \\"thou/thee/thy\\". The most exact way of translating \\"tu\\" from Spanish is \\"thou\\" or \\"thee\\". This was a bold experiment. Once the convention was understood and accepted one got used to and even grew to like it.During the course of the novel many flashbacks and digressions take place as various characters tell their stories and reminiscence about the past. We learn, for example, that Jordon's Grandfather was a Civil War hero in the America's war of rebellion. We also learned that his father was a coward and that he shot himself to death with a pistol. It is indeed ironic that Hemingway's own father committed suicide and that Hemingway took his own life with a shot gun many years later.Death is the primary focus of the novel with much discussion amongst the characters about what it is like to kill another human being, was it the right thing to do and what would it be like to die. In the end, Jordon is fatally wounded after successfully completing his mission and trying to escape. He waits by the roadside while the others get away, hoping to kill as many of the enemy soldiers as he can before he dies.It took me a long time to get around to reading this book. I have been carrying it around with me since 1971. I finally read it in 2011. Forty years. It was well worth the wait. While each man's death may diminish me to some extent, this novel has made me whole."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"With vivid, descriptive prose, Hemingway takes us into the mind of a soldier. Focused on duty and his mission, our main character encounters love among the carnage, but even that does not sway him from his duty. Though at times a bit long-winded, Hemingway brings the internal battle of war to the surface. The self-talk that goes on shows the conflict behind the rough exterior. We also see the useless deaths that take place because of the uncertainties that come with war."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I have been interested, as a pro-Republican partisan, in the Spanish Civil War since I was a teenager. What initially perked my interest, and remains of interest, is the passionate struggle of the Spanish working class to create its own political organization of society, its leadership of the struggle against Spanish Fascism and the romance surrounding the entry of the International Brigades, particularly the American Abraham Lincoln Battalion of the 15th Brigade, into the struggle.Underlying my interests has always been a nagging question of how that struggle could have been won by the working class. The Spanish proletariat certainly was capable of both heroic action and the ability to create organizations that reflected its own class interests i.e. the worker militias and factory committees. Of all modern working class uprisings after the Russian revolution Spain showed the most promise of success. Russian Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky noted in one of his writings on Spain that the Spanish proletariat at the start of its revolutionary period had a higher political consciousness than the Russian proletariat in 1917.That analysis calls into question the strategies put forth by the parties of the Popular Front, including the Spanish Communist Party- defeat Franco first, and then make the social transformation of society. Ernest Hemingway in his novel For Whom the Bells Toll weighs in on that question. Whatever value the novel had or has as a narrative of a small slice of the Spanish events one must look elsewhere to discovery the causes of the Republican defeat.Ernest Hemingway most definitively was in love with Spain and always lurking just below the surface was his love affair with death. That combination placed in the context of the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39 makes for an explosive, dramatic tale. The hero is an American, Robert Jordan, aka Ernest Hemingway, of fizzy politics but a desire to help the Spanish people. Additionally Jordan, if expediency demands it, is willing to face danger and death at the command of the Communist-dominated International Brigades (although it is not always clear whether he is a Lincoln Brigade volunteer or a freelancer). Hemingway's critique of the Stalinist domination of the military command and therefore authors of the military strategy that led to defeat at times overwhelms the story. His skewering of Andre Marty, leader of the International Brigades, also has that same effect. In short, Hemingway believed that 'outside forces' meddling in Spanish affairs led to death for Jordan and disaster for the Spanish people. Well, nobody expects nor is it mandatory for a novelist to be politically astute or correct. Here Hemingway joins the crowdThe one subject that Ernest Hemingway seemed consistently to excel at was the telling of war stories. And whatever else might be true of For Whom the Bell Tolls it is preeminently a war story. A classic war romance if you have also seen the movie treatment of the book starring Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman. It might be a male thing, it might be a Hemingway thing, or it might be that the nature of war lends itself to dramatic tension that holds a story together. Today, in some literary circles, it is not considered politically correct to laud works by such dead, white males as Hemingway but the flat out truth is that the man could write. If his work stands outside the current canon of American literary efforts then something is wrong with the new canon.To make matters worst the current leftist-oriented literary establishment, grizzled, hard-bitten battle-tested warriors that they are, has not been the only force that has taken aim at Hemingway's head. At the time of publication in 1940 the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, those who actually fought in Spain and the various Communist Parties throughout the world were unhappy with the novel. Why? Hemingway was too harsh on the deficiencies of the Communists, the International Brigades and the Republican forces in general. Above I mentioned that writers were not expected to be politically astute. That is one thing. But to say that Hemingway was essentially sabotaging the exiled Republican efforts to aid the refugees by the thrust of his novel is also politically wrong. The man did materially and militarily aid the Republican side (financially sponsoring volunteers and ambulances, as well as reportage). That accrues to his honor. In short, Hemingway's writings-yes. Hemingway's politics no"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is a great novel perhaps approaching a masterpiece and part of the enjoyment is the drama; so, I have not described the plot elements and those should be left as surprises for the reader.I had read \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Hemingway and was reading an essay by Raymond Chandler, the famous detective writer and screenplay writer of the 1930s through to the 1950s. He made the comment in his essay stating that \\"Farewell to Arms\\" set the standard for twentieth century fiction. With that encouragement I bought the book, read it, then ran out and bought most of Hemingway's other novels and a collection of his short stories. This novel from 1939 is his among his best works, and perhaps \\"Farewell to Arms\\" would be his best novel. Some of his other works such as \\"Sun Also Rises\\" does not have the depth and balance of the present work. This is among Hemingway's best with a good balance of prose, story, characters, and drama. It is one of his longer novels - most are short or about 300 pages - and this present book approaches 500 pages.The Bloomsbury Guide has picked 375 top fiction authors, and among those 375 has picked 40 \\"masterpieces\\" and they include Hemingway's \\"Farewell to Arms.\\" His contemporary, F. Scott Fitzgerald did not have any of his novels among the top 40, and there is only a select group of American writers in the Bloomsbury guide - which includes all writers. Other masterpieces include Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary,\\" Lawrence's \\"Sons and Lovers,\\" Tolstoys's \\"War and Piece\\" and Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" - as a sample. \\"Farewell to Arms\\" is shorter, more concise, and has more punch or drama than the present novel.The story is about the fight by the partisans or guerrillas in the Spanish mountains fighting during the Spanish civil war of the late 1930s. It involves Robert Jordan, a young American, and a girl Maria. It is part love story and part a war story. Hemingway visited Spain as a war correspondent during the period. Overall, it lacks the drama and action of \\"Farewell to Arms\\" and is a bit rambling by comparison.The prose is simply outstanding - as in other Hemingway novels - and the opening of the book is unforgettable:\\"He lay flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees. The mountainside sloped gently where he lay; but below it was steep and he could see the dark of the oiled road winding through the pass. There was a stream alongside the road and far down the pass he saw a mill beside the stream and the falling water of the dam, white in the summer sunlight.\\"That prose is very similar to his masterpiece: \\"Farewell to Arms.\\"Part of the fun reading the book is the plot and I would avoid knowing any more than that until you read the book. The prose is exceptional and on par with Fitzgerald, Henry James, Bellow, and similar writers.5 Star masterpiece."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Just finished listening to the audiobook version, and this is my first experience of Hemingway other than a couple of short stories in a distant academic past. I can see that his reputation is deserved, and will most certainly check out his other major titles. The story was absorbing and the characters true and complex in their relationships. The romance between Robert Jordan and Maria was beautiful and heartbreaking. Most of all, the dialogue has an utterly authentic ring, and transports you into rural Spanish culture. Much of this effect is due, I'm sure, to Alexander Adams' masterful reading, and especially his facility with this Latinized language."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This was the first book by Hemmingway that I ever read.

This is beside the point. Hemingway gives an excellent description of the Spanish civil war as it is seen from a handful of individuals. Hemingway shows a profound understanding of the Spanish people and their mentality. Readers who primarily draw conclusions from the fact that the female protagonist's hair has been cut short (by the falange not the male protagonist) have probably read too many (Freudian) psychology books."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I happen to think Hemingway is one of the most overrated novelists of the 20th century, but this particular book is &quot;a good read.&quot; Hemingway does deal with many subjects such as duty, brutalization, love, or loyalty, all the while telling a good, moving story.

The Spanish Civil War is simply a pressure cooker that brings out the inner being that truly defines the person, in all their fragile and sometimes irrational glory.

Granted, there are some dry parts in the book but other parts well make up for it."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is a masterpiece. This historical fiction from Hemingway is in my opinion far better than the other two Hemingway novels that I have read (The Sun Also RisesandA Farewell To Arms), and for the first time triggers the same kind of admiration for Hemingway from me that I had always been so puzzled to see from others. If you're looking for a taste of Hemingway, this is the book I would recommend. If you've read other Hemingway and been less than impressed, try this one before you give up on him completely.This long book takes place over just a few days, and follows Robert Jordan as he works behind enemy lines during the Spanish Civil War. While containing plenty of suspense and action, the primary focus of this book is delving into the psyches of Jordan and the irregulars he recruits for his mission. A stark and honest look into the minds of simple people caught up in the sweeping events of a large war is something Hemingway excels at, and it really shows in this book. While at times being perhaps a bit over the top with the rambling and inane thought processes of his characters, he seemed to ease up on it a bit with this story, instead focusing more on what was relevant and on progressing the story. And personally, I liked Hemingway's use of Spanish and the literal translation during much of the dialogue. Rather than being distracting, I felt that this method helped highlight the romantic nature of the Spanish language (and simultaneously reminded me of some of the basic Spanish that I had forgotten).The characters in this book are also great. Robert Jordan, Maria, Pilar, Pablo, and Anselmo are particularly well-done and unforgettable. Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed the innocence and sweetness of Maria, and didn't find her to be unrealistic in either her response to mistreatment or her love for Jordan. (Is it that she fell in love so easily? that she is so blindingly trustful? that she is universally kind? or that she manages to not wallow in self-pity, that modern day feminists hate about this character?) Pilar and Pablo are both spectacularly done, being often hilarious and always intensely complicated. Giving faces to these and the other irregulars in this book helps the reader realize the impact on Individuals that wars can have.As a historical fiction, this book is excellent. You'll want to educate yourself more about the time and the circumstances around the Spanish Civil War while reading this book. Interestingly, Hemingway himself was somewhat involved in this war, acting as a journalist, but also supposedly supporting the Republic's fight, even going so far as to help train young men in the use of modern rifles. The content of the story comes off as being very possible, and the battles alluded to come out of real history. Indeed, even some of the peripheral characters are historical figures, including the well-described Andr&eacute; Marty (known as the Butcher of Albacete) that played a significant role toward the end of the book. Nicely grounded in historical fact, it makes the reading of this book all that much better.Very highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Rave about Hemingway: it's been done.Complete envy of the power of his dialogue to characterize: wallowing in it (as a writer)I'm here to rave about the audiobook reader Campbell Scott. If he does not speak fluent Spanish, he sure fooled me; in the delivery and staccato pacing of dialogue, the pronunciation of names, the perfect accent for each character, and the timing and understanding in general. The flat affect of the voice of Robert Jordan was perfect as well. It is obviously written in English but you feel you are hearing, thinking, feeling Spanish, and the formality and structure of the language, and even the \\"obscenity-ied\\" out cursing sound believable and natural.Other times when a reader attempts accents it comes off as contrived and ends up being farcical, but Campbell Scott does a brilliant job for the voices of each of the characters, from the lightness of Maria to the childlike Joaquin to the solidness of Pilar and the heavy paced tones of Pablo.A treat to listen to. I will look for other audiobooks Campbell Scott has done the reading for!"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Note that this review is for the audio book version of this novel. The narrator was Campell Scott. The audio quality was excellent and the narrator did a good job; he spoke with a slight Spanish accent, which seemed to fit well with the narrative. He did some characterizations with his voice, but not much compared to other narrators I've listened to.This is the second time that I have read this novel; the first time was over 30 years ago in high school. It's amazing to me how differently I looked at this book this time around. The first time I read it; I saw it as an adventure story with some interesting character development. The second time around I read it as a fascinating look at how war brings out the best and worst in people.I feel that Hemingway accurately captured how certain people would act in a civil war; the cruelty by some and acts of courage by others. In all cases, the characters were in a situation where there were no great options. He also accurately showed that there are good people on both sides of a conflict; that soldiers do suffer by taking the lives of others.As a Spanish speaker; I enjoyed Hemingway's use of language. Most of the unique use of English is actually a direct literal translation of Spanish. I hadn't heard the phrases directly translated that way before, but immediately recognized them as common Spanish slang.This is a book worth reading; you will learn that life is not always black and white."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is my third experience with Hemingway, and while I fully expect to complete the entire Hemingway collection, I can't quite find it within myself to award five stars to any of the works I've read to date.In each of the novels (The Sun Also Rises and Farewell to Arms being the other two) I've been entranced at times by the hauntingly beautiful writing, however there have been periods where the story drags, where the almost stream of consciousness style grinds the action to a halt. Not long enough to kill the story, but enough to impact the overall reading experience.This novel is set in Spain, during the Spanish Civil War, the idealogical precursor to the Fascist/Communist clash soon to come on the Eastern Front of World War II. The story primarily involves American Spanish professor and converted Republican partisan, Robert Jordan and the 72 hours he spends with an anti-fascist partisan force in the hours preceding a Republican offensive.The characters crafted by Hemingway are fascinating, most specifically the partisan leaders Pablo and Pilar. The interaction between the rebels and with Jordan are spellbinding. The character of Pilar is especially haunting and her story of the execution of the fascists (a/k/a prominent citizens) in her small Spanish village is some of the best and most captivating writing I've ever read.Unfortunately, in my opinion, this 470 page novel is about 100 pages too long, as it is interspersed with periods of inaction, punctuated by stream of consciousness meanderings, which admittedly many may find enjoyable.Some may find the style of language irritating (Thee, Thou, Thy mother, etc.) but I found this to be a minor issue. More problematic to me is what I can only guess is the censorship (either self censorship in light of the times or editorial censorship) whereby all instances of profanity or coarse language is omitted and replaced by bizarre alternatives. For example, these beauties from the mouth of Pablo, \\"I obscenity in the milk of all,\\" and \\"Go and obscenity thyself.\\" I find it hard to believe that Hemingway actually wrote this, and if not (or even if he did), these bizarre omissions cannot be rectified.Despite these minor complaints, this is an extremely educational piece of work, both from the standpoint of literature and for the insight it provides for an extremely important and interesting period of world history. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This tackles several questions: How war shapes men, past and present and what a real hero is.Set in the Spanish Civil War, the story revolves around the experiences of a volunteer fighter, an American college professor named Robert Jordan. Filled with idealism at first, watch him reconsider as he faces the prospect of his own death.One of Hemingway's finest."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is my first exposure to Ernest Hemingway and, after reading it, I wonder how I could go through eight years of high school and college and not read one Hemingway book. I loved this book! I have never taken so quickly to a piece of classic literature. Hemingway's style is powerful, evocative, and dramatic. And yet none of the prose is overly verbose or bombastic. This tale, set over four days in the mountains of Spain during the Spanish Civil War, follows Robert Jordan, an American fighting in the International Brigade, and his preparations for a bridge demolition. During that time, he falls in love with the beautiful and tragic Maria as well as befriends the group of guerrillas he is working with. During those four days, Jordan loves, idealizes, and submits to his dutiful fate more passionately than most men ever will. If you have never read Hemingway before, I suggest you do so right away. This book is a great one to start with and I know that I will be looking to read more of his works soon."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This story had some of the most engaging characters that I have come across in a book. I found it hard to put the book down on numerous occasions. Hemingway has a way of illustrating settings, characters and emotions that will captivate the minds of everyone."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"First things first, if you want a quick thriller than this is not the book for you. If what you want is a compelling, thought provoking, and an informative narrative of guerrila's in the Spanish civil war than this is up your alley. Even with its slow pace and limited conflict lessons are learned in every chapter. Everything from how to treat unreliable ally's to how to deal with love in war. Hemmingway's writting is somewhat repetitive, but in its elegance completely bareable. Having only read The Old Man and the Sea, I can't compare it to his other longer fiction, to me For Whom the Bell Tolls was a more rewarding read. With a great cast of characters that constantly enrich plot, all with back stories that build character developement. Robert Jordan the main character gives an American familiarity to the story making it even more accessible to today's readers. Hemmingway has a way with words that puts you in the story, with Robert Jordan's up's and down's, you understand him, you want to be him. Anyone who hasn't read Hemmingway's work but enjoys any American classics from Steinbeck to McCarthy will find this read enjoyable and rewarding."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom the Bell Tolls (Scribner Classics)For Whom the Bell TollsBy the time Ernest Hemmingway wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls, he was already a major celebrity in the international literary world. His early and celebrated books, The Sun Also Rises, and A Farewell to Arms, had many fellow writers as well as critics seeing For Whom the Bell Tolls as a work comparable in stature to these earlier works. Hemmingway himself volunteered for the republican (democratic) cause in Spain, and served as a journalist on the front. He was present at the republican last stand, the Battle of the Ebro, and was among the British and American journalists who were some of the last to leave the battle, just before the Nationalists dominated the field. Hemmingway writes as only those who have experienced war can.On the surface, For Whom the Bell Tolls may appear to be a dated war novel in an age of increasingly abundant graphic literature. Dig deeper, however, and given time, any reader can appreciate Ernest Hemmingway's distinctive style, and acute attention to detail. The book is set during the Spanish Civil War--or rather, three days during the entire war. Hemmingway makes the reader feel as if they are experiencing the hardships that these outnumbered and outgunned freedom fighters endured every minute of each day. Robert Jordan, the protagonist, is an American dynamiter sent to enlist the assistance of local guerilla forces in the destruction of a bridge controlled by the fascists. For those not familiar with the Spanish Civil War, it began in 1936 after Francisco Franco toppled the democratic government in Spain. These conservative and fascist forces came to dominate most of the fighting, due to the aid they received from Nazi Germany. Three years of brutal fighting ended in the defeat of the republican forces, and the beginning of Franco's dictatorship. The \\"good guys,\\" in the eyes of a modern audience, did not win. This is not about the Second World War, or the triumph of good over the forces of darkness. Darkness comes to dominate all of Spain, and Robert Jordan and the guerillas are not excluded.Robert Jordan successfully encounters the guerilla forces and lives with them for three days until the time comes for him to embark on his mission to destroy a bridge critical to the fascist forces. In the opinion of some, For Whom the Bell Tolls may not have enough plot twists or changes of events. This may be because of Hemmingway's career as a short story writer. Each scene in this book is incredibly vivid and at times the reader even smells the stew over the fire in the freedom fighter camp--all detail is described. Perhaps the definitive aspect of Hemmingway's work is the physical layout of the text. All dialogue is written as if it were literally translated, word for word, from Spanish to English. Over time, the reader comes to understand Spanish culture and their modus operandi through \\"hearing\\" the language. This style of writing has a unique impression on the reader, for the reader is placed in the minds of the characters. Supporting characters that have no major impact on Robert Jordan, are given incredibly detailed backgrounds and each of these side characters are almost as fully developed as the protagonist--Hemmingway's short story writing style has its impact here. Spend time reading the book, and Hemmingway entirely immerses the reader in the Spanish mountains. Nothing is left without a vivid description. The novel has the intensity of a short story.For those who cannot go through life without categorizing and sticking a label on everything they come across, For Whom the Bell Tolls is an anti-war novel. No, the \`cavalry' does not come riding to the rescue and the surround the innocent \`homesteaders' in the end, for the cavalry has been ambushed and slain by a better supplied, better armed, and a better informed foe. In the end, Robert Jordan realizes the ultimate futility of his mission to have any impact on the events of war. He contemplates whether any one person can truly change the course of a battle, and comforts himself with thoughts of his grandfather, who survived the American Civil War. Jordan seems to wish that he could have made a difference, or that he could live up to his grandfather's achievements. Overall, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a phenomenal book and one that every person should read at some point in their lives. Its messages about selflessness, futility, and sacrifice are timeless, and the book itself should remain at the top of the charts in this modern age."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Written in typical Hemingwayesque ploddingly simple style, this book morphs English and Spanish in a unique manner for its period (1940), which subsequent writers have copied or embellished. Spain is Hemingway's love. During this time, most loved Paris - like friend Fitzgerald,. But, dry heat and bull running mania were for for this man.Spanish sayings abound in this novel about simple people asked to do a job - perhaps simple - in the name of the cause: blow up a bridge. But, the pithy and poignant statements of implyingly illiterate gypsy Pilar cannot be matched by 17th century philosophers. For example Spain, in her words, is \\"where blasphemy keeps pace with the austerity of religion.\\"When protagonist Robert Jordan speaks English for a short time to some of the group, Pilar tells him to revert to Spanish as \\"no language is truer.\\" She later concludes that \\"Spanish is shorter and simpler.\\"And, Hemingway's influence on this language shows as some verbs are paradoxically used -- each time the root of Spanish for English usage. One example is to constantly implement Spanish molestar in English sentences to ask that people stop molesting one another, when the translation is not to bother one another.But, these linguistic nuances are the special effect, the unique style, the cutting edge to the Nobel winning writing style of Hemingway. It is the sentences of Spanglish or otherwise, compounded with his ever seemless simplification, that make this novel resound.I enjoyed this novel also for its slow beginning and its heightening to a crescendo for its ending. His language and other writing angles seem to mature as the novel progresses. He slowly captures the reader, and has you under his exclusive control the last third of the book.Although Hemingway makes this a love story at a time of war, parts are seemingly unreal. Knowing that he is going to die the next day, Robert Jordan meets one last time with beautiful Maria. And, as they are about to start doing the deed, he stops and asks if she hurts. I am sure that you can interview many a disagreeing soldier under similar circumstances and ask if the concept of pain to the sexual partner ever entered their mind when they were having what would perhaps be their last moment of heaven on this man's earth - they would all agree that this was not exactly what they had in mindBut, this is a classic and worthy of reading. I waited over 40 years between readings and received very different messages. Each time good."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I have an original copy of For Whom the Bell Tolls that my grandfather gave me. For years I read the poem at the beginning of the book, (which has the same title as the book itself) but had never read the content. It is amazing that after years of reflecting on that poem, that reading the actual content of this classic meant so much more. As I am sure was Hemingway's intention, you can literraly reflect on that poem back through every single chapter in the book, and each time the poem will have a new meaning for the reader. This is a true sign, in my opinion, of a great author. I need to read this novel again, to pick up on some of the hidden inuendos and nuances I might have missed the first time, but that too will be time well-spent.This is a phenomenal book, by a bona fide, talented classic author. It is worth reading, reflecting upon, and reading again."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is an incredibly good book. Hemingway summoned all his superior story-telling powers and forged an unforgettable wartime epic. Complex, layered and populated by memorable characters, FHTBT is a true masterpiece. It is like an Iliad for the 20th-century man. The tragedy, injustice of war, engulfing good and bad human beings alike in its remorseless swirl, is brought to life with astounding attention to detail and humanistic depth. As you may know, the story takes place during the Spanish Civil War, a brutal conflict that not only tore apart the fabric of Spain's society, but also involved armies and volunteers from the great powers and ideologies of the time, most notably the tyrannies of Soviet Communism and German/Italian fascism.There is no facile characterization of heroes and villains on this book. Most of the narrative zooms in on the struggle of a small band of mountain guerrilla fighters who are summoned into near-suicidal action by the arrival of American volunteer Robert Jordan with orders from the Republic. That you know in the great scheme of things their call to sacrifice and their violence is just another futile exercise in a brutal war makes it all the more poignant. And Hemingway adds enough insight into the workings of the greater armies and the machinations of politicians so the reader experiences the bigger picture as well.In the book you find an intimate tale of struggle and courage in time of war, a moving love story, a critical view of the ideologies and idealism of the era, a couple of short-stories on bull-fighting, brutally honest accounts of war atrocities (from both sides) and moments of introspection in questions of love, life, death and hope that are as deep and moving as any. But don't forget about the adventure and suspense: Hemingway was a man of action and this is a book of men and women on a mission. You will be hooked and on the edge of your seat all the way to the (bitter-sweet?) end.The last chapter is the most gripping piece of fiction I ever recall reading. It is unbelievably good... and Hemingway proves one more time he is a master of story endings."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Yes, I said \\"historical novel,\\" because, even in H.'s day, history passed by very quickly. It's this novel A Farewell to Arms, and The Old Man and the Sea that, for me, are the real crown jewels of Hemingway's output. Even if you're just interested in the historical aspect of the The Spanish Civil War, you'll get much out of this work. There isn't much more I can add that hasn't already been said."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway's novel \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" (1940) is toughly realistic in its depiction of the butchery of warfare. The book has the no-nonsense, fact-intensive style of a reporter. Yet, in its themes of love, death, heroism, and human brotherhood, Hemingway's novel is, in spite of itself, romantic in outlook, but romantic with an edge.The novel is set in Spain in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). The Spanish Civil War was a multi-sided conflict between the democratically-elected government, the Republicans or loyalists, and its right-wing anti-communist opponents, the nationalists (fascists). The Republicans during this conflict had the assistance of the USSR. Their enemies, the nationalists, were assisted by Nazi Germany and by Italy. Hemingway was a correspondent in Spain at the time. His novel tells the story of Robert Jordan, a young American instructor in Spanish at the University of Montana who had earlier spent much time wandering through Spain. In 1936, with the outset of the conflict, Jordan volunteered his services to assist the Republicans and became an expert in explosives. Jordan idealizes his grandfather who had been a hero in the American Civil War. Jordan's father had committed suicide. When the novel opens, Jordan is assigned to destroy a bridge in furtherance of a Republican offensive. He works with a group of guerrillas in the mountains.The story unfolds over a time of three days. Hemingway's book offers portrayals of a group of Jordan's Spanish compatriots, in addition to Jordan himself. Chief among them is a 48-year old woman, Pilar, physically unattractive, earthy, and strong-willed. She is the de facto leader of her group and is as central to the story as is Jordan. Pilar is the \\"woman\\" of Pablo, who was once a formidable fighter but who has become disillusioned by the conflict. The novel includes several scenes of high tension and near violence between Jordan and Pablo. In his efforts to blow-up the bridge, Jordan is assisted by Anselmo, an aged man who despairs of violence and killing but is devoted to the Republican cause. And, in the three days of the novel, Jordan meets and has a passionate love affair with Maria, a lovely 19-year old who has been saved from the nationalists by Pablo.Hemingway is known for a terse, elliptical writing style, and it is on display in this book. But the writing is highly varied, with long stream of conscious digressions by Jordan as he reflects upon his past life and upon the conflict in which he has thrust himself. Much of the writing is both figurative and digressive. Hemingway tried to transcribe much of Spanish idiom directly into English, particularly the use of \\"thou\\" for the intimate Spanish \\"you.\\" He also makes considerable use of untranslated Spanish phrases. The book captures the speech patterns of soldiers under tension, with much use of colorful language. Hemingway does not reproduce this language directly but, in English, uses phrases such as \\"obscenity\\" or \\"unprintable\\" in place of the words themselves. In addition to telling the story of the bridge and its destruction, all the characters engage in long discussions of their thoughts and their prior lives. These discussions generally are directed to the brutality of the war. In an outstanding passage, Pilar tells of the destruction under the command of Pablo of a group of fascist leaders who are forced to run the gauntlet before being thrown down a cliff.Hemingway was in love with Spain, both for its beauty and its brutality. The novel has many discussions of bullfighting, largely told by Pilar as she recounts her experiences with earlier lovers. Pilar also has a power of clairvoyance in the story, especially as it relates to impending death. The book includes several vivid battle scenes. One of these scenes tells of the gunning-down by aircraft of a group of five of the guerillas assisting Jordan at the top of a small hill.(Aircraft has a large and fearsome presence in the book.) Another effective battle scene tells of the difficult destruction of the bridge and its aftermath.The love relationship between Robert Jordan and Maria comes to dominate the novel. The two become passionately attracted to each other and quickly consummate their relationship. The passages describing the couple's lovemaking are central to the story and effective. The inhumanity of war is juxtaposed against human commitment and the beauty of the everyday. Robert Jordan realizes that he is in love with Maria, Spain, and with life. This love, in the book, reaches its peak in heroism and self-sacrifice. Jordan comes to realize what in life he values. It is because of his realization, that he ultimately must give up the things he comes to cherish. Within its language of toughness and machismo, this novel has the theme of inevitability and of romantic tragedy.This is a book I read in high school many years ago when it was far beyond me. It is not an easy book, and not every part of it is successful. But it is an extraordinary novel. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to revisit the book when I was able to try to appreciate it.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Five stars are not enough for the audio of this book narrated by Campbell Scott. I do not speak Spanish or know much about the Spanish Civil War or the geography of Spain. It did not matter. This is a great, gripping story.Robert Jordan is a wonderful character -- macho, intelligent, generous, deliberate. Pablo and El Sordo, guerilla leaders, and Pilar, the \\"woman of Pablo\\" and Roberto's change agent, are fascinating, as are several Russians and Fernando, the rather prim guerilla. Other characters are colorful, but not as engaging. Hemingway tries very hard, but cannot quite bring Maria, the love interest, to life.The issues are how to die well, the roles of individuals and small groups in large movements and wars, and whether any reform movement can change a country. (Robert Jordan approaches, but does not reach the conclusion \\"Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Won't get fooled again.\\") Also, does religion mean anything and is it merely \\"the opium of the people\\"? Is it possible to live and die without religion when one was raised with it?Campbell Scott should get an Academy Award for this narration. He voices all of the characters well. (It is hopeless for a man to read Maria's perpetually ernest -- no pun intended -- lines.) He conveys the irony, the disgust, the subtle sparring very well. He switches from the choppy Hemingway style for Robert Jordan's thoughts to the cadences of Spanish and Russian for the others. He absolutely brings the story and the characters to life. I have listened to many books on tape (and CD) and this is hands down the best. Very highly recommended. (Thanks, Dad, for giving it to me.)In the audio edition, even the incidental music is perfect, as are the pauses before it begins and after it ends. It is just about a perfect production. (A map of in the CD box would make it perfect. It should identify all the places named in the text and shows the rivers and roads mentioned -- and the bridge!! -- even if this requires more than one map. Next best alternatives would be a CD or website with this info. But it would be best to have a hard copy with the audio CDs. Stephen Ambrose audio tapes about WWII came with maps like this and they were very helpful. This would help any edition of the book in any medium, as would a bibliography of the Spanish Civil War. [...]I read this as a teenager and enjoyed it. Back then, I thought that there might be many books this good out there in the world. It turns out that there are not many books this good."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"It took me far too long to struggle my way through this novel. Hemingway's attempts to capture the flavor of Spanish syntax make the narrative sound artificial and, at times, ludicrous. Furthermore he often had characters engage in lengthy exchanges which would resolve into nothing, leaving the reader to wonder what profound point he missed. When, in fact, there really was no point at all.Overly long and arduous. Something to be foisted upon unhappy high-schoolers. Hemingway's just not the sort whose style appeals to."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway is always worth reading again. This novel of the Spanish civil war is a benchmark work, rated as perhaps his best and one of the finest war novels ever written. It is used as a teaching text in universities. That said, For whom The Bell Tolls is a ripping yarn, faultlessly shaped, fast paced, with characters who live in the reader's memory. The prime protagonist gets killed off . . . but that's war. Hemingway never ducked."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"EXCERPTED FROM \\"GOD'S COUNTRY\\" BY STEVEN TRAVERS\\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is based upon Hemingway?s support for the anti-Communists fighting in the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s. He and many other Americans went over to fight in the war, which some say was a \\"dress rehearsal\\" for World War II. It did not materialize into the kind of idealized Spanish government that many had sacrificed for. The fascistic Francisco Franco ended up ruling an isolationist Spain until the 1970s. While the nation is now Democratic, the Franco regime was the final event that took Spain from greatness to mediocrity. Hemingway also wrote a stageplay about the Spanish Civil War called \\"The Fifth Column\\"."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I began reading For Whom The Bell Tolls directly after finishing a particularly bad modern novel. At first, For Whom... was a breath of fresh air: no long, run-on sentences; no excessive adverbs in the dialog tags; not a whole lot of meaningless adjectives, etc. The dialog was crisp and terse and enjoyable, and the setting was captivating.But then... nothing happens. For a really long time. And all of the flashbacks via thought and story start to get confusing. At times, I wasn't sure if the story was in the present or past; in the thoughts of the protagonist or the speech of another character. And speaking of characters, four of them are strong and compelling: Robert Jordan (the protagonist), Maria (his love interest), Pilar (a tough old woman), and Pablo (a once-great but now tarnished soldier). A fifth character of note is the Gypsy, but the other characters in this ensemble cast are largely indistinguishable from one another.One more criticism: I was really hoping to get a better understanding of the Spanish Civil War and its politics. Maybe I did. But Robert Jordan and his cadre are not hardline Communists nor anarchists (they have special contempt for the latter) but \\"republicans\\" in their fight against the Fascists. Not a lot of background is given as to the roots of this conflict or the underlying motivations of each camp.Overall, I feel I have been enriched by reading this book, and I like Hemingway's writing style (this is my first Hemingway since readingThe Old Man and the Seain 9th grade), but all in all, I understand why this has been called one of the \\"10 Books Not to Read in your Lifetime.\\" Also: Did I have an edited version? What was with all of this \\"I 'obscenity' in your milk,\\" etc.?"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway displays his narrative powers and his command of English prose in this novel that has a standard plot, i.e., a man on a mission, with the paradox that ambiguities always come with standing up for an idealistic cause. Robert Jordan has committed himself to his wartime assignment: to go behind 'enemy' lines so as to blow up a bridge to help the Republican cause prior to a critical battle. Unlike the obsessive focus of a novel like 'Bridge on the River Kwai,' Hemingway shows the fallibility of idealism, how revolutionaries that are not immune to disillusionment, and the self-serving actions of those who have fought for a selfless cause but get more and more self-involved as their nerves and wits are constantly challenged. The band of partisans, for example, Augustine, Pilar, a gypsy, a disillusioned commander who live behind enemy lines are seen to have their idealism slowly unravel while holding on the the core belief they have in the \\"Republic.\\" Robert Jordan splits his attention between dealing with the conflicts among the partisans and focusing on his profession as an explosives expert. This dichotomy allows Hemingway to present the proposition that the idealistic face we show to the world cannot but be tempered by doubt. This novel succeeds in showing 'ordinary' people dealing with extraordinary events."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I object to the previous review of this book. I do not believe that the book glorifies anything about war. One needs to take the time to research the names presented in the book and then the book will make more sense. Hemingway had no idea the Internet would ever be invented. He named \\"names\\" that no one would have really had access to in his time. We do now. And I am no one to second guess Hemingway.Would anyone say that Robert Jordan was having a good time? I think not. Let us also remember that one cannot write, with such vivid detail, that which Hemingway wrote about in FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS without actually having been there himself. He knew then and if we would only know now. Hemingway is not for everyone...besides OLD MAN AND THE SEA."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway and his simplistic style of writing live on in the stories he tells and represents.Through his writing you can tell that this is a man with the best of both worlds, in that he is not only a great writer but orator as well. This fact is why the trueness of his stories live on as if he's telling us the story himself right from the book. Robert Jordan and his gang of rebels are a reflection of a Spanish Civil War in which they live by there feelings toward politics, but their representation in the war is a hidden treasure behind the depths of mountains and lost memory in hope that this saga lives on forever."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I found the book to be a little tiresome to be honest. Although I did really enjoy the final section of Robert Jordan's thoughts on death, I found the rest hard to read at times. The style I thought was dry and bare, too much so for my liking, and the characters (particularly the hero) incapable of much emotion themselves or of summoning emotion in me. His style was &quot;sparse and halting&quot;, as Jack Kerouac said, and this definitely had a bad effect on the book, especially the sections with Maria, which I expected to be brimming with passion and joy. Instead, we just got rather turgid descriptions of &quot;it moving&quot;. Having said that, it improved as the time of the bombing drew near and the tension rose, but personally I found it too dry and arid."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. Hemingway is the best author I have ever come across. This book is perhaps the best example of his unique style of writing. If you, like some of the reviewers here, find this book boring, you have no interest in humanity, war, life, death or love. It also has the best ending to a book, ever. Read it."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is Hemingway - hear him roar. FWtBT is not a good introduction to Hemingway, but after reading a few short stories and maybe The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms, you'll be used to his style of writing and tempo and understand why this is considered his best. It's long for Hemingway, but it reads quickly in terms of plot - there isn't so much action as there is character development, which you'll find pleasingly unusual after Farewell and Sun, and if you aren't in love with Maria by the end, you're inhuman. These are Hemingway's best characters - hands down. This is his best writing - no contest. Is it his best story? - You might like the Old Man and the Sea better, but it's darn close."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I've read two other previous books by Hemingway. Feel free to read those reviews as well. In his best piece, Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway describes a man's courage and conviction in a mini-epic struggle between and elderly man and the greatest catch of his life (a giant marlin). In another book, The Sun also Rises, Hemingway paints a very rich and colorful portraitt of Spain and Pamplona that I could not sum up in a few sentences. Both books create a vivid picture almost unequaled in literature.This book, however, does nothing of the sort. Excluding a side story that concerns the massacre of a town of locals, it is repetitive, boring, and provides little insight. The majority of this 450 page book takes place in one cave and provides very little substance. Personally, no picture was painted for me, no human character was exposed, and no real lasting meaning came from this book.I grew tired of the cave, tired of the speculation about killing the Guerilla leader Pablo, and bored of the lightweight, unreal romance. An editor could have spliced away pages 200-400, and the book would have not missed a beat.If you're a casual reader like myself, stick with other Hemingway works."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"The plot, characters, etc. have all been discussed ad infinitum around here. Let's just say I was looking forward to my first Hemingway book. It took me three months to get through it. I'll read another one, but if it's anything like this one, maybe Ernie isn't for me."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"First of all, I recognize that this is a classic novel by one of the most highly regarded writers of the twentieth century. Hemingway was very good; sycophants made him sublime. To criticize this work and not rhapsodize over its poetic beauty and its insightful symbolism would seem to be almost in bad taste. But I will do so anyway.Overall I would have to say that the story is good but not great: Robert Jordan is an American fighting for the communists in the Spanish civil war. He is an instructor in Spanish at a Montana college who has taken a sabbatical to secretly come to Spain. He wants to fight to liberate the workingman. Jordan is sent by his Russian controller to join a band of guerrillas behind Fascist lines. His mission is to blow up a bridge; this is timed to precisely coincide with a Republican (communist) offensive. Anselmo, an old man who is the most reliable guerilla, takes him to the band of rebels. The band is led by Pablo, an uncouth peasant who has gone from fervent murderous radical to a man who only wants to survive. Pilar, Pablo's woman, is the unifying force in Pablo's band. There are assorted other rebels and Maria, a refugee who has been raped by the fascists. Maria and Robert Jordan fall in love immediately and are soon fornicating like rabbits. The bridge is attacked and destroyed but this leads to the death of Anselmo and to Robert Jordan being mortally wounded. He orders Maria to go on without him and he bids her to escape and enjoy life; thereby he will live through her.The book does give a good picture of the issues of the Spanish civil war. The fascists are portrayed as decent people backed by Nazis and Italian fascists. The Republicans are controlled by Russians, as are puppets on a string. Hemingway makes a point to say that the top Republicans all speak Russian, having been trained as revolutionaries in the Soviet Union. The individual peasants Jordan fights with are mostly portrayed as decent people with a few savages thrown in for good measure.I had several problems with the book. I understand that Hemingway uses the archaic thee and thou to indicate that the dialogue is being spoken in Spanish. He omits this when Jordan is speaking in English or thinking to himself. This takes some getting used to but is tolerable. It is the awkward translation of Spanish obscene phrases that is done in a silly and annoying way. The phrase \\"I obscenity in the milk of your father\\" appears dozens of times. No one speaks this way. It is patently unnatural and just about ruined the book for me. I understand that this is a literal translation of the Spanish oath \\"me cago en la leche...\\" I understand and don't care. It would have been better to leave the obscenity implied but unsaid without resorting to this awkward device.There is a painfully awkward page where Robert Jordan discovers that Pablo has stolen his detonators. On page 368 he says \\"Oh muck my grandfather and muck this whole treacherous mucking country and every mucking Spaniard in it on either side and to hell forever\\" and so forth ( in lieu of the word that is an acronym for \\"for unlawful carnal knowledge\\") about two dozen times. I understand that in 1940 that word could not appear in print but did it have to be replaced by something so witless. Funny how that word still can't appear in Amazon.com book reviews in 2002.There is another especially awkward scene that sticks in my mind. Hemingway describes Robert Jordan's feelings at having reached orgasm with Maria on page 379: \\"Oh now, now, now, the only now, and above all now and there is no other now but thou now and now is thy prophet. Now and forever now. Come now, now, for there is no now but now. Yes, now. \\" and so on for half a page. Give me a break!There is also the problem of some of the poorly drawn and unbelievable characters. Robert Jordan is too perfect to be true (is he Jesus in disguise?). He goes from a mild mannered rural college instructor to a stone killer and demolitions expert in a matter of months. He doesn't have any personal stake in the Spanish conflict but quickly becomes a cool yet eager killer in the service of the Soviet side. His inner dialogue tells us that this is because he has always wanted to do something for downtrodden workers of the world. It is also in part to prove that he is as much a man as his (U.S.) Civil war hero grandfather. The relationship with Maria is unbelievable to the point of being absurd. Jordan is a thirty-something who has never been in love. He and Maria, who is 19, fall in love at first sight. They immediately decide to have sex ; they plan to get married and live together happily ever after. He is fully aware that he has been handed a suicide mission and is completely unconcerned. How did he live for this long if his own safety is of no interest to him?Much has been made of the fact that this book illustrated the concepts in the Donne poem No Man is an Iland. Well then why do we need nearly five hundred pages of this book when that poem says it so well in a few lines."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"this book is a drunkolgue. of course, it's very well written. the style, is a style of a superb journalist. but the characters' alcoholism is piercing. the choices they make are hardly romantic, rather they are tragic. the emptiness of the spirit hidden behind the spirit of alcohol pierces through. how so many mice and men have fashioned their lives after this novel puzzles me."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"must be where Metallica got the song name from. Anyways this is one of but many authors that, like Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain decided to take the easy way out. In the meantime he penned this great literature that is a great book. I don't care what anybody says, the old man and the sea is boring and short and so with that I bid you good day and happy reading!"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This was an okay book. It ebbs and flows. There are great scenes (the massacre, Sordo's end, and the final battle) and there are whole sections where the book just grinds down into mundane language and repetition. However, the great scenes were unbelievably hypnotic and intense, I thought. I also liked the ending, which I thought was heartbreaking and left me feeling lonely and aching. I preferred &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom The Bell Tolls is a epic war novel written by Ernest Himingway that profiles the young American, Robert Jordan, and his 72 days with a anti-fascist guerrilla unit in the mountains of Spain. Himingway also describes El Sordo's last stand very well. Robert is fighting for his beliefs against the fascist. In the mountains, he meets up with other anti-fascist. Pablo, his wife Pilar, and the young, beautiful Maria. Robert soon falls in love with Maria. Robert is there to blow up a bridge, and within the 72 days, he visits the bridge making sketches and planning out the explosion. He and Pablo do not get along to good and Pablo throws Robert's detonator in the river and Robert gets real angry with Pablo. Pablo is a lazy man that stays drunk off of wine through out the story. Robert thinks many times of killing him. After careful planning, he successfully blows up the bridge. On the way back to camp, he has a tragic accident and his severely wounded. Maria, and everyone else escapes. Robert moves around to get behind a tree with his submachine gun waiting to face the fascist army all alone in the deep mountains of Spain."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For a school project, I was asked to choose any book and write a review. I have never been a big fan of Earnest Hemmingway, but I was up for a challenge and I chose one of his works. For Whom The Bell Tolls is Hemmingway's novel on the Spanish Civil war. It goes through the struggles that an American, Robert Jordan, goes through in order to help the Spanish guerrilla of the mountains overcome the fascist government. It follows him through the struggle with the people of the mountains, and what he must do to keep his newfound love. It includes many of the past stories of the characters and has a lot of character development in the 471 pages that the book contains. In it, he is given the task to blow a bridge in order to keep the fascist army from reaching the mountains during a guerrilla attack. The storyline is good, but there is a lot of extra and unneeded material. I had a lot of trouble reading this book because of the fact that it went on many different tangents about the past lives of the characters. Some of these stories went on for several pages and got very confusing at times. Hemmingway used many different names for the characters, which tended to make it a bit more confusing. It bothered me that instead of saying Robert or Jordan, he always wrote Robert Jordan. He used very little pronouns and it made the book drag on for days. Many of the sentences were repeated several times, and that, too, made the book long. At certain points in time, I felt myself screaming in my head for him to say it once and be done with it. But all in all, the storyline was good. I haven't always been a big fan of Ernest Hemmingway, and I was hoping that his book would change my mind. But in the end it was more frustrating than fun. The book makes you want it to come to an end. If you have a lot of time on your hands like a long car ride or a really long vacation, I would recommend this book. But if you are looking for something that won't take you very long to read and is easy to understand, then I would suggest reading something a little different. As for the school project that I had to accomplish, I think this book gave me something easy to write about since the plot was so thin."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"The book is fine enough though not what I had expected. Some of the wording in the description led me to expect something else. Also the interior of the package was absolutely filthy with something that appeared to be paper insulation. I got a face full of dust when I opened it. When I contacted the dealer about it he made excuses and said the package was clean when he shipped it. No it wasn't! The filth was INSIDE a sealed envelope. Really disappointing!! I expected better from Amazon. anza66, I won't buy from you again. I will look for other ways to purchase used reading material."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I want to offer a little dissent here. I thought the book to be a bit dull and slow. I really labored to get through it and becuase of it completely turned me off to the rest of his work. It could be that I spend too much time reading action fiction so I need a fast paced book to keep me interested."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"He can write effectively and knowledgeably about war, bullfighting, and hunting, but not women. This has been a common criticism against Hemingway over the years. Many critics have found his depiction of women hollow and superficial. His women seem to exist only in the context of the male hero. They are given no distinctive voice of their own and are almost always dealt a tragic fate. This cannot be said of Pilar from &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls.&quot; She is one of Hemingway's strongest female characters and has often been characterized as &quot;the real leader of the guerrilla band.&quot; Pablo may hold that title at the beginning of the novel, but as the novel progresses, Pilar's authoritative stature becomes more and more evident. Pilar is a rather contradicting figure and this is a testament to Hemingway's ability to fictionally construct her well. On the one hand, existing in male-dominated culture, she is fully domesticated, expert in her knowledge on how to perform traditional womanly duties. On the other hand, she is not entirely complaisant or silent willed. She will not hesitate to speak her mind nor will she hesitate to take up arms and fight with the men. She also has enough military sense to lead a group of male soldiers."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I'll be short and sweet. This is an excellent book that many different kinds of people will enjoy. The more intelligent the reader is, the more he or she will get out of the book. At the base, it is a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. From there, there are many little symbolic happenings and hidden meanings waiting to be seen. For Whom the Bell Tolls is a must read book!"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This book is set in Spain during the Spanish Civil war. &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; is the story of an American helping a guerilla group hiding in the mountains of Spain, fight the Fascists. The main character is Robert Jordan, who is a college professor in the United States. He loves Spain so much that he joined the Republican Army and started to fight with them against the Fascists.He has ben assigned to take a small group of people, who are hiding in the mountains, and blow up a bridge that is important to the Fascist Army. He has bad feelings about this but goes ahead with the plan anyway. He had his palm read, and that told him that bad things were going to happen.At one point in the book, a Republican rebel fighter describes in detail how they rid the small town of Fascist control. The Fascist polive force had their headquarters blown up, and the policemen were executed eventually. The Republican townspeople were forced to kill the Fascist townspeople with clubs, shovels, and other crude weapons.Even though Robert Jordan has a grave concern about the future, he believes in Spain and what it could be. He is willing to give up his life so that Spain may be a free country and people are free to enjoy it the way that they want to.I think that this book shows how the inner-strength of one man can be strong enough to help many people. I also think that the book says that one idea that you believe in, may be worth dying for in order to preserve the freedom of that idea."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is by far my favorite book ever. I am sure many other people will lay out the plot for you in their reviews, so I will tell you what I loved about it. I love the bravery and leadership of the main character Robert Jordan, I loved how Hemingway used people such as the strong willed Pilar and other characters to only make it seem more realistic, and I mostly love how Hemingway painted a picture with Robert Jordan that is the example for all people who want to see what bravery is. No author could top this book."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"The book &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; by Ernest Hemingway is sweet. I dont know if I fully understood the book because one I am not a strong reader and two Hemingway is such a good writer and he is above all the most complex person I have ever read.

Hemingway's work is just superb, the bold symbolism and metaphors make this a must have in your bookshelf. His style is simple writing yet under its surface lies a much deeper aspect and meaning. This is Hemingway at its best. If you like literature you will apreciate it, and once you finish, you feel enticed by his way of writing. As I said, Simply Hemingway!"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"If you like Old Man and the Sea, you'll love this. It is similar in feeling and has a Spanish flair. I seldom remember lines from books, but I've memorized many from this novel. The opening quote from John Donne is as deep as they come. It sets the tone for the book, but is better understood if you immediately re-read the quote right after finishing the book. You really truly understand then what is meant when he says, &quot;Do not send to know for whom the bell tolls....it tolls for thee.&quot;"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is by far the best war novel I have ever read. It is certainly Hemingway's finest work, and perhaps his masterpiece. The characters have magnificent depth, and the picture Hemingway paints is amazing. The book's exploration of the warrior, and of the tragic ideal, is at once both beautiful and foreboding. This book dives into Hemingway himself, offering a look at the man behind the words."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom the Bell Tolls is the story of an American teacher who feels compelled to join the leftist cause during the Spanish Civil War. At the moment when the world was beginning it's plunge into cynicism (where it remains) Hemingway creates a Romantic hero in the world's last great Romantic movement. Jordan is very human and very real. He believes in the cause for which he fights even though he suspects his side may well lose the struggle. Pablo and Pilar are memorable characters. Pablo has let fear get the better of him. Pilar is one of the strongest women in 20th century literature. Hemingway takes all to a satisfying destination. This work is a must read for all those who believe that one should not struggle for anything which will not benefit the self. Jordan went to Spain to fight an evil, powerful and unjust force. He believed the world COULD be changed for the better."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Robert Jordan, an American in at least the third generation, and a teacher of Spanish from Montana, goes to fight in the Spanish Civil War. His motives are never discussed, as are not the theater of or the reasons for the war. The novel is rather about several people who, in the course of a few days, are helping Robert Jordan complete his mission: to blow up a bridge.The novel's tall order - being \\"involved in Mankinde\\" to the extent of fighting thy neighbor's civil wars - is echoed in the story's close engagement with each character. Here is the natural-born killer Pablo, his no-nonsense and wise Gypsy wife Pilar, the beautiful young girl Maria who is carrying much pain, the good old rock of a man Anselmo, who fights to win this war, but who in his bones knows that thou shalt not kill.Robert Jordan is singled out to have both the first and last name. All the other foreigners go by their last names and the Spaniards - by their first ones. Besides embodying the foreign engagement in the Spanish affair, Robert Jordan also brings a distinctly human element into the war zone: the lonely human name among the nomes de guerre of general Golzs and partisan Anselmos.The book is written as if translated from Spanish. The language is a bit choppy, many expressions read like Spanish idioms translated verbatim, some phrases are left in Spanish. This adds to the feeling that one is in a foreign setting. As it often happens in Hemingway's novels, much working of the human spirit is revealed through this simple language."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Can I add anything to what has already been said? Well, I find this to be Hemingway's best piece of literature. The story is interesting (though sometimes the dialogue can come across as odd to me, it's from a different time, so some difference is to be expected). Especially interesting was the protagonist's work (a perfect example of UW, in my opinion), and what he did. Read it, enjoy it."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I was very surprised when the book arrived. For a 70 year old book it is in good condition. Thank! My husband loved ie."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"In the team photo of 'best books I've ever read', I feel a desire to re-read this one every 10 years or so. It's definitely a 'love it or hate it' effort -- in particular, the language used can be off-putting as Hemingway tries to convey the beauty of the Spanish language through the use of archaic English. I think it works, though the necessary linguistic convolutions needed to express obscenities gets tedious.The plot is well-constructed, giving an adequate amount of motion as it moves between the love story and the action sequences. Hemingway's flair for description are on full display -- whether it's the scenery, military weapons, food or people he gets to the heart of the matter swiftly and decisively.The themes Hemingway pursues throughout his career are present in this work -- androgyny, suicide, the outdoors, shooting and depression are all rolled into it. These themes provide layering and texture that helps propel the novel forward without dipping into an emotional morass.A book to treasure, by a master of the art."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is another masterly work from Hemingway. When he gets it right, he gets it OH so right. You have more tight, evocative language that conjure up the landscapes the characters live in, and wonderful characterisation so that you fully engage and sympathise with them. This is a great look at the Spanish civil war from the guerrillas point of view, with the assistance of an American explosives expert. It has romance, chivalry, betrayal, adventure and the rougher side of human nature. What more could you want from one novel? If you like Hemingway then this is another great novel and if you're new to him, this may not be the best starting place, but you'll still not be disappointed.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Warning, this review gives away the very end of the book, so if you have not read the book, don't read this review.So, first what I liked was just about everything. This was a well written, easy to read book. My edition was 470 pages, and I had it read in 2 days. The story sucks you in pretty well. I even was able to tolerate the romantic parts, and there are lots of them when Robert Jordan falls in love with the young lady Maria. Usually I roll my eyes and skip past the slop, but this was not too bad. The ending at the bridge was extremely well done. When I read about Robert Jordan down there planting his explosives, near panic because he still hears shooting up above, trying to calm himself down, it really did make my own heart beat a little faster. No book has done that to me in a very long time.So here's what I didn't like. First, it seems like two-thirds of the book was a buildup to the attack on the bridge. After a while, I was thinking, get on with it, already. The big one, however, that ruined the book for me, was the last few pages. Robert Jordan blew up the bridge, reunited with what was left of his group, reunited with Maria, and was fleeing, when a tank shell knocked him off his horse and the horse collapsed on top of him, breaking his leg. Now, in this part, Maria is absolutely right. She wants to cut the load off one of the horses and throw Robert Jordan on its back. Sure, his leg was broken.. so what? That's a non-fatal wound. He wasn't losing any blood as far as I could tell from the text. Sure, he probably would have lost his leg, but so what? Better than losing his life. I really hate what he does here. He gives up. He drives Maria away, breaking her heart for life. Then he lies there with a gun, waiting for the enemy so he can go out in a blaze of glory.Maybe Hemingway meant for this to be noble and heroic. Not for me. To me, it was stupid, unnecessary, and downright cowardly. You see, I'm not suicidal, and I can't get past the fact that this joker did not have a fatal injury. He could have lived and escaped. He had done his bit for the cause in blowing up the bridge. He had a woman (Maria) who loved him and was willing to marry him. He had a good, secure job waiting for him back in the States. The only downside for him is that he may have lost one leg. Big deal. To me, in throwing all that away and committing suicide, Robert Jordan ended up a despicable coward. His little suicidal ending may have killed one enemy officer. A suicidal ending like his is appropriate if you are inches from death; better to take one of them with you on the way out. But Robert Jordan was NOT near death! He just had a busted leg. So he's an idiot, and did not deserve Maria's love. The only possible benefit I can see is that maybe, IF he managed to kill that enemy officer, it allowed the group with Maria a little more time to get away. But they were all behind enemy lines anyway, so I'm not sure how much that matters.So, to sum it all up, I really enjoyed this book up to the last few pages. I was so let down by that ending that I took a star off, and I give it 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Set during the Spanish American War of the 1930s, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a novel about an American sent on a mission to help guerrilla fighters blow up a bridge.There. That's the basic plot. It sounds like something out a an action movie, doesn't it. To stop there, however, would be doing the novel and the author a grave disservice.When it gets down to it, For Whom the Bell Tolls is about death and how to face it. The men on this secret bridge-exploding mission are going to die, and they know it. They will not be coming back from this mission. Each of them will be facing death one way or another, and they each have to deal with it individually. The idea of suicide is even approached from a soldier's point of view; the question is raised, is it preferable to kill oneself than to be captured by the enemy?For Whom the Bell Tolls also touches upon racism and politics, though not strictly from an American point of view.Within this tale, violence is to be found in spades, but this is not a simple action story. This is true literature, told in the best writing Hemingway ever did (yes, I admit that's arguable, but it's my opinion ... believe what you want).As a writer, is there anything not to learn from Hemingway? The man knew how to write tense scenes and deal with weighty subject matters all while using as few words as possible, and most of those short words. No other author in my experience has quite been able to do that.As an aside, I'll admit that every time I read a Hemingway novel, I always hate it. Until I reach the very last page. Then suddenly I love it. Not sure why that is, but it's always been my reaction."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I fell hard for Ernest Hemingway in high school.I read A Farewell to Arms my sophomore year and fell in love with Hemingway and great literature. I read it over ever few years just because I can't get enough of the love story and Hemingway's gift for writing. Oh, he had a gift. I've also read The Sun Also Rises multiple times--sometimes because it was assigned and sometimes for fun. I've long heard that For Whom the Bell Tolls is supposed to be Hemingway's masterpiece and it's been on my to-read list for some time. (I have to admit that I have little to no desire to read about an old man in the sea. Sorry.)In For Whom the Bell Tolls, Robert Jordan is an American supporting the Republic in the Spanish Civil War. Jordan has been given the assignment to work with a small band of guerrillas to blow up a bridge at the moment of the Republic offensive. Over the three days he spends with the guerrillas the reader gets into his head and experiences the physical and psychological experience of being in war.I sat in my car waiting to do a family photo session this morning and finished this fabulous novel. It is powerful and emotional and just confirmed my belief that Hemingway is one of the greatest writers. I'm gushing, I know. He's not for everyone. I've pushed my husband to read both A Farewell to Arms and The Sun Also Rises and he's not a fan. My husband thinks Hemingway is just an angry drunk. He might be right but I'm going to encourage him to give Hemingway another chance and read For Whom the Bell Tolls. I think he will be glad he did."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I've probably read this book over 4 or 5 times throughout the years, first having read it as part of an assignment in a High School English class. This is my absolute favorite book, and I'll tell you why. As many reviewers have already pointed out, this book is enjoyable on so many levels: the characters are deep and complex; the questions about their purpose are deep.As a native Spanish speaker, I truly enjoy this book much more because Hemingway's prose is an exact translation of how the characters would speak in their Spanish setting, which I only realize now living in Puerto Rico and re-reading this masterpiece after many years (and two war tours). The conversations, which may seem awkward to a non-Spanish speaker, are perfectly natural if translated into Spanish, adding to the realism of his tale. Chalk this up to Hemingway's genius and his ability to create realistic worlds in which his characters live and die."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"When I first started reading this book I could not, for the life of me, remember what the dang thing was called! I kept confusing it with Hemingway's \\"A Farewell to Arms.\\"I read this book because The Hubble and I came up with an agreement that we would select a book for one another every other month. We started in May. The book he selected for me was this one.I approached this book assuming I would hate it. I assumed it was just some war story (The Hubble loves those) and it would be a \\"man\\" book. My assumptions were partially correct. This was a story about war...but it was also so much more than that.This was the story of Robert Jordan, the dynamiter. Robert Jordan is an American teacher who was called to Active Duty in the military. He was sent to the mountains of Spain to assist the antifascist guerilla units there. His main purpose is to demolish a bridge and assist in the attack against the fascist elements in that area.During his time with the guerilla group, Jordan begins to know and understand the many individuals who are engaged in the antifascist cause. Jordan quickly comes to care for individuals such as Anselmo, the old man, who is a hunter and hates to kill men. Pilar. the mujer de Pablo, who is considered barbarous. El Sordo...what is there to say about El Sordo? A brave man. A Strong man. A man who fought with everything he had. And Maria...Maria, the cropped headed one....I was extremely surprised to discover the love story within this book. Jordan's love affair with Maria is an integral part of this story and far from the \\"man\\" book I originally believed it to be. The love that Maria and her Ingles, or Roberto, share moved the Earth. It is a love that will linger in my heart.This book is both heartbreaking and beautiful. Though it is not a \\"man\\" book, neither is it a \\"romance.\\" This is a book that will dig within the depths of any reader's soul, rip your heart out and replace it with the warm of each character held within these pages.Hemingway has an amazing way with words. He is such an eloquent writer that he draws you in and makes you feel as though you were there in the hills with these people. One passage in particular stands out to me. The scene culminates in a bombing and the description of the ground rolling underneath the character is so intense and so vivid that you believe the ground has rolled under you as well.Hemingway's voice is astounding. His writing style is...what can you say? How can you adequately put into words how much a book has touched you? Affected you? Engaged you? Does the thesaurus contain words and descriptions strong enough? Bold enough to give justice to the magnitude of feelings and emotions this book evoked within me? Still days after I closed the back flap over the last page...if I think about it too much I'm right back there. Right back in the mountains. On that hilltop. Waiting.Now, I couldn't remember the name of this book when I first started reading it. However, now I don't believe I will ever forget the title of this stunningly magnificent novel. This journey through the mountains of Spain is not one that you should miss. I highly recommend you immerse yourself in the lives of these people as soon as you can. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This book gathers momentum slowly, but I guarantee that if you stick with it to the end you will be very well rewarded. I enjoyed this book for insight into history as well as military tactics. It's almost like you are behind enemy lines, eavesdropping on what is happening. But the last 40 to 50 pages swiftly gathers momentum both in action and emotional impact. But intertwined is this heart-wrenching love story, at least at the end it's heart-wrenching. I've read four of Hemingway's books, but this one ranks easily at the top. There is so much emotion and character in this book, the stuff that makes us human and heroic, and that makes Hemingway so great. The last 40 pages or so builds so much emotion, suspense, and excitement you cannot put it down--the mission climaxes, the love story climaxes, what a ride!!!"},{"Title":"Mistress of the Pearl (The Pearl, Book 3)","review":"I guess this was not the book for me...I have read another book of Eric Van Lustbader and loved it...This one not so much"},{"Title":"Mistress of the Pearl (The Pearl, Book 3)","review":"Though they have pretty much conquered the planet Kundala after a century plus of resistance, the victorious aliens V'ornn remain in combat with the locals. The natives believe their Messiah, the \\"Dar Sala-at\\" will save them. Just the Kundalan belief that their legendary savior will help them overthrow the V'ornn invaders has lifted the spirits of the natives and helped them resist the intruders though how someone can join two spirits from opposite poles of the universe as the fabled champion will do seems hard to fathom especially by the V'ornn.However, the impossible occurs when a Kundala female Riane contains her own soul and that of the dead Annon, ironically a V'ornn; the merger of two essences from opposite sides of the universe. The Kundalans believe that Riane is the Messiah who will vanquish the conquerors, but to do so they must obtain the mystical Pearl that only the true Dar Sala-at can yield its power.Part humor, part military science fiction, and part fantasy, the third Pearl tale is a gem of a novel that uses amusing satirical slapstick moments to ease some of the major tension. The story line is action-packed and filled with adventure as series fans will delight in the rebellion but especially with the paradox of Riane-Annon. New readers will enjoy the tale as it is a stand alone, but even greater understanding especially with the V'ornn will occur by reading the delightful previous two epics (see RING OF THE FIVE DRAGONS and THE VEIL OF A THOUSAND TEARS).Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Mistress of the Pearl (The Pearl, Book 3)","review":"Mistress of the Pearl (2004) is the third Fantasy novel in The Pearl series, following The Veil of a Thousand Tears. In the previous volume, Kurgan learned that Nith Batoxxx was possessed by the Archdaemon Pyphoros. Then he learned that a Gyrgon had tampered with Terrettt's brain and was certain that it was Nith Batoxxx. When Kurgan, Sornnn and Batoxxx/Pyphoros transitted to Za Hara-at, they found Riane waiting for them. In a battle where the daemon was attacked by everybody and everything, Nith Batoxxx was killed and the daemon was consigned to the Abyss. Then Riane entered Otherwhere with the Veil of a Thousand Tears and freed Giyan's avatar.In this novel, Krystren, a Sarakkon Onnda, sails on the Oomaloo to the Northern continent in a mission for the Orieniad. She carries a message for her brother, Courion, captain of the Omaline. As they approach their destination, a sudden storm drives them away from land and into the Illuminated Sea. There they run into a reef and the Oomaloo rapidly breaks up. Two boats get away from the ship, but are attacked by a Black Chimaera. The first mate, an agent of the Sintire, attacks the captain and kills him, but then Krystren kills him. Krystren, the only survivor, paddles the figurehead of the Great Mother Yahe toward shore. She reaches the strand with a little help from the Black Chimera.After a long nap, Krystren climbs the cliff up to a ledge, which leads to a manmade tunnel. At the end of the short tunnel is a wall, with a door in it. When she cannot open the door, Krystren falls asleep beside it. Later the opening door wakes her and she hides behind it. A black robed and hooded man comes through the door and climbs a stairway that she had previously overlooked. Then he comes down the stairs leading a young man with a glazed look in his eyes. Calling him Dar Sala-at, the cloaked man leads him to the door. Krystren has already snuck into the next room and watches the pair descend a long pole down into a large cavern. She climbs down part way and sees a green dragon in a cage.Giyan has been training Riane, the true Dar Sala-at, in sorcery. Now she teaches her how to cache her magic books in the Other Side, the null space between realms. They use a mirror, which reminds the rappa Thigpen of necromancers and banestones. Despite Giyan's attempts to change the subject, Thigpen continues to provide Riane with basic information on the banestones.Kurgan, the new Regent of the V'oorn, is attending a burial service for Courion on the Omaline. Unfortunately, the Sarakkon crew have no body to bury. While he knows that Curion's body is within Nith Batoxxx's laboratory in the goron-wave chamber, Kurgan doesn't tell the crew that Batoxxx had killed their captain. The crew substitutes Curion's favorite sea dirk for his body.Kurgan returns to his kashiggen to smoke laaga and think about Eleana. He saw her with Riane in Za Hara-at and is still obsessed with her. Nith Nassam interrupts these thoughts and takes him to Nith Batoxxx's laboratory in the Temple of Mnemonics. Kurgan makes several attempts to win concessions from Nassam, but all are denied. Nassam insists that Kurgan will do only what Nassam tells him to do, no more and no less. Kurgan reacts in his typical manner: he determines to get the better of all Grygons.As Riane is gazing in the mirror, she is overcome by a vision of her prior life. She is walking through a windswept landscape to a high wall. She fits an enormous key into an iron lock and opens the gates. Inside the walls is a courtyard laid with pink gravel. It is bisected by a black path. A pair of fountains flank the pathway, one labeled MEMORY and the other OBLIVION. She wakes from the vision with a gasp. Giyan explains the vision as a construct built by Riane. In it are stored all of Riane's memories. The ones marked OBLIVION are presently unavailable to her, but they may be restored.Riane, Eleana and Thigpen venture into the Regent's palace once again to try the Storehouse Door. After a chase by Kurgan and his Haaar-kyut, they accidentally slide down the wrong path at the triple intersection. There they encounter the Hagoshrin, who ignores Riane's claims of being the Dar Sala-at; he is only interested in feasting on her bones. But Riane and Eleana escape from the Hagoshrin and find the Storehouse Door. This time the door opens when Riane puts her finger in the Ring of Five Dragons. She walks through, but the door closes in Eleana's face. Inside is the Hagoshrin, but now it is aware of her identity as the Dar Sala-at and cooperates.Sornnn and Minnum, the reformed sauromician, have found a banestone in the ruins of Za Hara-at, but it disappears from their possessions. Riane learns from the Hagoshrin that the sauromicians have eight of the banestones, but that Kurgan has the ninth stone. Moreover, Kurgan now has Eleana. The Hagoshrin takes Riane and Thigpen to Kurgan's hiding place to retrieve Eleana and the ninth banestone.In this story, Riane locates the Pearl, but finds that it is not exactly as the prophecies foretell. Kurgan achieves his highest desire. Marethyn finds another way of life in the Kundalan Resistance. Everything is changing, but this volume only shows the beginnings of that change. So many plot lines are left dangling. Does this mean that a sequel is forthcoming?Be warned that the author does not hesitate to kill off the major characters. But don't expect these characters to remain dead; at least one is resurrected from the land of the dead and others cheat death one way or another. And one dead good guy comes back as a villain!Recommended for Lustbader fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of transformation, unexpected plot twists and powerful magic.-Arthur W.

He has a knack. But then his thrillers became stale and formulaic. He has re-invented himself as a writer with the Pearl series, of which, this is the third installment.Kundala rivals Raymond E. Feist's Midkemia. It is a land of the usual fantasy novel with high-tech thrown in. It's a well-done blend. Characters are well-developed and the dialogue is, at times, highly entertaining....way beyond the usual. These characters have senses of humour, bad days and good ones.Given the ending, it's likely we will see more of this world and I can hardly wait."},{"Title":"Mistress of the Pearl (The Pearl, Book 3)","review":"Whoever said &quot;getting there is half the fun&quot; must have been an avid literary adventure fan. For Eric Van Lustbader's hefty science fiction/fantasy thriller, MISTRESS OF THE PEARL, the intuitive reader should be warned to ratchet up that old maxim to say that getting there provides nearly all the fun.It's been a while since I've read anything by the justly acclaimed Van Lustbader, so I must confess straight up that the two previous volumes in his epic Pearl saga are not on my have-read shelf. (In retrospect, they should be...) And for Van Lustbader, creative continuity is everything. There's no gentle warm-up, no teacherly recap, no summary of previous highlights. He opens with a shipwreck on the exotic planet of Kundala and you, poor reader, are thrown headfirst into storm-tossed waves to thrash around with everyone else and create some sense of bearing as best you can.If you've ever traveled to a country where no one spoke your language (and vice-versa), that's the general feeling that results from swimming through the first few dozen pages. Yet you're there, submerged in it, and you don't really want to leave; the alien landscape may seem life threatening, but it's also magnetically alluring. So, like Van Lustbader's enigmatic characters, with their tantalizing and obscure pedigrees, you forge ahead looking for patterns in his intense fabric of inter-species relationships --- and perhaps try to become part of them.Yes, there is a mystical Pearl that's supposed to set everything right; yes, there is a Mistress, whose authority is all but unrecognized. There's also an omnipotent but maddeningly capricious super-goddess with a supposedly cosmic plan; and of course there are &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; forces embodied in a variety of beings, whose motives are not always clear. In short, little or nothing is as it seems and even the characters on the sometimes-fuzzy side of &quot;right&quot; end up entangled in all sorts of moral and political undergrowth.It's that amazing verbal and imaginative &quot;undergrowth&quot; of Van Lustbader's cosmically vast plot structure that grasps and holds the attention of any reader who appreciates clever imagery, graphic action, and surprisingly disciplined prose in such a long book (nearly 600 pages). In this lush jungle of improbable life, fascinating, frightening and endearing individuals exist side by side in a strange mixture of conflict and detente. In fact, politics alone weave a magical, circuitous web that keeps MISTRESS OF THE PEARL tight, edgy, and surprisingly agile throughout.By all means, get hold of the preceding RING OF FIVE DRAGONS and VEIL OF A THOUSAND TEARS and read them beforehand if you can. But if MISTRESS OF THE PEARL crosses your path first, take a leap of literary faith into Van Lustbader's vivid universe --- and enjoy a breathtaking ride.--- Reviewed by Pauline Finch"},{"Title":"Mistress of the Pearl (The Pearl, Book 3)","review":"I am a fan of Eric Van Lustbader.

I kid you not when I say there are some situations that are literally tossed away with a sentence or a paragraph.I was puzzled by that because I honestly thought the series was going to be five books. If he wrote the way he usually does, expanding the various situations he tossed off with a sentence or paragraph, he could easily have made this book fatter and written at least one more the same size.Curious about what Eric Von Lustbader was up too because I had not seen any new novels since these, I went looking around the internet where I instantly found out why this novel was so dissatisfying and short, and why the series stopped here.He got a job writing Robert Ludlum/Jason Bourne books for Hollywood to make into movies, so he cut this series off as fast as he could. I guess it is good he is making megabucks, but he should be ashamed for ruining this series the way he did.I honestly believe he was given that job to prevent him from finishing the series.

Even my own lawyer told me he had a class on them in college but hadn't thought about them in almost forty years. This version (partially annotated) ended up as a tantalizing read ... especially on a Kindle. The genius of the three writers is almost immediately apparent just from perusing the table of contents.Their concept of dissolving the confederacy (our first form of semi organized government) and replacing it with a set of codified, yet modifiable laws ended up creating an almost self moderating and mutable government. In other words, as the needs of the people developed more sophisticated demands, the laws could be changed to meet the times. This was unheard of in an age of nobility and kings rights. We would not be where we are now (arguing and parsing over new needs)if it weren't for Hamilton, Madison and Marshall.This is not a cliff notes version - you need to read and take notes on how they arrived at some of the concepts. But it is worth the time for a person who has an interest not only in our past but in our future. Is it a fun read?

It is obvious that our political system in our country has changed tremendously since its beginnings and how our new politics has deviated from what our forfathers had in mind. maybe we should make our politicians read this book and grasp what was really intended for our country to be.Good reading."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"The United States of America began with the Articles of Confederation which quickly became recognized as an unwieldy mechanism for the new country. Replacing the Articles with a constitution, an entirely new form of government, essentially creating a strong central government -- the federal system. A Constitutional Convention convened in Philadelphia to draft a constitution completing its work in June of 1787.The draft was complete but the real work then began: convince the citizens of the states that adopting this new form was the right course for the country.There were both pro- and anti ratification forces a work. Those for and against adoption worked to convince the people to support their views. The two most respected men in America -- George Washington and Benjamin Franklin -- were openly in favor of the Constitution with other influential individuals acting against.Four states were critical to adoption, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Virginia and New York. Of these, New York was the most opposed and had not approved the draft in Philadelphia; two of its three delegates withdrew in protest during the proceedings leaving the third, Alexander Hamilton, without a vote. Under the Articles, New York had carved an independent course for itself by adopting trade and tariff measures (which were allowed under the Articles).Hamilton decided that an intense propaganda effort would be required to sway the voters of New York. Hamilton was adept at, perhaps a master of, controversial writing and planned to publish arguments for adoption four times a week in the newspapers. He recruited John Jay, a fellow New Yorker and supporter of the Constitution, to help with the writing.Hamilton approached other individuals to aid in the effort finally recruiting James Madison, a Virginia delegate to the Congressional Congress sitting in New York the winter of 1787-1788, to join forces. Together these three men produced 85 letters each signed by the pseudonym \\"Publius\\" that were published in New York newspaper beginning in October, 1787.The 85 letters fall into two parts: 36 criticizing the government under the Articles and 49 analyzing the new Constitution section by section. The 49 analyses may be the more important part as they delineate the thinking that went into the writing of the Constitution; why we did what we did and why that matters. The arguments presented in The Federalist are quoted today -- and for the foreseeable future -- by lawyers and judges in cases before courts throughout the United States; when a judge or justice declares the he or she is a texturalist it is most likely that The Federalist has played a part in how a decision is formulated.We know that the Constitution was adopted (it is, after all, the supreme law of the land). A reading of The Federalist by citizens is an excellent way of seeing for oneself how and why it got to be the astonishing living document that it is.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"I read The Federalist Papers both in High School and College. I felt I needed to read the book again given the political noise we are hearing. It is a must for any voter interested in making a reasoned choice between the political candidates at all levels who claim to understand the constitution!"},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"The Federalist Papers are essential to the understanding of the Founders of America. Equally essential are the Anti-Federalist Papers. Between them, they show the shoals on which our ship of state can be wrecked.The Federalist Papers are the work of Jay, Madison, and Adams to justify the reworking of the American government into the single greatest government model in human history.The anti-Federalist Papers show the thinking of other Americans who see dangers in the federalization of the colonies, some of it remarkably accurate for today."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"I studied economics in college and have begun to follow one of the mainstream economists Peter Schiff. He recommended this book to his followers. This book does a great job of showing where we were in the U.S. Peter Schiff on the other hand shows where we are today and how things have changed for the worse since then. I recommend reading this book and following it up by reading Crash Proof 2.0, but don't read the two unless you want to see the truth, as I've learned the truth can be and is scary."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"A copy of this book (actually the 7th edition, printed in 1976) had been moldering in my book collection for decades. Underlining in the text, by my hand, show that I read it at one time - but the particulars are lost to memory. Anyway, I searched it out again in November 2009 due to ferment about the scope, cost and direction of U.S. government.The book samples a series of papers (26 out of 85 total) that were written and published in the newspapers after the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. The principal authors were Alexander Hamilton, who favored an energetic national government and pro-business policies, and James Madison who was more attuned to the need for restrictions on government and the preservation of state rights. John Jay wrote 5 papers, principally dealing with foreign policy.In general, the papers are masterfully written. Not for nothing does Andrew Hacker state in the introduction that \\"it is difficult to believe that these words were originally penned for a general readership.\\" And although the objective was to win grass roots support for the then proposed Constitution, i.e., the papers (18th Century blogs if you will) constituted a sales pitch, the tone is eminently logical and free of personal attacks on critics (who are frequently mentioned as a group however). It is hard to imagine a campaign of such importance being waged at the same high level today.No need to get into all the specific points about the merits of a federal system, separation of powers as between the three branches of government, etc., which are pretty well known. But the loving care with which this ground is covered does make one stop and think about the dismissal of the idea that the provisions of the Constitution should be interpreted in accordance with the intent of the founders. After all, a lot of effort and thought went into the drafting this document, perhaps the most thoughtful effort to create a good government in history (before or since 1787).On the other hand, one must concede that experience under the Constitution has diverged markedly from the expectations reflected in the Federalist Papers. Today, the lion's share of federal expenditures is for domestic programs, not the military as was predicted. The federal government has amassed more power and functions than the state governments, rather than the other way around. Tariffs are no longer the main source of federal revenues; income and payroll taxes fill that role. And although Congress may be the most powerful of the three branches in theory, its failure to fill the role in practice has fueled the development of an increasingly powerful executive branch.If Hamilton, Madison and Jay could come back and see how things have gone, wouldn't they be surprised!"},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"I have my nose glued to this book. I bought the book because I am a new legal studies student and was told that the Supreme Court uses the federalist papers to define the constitution. I thought, \\"what else could be better than to read the same papers that the supreme court uses?\\" So, I had to buy this book and was really impressed. It is well organized, has a great preface, and is loaded full of text to be engulfed in.Learning about the history of our legal system is not only essential for a legal student but should be important for every U.S. citizen as well. It explains some of the things that were going on around the constitutuional convention and why the laws are how they were written.The purchasing experience was, as always, terrific and I got the book in record time. This is a thick book and will take quite some time to finish reading but, with that said, the book should be continually used as a reference book.I recommend this one!"},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"I had to purchase this book to read for school. It is interesting to see the history of what was taking place around the time our Constitution was adopted and the politics at work during that time. This gives context to the study of our Constitution."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"The end of the Revolution in 1781 left the United States operating under the Articles of Confederation, a union of equal states. There were problems with this government. A group of men convened in Philadelphia to consider Amendments. The result was a new Constitution to address the problems of the old. This change was controversial, so advocates of the New began writing a series of articles to explain the changes. Alexander Hamilton began the series and was aided by James Madison and John Jay. Those who objected to the original quickly added a Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution. Others were added over time. This book has the 85 articles, the Constitution, and 24 amendments, and an 'Index of Ideas'.'The Federalist' is the most important work in political science that has been written in the United States. It has been quoted by the Supreme Court for judicial review, executive independence, and national supremacy ('Introduction'). It provides the \\"genuine meaning\\" of the Constitution. These articles were published from October 1787 to May 1788. They argue for the adoption of the new Federal Constitution. The immediate purpose was to win over New York to insure the new Constitution (p.ix). Alexander Hamilton was the person behind these articles, the only man from New York to sign. John Jay was a distinguished New York lawyer who authored the NY Constitution of 1777 (a source for the Federal Constitution). James Madison was the \\"most useful member of the Convention of 1787\\" (p.x). All had distinguished careers.'The Federalist' was a source of arguments for the new Constitution. Promises, threats, bargains, and debates were more important than eloquent words (p.xi). [But that leaves no paper trail.] The value of these articles derived from the endurance of the Constitution and the country it created. It explains the value of a Federal government, the failure of the Articles of Confederation, the defense of a federal constitution, and the truths about a free government (p.xii). Given the diverse interests of society, there is a way to keep balance in government.Madison was a proponent of limited government while Hamilton admired an \\"energetic government\\". The Federalist is a \\"bundle of compromises\\". The message is: \\"no happiness without liberty, no liberty without self-government, no self-government without constitutionalism, no constitutionalism without stability and order\\" (p.xvi). Clinton Rossiter says the most important articles are numbers 1, 2, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 23, 37, 39, 47, 48, 49, 51, 62, 63, 70,78, 84, and 85.

We were never required to read the Constitution and I only knew of The Federalist Papers from brief mentions in History books. And they say our citizens are being dumbed down? Crazy conspiracy theorists.So, reading the Federalist Papers in tandem with the Constitution will seriously depress you when contrasting then with now. My, how we've wandered into left field, out the gate, through the parking lot, under the bar, loaded, hammered, and blacked out.Fortunate for posterity sake, New York was obstinant and Hamilton, Madison, and Jay found it necessary to win them over through letters. Unfortunately, posterity has been denied a decent education of our great Republic by not requiring such letters be mandatory reading. An ill-informed electorate has become the result.The Federalist Papers should be read to further understand how and why America is a Republic.

It has the size and heft of a textbook, so it's larger than a typical hardback. I love the size, though, and I couldn't be happier with it. The content, of course, is the pro-arguments made by various founders after the Constitutional Convention to convince the states to ratify the Constitution.

They seem very modern to me, not just some old catechisms to be honored. Federalism versus states' rights.

But, you get used to it. It was also written to oppose the anti-federalists. So, a lot of time is spent refuting their arguments. - a little off MY purpose for reading - but still enlightening. My overall sense of the book was that it was not written for a 2009 audience. I know this is obvious, but that is my sense reading this book.I got this book hoping to learn more about the framers' intentions for The Constitution. I was NOT disappointed. This book achieved that goal. The ideas presented in this book are so fundamental and foundational that I can't believe I've been on this earth for 33 years and am only now reading them.

The Papers were written in defense of an as yet unratified US Constitution and go point by point through why the new form of government was necessary (indeed why any government is necessary) and then through the consitution explaining how the different parts of the new federal government were meant to pull against each other (as advised by Montesquieu), and make it as difficult as possible for factions (today we might use the term \\"special interests\\") to trample the rights of the minority. The language can be a bit tricky at times, especially in some of Madison's papers (though his papers are often the most powerful), but at the end one emerges with a much deeper understanding of what the founders were thinking and what they thought they were ratifying (as opposed to how it is interpretted today).But the book can also be applied more generally. The debate on how to balance the need for effectual government against the need to restrain the government from oppressing the people is applicable more generally. As you read you will almost certainly see some echoes of modern debate between the desire of modern politicians to expand government to remedy any number of social ills, and of others who regard the same acts as being the beginnings of tyranny. In some places, you will see where history has proven the founders wrong in terms of what artifacts of government would be sufficient to prevent future expansion of government, and other places where they were almost prescient.Why every American child is not required to read this in High School civics classes, I will never understand."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"I wanted the Federalist Papers, edited by Clinton Rossiter.

The Kindle edition is The Federalist Papers, all right, but with a different editor and from a different publisher.This is either an honest mistake because Amazon can't differentiate between editions of works in the public domain, or it is a bait & switch, where you think you are getting a particular edition of a text but you receive something different on your Kindle.Luckily, it only requires a couple keyclicks to return a Kindle book.

Reading the argument for and then the argument against presents both sides in perspective. There is truth in the arguments of the Anti-Federalists that ring true in our political arena today of parties and corruption, and you can see the insight of Jay, Madison & Hamilton in their presentation of the checks and balances built into the Constitution and their belief in its ability to reign in ambitions of politicians. By reading both together it gives the same insight that the men of that time gained and why it was such a hotly debated issue. Today we accept the Constitution's legitimacy and wisdom, but in the 1780's there was a deliberate aversion to a strong central government. We had just fought to rid ourselves of a monarchy that was centeralized and distance, the people feared giving even a fraction of their freedom to another centralized government. Madison and Hamilton especially addressed the concerns in a manner that was understandable and thoughtful."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"The funny thing is that I happened to stumble across a review of this edition while perusing a political scientist's list of books for congressional studies.

It was the brilliant thinking and writings of a surprising few that formed the unique U.S Constitution--the foundation for the most powerful, just, and free nation on the planet.The Papers are a series of eighty-five essays written by Alexander Hamilton and James Madison and published in various colonial publications during 1787 and 1788, just as the great Constitutional Convention takes place in Philadelphia. They cover a wide variety of topics, each designed to describe the design and justification for the new republican federal government: the House, the Senate, the Presidency, the Judiciary, States' Rights, the Bill of Rights, etc. The essays are difficult to read in today's language. The writing style is verbose and stuffed with big words. Some of the longest sentences ever written are in there. But by plowing through this national treasure, one makes these observations:One, these guys were smart. Hamilton and Madison possessed intellects unsurpassed by anyone in our federal government before or since. They envisioned literally the entire complex structure of the government before it even existed. And two, they did their homework. They applied their great brilliance to the study of political science and the vast wealth of historical experience offered by all the countries of the world. To make their points they often reference the examples of England, France, Spain, and the ancient civilizations of Greece, Rome, and more.After reading the Federalist Papers, one can't help but come away with a renewed sense of patriotism, a sense of awe at the rare beauty of our democracy, and a glowing appreciation for U.S. citizenship. It's amazing to me that these documents aren't more popular. I went all the way through school, and never heard of the Federalist Papers.

Far too many times you will be likely to encounter someone who is completely unfamiliar with notions like executive prerogative and is in utter bewilderment where Bush, for example, gets off with such ideas as the recent wiretaps. The abstract justification for such cases is among the countless other arguments provided by Hamilton, Madison, and Jay within these pages, and though one may disagree with them, they are nonetheless important to know and understand. They are hardly perfect, and many, such as Hamilton's attempt to justify the absence of a Bill of Rights, show that these articles sought to employ every argument available to make it seem that the Constitution was a paragon of a social contract (rather than a document meticulously written as a result of numerous compromises with little universal ideological consistency), but they are nonetheless important to have in one's library.Of course, it's easy to find every single one of them online for free, not to mention all the other documents this edition adds on, such as the Constitution or the Declaration of Independence. It is a good thing, then, that this edition is so cheap, as it is certainly convenient to have them all in a relatively small book that preserves all your markings. The edition also tries to overcome this burden of free access to its material through a masterfully written introduction, through a table of contents that briefly summarizes the argument contained within each article, and through the numerous footnotes that concisely expand upon the many now archaic references to the Romans and the Classics that Publius tends to make. For these reasons, I find having this precise copy of the Federalist Papers worth the 7 or so bucks that it costs.The one thing I dislike about it, and why I give it 4 stars rather than 5, is that the paper and ink are almost of newspaper quality, so that extensive reading will tend to leave black markings on one's fingers. This does get annoying when writing papers about it and flipping around its pages."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"Buy this book only if you want to move along the road toward knowledge and away from ignorance. I find it a tough read but an essential read if you want to understand a conservative's aversion to destroying the best Constitution ever written. If you are older than 21 years and still believe in liberal interpretations, the \\"papers\\" may help you develop a more reverant view of our real rights and the fears of the framers. A slow (almost required) read should alert you to the dangers of \\"finding\\" a right not intended or even remotely obvious in this great document (the Constitution of the United States)."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"The Kindle edition is very disappointing - it only contains the papers, and (at least on the iPhone Kindle reader) does not even contain a table of contents, links, or the fine introduction of the paperback.

However, the print quality is so poor as to merit only two stars. It is much worse than \\"newsprint,\\" on roughly 20 pages of my copy, over a quarter of the page is virtually unreadable, the text is so light. The only reason this book merited two stars was its superb notes, illuminating some of the more perplexing aspects of the book.

They were drafted by three important historical figures during the forming of the original 13 states. These papers were drawn up in order to encourage other states to join the Union. After the drafting of the Constitution of the United States in 1787, only Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey had joined. These papers appeared in New York journal's and were impassioned pleas for other states to join the Union. I am Canadian, but I read these papers with great interest. The majority of them were written by Alexander Hamilton, and he is an impassioned and charismatic writer. Good history lesson here."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"Don't let the 3 star rating mislead you. This is a brilliant summation of the Constitution by three of the smartest Founding Fathers: Alexander Hamilton (first Secretary of the Treasury), James Madison (Father of the Constitution and fourth President of the U.S.), and John Jay (first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court). It is such a shame that there are so few political geniuses in government today. The breadth of their knowledge, particularly Madison's, boggles the mind. Except for the fact that they took the view that the Constitution didn't need a bill of rights (that was passed after the writing of these papers), you will find no better examination of the Constitution. But that is one of the problems with \\"The Federalist Papers,\\" it examines the structure of the federal government in detail (brilliantly too), but most of today's Constitutional questions revolve around the amendments to the Constitution. So, if you were looking for the Founding Fathers' ideas about the meaning behind the second amendment, you better find a different book. The other problem with the book is that while the language is not archaic (yet), it is still difficult for the average reader to grasp. If you didn't get a high verbal score on the SATs, look for the version in modern English. So really, this is a great book to read for the serious political scientist, but the average reader should look for something easier or limit themselves to Papers 10 and 51."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"The is a good reference copy of The Federalist Papers and it includes The Declaration of Independence, The Articles of Confederation, and The Constitution with the amendments.I recommend this book to those that want to learn more about The Constitution and our country's government.

We the American people need to understand the political mindset of our country's founding so we can see how far things have gone astray. The federal government's powers are limited and specified, meaning it cannot make up the rules as it goes along. But you wouldn't know that if you simply observed its actions over the last 100 years.

Published in New York, and in installments the papers are very influential in American Politics.The Authors of the Federalist Papers are an interesting group. Madison and Hamilton did not have the same political views, but it is very difficult to tell the difference between their writings. The reason for this is the persona of Publius (An ancient Roman) that was taken on by both Hamilton and Madison.The Federalist Papers outlined the ideas and the powers of the new government. This book is outstanding because it has a guide to the papers. Some of the historical references and language which was used at the time of the publication are not understood by most readers of the 21st century and the guide and explanation of these ideas makes this book a gem.

Although I haven't finished reading all the papers, I've already learned many things and dispelled several preconceptions about our Constitution that I had previously thought was fact. For instance, our Constitution has intentionally created in it a 'factional' system (first defended by Madison in Paper No. 9) that promotes discord and disharmony. The factions are designed to prevent the majority from totally controlling the federal government so that minorities can have an almost equal sway over all governing facets. The thought process here has to do with experiences of Athens and other pure democracies that ultimately turned into a rule by mob mentality. Another interesting point is Publius's accounts of social norms of the day, and his assumption that these norms would continue on and on which is a fallacy in today's Union with it's limitless special interests, both monied and pauperism, and the politically correct idea of diversity being a good thing for our society. Publius had no idea of Communism or Socialism and what that type of faction could cause in creating havoc in this country and our government.If my opinion is worth anything to anyone, reading these papers along with the Antifederalist papers is well worth one's time for the reasons I've stated above plus many more."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"This is the book that is constantly being quoted--often by parties on the opposite sides of an argument, about what this country means and where it should go. There is nothing else like it, despite books written during the time, most of which are meant to glorify a person or political idea and are valuable to understanding the subject written about (despite any biases, if you understand what they are). This is where a study of America's founding should begin, and should be REQUIRED reading in every history/civics course."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"To better understand the perspective of supreme court justices one must get a sense of the history of our constitution. We often hear politicians and justices talk of the intentions of the founding fathers. We hear terms like strict constructionalist or origionalist. The Federalist Papers are a good place to look at the intentions of the founding fathers. These along with readings on Jefferson and Madison will help to clear up this often muddled picture. The Federalist Papers were an effort by Hamilton and Jay to educate the voting public so the Constitution would be ratified. It was a controversial document.

Thank God.)We need a rebirth of patriotism and this is a good start."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"I can hardly offer enough praise for this work. While most Americans have probably read the constituion at least once in their life, it is a shame that so many people are daunted by the task of reading what may be one of the best political pamphlets of all time. To truly understand the constituion and what its writers thought concerning its application it is necessary to understand the political climate of the day and some of the problems facing those who saw the necessity of doing away with the failed system of government under the Articles of Confederation.Hamilton, Madison, and to a lesser extent Jay, all offer the reader with a first-hand look behind the writing of the constituion and help to explain such misunderstood principles of our government such as the differnces between a nationalist and a federalist system of government, the necessity of seperation of powers and ckecks and balances, and the electoral college. While some of their perceptions of how the young republic would mature and some of the problems it would face are either laughably naive or downright wrong, considering how much the world has changed since the writing of these papers it is amazing how well they understood the political situtions inherent in all governments; both in their own day and in ours.The Federalist Papers are a fitting amalgamation of over 2000 years of political thought but they are also an interesting case study in a pragmatic view of human nature which was shared by almost all of the writers of the constituion, that man is inherently flawed and thus a government must be designed so as to protect itself from the fruits of these flaws. While astute and inciteful it is important however to view this work as a political pamphlet (it was origionally written for newspaper publication) and not purely as a work of political philosophy and thus it is full of verbose rhetorical flourishes that sometimes make the authors intent confusing. Still a must read for those who wish to understand anything about political philosophy or human nature."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"If you are going to read \\"The Federalist Papers,\\" you must also read \\"The Anti-Federalist Papers\\" in order to get the complete picture. Both books cross-reference each other and both are instrumental in understanding how our government was designed and how it was intended to work. In addition to the Papers, this edition also contains the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and an excellent introduction by Charles Kesler.In a time when each colony had its own \\"constitution,\\" the Federalists believed in creating one strong centralized government (with one Constitution) that could effectively represent the people. The authors and supporters of the Constitution knew that they could not afford to lose the vote in the state ratifying conventions. In an effort to win over his home state (New York), Alexander Hamilton, with the assistance of James Madison and John Jay, began a collection of 85 essays and published them under the pseudonym of \\"Publius\\" (named after one of the founders and heroes of the Roman republic, Publius Valerius Publicola). The Papers, published in 1787 and 1788, analyze and defend the proposed Constitution of the United States.The Federalists succeeded in winning the colonists' support. But, even though the anti-federalists lost, their ideas were also brilliant and made an important contribution to the history of our government, which is why you should also read \\"The Anti-Federalist Papers.\\"This book is a must-read for all Americans.

However, we need to be familiar with the Founding Fathers' opinions in framing the Constitution, and they were no less conflicting now than then. This book, however, helps to introduce a person to some of the opinions of the Fathers. Coupled with the Anti-Federalist Papers, one can educate himself on the original intentions and interpretations (If they didn't have one interpretation, we cannot). It will also help us see the redemptive elements of out Constitution and political theory that lead to great things such as women's sufferage and the abolition of slavery.Simply put, this is a must read for an American. If you value your political comments, educate yourself or be quiet."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"The Federalist is the most important work on American political ideology, save perhaps for the Constitution itself. Written largely by Madison and Hamilton (John Jay became ill after writing only a handful of the essays), two of the most brilliant minds this country has produced (okay, Hamilton was not technically a natural-born American, but that's splitting hairs), The Federalist is nothing short of remarkable in its argument for a federal system of republican government. Particularly important is Madison's Federalist No. 10, which blends Hume's and Montesquieu's thoughts on faction and republicanism to present a brilliant argument for an extended republic based on a federation of smaller republics (ie, the United States). If you don't own a copy already, buy one. In fact, buy two (as I have)-one hardbound volume to keep on your bookshelf for reference, and one paperback to carry with you wherever you go.

The Federalist Papers is a scholarly work of remarkable erudition that aggressively, unapologetically, and cogently defines the United States Constitution according to Federalist views, proposes changes and limits to it, and advocates points of view regarding its implementation and continued practicality in a nation rife with disagreement among its varying ideologies and regions. The Federalist Papers were composed by men who supported something akin to a meritocracy, but a meritocracy defined by birth status, wealth, and social prominence rather than non-status-borne achievement or the ability to appeal to the voting citizenry of the nation. Aspects of this system hold tremendous worth and have been of incalculable influence on the operation of the American nation for two centuries. However, untempered by an opposing party more in favor of a representative democracy participated in by all peoples low and high, the Federalist position as espoused in the Papers could readily have resulted in tyranny and a nation unrecognizable as the one envisioned by most of our nation's founders and diametrically unlike the one we have today. Neither Lincoln nor Reagan nor Clinton, for example, would likely have become President under a political system sought by Federalists. However, the Federalist Papers themselves as an early example of American citizens (albeit aristocratic citizens) impacting the national government show that our mutable, dynamic Constitution works well in bending to the needs and wants of the people it binds. Although I found these essays to be among the most difficult reading of my life, I am not unmindful of their merit and do not regret the investment of much time, effort, and disciplined devotion it took me to get through them. I would even go so far as to say it is a shame The Federalist Papers is not taught more than it is in today's schools, although in small pieces, as an ongoing enhancement of the curriculum rather than as a single reading assignment."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"Justice Antonin Scalia asked our class at Marquette Law School last week who has read the Federalist Papers cover to cover.

Even two hundred years later, the arguments presented by Hamiliton, Madison, and Jay stand as testimony to the vision of our founding fathers.As our nation enters into the new century we are gripped by ongoing investigation of the President. We hear charges and countercharges of partisan politics. Yet, if we want to know why the nature of partisan politics then we need look no further than Madison's Federalist #10. If we want to understand the impeachment process, why the founders provided for the process, and how they envisioned it working, one needs only read Hamilton's Federalists #65.When I hear commentator's proclaim the federal court's have overstepped their bounds, I wish to shout at them they should read Hamilton's Federalist #78 before they speak.The Federalists were designed to be read individually and then reflected on. They were written to present arguments for the ratification of the Constitution by the New York Convention. They presented arguments and insights which each citizen of our nation should and must know in order to participate effectively in our democratic process.The issues of today--the answers to our constitutional questions, and the myrid other problems can best be solved if one first understands the essences of our constitution.I highly recommend the Federalists papers to all. Take your time, and consider wisely the wisdom of the sages and how true their words ring today."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"Written by Alexander Hamilton, one of the Founding Fathers of the US, the 'Federalist Papers' are a series of articles written for a New York newspaper. Mr Hamilton goes into detail on the thought process behind the US Constitution and clearly shows the intent behind the Constitution and the BIll of Rights. In this respect, the 'Papers' clearly and concisely outline what the Founding Fathers meant and should be used by citizens, political leaders, and the court system to accurately adjudicate the true meaning behind our Constitution.I found this collection of writings by Mr Hamilton to be a very humbling eye opener as it can clearly be seen how far off track the US is getting with &#34;modern&#34; interpretation of the Constitution. By reading these papers, you can clearly see that the Founding Fathers were well educated in both literature and history and attempted to produce a framework of laws governing the US that would preculde pitfalls that earlier Republics have fallen into. Yes, the US is a Constitutional Republic and the Founding Fathers never intended nor wanted the US to be a Democracy. We are a Rule of Law nation not a majority rule one and the 'Federalist Papers' makes that more than abundantly clear.For example, in Federalist #26, Mr Hamilton clearly explains the Second Amendment, clarifying that the 'militia' is all able-bodied men, and that the right to bear arms meant that citizens should have the same type of arms as the standing army because the full intent of the Second Amendment is to prevent government tyranny, not to protect hunting rights.I believe that the 'Federalist Papers' should be required reading by all High-School and college students in preparation for them to become well-informed voting citizens and able to preserve and protect the Republic our Founding Fathers have created."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"The Federalist Papers are rightly considered one of the most authoritative explanations of the provisions of the Constitution in existence. While much further interpretation and definition of the Constitution has taken place over the past 200+ years through the slow accretion of judicial interpretation, the Federalist remains the source for a contemporary explanation of the political causes and justification for virtually every clause in the Constitution.Some passages are less thrilling than others but Nos. 10, 39, 48, and 51 are about as good as it gets in terms of explicating the structure of what became the US government.A must read for political science majors, history majors and selected parts for high school students in every government course."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"For those newly awakened to American politics, nothing is more important than the Federalist Papers.

From a government of limited and enumerated powers, celebrated by these Founders, we now have a government that, in the belief of most and the frank admission of many, is a government of unlimited power. They would call this tyranny, and say why. Americans sleep through it, waiting for the check in the mailbox."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"If you are going to read \\"The Federalist Papers,\\" you must also read \\"The Anti-Federalist Papers\\" in order to get the complete picture. Both books cross-reference each other, and both are instrumental in understanding how our government was designed and how it was intended to work. In addition to the Papers, this edition also contains the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and an excellent introduction by Charles Kesler.In a time when each colony had its own \\"constitution,\\" the Federalists believed in creating one strong centralized government (with one Constitution) that could effectively represent the people. The authors and supporters of the Constitution knew that they could not afford to lose the vote in the state ratifying conventions. In an effort to win over his home state (New York), Alexander Hamilton, with the assistance of James Madison and John Jay, began a collection of 85 essays and published them under the pseudonym of \\"Publius\\" (named after one of the founders and heroes of the Roman republic, Publius Valerius Publicola). The Papers, published in 1787 and 1788, analyze and defend the proposed Constitution of the United States.Obviously, the Federalists succeeded in winning the colonists' support. But even though the anti-federalists lost, their ideas were also brilliant and made an important contribution to the history of our government, which is why you should also read \\"The Anti-Federalist Papers.\\"This book is a must-read for all Americans. After reading this book, you will have a renewed appreciation and admiration for the wisdom and vision of our founding fathers."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"I rate this one of five stars due to its blatant manner of trying to provide commentary to the youth of America on personal views and preferences that are contrary to our nation's founding documents (if possible, it would be a zero). Without a doubt, the leftist tendencies of many in our nation are the surest threat to our survival as a free nation. And while I have defended our great nation for twenty-nine years of active military service, I sometimes am amazed at the fact that I must also defend these types of unpatriotic attacks on our own nation.

Kruschev said the communists would destroy us without ever firing a shot and Lenin spoke of useful idiots. In my humble opinion, guaranteed the light of day by the Consititution, these people are who Kruschev and Lenin spoke of back in the day. Boycott all of their publications.

They seem to be one off starting with Federalist No. 6.The index shows subjects but doesn't indicate where it is. The index is one of the best features of the print edition since it's very thorough.The copy of the Constitution included in the print edition and advertised in the table of contents in this edition is supposed to show references to the relevant Federalist Paper for each section.

Does anyone else have trouble understanding the writing style of the late 17th century? I appreciate that the book is true to the original newspaper articles, but sometimes my eyes glaze over and I lose the gist of what the author was trying to say. For example: \\"The disciplined armies always kept on foot on the continent of Europe, though they bear a malignant aspect to liberty and oeconomy, have notwithstanding been productive of the signal advantage, of rendering sudden conquests impracticable, and of preventing that rapid desolation, which used to mark the progress of war, prior to their introduction.\\" I think he's saying that a standing army will prevent foreign powers from easily invading your country. But I have to do this \\"translation\\" in my head as I read each sentence, so the reading really gets bogged down.So, this work is not something that most people can just breeze through - it takes some thought and understanding of the culture and style of the time. If there is a modern-language translation available, I would buy that as a supplement, because the content definitely is worth learning!"},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"Anyone wanting to have a true understanding of the founding intent and framework of the United States needs to read The Federalist Papers. This version is economical and serves the purpose. You will not get this much value out of any constitutional law course!!"},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"Placing a disclaimer on the Federalist Papers is unbelievable. It's their right of course, but it's our right to protest and to NOT BUY.Thank you."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"The new edition of THE FEDERALIST PAPERS edited by Clinton Rossiter and co. is probably the best paperback edition. Rossiter and Charles Kesler did a good job in presenting these papers, and their explanations and notes make this book clear for readers. THE FEDERALIST PAPERS alone are an important source of serious political thinking. In an age of almost unbridled political power, corruption, empire buidling, etc. THE FEDERALIST PAPERS are important reminder of what a Free Republic (not an empire) should be.THE FEDERALIST PAPERS were written by Alexander Hamilton (1757-1804), John Jay (1745-1829), and James Madison (1751-1835). Due to concerns about the New York State legislators ratifying the The U.S. Constitution, these papers were journal pieces written to New York journals and newspapers to convince both the residents and state legislators to ratify The U.S. Constitution. One should note there were other published articles supporting ratification of The U.S. Constitution and other articles can be read in a text titled FRIENDS OF THE CONSTITUTION.What is alarming about THE FEDERALISTS PAPERS is that they were written for most readers. If one were to write such articles these days, most Americans would not read them nor comprehend them. This is a sad commentary on Americans regarding serious political writing regarding their birthright. If THE FEDERALIST PAPERS were assigned to high school kids, whoever would make such an assignment would be fired or worse.THE FEDERALIST PAPERS give important explanations of the separation of powers, limits of each branch of the central government (The Federal Government), and how political power should be used within severe limitations. These articles were a brilliant attempt to mitigate fears that The U.S. Constitution would give far too much power to the the central or federal government.The late Clinton Rossiter had a useful suggestion for those who did not want to read all 85 of THE FEDERALIST PAPERS. He suggested that the best numbers were 1,2,6,9,10, 14, 15, 16,23, 37, 39,47, 49, 51, 62, 70, 78, 84, and 85. Those readers who read these numbered papers would probably want to read the remainder.This newer paperback edition of THE FEDERALIST PAPERS has some valuable features to help the reader navigate complex political thinking. The U.S. Constitution is placed in the end of the book with page numbers of the book whereby the authors of THE FEDERALIST PAPERS refer to that section of the U.S. Constitution. This gives clarity as to exactly what the authors were arguing regarding specific sections of the proposed U.S. Constitution. Another important feature of this edition of THE FEDERALIST PAPERS consists of the notes. The men who wrote THE FEDERALIST PAPERS were learned men who had seriously studied history and political thought. The notes explain the examples of Ancient Greek and Roman History used to make some of the arguments. These notes also refer to examples of Renaissance and English History which were also used to make good arguments from historical examples. One could get first rate learning experience of Ancient Greek and Roman History as well as a better view of European Renaissance and English History.Readers should not forget that the authors of THE FEDERALIST PAPERS were responding to the Anti-Federalists and their articles titled THE ANTI-FEDERALIST PAPERS. Too often the Anti-Federalists are referred to as obstrcutionists and narrow minded men. This is simply not true. The ANTI-FEDERALIST PAPERS were as well written and brilliantly argued as THE FEDERALIST PAPERS.One should note that one of the major objections of the Anti-Federalists to ratification of The U.S. Constitution was that it did not contain a Bill of Rights. The Federalists took this argument seriously. Basically, one could argue that without the Anti-Federalists, there would have been no Bill of Rights. Ergo, without The Bill of Rights, there would have been no U.S. Constitution. The Anti-Federalists were very important in the ratification of The U.S. Constitution.Anyone who wants to define who Americans should be should read THE FEDERALIST PAPERS. They should also read THE ANTI-FEDERALIST PAPERS and read clear, informed, and well written political theory from men who could actually think. Most political hacks and too many American citizens are not even vaguely aware of this important political writing. Yet, this political writing is the very best American political thinking in U.S. History. This reviewer highly recommends the Rossiter-Kesler edition of THE FEDERALIST PAPERS and other editions of THE ANTI-FEDERALIST PAPERS."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"and the Mentor Federalist Papers keep getting better. Yes, that's right. They actually managed to improve on it. The great new additions include the Declaration, the Articles, and an excellent new introduction by Charles Kessler. I think the killer feature for new readers will be the notes in the back, which, if you (like me) are shaky in your Greek history (and the finer points of European), do a great job of explaining allusions and references by the Papers. Be sure to use this feature -- there's no indication in the text that a note exists, but you should just look if you're unsure of a historical setting (or something similar), and there probably will be one.On the minus side, I do miss Rossiter's introduction. It wasn't as good for laying out the plan of the work, but it should have been included (along with Kessler's) for its excellent overview of the contemporary situation and the philosophy behind the papers. Also, I feel that Rossiter's contents were slightly better than Kessler's. And, the page numbers are changed, invalidating older references to them. But all in all it's an improvement, and certainly the Mentor edition is the only one to have. Period. It's the one used by at least some of the Supreme Court Justices, and it retains that single dominating feature, Rossiter's cross-referenced Constitution (and index of ideas).As for the Papers themselves, of course, they need no review. They are the first and ultimate Constitutional commentary, and fascinating reading besides. As literature they stand out for the exceptional style (all the more remarkable considering the haste in which they were written) and clear thinking, and more than any other book they define how the U.S. _should_ work.All in all, this is one of the best book bargains on the market, that rare coincidence where best edition meets mass-market paperback. What are you waiting for?-Stephen"},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"This is the best edition of the Federalist Papers.

Why? Well,check out the disclaimer Wilder has stuck onto the words of Madison, Hamilton and Jay, thereby earning one star:\\"This book is a product of its time and does not reflect the same values as it would if it were written today. Parents might wish to discuss with their children how views on race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and interpersonal relations have changed since this book was written before allowing them to read this classic work.\\"Yup.

While there are occasional inconsistencies and undoubtedly many of the founding fathers that took part in the Constitutional Convention and favored adoption of the Constitution would disagree with some of its contents, it is vital reading if one hopes to understand the original intent of the founders."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"One of the reviewers below challenges the notion that the US was ever a Democracy, however, he (apologies if it's a 'she') is viewing the Federalist Papers from the perspective of modern times, and that is a fallacy in reviewing this work, but fortunately it's an instructive fallacy.The issue with the Federalist Papers is that although it is the leading arguments for the creation of a more centralized government (to replace the Articles of Confederation which seemed inpractible), not all of these arguments were adopted in the Constitution, and some that were did not survive very long. As a result, you may get the wrong impression that the Federalist Papers=the Constitution. Remember, Hamilton's party, the Federalists, did not survive much longer after the defeat of Adams by Jefferson in the 1800 election. The populism of Jefferson and Madison were the ultimate winners *at the time*.And my *at the time* comment is important. Nowadays the federal government of the US holds a superior and decisive position in the governing of its people; this has not always been the case. In the early-to-mid 19th century, federal power was severely limited when it came to internal affairs; most of the government was conducted at the local level, with some county and state control thrown in where applicable. So *at the time*, the fact that the Senate had 2 members from each state (and appointed by the state legislature) regardless of population was *not* a measure that was anti-democratic in purpose. Democracy existed because the government was predominantly local and the people were predominantly involved in its affairs.Thus my contention; now for the suggestion: if your project is strictly to research the creation of the US Constitution, than the Federalist Papers by themselves are fine. If, however, you are more interested in how the Constitution affected American society at that time, I would recommend that you start by reading de Tocqueville's \\"Democracy in America\\", and working backwards. The immediate results of the Constitution are best expressed in de Tocqueville (he toured the United States and published his work in Europe within 50 years of the ratification) because its not the causes of the Constitution he is discussing, but its effects. After you have completed Democracy in America, then you'll be able to approach the Federalist (and of course the Anti-Federalist) Papers with the understanding of what worked, what didn't, and maybe what we need to work again for."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"This free Kindle edition of The Federalist (listing James Madison as first author) has a rather significant shortcoming: it has no table of contents. Since one generally reads the essays in The Federalist by topic (e.g. Federalist No. 10, or No. 51), the lack of a navigation tools is a real shortcoming. Fortunately, the free Amazon edition that lists John Jay as the first author does have a navigable table of contents that jumps directly to the desired essay.The formatting of this (Madison) edition is also a bit odd. In the heading for each essay, rather than using bold font for the number or the topic, the only words appearing in bold is the author's name. That said, if you simply want to read the essays from front to back, this one will do the trick."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"I will boycott any product of this company.

I had to read it for a class, but I would've enjoyed reading it on my own too."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"The great push pull among great minds with different views.....BUT WORKED OUT A COMPROMISE TO THEIR DIFFERENCES! The pluses and minuses given a true forum to flush out the meaning of the words so that an INFORMED vote for ratification could occur. HOW UNLIKE TODAY; where opinions and feelings triumph facts."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"It was insightful and edifying to read what is essentially a commentary on the Constitution by three of the most influential of the Founding Fathers, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James Madison. The Federalist Papers were written to advocate for the Constitution's ratification by the states by expositing on the purpose and intent of the various articles of the Constitution and how the branches of government worked together. This came, of course, from a decidedly Federalist point of view. The Federalists argued for a strong central government to promote national power and mercantile development, but balanced by reserving certain powers and responsibilities to the citizens and states. The Federalist Papers are worth reading by anyone interested in American political history, and every citizen, in order to better understand the processes that guide American politics and US federalism."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"I have not finshed the total as of yet. But, so far it appears to be a great policitic piece for the the people to vote for the new goverment."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"This is considered one of (if not the) authority on the U.S. Constitution. It lays out several arguments for the Constitution which was at the time set to replace the Articles of Confederation. Some people have told me that these essays argue for a large federal government, and on that I have to disagree. What is being argued for in these is a strong union, that is ultimately controlled by the people.The argument is quite simple, a strong union with a central government can provide for the common defense and gives the United States a single face to foreign nations. This government can collect taxes, raise armies/navies, broker deals with other countries, and conduct business as a single entity rather than 13 (at the time) individual states.It's interesting to read this and look at our country today. Much of what is argued for has kept our current Constitution in place and we have not fallen under a tyranny or an oligarchy, something that the Constitution was designed to prevent. While some things seem to have been forgotten, like the idea that the people ultimately have the power to change the government when it's acting in a way they dislike, much of what's here has helped maintain one of the longest running republics.This is a must read if you want a better understanding of the Constitution and the arguments in favor of it. If you consider yourself an informed citizen, and you vote, but you haven't read this, you are doing yourself and the United States a huge disservice."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"I assume the papers to have come from reliable sources. There is no current information nor sources assumed, and sparse metadata."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"Every US citizen, or person aspiring to become one, should read this at least once in their life! This is our republic and it's constitution explained."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"If you want to understand the Constitution, you should read the Federalist Papers. They present, at great length, the rationale for discarding the Articles of Confederation and adopting the Constitution. You really can't claim to understand the Constitution, how it works, how it fits together, and how it was intended to fit together without reading these articles. (I picked this up on the recommendation of Justice Scalia, and he was absolutely right about this being a must-read to understand the Constitution.)(A quick note on this particular edition of the Federalist Papers: while it self-describes as an &#34;enriched classic&#34;, it is not especially enriched. As is proper, the book includes a copy of the Constitution and its amendments -- although strangely it omits the 27th Amendment despite being published well after its ratification. [There is no included copy of the Articles of Confederation, unfortunately -- I'd definitely have found such a copy helpful, particularly since I had no other access to them when reading the book.] A notes section which explains the cultural and historical references scattered throughout the papers. A brief 7-page &#34;Interpretive Notes&#34; section discusses the context for the Federalist Papers. A &#34;Critical Excerpts&#34; section discusses early reactions to and scholarship concerning the Federalist Papers up to the present day. And there's a couple pages of questions and a few suggestions for further learning for the interested reader. Does this spare additional material really an &#34;enriched classic&#34; make?There's something to be said for providing the unvarnished text, with explanatory notes that are informative but not interpretive; it's much easier for the reader to form his own opinions, uninfluenced by the biases of a commentator, when the Federalist Papers stand on their own. This is for the most part the strategy this book follows. Yet I would not call this book, for following that strategy, an &#34;enriched classic&#34;. If you're looking for analysis of each paper in context with the papers themselves, this is not the book for you.)The entire series is long, consisting of 85 papers of various lengths. Yet it's well worth reading and slogging through, even if you have to contend with the 1780s style of highly-educated writing to do it.That said, I would strongly recommend not attempting to read it the way one might read any old book, starting at the beginning, reading a bunch at a stretch, then reading a bunch more at a stretch, until the entire series is read. Instead, read a paper at a time, then spend some time to think it over. Consider the arguments and how they fit together; look at how they relate to the modern day; consider what was missed in the initial analysis. Giving each article the time it requires will make this book take considerably longer than the average book of 630 pages (not including text after the articles) would take. But it's worth it.(For a little context, I started this book a couple weeks before an Appalachian Trail thru-hike, expecting at some point to finish it and leave it in a shelter for some other hiker to read, at which point I'd pick up another book and do the same thing, as many times as it took to finish the hike. I didn't even finish this book over those 139 days of hiking, only on the flight home -- it's that dense and worthy of thought. And it's not like I was distracted by other reading, either: I only read one other book in full during that time, plus a couple hundred pages of another. And even reading with that deliberateness, I'm sure I'd get more out of it if I spent the time to read it again.)"},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"Still reading it and reccomend it, a wealth of information about our Constituion and the work that whent into it"},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"This writing helps document the intents of our founding fathers and all who call themselves Americans should read and understand."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"Really helps clarify issues that the Founding Fathers were struggling with as well as outlines their views and compromises they were working through to create the United States."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"This copy is worth every penny and more.

It is the foundation of our form of government. The Declaration of Independence and the Federalist Papers contain the principals upon which the U.S. Constitution was written. Our Founding Fathers were very wise to build upon time tested principals. Their documents and arguments are as valid and important today as they were then.

They are unworthy of the great Nation that we share."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"The Federalist Papers were written primarily by Alexander Hamilton and James Maddison (with a few also written by John Jay) under the pen name of &quot;Publius.&quot; The papers were written to gain support of the residents of New York State for ratification of the Constitution. First, it is important to note what the Papers are not! They are not debates among the drafters of the Constitution which can serve as legislative history as to the drafters' intent. Rather, ithey are the opinion of &quot;Publius&quot; as to why we needed a Constitution setting up a federal system with a strong national government rather than a weaker system under the failed Articles of Confederation. For example, how could we have a national defense if one small confederation of states were attacked and the other states were not bound by a strong antional government to come to it's defense? Hamilton and Madison grew to be political rivals so it is interesting to see the unity they had in advocating our system of government under the proposed Constitution. Of particular interest is the classic warning against factions and the mental wrestling over the best way to temper their effects. I believe that whether you plow through all of the Papers cover to cover, or read them selectively, you will gain an invaluable appreciation for the genius behind our system of government."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"I rate this book 5 stars because the content is so vital to understanding what our founding fathers were thinking as they tried to convince the Americans in New York that a \\"Foederal\\" government, rather than individual states or territories, was the best way to bring the new union together.OK, now readability. Does anyone else have trouble understanding the writing style of the late 17th century? I appreciate that the book is true to the original newspaper articles, but sometimes my eyes glaze over and I lose the gist of what the author was trying to say. For example: \\"The disciplined armies always kept on foot on the continent of Europe, though they bear a malignant aspect to liberty and oeconomy, have notwithstanding been productive of the signal advantage, of rendering sudden conquests impracticable, and of preventing that rapid desolation, which used to mark the progress of war, prior to their introduction.\\" I think he's saying that a standing army will prevent foreign powers from easily invading your country. But I have to do this \\"translation\\" in my head as I read each sentence, so the reading really gets bogged down.So, this work is not something that most people can just breeze through - it takes some thought and understanding of the culture and style of the time. If there is a modern-language translation available, I would buy that as a supplement, because the content definitely is worth learning!"},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"It's frightening how accurate this book is. All throughout the 85 papers that make up The Federalist, Hamilton, Madison and Jay state their points complete with warnings of what might happen should things go in a different direction. Certainly they were standing up for their opinions and beliefs and of course they understood (and supported) the fact that not everyone would agree with their proposals, but something that we have today that they couldn't experience is hindsight. The fears of a civil war for the reasons articulated came true almost to the number, the reasons why and how and what the ultimate end-result would probably be. The warnings against abusive state and federal governments have, time and again, been bled out with remarkably accurate assumption. The troubles of even so far a distant future as today were thought about and discussed and every effort was made to counter such obstacles with the sheer ugency of ideas.It is tragic that this book has become something of a forgotten classic for the people of today, shrugging their shoulders and presuming that the founding fathers have nothing new to teach us.

Each of the papers was nothing but a solid block of text--you might say a wall of text--due to the lack of paragraph breaks.

The old saying is that &#34;To understand the present, investigate the past.&#34; And I find that to be true. When I know the reason, it is easier for me to accept. The Federalist Papers were known to me, for quite a few years. They were important after the Revolutionary War, and during the states machinations about the weakness of the Articles of Confederation, then in force. Washington, Hamilton, John Adams, and James Madison understood that this document encouraged invasion from a foreign power. So a new more Nationalistic Document was required. The 85 articles written by Hamilton, John Jay and Madison, appeared in all the popular newspapers in the Colonies. And these articles were most instrumental in making the citizens of each state understand how important a new Constitution, that would bind each state more closely together, was of the security of the Nation.The writing is as good as English can get.

Long before the Revolutionary War, the men who would be forever identified as the country's founding fathers, had to have colonists' support by convincing them that the new nation they envisioned promised a better life. In doing that, the eventual founders published their ideas and ideals in a collection called &quot;The Federalist Papers,&quot; so titled to identify the proposed new government as a federalist one that established a federal government of three branches (the executive, judiciary and legislative) with checks and balances, and independent of what would be territorial states. Here, in essay form, the towering historic words of such founders as George Washington, Thomas Paine, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay lay out their vision of a new country not under the stifling governance of the mother country. The ideas of the founding fathers, in their time, were widely feared, criticized, debated and disputed. But the idealism of a new country won enough support that colonists revolted against the mother country. Far from the revered ideologies that laid the groundwork for America's constitutional form of government, &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; are a must-read for anyone seriously interested in how we as an American people began and why we're where we are now."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"As mystery writer, I have found that reading a variety of materials is essential to my work.

Be a true patriot, read this book."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"The American Republic. What an unequalled and brilliant diamond in a world covered in coal. It is so sad after reading this book (The Federalist Papers) that I finally find the reality I have been seeking. The pieces have fallen into place after a lifetime of reading other works and wondering why I and others were so frustrated at the course America was taking. The fourty year rain of the Liberal left in Congress seemed a departure from the American Dream but it would not solidify in a true understanding of the problem. That is no longer the case. I now see that many of our leaders are shredding this magnificent creation into fodder for their own ambitions, corruption, political, personal and deviant pleasures. We have betrayed Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison and Jay by letting party loyalty blind us to the truth. Unfortuantely the battle has become one of good and evil, right and wrong and bipartisanship is nothing more than a covert effort to gain compromise in only one direction, to the extreme, fanatical left. The left has so corrupted the original intent of our Constitution that it is by their pathetic interpretation nearly unrecognizable today. After reading numerous books, I.E. the Bible, the Book of Virtues, Slouching Towards Gomorrah, Out of Order, We Hold These Truths and numerous others. In addition to being a life long student of the Magna Carta, Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation and the Constitution itself. I found it unavoidable in todays atmosphere to go any further with the vast number of books addressing the current crises facing our country and this president without first reading the Federalist Papers. A task I had to date, failed to do. But I knew that if High Crimes and Misdemeanors or the Death or Outrage were to mean anything to me, I needed this valuable knowledge of our founders intent. I now see that it is the only real definitive authority on what was intended by the Founders. This book is a must for any American from either side of the isle who really and truely looks for the truth and who desires to honestly make an informed and patriotic decision about the terrible disgrace brought upon our nation by the crew on the bridge of this ship of state called America. We need a new crew and we need one immediately. America is adrift on a sea of deviance, corruption, lies and betayal. &quot;We the People&quot; have been gut shot by an administration that cares for nothing but power. The Federalist Papers to the true student of our history will allow no other conclusion and if one hopes to think him or herself worthy of standing in the shadow of those great minds of our nations birth they must accept the truth.

Some of Alexander Hamilton's points were addressed over several pages so I needed to keep in mind the first sentence to understand the subject he was discussing three pages later. It requires full attention and concentration. It is a good book to exercise your reading skills!It should be required reading before graduating from high school because it is the duty of all citizens to understand the Constitition. Our leaders are sworn into office to uphold the Constitution. It is the document that protects the freedom of the people, but because of general ignorance our government is out of control, not living within the limited Constitutional authority, and the people are becoming slaves to a national debt, mountains of unConstitutional legistlation, and entitlement programs. Read this book and you will know more than most lawyers.I also recommend the 25 part DVD series \\"Constitutional Literacy\\" by Michael Farris. It lays out clearly where the Federal Government has overstepped its Constitutional bounds. It identifies what we need to work on.Joseph Story's 1859 \\"A Familiar Exposition of The Constitution of the United State\\" is another must read book on the original intent of the Constitution. For years a public school text book, why has it been removed? It was removed by people who hate the Constitution and freedom of the American people!Another book I highly recommend is Edwin Meese III, \\"The Heritage Guide to the Constitution.\\" Reading about the Constitution and you get a lot of interesting history. Our Forefathers used lessons from history to create the longest lasting most successful Constitution in the history of the world. Why has our generation quit using lessons from history? We are repeating the mistakes of the past because modern history books revise history to manipulate the people. The Federalist Papers and Joseph Story's Commentary were written before evil history revisionists had their way."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"Very well written story.

This is an important point, I feel, because histories written by others, no matter how how neutral the author is, invariably are an interpretation. This, on the other hand, is direct from the source and opens up a window into a time when things could very well have gone in a different direction for the new country.

The Federalist Papers are a series of contemporaneous essays rebutting critics of the proposed Constitution. A better historical collection would start with complaints about the Articles of Confederation, defenses against those complaints, arguments in favor of the new Constitution, arguments against, rebuttals to arguments in favor, rebuttals to arguments against. The Federalist Papers are all in the \\"arguments in favor\\" and \\"rebuttals to arguments against\\" categories, leaving the other side unrepresented, and many of the \\"we need a constitution in the first place\\" arguments represented only by inference.The authors devoted considerable attention to the checks and balances of the new Constitution: who elects whom, who impeaches whom, who overrules whom. This part of the work reads well. They did overlook one giant problem: the original procedure for electing vice presidents turned out to be completely unworkable. The procedure for amending the Constitution to fix that problem, however, worked well.Another unforeseen problem: the Constitution makes it difficult for the Legislature and Executive to remove Justices, but there's no protection against diluting the power of the courts by appointing lots more justices, as Roosevelt attempted when he disagreed with certain rulings of the Supreme Court.It's also interesting (and a bit beyond my power as a layman) to apply the analyses of Publius to other federations, such as the 20th century USSR and the partial federation of the European Union.I read this book on my Kindle and found it much convenient.

The federalists recognized that the union of the states under the Articles of Confederation could not hold. Additionally, they recognized the opportunity they had to create a large power.Read all about the Separation of Powers and the Checks and Balances devised by our founders (with props to the Frenchman, Montesquieu of course).

The constitution of the United States of America is, despite the youth of the country, the oldest one in operation today. It is the oldest because it is the best. The federalist papers are a unique discussion on the principles of sound governement, the constitution as the most interesting experiment in human history as Alexander Hamilton puts it. \\"It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force.\\"(Paper No 1, Hamilton) Through its constitution and a handfull of patriots America has rose, against all odds, to become the most powerfull nation of the world.

I did think it might be useful, though, for the curious to know that The Federalist Papers are not all dull political analysis devoid of rhetorical flash and filigree. My favorite example to the contrary comes from The Federalist No. 11, by Hamilton:&quot;The world may politically, as well as geographically, be divided into four parts, each having a distinct set of interests. Unhappily for the other three, Europe by her arms and by her negociations, by force and by fraud, has, in different degrees, extended her dominion over them all. Africa, Asia, and America have successively felt her domination. The superiority, she has long maintained, has tempted her to plume herself as the Mistress of the World, and to consider the rest of mankind as created for her benefit. Men admired as profound philosophers have, in direct terms, attributed to her inhabitants a physical superiority; and have gravely asserted that all animals, and with them the human species, degenerate in America -- that even dogs cease to bark after having breathed a while in our atmosphere. Facts have too long supported these arrogant pretensions of the European. It belongs to us to vindicate the honor of the human race, and to teach that assuming brother moderation. Union will enable us to do it. Disunion will add another victim to his triumphs. Let America disdain to be the instruments of European greatness! Let the thirteen States, bound together in a strict and indissoluble union, concur in erecting one great American system, superior to the controul of all trans-atlantic force or influence, and able to dictate the terms of the connection between the old and new world!&quot;How about that for rhetoric?! for prophecy?!It also might be useful to note that The Federalist Papers are not, as some might assume, a text describing the founder's intentions. Neither Madison, nor Jay, nor Hamilton -- especially Hamilton -- were perfectly content with the Constitution drafted in Philadelphia in 1789. These papers were their justification for the compromise. It is fascinating reading nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"When we lost Gore Vidal a short time ago I remembered he said there were two books all Americans should read. I had read both in the distant past but decided it was time to read them again. The Federalist Papers were one.

Just a heads up for anyone else that is looking for this particular bit of insightful editing."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"Not too many years after the United States won their independence from Great Britain it was generally acknowledged that the Articles of Confederation were inadequate. In 1787 in Philadelphia a convention that included several of the Founding Fathers convened and later that year proposed a new constitution for the young nation.Months later, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay wrote the Federalist Papers--they hoped to influence public opinion toward ratification of the Constitution. In these 85 essays, they listed some of the problems that the new nation was facing due to the lack of an adequate central government. The authors set forth the military and economic advantages that they thought ratification of the Constitution would bring about and also asserted that the document would promote domestic tranquility through a stronger union.Perhaps the most famous of the essays today is Federalist 10, in which Madison explained that a populous republic with many factions would protect against tyranny--coalitions and people within the coalitions would shift and change over time, so that no one faction or interest group would be able to dominate permanently. Madison's prophecy proved correct--one can look back across the decades and centuries of American history and see how certain groups and interests left political parties or joined others, creating new temporary majorities and changing the course of government and history.The Founders and other delegates to the convention were well aware of the dangers of too much centralization, but they thought that they had fathomed a proper balance between state and federal authority with the doctrine of separation of powers. The federal government itself was also set up with checks and balances between the president, Congress, and the judiciary, and the authors make their case as to why these institutions were designed as they were. These essays also describe the further check of regular elections for representatives and senators and explain how they work.One gains when reading these essays a sense of how well the Framers of the Constitution understood human nature. They even anticipated the demoralizing effects of \\"voluminous...incoherent\\" legislative bills and recognized the deleterious effects that uncertainty would have on business and commerce.As well as the 85 essays, this Oxford World's Classics edition of the Federalist Papers contains a solid introduction and explanatory notes, and as an appendix contains the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Any citizen who reads this book will gain a richer understanding of the Constitution as well as a fresh appreciation of the genius of the Founding Fathers."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"A very good help in understanding the U.S. constitution.

They interviewed some Venezuelans who did not know to read, but had learned to read by reading their constitution.I was touched by this, but then I thought \\"how many Americans can say they've read the Constitution?\\" My guess is probably not many. And those that have only did it for school and have since forgotten much of what they learned. Personally, I remember having to memorize the Bill of Rights for a class, but that's about it.So I bought a copy of the Constitution for myself and began reading it.

With that being said, the Federalist Papers are not an easy read. The reader has to understand the context and meaning of certain words used during this period, and also be familiar with ancient history in order to understand the ideas that Hamilton,Madison, and Jay are expressing. However the editors did a great job by providing a section of notes that help the reader immensely. To give an example of how difficult this can be to read at times...Madison( And happily for the republican cause, the practicable sphere may be carried to a very great extent by a judicious modification and mixture of the federal principle.) Although I agree with the dumbing down of our society, nevertheless that is hard to interpret.Throughout the whole essay, the writers use their knowledge of history and intelligence to lay down laws by which men can rule themselves in a republican government. To say it concisely, they tried to create a system of checks and balances in order to curb the evil side of human nature. They understood their system was not perfect and absolutely required virtue in the heart of the people in order for this experiment to succeed. The principles that were laid down in this book are brilliant. While Americans can blame politicians for the situation we are in, ultimately we receive the government we deserve. The fundamental question that needs to be asked is...Are we a virtuous people anymore?God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.(Ecclesiastes 7:29 KJV)"},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"I am appalled that a publishing company would put such a ridiculous disclaimer on a publication of the founding documents of the United States of America.

These 85 essays, published anonymously in New York newspapers during the debate over whether New York would ratify the Constitution, are the best \\"footnotes\\" for the Framers' intent when devising the Constitution, the powers of the three branches of government, and the overall shape of the federal government. It is simply impossible to understand the Constitution without taking the time to read the Federalist Papers. And this edition has the very useful feature of cross-references in the Constitution back to the relevant essays of the Federalist Papers.Some of the essays now seem irrelvant (i.e., the ones dealing with minting of coins). But others are just as powerful now as they were when first written - the role of the judiciary; the conduct of foreign affairs; the division of governing authority between the President and the Congress; the destructive power that special interest groups could have on the legislative process.The Federalist Papers are often-cited by those who argue that it is the only source of interpretation of the Framers' intent. This may be true. But even the Framers themselves later argued vehemently over what their intent was. While Hamilton supported a strong centralized federal government, Madison eventually supported a weak federal government with strong states acting almost as independent sovereigns. That same political division - between states' rights supporters and strong federalists - continues today among Democrats and Republicans. Both sides cite to the Federalist Papers as supporting their respective positions. Yet neither side can conclusively resolve what the Framers' intent truly was since the Framers themselves seemed to have changed their original intentions as the political winds changed in the years following ratification of the Constitution.This book is an essential reference guide for anyone with an interest in the American system of government. It is a valuable tool to probe the truth behind politicians' talk of \\"activist judges\\" versus \\"strict constructionist judges\\". For those who want to be educated on the topic, rely on the Federalist Papers thmselves rather than on others telling you what the Federalist Papers really mean."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"You don't need to be told that the Federalist Papers are not for everyone, but for a niche audience of which I happen to be a member. And so, the qualifications: you need to have a pretty fluent command of the English language, and not just modern usage but also more archaic structure and vocabulary; you have to have a good grasp of history, at least a rough outline of it solidly in mind; you have to have a love for politics, political science and the Constitution.If all of that is true of you, you'll probably enjoy reading this. At least, to a point. The Federalist Papers, written mainly by \\"Father of the Constitution\\" James Madison and \\"Shot by Aaron Burr/Closet-Monarchist\\" Alexander Hamilton, is a very lengthy defense of the then-proposed Constitution, point by point. And what I mean is, they will take items over which there could be seemingly no substantial debate and then write a series of three or four essays on that point. And so, it is possible that even the die-hard history/political science buff will be bored by the thirtieth page of the debate over whether standing armies should be allowed to be kept during peace time.The most laugh-out-loud moment (and yeah, there are a few) is when the \\"Interstate Commerce clause\\" is dismissed in a slip of a paragraph, which is, of course, one of the most important and controversial passages to the modern reading of the Constitution, forming the basis for a good deal of our current legislation. Whatever one feels about our current \\"construction\\" of the Constitution, I think a fair reading of the literature will show that it is not the same construction as that of its authors.Not laugh-out-loud at all, however, is the roaring silence on the subject of slavery. It does come up, from time to time, but the lack of debate on these matters (there are, maybe, 2-3 pages on the 3/5 compromise and a paragraph on the ending of the slave trade) proclaims the volatility of the subject matter, even 100 years before the Civil War. Madison wasn't looking to offend his audience, after all.Of course, all of these debates are mostly moot (with a couple of exceptions) and so the Federalist Papers are largely a historical artifact... but there is something very telling about them. That is, how incredibly learned, intelligent and eloquent our Founding Fathers really were. They debate calling on historical antiquity, philosophies ancient and modern, then-current foreign political systems, the Constitutions of the several states and the Articles of Confederation. These people knew what they were doing and it all mattered to them, very much. It's kind of sobering to see with what care and deliberation they forged this Constitution, and then to compare it with the \\"guardians of the flame\\" today who can't even seem to agree on the meaning of terms like \\"liberty,\\" \\"democracy,\\" or, in the case of one former President, \\"is.\\" When reading, you'll wish we had Madisons and Hamiltons today, or even politicians who bothered to read them... or, maybe we do, but the general level of care and education of our country today does not allow men such as those to rise. The Federalist Papers is an interesting insight into the incredibly well-thought-out origins of our country."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"&quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;, consisting of 85 essays written by three of our founding fathers, is the quintessential explanation of why are government is the way it is, and how it was originally intended to be.This is the stuff you learned in your high-school civics class - directly from the minds that envisioned the least imperfect government ever created. While some of the parts are now irrelevant, and some so ingrained into our culture as to no longer be questioned, many remain contentious to this very day. If you have any doubt about the meaning of the interstate commerce clause or the general welfare clause (the two of which form the justification for most modern federal powers), Madison leaves no doubt as to what they really meant at the time.As an added bonus, this edition contains the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and helpful notes and introductions that further elucidate the thoughts of the authors.

If you are relying on the public schools and the media to give you that education, you are going to have a very great misunderstanding of what the Constitution was meant to mean and an even greater misunderstanding of how far the government of the United States today has veered from the vision of the wise men who met in Philadelphia in 1787.These are a collection of papers that were published in New York in 1788 for the purpose of convincing the people, and through them, their representatives, to ratify the Constitution (which New York did a year later.) The papers themselves are fairly well organized discussing the basic utility of Union before a discussion of each of the three main departments of government (legislative, executive, and judicial.)This edition has dozens of notations regarding people, places, and historical events and assemblies that the educated populace of the 1780s would be aware of, but the average person in 2006 may not be so familiar with.One thing that I did as I was reading the book was that I was trying to consider what the three men who wrote these papers would think about these notions if they around today. It is also clear upon reflecting while reading about subsequent history, that they were wrong on a number of issues, especially considering the relative strength of the judiciary, which has in reality become arguarably the strongest of the three branches of government, not the least as argued by Hamilton.This book should be a required text in every United States government class (senior year in high school or 101 class in college) rather than the one or two excerpts that are common fair in those watered-down classes.

What emerges is an obviously biased but logical argument for a strong central government, a national army (rather than provincial, state-run militiae), and an economy based on commerce, manufactures, and banking. Each essay is a self-contained entity, but the common themes make the collection a seamless (most of the time) and unified whole.Ironically, Madison and Hamilton would become enemies. And over time the anti-Federalists and Democratic-Republicans would endure but the influences of Jay, Hamilton, and Madison had left their marks on the new nation. Any American with an interest in how their country went from independence on paper to independence and success in practice must read THE FEDERALIST PAPERS."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"These papers plus the Declaration of Independence constitute the core political philosophy upon which America and its political institutions were founded. Heavily influenced by the ideas of Locke and Montesquieu, the three writers of the &quot;Federalist Papers&quot; developed potent political rhetoric designed to persuade as many politically-involved people as possible that a new constitution was needed. These men knew much of history and political philosophy, and they were not blindly led by either to embrace some narrow dogma. They had an open mind, and their sagacity told them that in order to endure the new country has to remain open to fresh ideas and experiments. Their scholastic knowledge, in short, did not lead them to abandon their practical wisdom.These papers combine polemics and analysis, history and conjecture, hope and caution. Every American should read &quot;The Federalist Papers,&quot; for they are the ideological &quot;stuff&quot; of this country. Read them, appreciate them, and think for yourself. &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; are a heritage and a challenge. They endure and intrigue. They are a part of the foundation under the magnificent construction that is the United States of America."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"The Federalist papers were written as a part of the campaign to get the Constitution ratified in the American states. In New York, the final decision was in doubt, and Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay wrote a series of essays, published in the media of the time, to convince New York to ratify the Constitution. Jay became ill, and did not participate in this project as much as Hamilton (a New Yorker) or Madison (a Virginian). In the process, their propaganda also illuminated important themes emanating from the document being debated. As a result the Federalist papers are a rich source of understanding the logic and premises of the Constitution (but keep in mind the political purpose behind these documents).This is a fine version, with Rossiter being one of the deans of these documents. But it is the essays themselves that are most important. Let's take a look at a few issues emerging from these documents, to see what is at stake. . . .One juxtaposition is between Federalist # 9 and # 10. # 9 was written by Hamilton, and addresses how to deal with factions and discontent: He wanted a stronger central government that could suppress such threats to stability. # 10, on the other hand, is a much more subtle effort by Madison to address the same issue (no wonder the two of them became political enemies shortly thereafter). He felt that a republic over a large area would keep factions from becoming too dominant. He was more trusting of processes than was Hamilton. If you want to understand the brilliance of Madison, read Federalist # 10; it is a seminal document.# 47 and # 48 provide the rationale for two hallmarks of the American system: separation of powers (by which Congress, the courts, and the President have different sources of power) and checks and balances (the ability of each of the three branches to \\"check\\" the other, e.g., Presidential veto over Congressional laws or Congress being able to override said veto). #51 is even more explicit, with a near poetic turn by Madison. \\"Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. . . .If men were angels, no government would be necessary. . . .\\" In short, political figures may try to use the political system for their own advantage. By creating a government where such ambitions can be thwarted by others, you prevent evil effects of such ambition. Thus, checks and balances and separation of powers can deter misuse of power.And there is so much more in this volume. Hamilton, in #69 and # 70 indicates why a vigorous executive (President) is a plus for the proposed government. Just so, Hamilton in # 78 speaks of the role of the Supreme Court and the whole court system.The Federalist Papers are key documents regarding the Constitution. One must recognize their political purposes; one must understand that there are internal inconsistencies (compare, again, # 9 and # 10); one must take into account the extreme time pressures on the authors as New York's ratifying convention's meeting loomed. Nonetheless, this is an important document and provides genuine insights into the minds of the Founders."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"This free Kindle edition of The Federalist (with Jay's name listed first in the Amazon listing) has one advantage over the other edition available free at this time (for which Amazon lists Madison as first author).

However, I would strongly recommend purchasing the Mentor edition, as that edition contains the text of the Constitution, as does this edition, but the Mentor edition has cross-references to specific portions of the Federalist Papers which address that clause of the Constitution.In general the Federalist Papers is a must read, no matter what edition you use, for anyone interested in the founding of the US, or desiring to learn how our system of federalism, and separation of powers was intended to work.

Publius' intent was to defend the proposed Constitution by explaining its overall integrity and the republican government it would establish. Ironically, one of Publius' intents was to defend the Constitution against the argument it was too weak to withstand those who would subvert republicanism in favor of some form of aristocratic domination.Sadly, not many read this work, despite the fact that it is one of the few documents that define what the founders' intent really was. This omission has not stopped many from espousing their (lack of) knowledge of that intent. The casual reader can be put off by the size of the work, 85 articles, and the seriousness of the articles. This work was intended for serous people. However, one can approach it with a pen and yellow highlighter and LEARN its wisdom or the more casual reader can let the Introduction guide them to the pieces that interest them.These casual readers will learn The Federalist Papers are divided into two divisions, each with different themes. The first division addresses the issue of a \\"firm\\" and \\"well-constructed\\" Union as opposed to a lose confederation of states. This division then addresses how the constitution is protected from the founders' anticipated accidental and intentional threats and answers: what the respective purposes of the Union and the Constitution are; what should be done with society's will; the problem of politics; and even the issues of taxes and maintaining an army. All of these together described the function of government as defined by the Constitution.In the second division, The Federalist Papers move from the basic function of government to the structure of the American government and using that structure to secure society's common good, the people's happiness, and the public good. All this is accomplished using a moderate tone that makes the reader part of the discourse and not the object of a lecture. This is a constitution aimed at the public in many ways.So at heart, The Federalist Papers is a guide to the Constitution intended for the casual reader, a reader who can pick and chose those elements that are meaningful."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"The essential commentary on our system of government. The U.S. Constitution is a brilliantly constructed document. But for those who are unable to fully understand its simplicity, read \\"The Federalist Papers.\\" It makes clear the basis for our system of government (Natural Law). It also explains why the Constitution is a document from the people telling the government what rights it has to govern rather than a government document telling the people what rights are available to them.Government gridlock is not a bad thing according to \\"The Federalist Papers.\\" The Constitution is written in such a way that the government can't easily pass laws. Remember, for every law passed, we loose some of our natural rights.\\"The Federalist Papers\\" was written to encourage the people of the time to support a new constitution (as opposed to keeping the Articles of Confederation). However, there is not a more modern explanation of why our current system is very flawed but the most viable option of self-rule anybody has ever devised."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"You may ask yourself, &quot;What's the difference between one version of the Federalist papers and another?&quot; So did I. I found myself looking back to the Federalist papers so much during my first year of law school that I wanted a small, paperback edition. This was a great choice. The best feature is that the Papers are cross-referenced to the relvant articles of the Constitution. It also includes copies of the Constitution, the Articles of Confederation, and the Declaration of Independence. It makes it much easier to be aware of the context the Papers were written in as well as the result of the debates.The only thing missing was a copy of the Anti-Federalist papers -- but I haven't found a single volume that includes both yet."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"I tried the free version yet it did not have the linking abilities, etc. This is only a buck and without a complete understanding of the arguments for and against our Constitution you cannot successfully know federalism. The bottom line - this is a must read. Use it in conjunction with Noah Webster's 1828 Dictionary for words you may not know or words you think you know today yet have changed, like Discrimination. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"\\"The Federalist\\" is a compilation of articles that appeared in the New York newspapers in 1787 and 1788, written in support of the document that had been approved by the Constitutional Convention that had met in Philadelphia during the summer of 1787. The authors, writing anonymously under the pseudonym \\"Publius\\" (after Publius Valerius Publicola, the quasi-legendary First Consul of the Roman Republic), were Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, all well-known political figures in the American Revolutionary period. The Constitution had actually been ratified by the time the articles began to appear, but they served to explain to the public the nature of their new government. They have served that function very well ever since. They are now considered to be a definitive statement of the practical issues involved in establishing popular consensual representative government.Ironically, Hamilton was not nearly as enthusiastic about the new Constitution in private as he was in the pages of \\"The Federalist\\". For example, he believed the President should be elected for life, and for that reason throughout his life he was called a \\"monarchist\\" by his political enemies.Another irony is that Hamilton persuaded the American people to accept a Constitution that was and continues to be much more conservative in outlook than are the majority of the American people. He succeeded at this because Americans, like Hamilton, sensed that a conservative governmental structure, with a strong executive, was essential to our security as a fledgling nation-state in a world dominated by hostile and predatory military monarchies. The desperately vulnerable state of the early American Republic comes through vividly in Hamilton's writing, informed no doubt by his heroic Revolutionary War service as George Washington's personal aide. The attachment of Americans to our Constitution as a source of our strength and security continues unabated today.\\"Publius\\" was writing for the average citizen of his day, who either could read himself or was read to - newspapers were usually passed from hand to hand for weeks after publication in those days. But he doesn't write down to his audience. He justifiably assumes that having been through a prolonged and bloody war for their independence the average American citizen was extremely interested in preserving that hard-won liberty, and in the structure of the government that would help them do it.However, the language is of the late 18th century, and takes some getting used to. These papers should be read one at a time, over a period of months or years. The topics covered are as timely as today's headlines: The limits of presidential power, the independence of the judiciary, the role of government in society.My favorite quotation from \\"The Federalist\\" is not by Hamilton, but by Madison, although I'm sure Hamilton agreed wholeheartedly with the sentiment: (from The Federalist No. 51) \\"But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary.\\"\\"The Federalist\\" is one of three basic texts of American government. The other two are Alexis de Tocqueville's \\"Democracy in America\\" and Lord Bryce's \\"The American Commonwealth\\".These three books together will provide an educated person with a solid understanding of the nature of the American system of government."},{"Title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"This book is adequate. It contains the full Federalist Papers and a copy of the Constitution in the back, plus synopses of the content of each of the Papers.

I learned of his work as he was the first in the medical community to establish the Alzheimer Prevention Foundation International, here in Tucson.By candidly voicing my own opinion, I may address the same apprehensions as someone who is reading this review. You see, initially, I thought that Dr. Dharma's work would center totally around eastern religion because his photos feature him in a turban. I was VERY skeptical. While I like to think that I have an open mind, I just have never been into practices that weren't fairly \\"mainstream.\\" I then read his medical creditials and was convinced that this was a man with intelligence and vision - who knew something that it was important that I learn.Dr. Dharma is so respected in the medical community that he was asked to speak before Congress regarding an integrated medical approach in the prevention of Alzheimer's. This threatens to reach epidemic proportions in the next 20 years.If you are concerned about an aging parent's memory; if you know someone with Alzheimer's and think that absolutely nothing can be done about it; if you are experiencing your own bouts of occasional memory loss - I URGE you to order this kit!Alzheimer's begins approximately 30 years before the first symptoms appear. If someone in your family has Alzheimer's, this also increases your OWN chances of developing the disease.I was amazed at what I learned in this program. I learned about memory loss as we age and memory loss under extreme on-going stress. In stressful situations, cortisol prevents glucose from entering your brain cells and blocks neurotransmitter functions, which cause your brain cells to die.However, the medical evidence is absolutely conclusive in showing that the symptoms of Alzheimer's and other forms of memory loss can be alleviated and reversed by regenerating and increasing brain cell connections.The memory kit centers on 4 basic approaches to reversing memory loss. They are not gimmicks or memory tricks found in so many other books, but are medical advances that are leading the way in this field. The kit includes a book, a CD, and a series of large cards.I have recently read other publications by Dr. Dharma, which have been life transforming. This physician is the world's LEADING authority on the prevention of Alzheimer's and his advice is medically solid. I urge you to investigate this great new science and help yourself or someone you care about. The cost of the kit is so little, yet the information you gain will literally transform your life."},{"Title":"The Better Memory Kit","review":"This kit combines the best medical research by Dharma Singh Khalsa, M.D., and brings breakthrough techniques for anyone with memory loss, as well as for anyone that would like to enhance memory.I wish I had this kit when my Grandma was in her early stages of Alzheimer's, I am positive it would have helped her a great deal.Whether you are concerned about your memory, would like to enhance your memory, or help a loved one to do the same, you will not be disappointed in this wonderful kit.

It starred John Wayne and the beautiful Gail Russell who, sadly, died of a bad liver and malnutrition before she turned forty. I loved the film and still count it as a favorite. But I was curious to read the novel and finally scored a first edition copy from Amazon.Surprisingly, the film followed the novel quite closely--both are melodramas: a tragic love tale between two lovers that is not meant to be. But there are some interesting differences as well.The novel is far more graphic, with more violence; plenty of fisticuffs, and rape as well. There are also several other tertiary characters in the novel who play more prominent roles.Both feature clearly defined characters; but in the movie, John Wayne as Ralls is the central character, the hero. In the book, it's Sam Rosen who is the paladin, and he also doubles as the narrator.In the movie, Wayne is a more sympathetic hero; while in the book, Ralls is the heavy, nearly on a par with Mayrant Sidneye, the shipping mogul who goes head to head with Ralls.The film features a love triangle between Ralls, Sidneye and Angelique, played by Russell. In the book, this romance takes a back seat to that of Rosen and Teleia, who, in the film, plays a minor role.The middle part of the novel is largely exposition and focuses on Sidneye's youth and rise to power (it leaves Ralls' history unexplored.) This part of the story lags at times. Ralls' love for Angelique is, as in the movie, rather superficial, but it clearly is what drives him to lay Sidneye to ruin.Wake of the Red Witch is not an easy read, mostly due to the style of writing of that bygone era where narrative reigns and showing and not telling is the mode of the art.A good read even as it was at times tedious. For me, the movie was superior."},{"Title":"Wake of the Red Witch","review":"I purchased this book for my husband. He saw the movie w/John Wayne when it first came out.

As black women, we've endured sorrow and acheived greatness...all of which is found in this text. Black Women... gives an excellent account of the early history of African women in America."},{"Title":"Black Women in White America: A Documentary History","review":"While this is a heroic effort on the part of the member of one American subgroup (most probably a Jewish woman) to write the history of a member of another subgroup (most definitely Black Women), it nevertheless succumbs to the fallacy that the eminent Historian E. H. Carr warned us about in his seminal book called \\"What is History.\\"The reader may recall that there Carr reminded us that historical facts are like the illusive fish we catch in the lake. Once we struggle to get them in the boat, we then take them home, cook them and serve them up in our own favorite style (interpretation). Consciously or unconsciously the interpretations we serve up invariably always reflect our own positions in social space and time; and thus form part of the broader question of what positions we hold in society ourselves. And although this author takes great pain and care to build an almost impregnable defense against failing to be objective, etc., Carr's admonition holds nevertheless.However, one of the beauties of her attempt to build an impregnable rationale for having a Jewish Historian write the history of Black women, is that it causes the mind to focus on how so much of American history is written by non-members of the groups written about; that is by the ruling classes? It is certainly true as the author says that the emotional distance (of being an outsider) can sharpen ones focus and avoids the pitfalls of insider pandering, culling the facts only for the positive tidbits, etc. We certainly have seen enough of that in the way Black women report their own history. Yet, there is a deeper aspect of historical presentation that remains unaddressed here. It is the question of voice and perspective.As an avid reader of Jewish History generally, and the history of the Jewish struggle during the Holocaust of WW-II in particular, the question of perspective tweaked my \\"crap detection antenna\\" raising it to a \\"Defcon 5\\" status: It did so because it is obvious that there is no Black Woman's voice in this history, no Black Woman (or Black) perspective here at all. It is simply \\"traded away\\" for \\"feigned objectivity\\" and the elusive commodity called \\"historical accuracy.\\"How can a man (even a Black Man) say that this is the case? I can say this because, I know the voice of blackness and even though I may not know the exact voice of a Black woman, I will know it when I hear it. And I did not hear it here?This is not nearly as obscure a point as I am making it out to be because when I read holocaust material, I notice that the voice and perspective are immediately and invariably Jewish: The focus is rarely restricted just to the horrors of Jewish victimhood, but invariably moves rather quickly on to the psychology of the perpetrators, the Germans, their ideology and then on to the chief devil of the holocaust, Adolph Hitler himself. This is what history is about, problem-solving: Getting from the lamentations of victimhood to how to prevent the next holocaust. QED.However, if Adolph Hitler or his sympathizers were writing the Jewish History of the holocaust, how may times do you think he would mention himself as being the culprit? The point is that interpretations are one thing, but voice and perspective are something else altogether: they are everything. What is missing here (not to pick on the fine work of a heroic author) is a return address of the perpetrators.Black people, no less than other peoples want their history to help solve the problems that brought them so much misery. No less than Jews wanted to understand Hitler, we need to understand those who perpetrated the crimes against us; we need to know who and why they have wreaked havoc on Black women and the Black race for four plus centuries? In this narrative, as in most narratives of U.S. history, the perpetrators remain faceless, tucked away deeply in the always neutral and sanitized subtext.In discussion of race in America, we invariably and unconsciously shift the perspective, turning it on its axis by 180 degrees so that the spotlight is always only on the suffering of the (usually colored) victim; never on identifying the perpetrators or explaining his existential psychology? Yet, this is not at all so when we discuss the European Holocaust. Hitler is always subject number one.In that case, the whole of the discussion is why and how it happened and how to prevent it from occurring again. Here it is only about how heroic the black women victims were in their suffering? As a result, this book dramatically begs the questions: Who did it to them and why? Why do we not expose the evil that caused this suffering in the same way that Hitler is exposed when the holocaust is discussed? What is the address of the American perpetrators here? What is their psychology? What do they look like? How can we prevent them from doing the same thing in the future? Why do we continue to serve up interpretations about the Black condition that shows only their victimhood, but omit this most important of aspects: the psychology of the perpetrators?I believe that E. H. Carr got it just about right. Despite these comments, this is a great collection.

I thought it was one of those feminist non-sense books that no respecting Black woman would waste her time reading such propaganda. However, once I began to read, I am glad I did. I give this book a 4 star.Here is an excerpt that really touched me:\\"White women have greater opportunities to display their ability because of the standing of both races, and due to the fact that black men are less appreciative of their own men than white men. The former will more readily sing the praises of white women than their own, yet who is more deserving of admiration than the black woman, she who has borne the rigors of slavery, the deprivations of consequence on a pauperized race, and the indignities heaped upon a weak and defenseless people. Yet she has suffered all with fortitude, and stands every ready to help in the onward March to freedom and power.Be not discourage black women of the world, but push forward, regardless of the lack of appreciation shown you. A race must be saved, a country must be redeemed, and unless you strengthening the leader ship of vacillating Negro men, we will remain marking time until the yellow race gains leadership of the world, and we be forced to subserviency under them, or extermination.We are tired of hearing Negro men say \`There is a better day coming,' while they do nothing to usher in the day. We are becoming so impatient that we are getting in the front ranks, and serve notice on the world that we will brush aside the halting, cowardly Negro man, and with prayer on our lips and arms prepared for any fray, will press on and on until victory is ours.Africa must be for African, and Negroes everywhere must be independent, God being our guide. Mr. Black man, watch your step! Ethiopia queens will reign again, her Amazons protect her shores and people. Strengthen your shaken knees, and move forward, or we will displace you and lead on to victory and to glory.\\"Editorial, The Negro World, October 24, 1925Here is another excerpt:\\"It appears to me that America has become like the great city of Babylon...She is indeed a seller of slaves and the souls of men, she has man the Africans drunk with the wine of her fornication; she has put them completely beneath her feet, and she means to keep them there; her right hands support the reins of government, and her left hands the wheels of power, and she is determined not to let go of her grasp. But many power sons and daughters of Africa will shortly arise, who will put down vice and immortality among us, declare......that they will have their rights; and if refused, I am afraid they will spread horror and devastation around.

After reading a poem she wrote (from an anthology) regarding the demands placed on Aretha Franklin (as a star), I really connected with her message. Therefore, I ordered her book. Due to a great deal of \\"drama\\" currently occurring around me, I have not had an opportunity to read her writings. But in my heart, I know that she has put forth a lesson from which I can learn."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"I initially bought this because 1) I liked &quot;Championship Streetfighting&quot;, also by the author, and 2) I do a lot of submission grappling, and want to learn anything useful. I was dissapointed by much of what I read. The good:I learned a little about the history of wrestling that I didn't know; I found the principles in the begging to be most useful; the author does a decent job of converting amature moves to a street scenario; this is one of the few books I've read that talks about biting and gouging, though I think Beaumont's kind of reaching to include them in this book; and lastly, the bibliography helps the reader find more, practical information about grappling in the &quot;pavement arena&quot;. The bad: most noticably, there are rather crudely drawn pencil illustrations, and no photos; the takedowns, as presented, are not &quot;technically sound&quot;, and I think it's because of a lack of experiance on Beaumont's part; some of the holds are taken direclty from professional wrestling's &quot;show holds&quot;, like the Cammel Clutch and Figure-four leglock (I've wrestled a lot of guys, and I've even tried to make use of pro-wrestling holds, but I've never seen anyone put that leglock on someone with half a brain and better conditioning than a hampster). About half the info was useful to me, and I'll give props to the author for sticking to the theme of Western arts as self defence, but if you grapple for fun or sport, borrow it, and if you're looking for quick and easy self-defence, avoid it. In closing, I'd like to emphasise that this is NOT a useless book, it's just that finding the useful stuff is one of those needle-haystack things."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"What else can I say about this book that hasn't been said already? Sure you've witnessed a few UFCs or have seen a few street fights but what really works on the street, whats the best defence? This book sums up what you need in your arsonal, superior wreslting and grappling skills with the submision and finishing moves to go with em. Anyone who thinks that karate,boxing, or some other stricking art is enough to protect them needs to read this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know how to fight no holds barred. Great for amatures who know nothing of wrestling, great even for expirienced wrestlers who know the grappling skills down to a T but have limited knowledge on submision moves or finishing (killing) moves. This book has it all and as many others have mentioned before, it has a great conditioning section to help get you in the shape you need to apply your skills to their upmost potential."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"This book maybe a little simple. And some of the moves far fetched. But I really enjoyed it. And as the title says its a guide for streetfighters, not olympic hopefulls. Ned's writing style cuts right to the chase and leaves a smile on your face. He is very entertaining to read. And as an added bonus about 1/3 of the book is the best weightlifting, conditioning advice you can get anywhere. Take a little bit of Pavel a dash of Furey mix it with milk and supersquats and you have got a taste of the conditioning program."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"As bad as it sounds this book didn't have enough pictures. Well before I go on like me start by saying I'm a pro-wrestler with previous grappling experience...This book makes a fairly good read. But Still when I pick up a book on martial arts I expect to see pics of real people in it.. This book had only drawings. Ofcourse this isn't really a tech nique book, it's more like a book that explains Catch wrestling. If you do pick up this book also pick up &quot;winning Wrestling Moves&quot; and &quot;Gene LeBell's Encyclopedia of finishing holds&quot;. This book really explains some of the Techs that are hown in the other book..I still recommend this book, but pick up the other two in conjunction with it.. All are sold here."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"Gives some good explanation of the wrestling skills you'll need (and some you won't) in a fight against an unarmed opponent, but is light on useful instruction, primarily due to the lack of photographs. There is a lot to be said for an author who will actually fill a book with words, rather than lean on photos as a crutch, but if you intend to train with a book as an aid, photos are all but necessary - and the more the better.You'd be better off with a combination of Winning Wrestling Moves (to instruct on takedowns), combined with one or more of the following: Iverson's submissions book; The Fighter's Notebook; one of the Gracies' BJJ texts. All will give you more practical instruction, and do so with loads of pics to help you get the idea better. All are available at Amazon. You'll pay more to get the more complete education, but if genuine improvement in your grappling skills is the goal, it's worth it."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"Ned Beaumont is a great author, however, I thought you may all like to know that he is a Latin scholar and teaches high school latin at Nardin Academy in Buffalo, NY. I was his student and he is an excellent teacher...except that he is not a real boxer, so a lot of his writing may be made up.His real name is Matthew Riley."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"This book is very different then most grappling books today. Instead of showering grapplers with false promises about Wrestlings superiority over other &quot;Arts&quot;, he gives you a no nonsense look into the streetfighting world. His book gives very thoughtful insight into Wrestling on the street, using Wrestling against different types of fighters, and a lot of other streetfight related topics. HOWEVER, he also gives tips on conditioning, and most of all...survival. If you want to hear about Wrestlers in the UFC, go rent the UFC. If you want to hear about Wrestlers in a streetfight, buy this book."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"I just finished reading this book and I am very impressed. Call me stupid, but I would have given the book five stars if there would have been more illustrations. Overall though, this title is worth every penny if you're serious about protecting yourself on the street (and have little/limited wrestling knowledge...)"},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"I just can't place any limits on my enthusiasm for this book -- for the clear, crisp, and interesting writing, for the great commonsense advice on fighting, and especially for the wonderful final chapter on physical conditioning. There's nothing else like this in the self-defense field -- and it's difficult to see how anyone else could even approach Beaumont's lofty standard."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"This book discusses practical street combat from a wrestler's perspective. As expected, the author's focus is from the stand-up engagement that is taken down and finished on the ground. The subject matter is light reading without in-depth instruction. The book's pictures need improvement as the novice may find some figure's inadequate to completely convey the message of the instruction. Overall, the book is a good practical source for both the novice and stand-up only student. It does not add too much value for the mixed-art street oriented combat student."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"I've never been a three-time city champ in high school girls' wrestling. In fact, I never graduated high school at all. But I have been through many jails and prisons throughout the Eastern United States -- places where real fights, and fights to the death, happen on a daily basis. Ned Beaumont's advice on the rough-and-tumble of real combat is absolutely compelling and accurate: he knows whereof he speaks. And if his pronouncements strike you the wrong way, perhaps you're not cut out for real combat after all. You'd better go back to playing with the other girls."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"His new book does have some new things to teach you. The grappling and the Greco-Roman to freestyle moves are very effective. However, I do believe to be a better ground fighter, it's better to learn judo and jijitsu since that gives you quicker and more effective moves utilizing all your body and chi."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"Professional wrestling's popularity is at an all time high while amatuer wrestling gets little, if any, recognition. Beaumont's book (an excellent companion volume to his one on boxing) takes another angle and looks at wrestling as a practical martial art, especially when a real fight goes to the mat (or floor or ground). It is jam packed with history, information on famous wrestlers, practical advice on a variety of moves, and the section on physical conditioning alone is worth the price of the book. Other reviewers agree except for the guy from the Bronx who is still living in his high school days. This book ain't his coaches manual. Read it and enjoy."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"This book is a must read for one reason only and that is the fantastic advice that it contains regarding body-building. The rest of the book contains wrestling techniques that are too advanced for the average joe who just wants to know how to use the bit of high school wrestling he knows in a dust up. Also the book is not as entertaining as Beaumont's other books. Read Championship Streetfighting to see Beaumont at his best."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"The amazing thing about this book is that the author, unlike almost anyone else in the field, has a real prose style. He writes like a literate and sophisticated adult. If this is too much for you to handle, then perhaps you'd better stick to the comic books of the genre, in which faked photos fill up such space as the author can't. You'll be missing out, though. Beaumont not only writes well: he also knows what he's talking about."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"I found the book very helpful. While the presentation of techniques could be improved somewhat, the book is worth every penny."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"I enjoyed this book and in my experience the thoughts of the author are true. Good techniques for inexperienced wrestlers. Most fights go to the ground, so you need to be ready."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"No doubt about it: this is the best book on the subject--not only the best book available, but the best book that's ever been written. If other authors know more about wrestling and about the nitty-gritty of real hand-to-hand combat--a dubious proposition--none of them has had the skill to convey that knowledge in book form. Ned Beaumont's exceptional literacy and sense of organization, and especially his unique capacity for being informative and entertaining at the same time, make this the most profitable and readable book in the self-defense field. And the concluding chapter alone constitutes one of the best treatises on physical conditioning ever seen.If you really want to learn how to fight, forget about all those photo-crowded manuals of kung-fooey by \\"experts\\" who've never been in a fight and can hardly write a sentence. As fighter and as writer, Ned Beaumont pile drives them right into the canvas. Get a copy of \\"Kill as Catch Can\\" and wrestle the opposition right to the ground."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"This book picks up where Beaumont's boxing book left off: what do you do when you find yourself unable to punch? The advice and techniques in this book are once again practical, well-illustrated, and appropriately restrained. Wrestling comes in handy when you have to subdue your opponent rather than kill him or knock him out. The sections on training for hand strength were outstanding."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"This book explores the use of simple, effective grappling techniques. The illustrations are simple and clear. The advice on physical conditioning alone is worth the price of the book. Also, there are some excellent suggestions for further study. If you are a wrestling fan, martial artist, or self-defense afficionado, you will enjoy this no-nonsense book."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"I was a 3 time city champ wrestler in H.S. I know plenty about the sport. However, I don't recommend this book as a manual to learn how to wrestle in the street. The moves are far too advanced for someone to actually pull them off in a real fight. Especially against someone really determined to kick your ass and who won't follow the &quot;rules&quot;. The author repeats himself over and over, going back to topics in previous chapters etc. He just keeps praising himself as if he were a great fighter. &quot;Ohh, in my days as a streetfighter this and that&quot; Overall the book is somewhat disorganized and looks like if a 5th grader wrote it as a book report about wresling. I gave the book 2 stars because he gives pretty good advice about weight training. You will make better use of your hard earned cash taking a Ju-jiutsu book or course."},{"Title":"Kill-As-Catch-Can: Wrestling Skills for Streetfighting","review":"The &quot;reality&quot; combative followers might be disappointed in this book.Sure it's helpfull and has decent techniques but there is nothing in this book that can't be found elsewhere in REAL photos."},{"Title":"Proud Citadel","review":"THE BOOK IS IN BETTER CONDITION THAN EXPECTED..THE ONLY THING REALLY BAD ABOUT THESE BOOKS IS THE SMELL.

Set generations after the first novel _White Mare's Daughter_, _Daughter of Lir_ sets the stage with a deftly written prologue filled with signs, portents, and the undercurrent of theological politics. From the story leaps forward to begin to show the many differences -- and interesting similarities -- between the People of the steppes and the cities of the Mother. The main protagonist is a woman, but not far behind are several male characters, who together represent the two opposed cultures.This well-written book keeps a good pace, and Tarr's academic credentials make her depiction of the cultures seem vividly real; even the use of magic (even more clearly an actual working force than in the previous books) seems to fit the novel. Tarr is especially skilled in depicting, with but a few words, deep and complex relationships between individuals without making it seem like vapid romance. Last of all, her style is an impeccably clean prose, not simplistic but simply very clear and unaffected by a desire to seem 'literary'. All in all, the novel was a joy to read."},{"Title":"Daughter of Lir","review":"This is a beautiful book. The second in what seems to be a trilogy, begun with White Mare's Daughter and finished in Lady of Horses, this is set in an ancient eurasian steppe, and travels to the beautiful realm of the goddess worshipers. The setting is described beautifully, the characters are wonderful.. I only wish I could live in Lir.. *sigh* This book made me feel ever more proud to be female. *grin*"},{"Title":"Daughter of Lir","review":"Early Celtic mythology and Indo-European history set against a semi-historical Central Asian backdrop.To me, this was one of the best books Tarr's come out with lately. It's not underwritten, it's not boring (it all actually takes place in less than a decade, though only just), and although here and there the plot tries to go in too many directions at once, for the most part it works.Tarr's books are romance novels with action and magic. Relations between men and women, often of different cultures, are central to nearly everything she writes. Readers who don't like this element are advised to stay away from her work--I'm usually not too fond of the romancey subgenres myself. However, she does it well; there's plenty of spice and both the female and male characters have depth and personality, though there's a little too much \\"war of the genders\\" phrasing for me. In Daughter of Lir, both Rhian and Minas, the foremost of several pairs in the book, are well-drawn, appealing people.The historical recreation generally works well for me and the horse nomads are great -- I don't know if any actual historical or archaeological evidence supports Tarr's conception, but since it's such early history that doesn't seem indispensable here. I did find it a bit hard to believe that a strongly patriarchal tribe would have a \\"Year-King\\" ritual (which apparently is never performed except when the witchy antagonist needs to use it as a threat). Battle scenes are good, though here and there the plot structure gets confusing. The horses are wonderful--sometimes on the verge of being too anthropomorphic, but never sliding over. The fact that the matriarchal society is far from a utopia adds verisimilitude."},{"Title":"Daughter of Lir","review":"Well written novel about the progression from matriarchal to patriarchal society. This book addresses the value of horses to nomadic man."},{"Title":"Ringneck Doves: A Handbook of Care and Breeding","review":"This book has the most complete care, identification, and genetics information available anywhere for the Ringneck Dove (Streptopelia risoria).

Thomson apparently wrote about just those who interested him. He expresses himself beautifully. He has a real gift for finding just the right words to convey his ideas. As always with critics, one remembers the opinions that seem loopy because he differs with everyone else. The revered directors like Kubrick he hates. The veteran actors I like he dismisses. His weird essays on comedians in which he treats being funny as of secondary importance. But he is always entertaining, and I found his attacks on some of my favorite actors (George Raft, Anthony Quinn) hilarious. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Biographical Dictionary of Film","review":"The author seems to me the greatest writer on film (and just about anything else that interests him). What makes Thomson so good is the style in which he writes is so succinct that even if (like me) at first you disagree, given time you soon come round to his opinion. Why? Because you realise he is a master - hes tough, independant, superbly knowledgable and educates you on what is GOOD and what isnt, based on admirable opinions of art and expression. More than anything this book is a wonderful education."},{"Title":"Biographical Dictionary of Film","review":"Thomson's gifts seem to elude many... No, this is not the foundation for a film library; it's a wholly biased supplement...)Thomson is first and foremost the densest writer about film out there; his economy is unparalleled, and it often takes two or three readings just to figure out how much he's saying in a single sentence. Most people won't agree with Thomson often, but that's the point: He's provocative, contrary, and dogmatic, the latter characteristics redeemed by his incisiveness. The challenge is to read him openly, consider his analyses fully, and form an opinion only then.It's easy to fault Thomson for his selectivity, and the lapses between editions of his Biographical Dictionary of Film. But that's akin to criticizing your favorite author for not writing enough books. Thomson should be treasured for what he does offer; the world of film criticism would be a far poorer place without him."},{"Title":"Biographical Dictionary of Film","review":"RE: Previous review stating &quot;Thomson is also not bashful about leaving out important contributors to cinema to include seasonal celebrities that were mostly popular in the early nineties&quot;. This title was originally published in 1975, then reprinted in the U.S, as hardback in 1976 and paperback - 1979. One should hardly fault the author for not including personalities who would experience their fame 10-20 years into the future."},{"Title":"Biographical Dictionary of Film","review":"Not your typical film encyclopedia. Instead of general-information blurbs, Thomson offers a critical assesment of the actors, directors, producers and other filmic figures he references. The best entries attempt to come to terms with their subject's meaning, his or her importance to the development of cinema as an international and a local/national artform -- and this describes virtually every entry in the book. Be aware, Thomson has very definite opinions and no fear of sharing them, but don't let that turn you off. Even if you disagree with his appraisals, his criticism is founded on sound reasoning, and presented in dense, articulate prose. The book does have its faults, of course; Thomson offers only a cursory treatment of contemporary cinema -- he has substantive comments for Tom Cruise and Speilberg, but other contemporary figures receive little more than a filmography. Still, this book should be useful to anyone interested in film history and criticism, or arts criticism in general."},{"Title":"Biographical Dictionary of Film","review":"If you love good, pointed writing, writing that really goes to the heart of what we see on the big screen when we see certain film actors, this is your book. Really well-written, certainly opinionated (but justifiably, in all cases), thoughtful, insightful, amusing, witty. As you read each entry, you'll be saying to yourself, &quot;That's EXACTLY how I feel about SoAndSo!,&quot; because the author expresses each film person's essence so aptly. The author has apparently known and/or met many of the entries, so is able to add personal experience with these people to his vast historical knowledge of their work. A wonderful work."},{"Title":"Biographical Dictionary of Film","review":"Untouchable. If you are looking for the best guide to usher you through the vast moviehouse of the ages, Thomson is your man. Learned, caustic, and thoroughly entertaining, Thomson will cause you to re-evaluate old favorites and to discover many new ones. WARNING: You must live near a fabulous video store or you will not have the opportunity to develop your own conclusions about the movies discussed. The big video chains just don't cut it!"},{"Title":"Biographical Dictionary of Film","review":"This is neither Biographical nor a Dictionary nor about Film. I know little more about the people in it after reading than I did before - only Thomson's opinions about them. Moreover, it's not very comprehensive, like a dictionary should be. Where is Jack Conway? Where is Klaus Maria Brandauer? Where is Sean Penn? But there is a huge write-up of Johnny Carson. What does he have to do with Film? In Thomson I suspect a fluttering fan, who is using his access to publication as a platform for promoting those who have favored him with their acquaintance and damning those who haven't.Thomson reads like the film equivalent an opera queen, ready to defend camp heroes like Fassbinder and Joan Crawford, but rather scornful of the likes of John Ford and Fred Zinnemann. And what's worse, this British expatriate takes every opportunity he can to put down America and Americans. No wonder he lives in that most &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; of American cities, San Francisco.If you want a competent, balanced, comprehensive and, yes, opinionated biographical dictionary of film, get Ephraim Katz's Film Encyclopedia."},{"Title":"Biographical Dictionary of Film","review":"I was looking forward to something more opinionated than the useful and comprehensive but rather dry film bios of Katz's Film Encylopedia. Well, I got opinion in this Biographical Dictionary.Unfortunately, that opinion is from someone who apparently thinks one must be a curmudgeon in order to be a critic. It is obvious from this massive and hard-laboured work, that David Thomson is a pedant and a misanthrope. He really doesn't like much of anyone, especially those whose output is entertainment.Woe be unto the actor or director deemed here as (a) politically incorrect or (b) an audience pleaser. As George Lucas has said, Thomson doesn't know much about the movie business. But he does know about Ceen&eacute;ma Art.If you are the type who thinks himself a cinema Enthusiast, who lives at the Penultimate Picture Palace, swooning at spittle on the faces of Dreyers's close-ups, you will no doubt relish Thomson's tome."},{"Title":"Biographical Dictionary of Film","review":"This book was probably mistitled A Biographical Dictionary of Film only for marketing reasons. It is really a selected list of film personalities with essays that are often more critical than biographical. The only useful feature may be its large entry of corresponding films and dates. But nowdays, this is also downloadable from many internet databases. One of the book's most pretentious touches is the combination of Sharon Stone and Frances Farmer's bios into one to show a parallel between two actresses from different generations. Self important in its overall tone this book really reveals a limited and basic selection of actors and directors based on the author's likes and dislikes. Particularly when figures fall under heavy criticism (i.e. Fellini) the text becomes a turn off instead of being informative.Totally void of not-so-obvious figures, Thomson is also not bashful about leaving out important contributors to cinema to include seasonal celebrities that were mostly popular in the early nineties. This makes the book already terribly dated.Limited in information and obnoxiously opinionated, Tomson's book has quickly become useless after a few years of it's publication.

Doesn't anyone else see that Thomson's &quot;Dictionary&quot; is mean spirited and condescending? Ok, maybe a couple of others. I guess you could use this snob's eye view of the movie industry for a laugh at the brilliant putdowns with no substance to go with them. For example, Thomson dismisses George Brent because he considers him overweight but spends a lot of time fawning over Johnny Carson. (Johnny Carson?) Like his book about Nevada, Thomson's book about movie people seems to be an exercise in showing everyone how culturally superior David Thomson is. So, Nevada is a &quot;blank,&quot; and American filmmakers barely adequate, unless they're the artsy type? Well, behind the words, David Thomson is also a blank, barely worth notice. But he can still get published by the likes of Knopf. Shows how low Knopf has sunk."},{"Title":"Biographical Dictionary of Film","review":"This book was probably mistitled A Biographical Dictionary of Film for marketing reasons. It is really a selective list of film personalities with essays that are often more critical than biographical. In fact, there are hardly any biographies. One of the few useful features is that under each person there is a thorough list of corresponding films and dates of release. But nowdays, this information is also downloadable from many websites.Thomson is a good writer and a highly opinionated and respected film critic, but reading through these \\"biographies\\" one leaves feeling only that. His critical self-important tone overshadows everything else. And the reality is that he completely fails to deliver to readers what we all came to look for: a biographical dictionary of film.Thomson is not concerned with giving us researched, informative text on film figures. Like many critics he seems more interested in listening to his own well constructed reviews. Particularly when famous figures fall under heavy criticism (i.e. Fellini) the text becomes only a turn-off. One of the book's most self indulgent touches is the combination of Sharon Stone and Frances Farmer's bios into one, to show a parallel between two actresses from different generations.In additon, the list is predictably limited to actors and directors as if they're the only worthwhile contributors to cinema. There are no producers that I can remember, nor writers and cinematograpners. Hardly anything is said about animation, documentaries or the avant garde. But he leaves room for some seasonal celebrities that were mostly popular in the early nineties such as Christian Slater. This makes the book already dated.Thomson's book may be well written but like a film review from five years ago it is far less useful now.

Even at the end of the novel I did not feel that I truly knew the main character, Abby Banes. The story also did not flow as did Price's previous stories. It took too long for problems to be resolved and the love interest for Abby did not capture my heart as did Mark Browning in Savannah or David Fenwick in Maria.

I have not finished reading the book, but even before I read the book I can tell you that it is again written in Ms. Price's writing style that makes me feel as if I were living as part of the story or at least, would have loved to have lived it. Only when I read the review on Amazon, did I find out that Ms. Price is no longer living on this earth. I grieve for this very special person and author. Once again, I have no doubt that this book will be more special to me because I know it will be her final one.

This book is filled with the life stories and philosophies of extraordinary individuals whose lives were changed by contacts with caring and experienced Westerners who helped them realize their dreams for change and decency.Susan Shapiro got involved in change behind The Iron Curtain through her concern for the health and eating habits of a Hungarian boy who stayed in her home in Harrisburg, PA. Her concern led her to teach 500,000 teachers and millions of children behind the crumbling curtain not only how to live more healthily, but to change their own lives, their schools, and their communities through grass-roots actions.This book can be read as fascinating social history of the Soviet Empire or as a blueprint for bringing about basic changes in countries around the world in our time."},{"Title":"The Curtain Rises: Oral Histories of the Fall of Communism in Eastern Europe","review":"I thought that this book was very well-written and extremely interesting. As a dedicated historian with a great interest in the Eastern European region, this book offered a different and unique perspective.

I first read this at age 14 (with some vocab help from dear old dad) and it remains one of the best books I have read in a long while. Being a history major and an english minor I found the prose of this book delightful and the historical significance astounding. If you are an adult who has read and re-read Stevenson too much and want the same genre but a different author/plot Jim Davis is the novel for you. If you have a child whom you wish to turn onto fine literature Jim Davis will grab your child's imagination and illustrate a grand adventure of pirates, smugglers, soldiers and gypsies for it. Any child (old or young) can relate to the stories narrator, this is a jewel of English literature. Another great Stevenson alternate is J. Meade Falkner's Moonfleet, it is a bit of an easier read than Jim Davis, but contains just as much adventure."},{"Title":"Jim Davis,","review":"This story is set in early 19th century Devon, during the Napoleonic Wars. The narrator is a boy in his early teens, who by chance and high spirits falls in with a gang of smugglers bringing contraband by sea from France to England.

While the writing style is nice, and the idea of having one's children taken away is indeed emotional, I found that in this book all conflicts wrapped up nicely, neatly, and FAR too easily and quickly at the end. So quickly and easily, in fact, that there may as well have been no conflict at all, and what's worse, the author starts setting up the easy resolution pretty early on. I kept reading thinking there would be a twist at the end, but nope--if you read this book and after about the first third, you start to think--it can't really be that easy, can it?--well, yes, it can.If you're looking for a light read with unneccesary romantic side stories for the lesser characters, this is a great choice.

Though one reading hardly exhausts the resources of this power-packed little volume, the basic idea is simple: the belief content of authentic Christian committment should provide the Christian scholar with 'control beliefs', which narrow the range of acceptable theories in scholarship, whether scientific or theological. One negative example of the use of such control beliefs was when the Catholic church appealed to Scripture and tradition to ban Galileo's astronomical theory. But control beliefs are also found in the scientific community, as in the case of behaviorism, where a priori committments limited the phenomena of psychological investigation to external behaviors, with the well-known resulting flat failure. Since scholars of all stripes share a common structure of theory-weighing (involving data beliefs, data-background beliefs and control beleifs), this approach provides a common ground between theology and science, which has perhaps not yet been fully appreciated, except under the rubric of 'presuppositions', which is a bit different from Wolterstorff's idea of control beliefs.Wolterstorff also makes the bold suggestion that, not only should the belief-content of Christian committment provide control beliefs in the search for acceptable theories, but that individual theories should also serve to alter the belief-content of Christian committment. This approach, although riskier than the usual conformism found in science-and-religion literature, can also make for a more authentic, stimulating dialogue between science and religion. Ditto for Wolterstorff's assertion that the Bible cannot serve as an ultimate foundation for theorizing, which he supports with his overall critique of foundationalism in general.Last but certainly not least is the call for Christian scholars not only to use their control beliefs to weigh theories, but also come up with promising research programs within the context of particular theories. He is right that unless this happens, Christian scholarship will be nothing more than adding a theological gloss on essentially secular scholarship. Unfortunately, we have not seen much of this recently, with one notable exception being Nancey Murphy and Warren Brown's non-reductive physicalism project. That is indeed a research program in the best sense of the word (see \\"Whatever happened to the soul?\\", \\"Bodies and Souls, or Spirited Bodies?\\" and \\"Did my neurons make me do it?\\", forthcoming) and one of the finest examples of genuine, bona fide, Christian scholarship.This book deserves to be read and re-read. It is full of stimulating insights, challenges and skillfull argument. A must read for any aspiring Christian scholar."},{"Title":"REASON WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF RELIGION","review":"Wolterstorff does his characteristic solid job of thinking and writing enabling us to engage the philosophical underpinnings of the challenges of epistemology in our contentious era."},{"Title":"A World Full of Gods: The Strange Triumph of Christianity","review":"Some have criticized Hopkins' book for not being scholarly. If they mean by this that it does not bore the reader with yet another positivist history of early christianity, they are right. However, critics cannot fault the author for his research. The footnotes present factual evidence in the scholarly tradition to back up Hopkins' interpretation. This book is way overdue. It meticulously and creatively lays out the context of the christian origins. The lay reader will come away with an existential hermeneutic of history based on informed knowledge of the context of christian origins. This is the most important contribution of Hopkins' book. The author traces the role of episcopal christianity in establishing the 1)canon of scripture (necessitated by Marcion and then gnostic christians), 2)the chain of bishops(replacing reliance on Jewish scriptures for legitimacy), and 3) the rule of faith. This sequence was critical in creating the identity of that form of christianity that became a historical force to be reckoned with. The bishops forged a historical reality from the myth of Christ, thus institutionalizing the church under their control. The modern secular world has compartmentalized religion to time and place. The ancient world was not secular. Religious symbolism was literally &quot;in your face&quot; for the ancients. Hopkins does the interested modern a service by opening the door to the complex and syncretistic cultural world of the Roman Empire. In short this book provides a useful tool for appreciating, not merely gaining information, about the world, challenges, and contributions of christianity."},{"Title":"A World Full of Gods: The Strange Triumph of Christianity","review":"Keith Hopkins is an internationally respected classicist who decided that he would do something different for his book on pagan religiousity the rise of Christianity. He would go out of his way to make his book more accessible to a popular audience and at the same time adapt some postmodern elements. So in his first chapter he introduces two time travellers who visit pre-Vesuvius Pompei who make them some properly footnoted comments on the culture and lifestyle of the region. Later they go to Egypt, look at the temples, the man seeks a love spell directed at the woman who isn't talking to him, then he is unfairly arrested and barely escapes before being tortured. At other points Hopkins has a TV interview of an aged Jewish sectarian, and later has an imaginary conversation between a Christian and his pagan colleagues. At the same time there are (fictional?) letters from other scholars which criticize Hopkins' prejudices.The result is certainly interesting. We certainly get a sense of the public, vigorous and somewhat misogynist sexuality of the Romans. The account of the ascetiscism of the Dead Sea Scrolls Sect is certainly interesting. Hopkins' discussion of Christianity emphasizes the potential alternatives to the central doctrines that became Roman Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity. He then goes into considerable details about the world-views of Manicheanism and Gnosticism, with its own elaborate geneologies and cosmologies. Hopkins also emphasizes the strong tendencies towards acesticism within Christianity. \\"It is ideal that we should feel no desire,\\" says one Christian intellectual. Hopkins goes into considerable detail about the Acts of Thomas, with its miracles and its emphasis on newly converted Christian wives refusing their pagan husbands. The book also benefits from plates of thirty illustrations which are well chosen. One important fact that Hopkins properly reminds us is that the early Church did not emphasize the Gospels. (\\"It seems amazing now that the New Testament was not recognized as a single set of privileged Christian scriptures before the end of the second century.\\") Their major polemical tool was trying to find prophecies of Jesus in the Old Testament. (The most famous of these is the classic mistranslation of Isaiah, in which the Hebrew, \\"A young woman shall conceive,\\" was mangled into the Greek \\"A virgin shall conceive.\\") And so we get fascinating details about the topes of Christian martyrdom literture, about brother-sister marriages in Egypt, and pagan accusations of ritual murder against Christians.At the same time one might want something more. The book is well researched but the contrast with Robin Lane Fox's Pagans and Christians is striking. There Lane Fox patiently sifted through the whole range of somewhat scarce evidence to give a picture of surprising Pagan vitality on the eve of Constantine's conversion. By contrast Hopkins account is somewhat sketchier. Hopkins gives the most recent figures on the growth of Christianity, with perhaps 0.3% of the population of the Empire around 200 and maybe 10% by 300. But the reasons for this growth are not given in much detail. Hopkins suggests that Christianity offered a sense of community and structure (especially in charity) that allowed it to grow until Constantine's patronage ensured its triumph. It is not clear, however, from Hopkins' account, why only Christianity possessed these traits that allowed it to grow and why the Roman elite would look upon it as a new state religion. One wonders whether the emphasis on Gnosticism and Manicheanism really represent their importance at the time, though given the lack of evidence it is not surprising that Hopkins cannot tell us more. All in all, this is an interesting, somewhat eccentric book, which could use more sociology."},{"Title":"A World Full of Gods: The Strange Triumph of Christianity","review":"The author, an esteemed university professor of history, takes an unorthodox approach with this book on the Late Antique/Early Christian period. The book reads almost like a novel, in that Hopkins sets up actual scenarios of people traveling back in time to witness for themselves what Rome was really like (they visit Pompeii in 76 A.D. - in enough time to escape Vesuvius). Other travelers visit other areas of the Roman Empire later in the first century and on into the fourth (i.e., Syria and Egypt). While the premise smacks of the new Michael Crichton novel envolving time travel, Hopkins does thoroughly footnote, and his bibliography indicates extensive study of the major scholars in the field. While this new approach may be problematic to some, it is fresh and opens up new ideas for further study. For instance, Hopkins recreates a Roman bath house, with obvious attention payed to the aftifacts that have been discovered and written accounts of life in Rome that have survived to the present day. There are some problems: passing by houses in Pompeii that display mosaics of dogs that say, in Latin, beware of the dog, Hopkins proposes that the dog, in reality, would be chained there as well. There is literally no way to know this for sure. While problematic in certain details, Hopkins should be commended for producing a vivid account of the period, a time in history that is already receiving a reassessment from scholars in many areas of research."},{"Title":"A World Full of Gods: The Strange Triumph of Christianity","review":"Keith Hopkins has tried to achieve something different and unique as a historian in A World Full of Gods (The Strange Triumph of Christianity). Each chapter is written in a different style including one as a television play about an interview with a survivor of a Qumran sect living in Rome (his least successful chapter) and two chpaters told by time travelers to the ancient Roman Empire (moderately successful). Only one chapter is presented in the usual style of &quot;objective&quot; history and even that could be an argued point. He also includes throughout correspondence from colleagues in the field of ancient religious studies that are actually quite interestng and illuminating both for showing the complexity of religions in the Roman Empire as well as demonstrating the complexity of studying this ancient period in our own era. Many of the bits do not work especially well but, as a whole, the book is very effective in painting a portrait of an era and a land that was awash in religion of all sorts as well as for demonstrating that is was more amazing than inevitable that orthodox Christianity would triumph over its many rivals. This book is not a scholarly exercise but it should give the reader more of an interest in this fascinating period of history."},{"Title":"A World Full of Gods: The Strange Triumph of Christianity","review":"Multiple modes of presentation including time travelers, scripted show, description, letters critiquing sections of the book are sometimes interesting and entertaining. Clearly the author is well informed and feels free to present viable but unpopular views. Fundamentalists and literalists beware. Yet overall the book is a mixed bag and unsatisfying because the imbalance does not hold together to present a consistent perspective. Sometimes one may draw general conclusions at others instances may or may not be representative."},{"Title":"A World Full of Gods: The Strange Triumph of Christianity","review":"This book is a collection of essays with early Christianity as a (tenuous) link between them. I liked KH accounts of Mani, the originator of Manicheaism, his many examples of early tensions between the Christians and the Jews and, especially, his accounts of the &quot;feverish imagination of the Gnostics&quot;. The core belief of Gnostics is that inside every human there is a spark of divinity, put there from a supreme Divinity which is lodged in the high heavens of outer space. The divinity within each human can be awakened only through a process of contemplation and self-knowledge. It can also be accomplished with the assistance of a divine mediator, such as JC. Although a human instructor can sometimes help, more often than not interference by the &quot;human&quot; dogma can, according to the gnostics, be counterproductive. The gnostic approach to the &quot;teachings of JC&quot; is thus very different from the &quot;catholic&quot; doctrine, which has invested a lot of effort into suppressing individual quest for inner truth in order to establish a universal belief system (for some reason, the efforts by Augustine, Iraeneus, et al. to push a one to-be-accepted-by-all dogma reminded me of the birth of Communism). Hopkins' book is basically a deconstruction of that dogma. The basic idea is that contemporary Christianity is a theological mishmash selected to support the ideological and political interests of bishops during the early AD and today seems rather uncontroversial. The last chapter does a pretty good Job in textual analysis of the 4 canonical gospels and their contextualization into the writer's theological and ideological interests. Personally, I found the accounts of life in the Ptolemaic Egypt and imperial Pompeii a bit slow, although Hopkins does his best to titillate the reader with tidbits of info on Egyptian sex magic ritual practices, Roman sex life and asceticism, which is the religious eroticism of the true Christian (&quot;Laughter&quot;, wrote Clement of Alexandria disapprovingly, &quot;is the prelude to fornication&quot;). In short, this is not an integrated work of scholarship designed to press a theological or historic point. The idea is to entertain and to teach through the many delicious and well-selected morsels.

It left me with rather the same feeling I have after reading a well-researched historical novel -- just how much artistic license has the author taken. Without having a broad base of knowledge, one must trust that Mr. Hopkins knows his subject and has only taken license in presentation is he believes that his fictional creations do not materially alter the facts. Although I don't expect his method will soon change the way history is written, I did enjoy his genre-bending; his approach kept my interest to the end and I did pick up some interesting information about religious trends that competed with Christianity in its formative years."},{"Title":"A World Full of Gods: The Strange Triumph of Christianity","review":"I was disappointed with this book. The admittedly clever techniques of trying to explain early Christianity through the notes of time travelers, a television script, make believe letters between early Christians, and critiques of these techniques from &quot;colleagues&quot; simply didn't work for me.Don't get me wrong, there is obviously solid scholarship behind this unique presentation. The information presented is very interesting but the method of story telling gets in the way. The author is a academic and not a novelist. The contrived nature of the novel-like elements detracted from the history being presented.The book did add to my historical understanding of the development of Christianity, but I would not wish to read another work of scholarship written in a similarly &quot;innovative&quot; style"},{"Title":"A World Full of Gods: The Strange Triumph of Christianity","review":"I found this book to be very readable and to have achieved what the author seems to have been trying to accomplish.

I worry first because, there are some books like the Blood and the Holy Grail that are patently opinion and theory, and books by authors whose intention is to demean and or mock Christianity.If I had read the back cover more carefully, the phrase &quot;dazzling invention&quot; would have given me a clear signal that this book could have easily been on the fiction shelves. So my bad!I'm glad at least I didn't pay hardcover price for this book. I wish I hadn't paid the softcover price, but we pay for our education.Interesting fiction...not necessarily factual or historical. Hopkins states in the preface that he identifies his position as &quot;my athiesm.&quot; And therein perhaps is what bothers me about the book. What would be the ultimate purpose of an athiest in writing a book about early Christianity,especially when he includes a great deal of information about anti-Christian grafitti from the times and some graphics that have no connection to his theme, but appear to be there just for the purient thrill?"},{"Title":"A World Full of Gods: The Strange Triumph of Christianity","review":"Keith Hopkins' &quot;writing history&quot; is a worthy attempt to overcome the intimidating scholarly jargon that scares the majority of people and at the same time is an obstacle to the truth. Breaking new ground, it is a first step in the right direction. It attempts to uncover the brutality of believing in an historically unproven Christianity, with its gospel truth. Still Keith Hopkins is unable to give up the obsolete category of atheist Protestant. I thought that Atheism had been discredited by sophisticated scholars. Atheism doesn't exist because you cannot deny a construction of the mind: God. Every so -called believer is an atheist for another believer. A Catholic is an ateist for a Muslin and viceversa and so on with the others religions. One of the reasons that the United States is so great is because the founding fathers believed that God is a construction of man, the imagination is limitless. and nobody has the right to impose his imaginary construction on others, calling it the truth. In christian world the consequences of this imposition of one faith have been devastating and murderous. Anothor obsolete category that Keith Hopkins still clings to is the distiction between believers and nonbelivers. Many so- called believers hold on to farfetched stories and statements out of fear of giving up cherished childhood fantasies.

From the Oscar-nominated films The Twilight Samurai and Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai to anime marital arts sagas and the hit Emmy-winning Cartoon Network series, Samurai Jack, the robed, inscrutable, unstoppable warriors conquer our hearts with their martial arts and their dignity. The illustration of a black-robed Japanese gentlemen seated in a meditation pose with a katana by his side, one in his lap, sets the tone for Kendo and Kenjitsu practitioner Darrell Max Craig. Although Craig, like so many martial arts devotees, is a gai-jin (foreigner), he displays a reverence and knowledge of Japanese culture, samurai in particular, that is to be respected and admired. Craig goes into great detail about the katas, combat, clothing, equipment, and most of all, the swords of his art. He writes of the details with the same intricate deftness of a skilled samurai dueling with an adversary, and his strokes of the keyboard baffle and enlighten us as much as the strokes of the katana, or the other sword Craig introduces us to, the shinai.Those readers who, like this reviewer, have not read Craig's previous book, The Heart of Kendo, and are not familiar with Kendo and Kenjitsu, may find the details difficult to master. This is not a casual read, but if you truly desire to learn martial arts, or at least collect Japanese swords, a pastime to which Craig devotes the last two chapters (perhaps recognizing, wisely, that some of his audience for the book may be Japanophiles and collectors), The Way of Kendo and Kenjitsu is a worthy place to start."},{"Title":"The Way of Kendo and Kenjitsu: Soul of the Samurai","review":"This is a great book: enjoyable, entertaining, and enlightening. Craig's basic premise is that the way of kendo is something different to each and every student who picks up a Japanese sword. While traditional Kenjitsu had no rules per se, modern (sport) kendo does. He has fascinating insight into the differences and similarities between the two, asserting that to learn kendo properly practitioners must not think of it (or practice it) as a sport. If you don't already know, kendo uses bamboo shinai and padded armor for practice while kenjitsu uses live steel. To get the most out of these arts, Craig believes that you must think of them as a way of life, a perspective promulgated by most of the leading sword arts practitioners such as Dave Lowry as well.Craig's writings will advance your sword skills imparting knowledge of equipment, exercises, applications, and kata (including the last three kata of the All Japan Kendo Federation, which use the wakizashi short sword). More specifically, topics include kendo clothing, equipment and care thereof, fundamental movements, advanced waza, and kodachi katas. There is also great information about samurai sword collecting, care, maintenance, and terminology. The illustrations enhance the text and facilitate the reader's ability to understand and internalize Craig's excellent points. I think that the target audience is experience practitioners so it might be a bit beyond some beginners though. Regardless, this is a great book, a worthy addition to any martial arts library.Darrell Craig really knows his stuff. He holds a exceptionally impressive list of black belt ranks in several different martial arts, including kendo (renshi), karate (kyoshi), jujitsu (kyoshi); iaido (godan), kobudo (godan), judo (yodan), and aikido (yodan). He has worked as a martial arts choreographer on a number of feature films and is the author of several other martial arts books as well.Lawrence KaneAuthor of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction"},{"Title":"The Way of Kendo and Kenjitsu: Soul of the Samurai","review":"Mr. Craig has again written another fine book and I can recommend it as a enjoyable read. It maintains the traditional Craig writing style that integrates authentic personal stories, but written around completely new information and insight into one of the more mysterious of the martial arts - kendo. This book is as good as, and in many ways much better, than Mr. Craig's previous books. If you don't read it for the diagrams and technical depth, it certainly should be read for his historical reflections. I found it particularly interesting to understand that the martial experience Mr. Craig has gained - enough to write an authoritative book on the subject, comes from his long relationship with a family in Japan that has been practicing kendo in one form or another for almost 800 years.I only will point out an observation that Craig gets slowly around to making. He describes that kendo has a very pragmatic modern application. In spite of the list of ranks, skills and titles that Mr. Craig has (l)earned, he writes that the marital samurai is not a person brute bristling with weapons and bravado, but rather a courteous, indifferent person who carries within himself, unseen except when called to action, a martial spirit and a courage to battle for a right."},{"Title":"The Way of Kendo and Kenjitsu: Soul of the Samurai","review":"Knowledgeably written by Darrell Max Craig (a renowned martial arts expert and film choreographer with a 6th Dan in Kendo, Karate, and Jujitsu, 5th dan in Iaido and Kobudo, and a 4th Dan in Judo and Aikido), The Way Of Kendo &amp; Kenjitsu: Soul Of The Samurai combines the author's personal life experiences, philosophy concerning the way of the sword as has been practiced in Japan since ancient times, diagrams and carefully worded descriptions of techniques, movements forms, and exercises relating to historical as well as sport kendo, and much more. From extensive guidelines to using basic equipment, to a reflection on the tradition of the samurai and his swords, to information concerning the collection, care and upkeep of swords as well as martial arts training regimens, The Way Of Kendo &amp; Kenjitsu is a holistic introduction and highly recommended for anyone fascinated by what it means to better one's skill with the Japanese blade."},{"Title":"The Way of Kendo and Kenjitsu: Soul of the Samurai","review":"Reviewed by Bob SpearsPublisher and Chief ReviewerHeartland ReviewsThe author has written a definitive work on the subject. Kendo, using padded armor and split-bamboo swords, is a sport. He covers its essentials. Kenjitsu is the much older code of sword fighting, which has no rules and uses real, metal swords for practice.The book is remarkably well illustrated and the text provides excellent information on the topic. The author provides not only the movements, descriptions, and customs, but what to look for in collectible swords and other equipment."},{"Title":"The Way of Kendo and Kenjitsu: Soul of the Samurai","review":"Here's another informative, instructive, and inspiring book by Darrell Craig - a great addition to your library if interested in kendo, iaido, kenjitsu, or simply martial arts in general.Thanks to the helpful reviews below, I've gratefully added this book to my collection. One reviewer complained that the author was arrogant, which I was unable to determine from reading the text. To the contrary, the stories reveal a kind and generous man. If the author is arrogant, so what? His book is a great buy!And so is &quot;The Heart of Kendo,&quot; which I rate at 5 stars for being not only educational but also exceptionally beautiful."},{"Title":"The Way of Kendo and Kenjitsu: Soul of the Samurai","review":"Pretty much repeats himself.

Author is very arrogant and has a big ego and that is a turn off."},{"Title":"The Tortoise and the Tree Adapted from a Bantu Folktale","review":"This book has a wonderful message about being kind to others no matter how small or insignificant we might think they are. The animals do what is necessary to secure food. Their country is in a famine, and one tortoise helps provide for the key necessary to eat from the only tree providing food. They forget who helped them get the food, and selfishly try to eat only to come to their own ruin in the process. The pictures are unique in their African geometrical designs, and add to the overall folklore of the story."},{"Title":"The Houses of History: A Critical Reader in Twentieth-Century History and Theory","review":"I found this book very helpful in understanding the methodologies behind the different &quot;houses&quot; of historiography. As the first reviewer stated, it can sometimes be tedious, but if you need to know this stuff, this is a relatively painless way to go about doing it. Finally, I would just like to pose a question: why would anyone trust a review by a college student who cannot correctly spell &quot;nonsense&quot;?"},{"Title":"The Houses of History: A Critical Reader in Twentieth-Century History and Theory","review":"Great book. Before I read it, I had been confused by the various historiographical 'houses.' Now I know what's what. Anyone who's doing a historiography course at university should read this book because it (a) explains most things well and (b) makes it clear that there is a lot of conscious consideration behind how historians approach the past, which I think anyone who plans to study the past for a living needs to know. Jay's negative review shows he isn't willing to engage in a sophisticated analysis of the historian's influence on history."},{"Title":"The Houses of History: A Critical Reader in Twentieth-Century History and Theory","review":"The reason I recommend this book above any others on historigraphy, is that the chapters are succinct and virtually absent of pretentious academic-speak. In addition, each \\"house\\" of history comes with an example of the theory or methodology being discussed, which is useful for those of us who need \\"illustrations.\\" While this work is extremely useful while taking an oft-painful historiography course, it is also a terrific handbook for developing the historiography section of a long research paper, thesis, or dissertation."},{"Title":"The Houses of History: A Critical Reader in Twentieth-Century History and Theory","review":"I read this book for a methods course as well as some of the other reviewers. The format of the book is useful since it provides a synopsis of the selected perspectives as well as a reading that provides an example of the method/interpretation in action. While it is not always entertaining, it is not designed to be; it is a critical reader designed to promote critical discussion. I completed an annotated bibliography of the work (since Troup references many scholars and their works) and found this very useful so that I could read the better known examples that Troup discusses in each section. This book is a good spring board to further studies in the historian's journey to becoming thinking historian who is sensitive to the relationship between worldview, interpretation and methods in the historian's research."},{"Title":"The Houses of History: A Critical Reader in Twentieth-Century History and Theory","review":"This book gives a good summary and example of different types of historical methods.

Not the authors or the books referenced themselves, but that the sections didn't really provide a great example of what was described. Now of course you can't choose a section that is hundreds of pages long to exemplify, so perhaps this only appears to be an issue for me due to the impossibility of the task"},{"Title":"The Houses of History: A Critical Reader in Twentieth-Century History and Theory","review":"The Houses of History was an interesting read.

I was forced to endure the reading of this book for a course in historical methods. I found the book to be very dull in its presentation and arguments about the historical house. This is not just my opinion but that of my fellow students as well. In a class of thirty people only two or three found the book excellent to use the rest of us found it a disaster. There are numerous other sources out there that present this material in a more colorful and interesting fashion. I am no fan of this book. The book does present the very broad subdivisions of historical research. I disagree with anyone who is in the study of history that allows one book, one professor, or one course to mold their like or dislike for this discipline. I suffered through this book because it was mandated for the course. I did learn something about the topic. So in that way the book did have useful information in it. I just would like to suggest to those who want to learn about the historical houses of history that there is an abundant amount of material available both on the web and published that is much better in presentation then this book. For the dullness and lackluster presentation of the material I gave this book only 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Houses of History: A Critical Reader in Twentieth-Century History and Theory","review":"Informative on the different types of historagraphy.

Having barely survived storms of Russian missiles and a close dogfight with the other Firefox prototype, he discovers (in the first few pages of &quot;Firefox Down&quot;) that he's running out of fuel. Mustering all of his flying skills, and after another un-in with other Russian jets, Gant lands on a frozen lake in Finnish Lapland, outside of Russia - but not far enough. Barely getting out of the empty Russian jet before it sinks under a frozen lake, Gant is captured by the Russians. The western spymasters, too late to save Gant, quickly locate the Firefox, but are cut off by a blizzard. Thus starts the race - for the west to break out of the storm before the Russians learn the superplane's location.Few sequels measure up to their original, fewer ofcourse succeed, but &quot;Down&quot; is atleast the match of the first book. Picking up exactly where the last let off, Thomas displays his masterful sense of precisely paced action, riveting aerial scenes and nuanced charachters. Not as personal a novel as &quot;Firefox&quot;, which was more centered around pilot/pirate Mitchell Gant, &quot;Down&quot; is more of an ensemble piece with more charachters in the trenches. Still, Gant, seemingly played out in the last book, continues to reveal more scars, unpeeling himself like an onion. This isn't your typical paper-thin technothriller, but you knew that already if you read &quot;Firefox&quot;."},{"Title":"Firefox Down!","review":"This novel is an excellent follow up to FIREFOX, and it takes place right where the first book left off. If you are eager to find out what happens to Gant and the Firefox after the first book, or the movie, you must read this book! Warning though, this book is VERY suspenseful, with Gant forced to land in Finland and NATO and Soviet forces rushing to retrieve the incredible superfighter. This book holds onto all the great qualities of the first book, and you will not put it down. For fans of FIREFOX, aircraft, espionage, supense, and military fiction, this is a must read and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Firefox Down!","review":"Mitchell Gant, after nicking Firefox, has survived a dogfight. He doesnot come out completely unscathed, and is forced to ditch the plane.The rest of this thriller revolves around the attempts to get back tothe plane, and get Gant back to the plane, as he is the only many theyhave currently qualified to have a chance of flying it out of Laplandfor them."},{"Title":"Firefox Down!","review":"The story line fits the sequel with suspense, action, a plausible plot but tends to be \\"exposition-heavy\\" when Colonel Dmitri Priabin (KGB) catches up with Gant and Anna, by boarding the train at Chudovo just before Leningrad and ends with Anna being shot attempting to cross into Finland.Almost as good as \\"Firefox\\" and a much better read than my novel \\"The Revelation, Year 2027, it's Coming!\\""},{"Title":"Firefox Down!","review":"Books were fine and in decent shape for their age.

Lampassas planned to test his courage by joining a trail drive north. But the young woman he admired convinced him that love and a home would be a better dream.Years later when his wife dies and his son faces a life as a storekeeper like his father, Lampassas knows he has little time. He sells his store, surprises his son with a full-blown plan for a trail drive, and sweeps them off to follow his recaptured dream. He assembles a bedraggled crew of misfits and rounds up 2000 range cattle for the great adventure. Unprepared, under-capitalized, and unwilling to give up, this group of dreamers loses their horses and wind up &quot;walking&quot; the cattle to market. Arrival at the railhead proves disappointing since there has been no market for cattle for fifteen years, and the cattle are too scrawny by then to be worth anything except their hides. But the dream will not die.Written almost 20 years before LONESOME DOVE, this novel captures the lure of the drive, where every man faces tests of courage and manhood, where every disaster can only be the prelude to success just over the hill.With respect for his characters' quest, empathy for their refusal to abandon their dreams, and wry and hilarious humor, Flynn captures the American passion to be going somewhere, to be &quot;satisfied for a while just to be on the trail.&quot; Readers who catch a glimpse of their own roads not taken will find themselves rooting for Lampassas and his motley crew to reach the trail's end, no matter what they find."},{"Title":"North to Yesterday","review":"\\"It is the first feller that does something that is the hero, and the last feller that does it that is the fool,\\" Preacher tells Lampassas toward the end of this comic, sometimes tragic novel about some wonderful misfits and dreamers who made a belated drive of longhorn cattle from Texas to the railhead in Kansas.Chief of the dreamers was Lampassas, a storekeeper who sold supplies to the longhorn drivers and listened to their bizarre stories and tall tales until he could envision every bend in the trail. Making the drive to Trails End was one of the great adventures of the old West; but when he and his odd company of hands finally act out this once-heroic role, Lampassas becomes a tragicomic hero, a kind of American Don Quixote living in the past.The cowhands he assembles are inept, and the heroine tougher than the men, but all of them are chasing dreams: Pretty Shadow, the tough cowhand searching for the whore he once loved in Trails End and to whom he promised to return; Preacher, a self-ordained revivalist, who thinks the Lord meant him to save the sinners at Trails End; Gattis, the farm boy running away from cotton picking and the dour financee his parents had thrust on him; the man nicknamed June, a stable hand whose pistol is the cherished symbol of his manhood; the Kid, Lampassas's son, who would rather be a locomotive engineer than a cowboy; and above all the entrancing tomboy Covina, who ran away from home with her illegitimate child and hoped to make a living as a barmaid.Lampassas, to whose fire and folly and utter weariness one is deeply drawn, holds the long drive together in the face of natural and man-made catastrophes, some nightmarish, some fatal, but many wildly funny. He is at once magnificent and absurd.This novel compiles a rich cast of characters, each on the cattle drive for his own Quixotic reasons, each a dreamer himself. A great western tale spare in talk, bold in incidents, endearing of characters, this is a must read for all lovers of the American western."},{"Title":"God and Elizabeth Bishop: Meditations on Religion and Poetry","review":"Cheryl Walker's book on Elizabeth Bishop and God is spectacular.

I think that this text is essential reading for anyone interested in Bishop, poetry and spirituality, and women's spirituality."},{"Title":"the ice ghosts mystery","review":"I first read this book when I was 12 years old and I've read it innumerable times since. It's impossible to put down and more gripping than most mysteries written for adults. Mrs. Byrd and her three children, Oriole, Peregrine, and Mab have just received a mystifiying telegram from the now-missing Professor Byrd. He's disappeared in a remote valley high in the Alps. In his telegram he mentions &quot;Tce ghosts.&quot; Does he mean Ice ghosts or The ghosts? Mrs. Byrd hurriedly packs her family onto an airplane, and they're off to investigate the mysterious disappearance and the meaning of the telegram. With the help of a local boy, a bumbling folklorist, and an instructor from the nearby climbers' school, the Byrds must solve both mysteries if they ever want to see their father again."},{"Title":"A Congress of Wonders","review":"One could make the case that it's only natural that Ed McClanahan knows how to tell a good story, with rich, endearing characters. After all, he comes from the same regional stock that gave us Flannery O'Connor, James Agee, and William Faulkner. Maybe it's something in the water.Whatever it is, it works in spades for McClanahan in this collection of three related short stories set in Kentucky during and just after World War II. A finer collection of characters will not be found, and McClanahan has the same gift that O'Connor did of letting the characters lead the action. One major difference, however, between O'Connor and McClanahan is this: O'Connor's characters always seem to have an undercurrent of anger and bitterness in them, while McClanahan's are open and honest and funny. These stories are a mix of elegant writing and down-home talking that is a joy. I quote extensively from the opening of the first story:&quot;Welcome to Burdock County, hails the peeling roadside billboard out at the county line, The Asparagus Bed of the Commonwealth. &quot;Not that anyone in Burdock County actually grows asparagus in any noteworthy quantity; we're in tobacco country here, and asparagus makes, at best, an indifferent smoke. It's rather that the noble vegetable is reputed to insist upon the choice spot in the garden for itself, and civic-minded Burdock Countians like to suppose they're at least as discriminating as a stalk of asparagus.&quot;At what is purported to be at once the highest point of ground and the exact geographical center of the county, the Burdock County courthouse, an ash-gray pile of colonaded, crenellated stucco, bulks exceeding large, with the village of Needmore, nine hundred citizens strong, abjectly huddled round it, and the wrinkled hills and dales of Burdock County tumbling off to the four horizons like a vast unmade bed. Until recently, the predominant color in this great rumpled patchwork vista would have been green - the bosky verdure of woods and thickets, the paler shades of meadows and cornfields and tobacco patches - but the harvest season's over now, and the first frost has come and gone; and on this day - a certain fine late October Sunday afternoon in 1941 - the orange and dun and russet hues of autumn are in the ascendancy.&quot;Atop the courthouse, that imposing eyesore, is situated yet another imposing eyesore: a bulbous, beehive-shaped cupola with four clock faces the size of mill wheels, each asserting with all the authority of its hugeness four entirely different times of day. Two sides of the clock have, in fact, long since concluded that being right twice a day is better than never being right at all and have taken their stands at, respectively, 9:14 and 7:26. The remaining pair toil on, not in tandem but quite independently, one gaining several seconds every hour, the other just as resolutely losing them. There is, moreover, a bell in the clock tower that has a timetable all its own and is liable to toll midnight at three in the morning and noon at suppertime. The dedicated public servants in the courthouse learned long ago to ignore altogether the two broken clocks and the bell and to come to work by the slow clock and knock off by the fast one. They regard their singular timepiece as a labor-saving device and treasure it accordingly.&quot;I would sacrifice body parts to write like that.It apparently doesn't come easily to McClanahan, either. His first book, which took twenty years to write, is called The Natural Man, published in the mid-1980s, when McClanahan was 50. This is his second novel. It's not that he wasn't busy. McClanahan's biography says that the Kentucky native studied at Stanford, where he apparently hooked up with Ken Kesey and became one of his Merry Pranksters, joining Neal Cassady, Wendell Berry, Timothy Leary and Larry McMurtry. He has written many non-fiction pieces for Esquire, Playboy, Rolling Stone and others, some of which were collected in Famous People I Have Known. He's won dozens of writing awards. The central character, if he can be called such, in A Congress of Wonders is a traveling con artist named Philander Cosmo Rexroat, &quot;B.S., M.S., Pee Aitch Dee.&quot; Rexroat brings a touch of magic to these stories, which are different from each other, although each introduces us to tragic, comic characters who face absurdity squarely. These three little jewels are framed beautifully in this work, and, if we have to wait another 15 years for the next book, it'll be worth the wait."},{"Title":"Barbados Business Law Handbook (World Offshore Investment and Business Library)","review":"This book is a total fraud. Don't buy it. It's just reprints of political documents."},{"Title":"Rebels with a Cause: The Minds and Morality of Political Offenders","review":"World reknown criminologist and international criminal law professor, Dr.Nicholas N.Kittrie has written his tour de force work. Recognizing that codified international law does not cover the transnational and internecine tensions that have permeated the world during the latter part of this century, Kittrie identifies the social forces that have made public response to ethnic and religious strife so incredibly difficult.In a book to be enjoyed by academics, lawyers, sociologists as well as lay readers, Kittrie draws a road map leading from passion to insanity, and backs up his arguments with case studies and empirical data.The book is well organized, elegantly written, yet devoid of the pretentions that scholars of Kittrie's calibre often gratuitously include in their work. Kittrie not only asks penetrating questions but postulates solutions to some of the more vexing socio-legal problems caused by the political offender's unusual status. The book is a joy to read and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Electricity Markets: Investment, Performance and Analysis","review":"Initially, the title of the book makes it seem exciting. However, all topics are covered very briefly and the book assumes the reader has a large repository of knowledge (so much so that, in fact, those who possess that knowledge would not actually need this book!). Coverage of alterntative market forms is weak. Unfortunately, this book is continued testimony to the fact that Brits still live in their experience, oblivious to the incredibly cutting edge work being done in this sector in other parts of the world."},{"Title":"Talamurakal: Noval","review":"Thalamurakal belongs to a different genre. No, it can't challenge his own Khsask, but its deviation from rest of his works is visible. As usual, Vijayan has used his splendid and magical narration throughout the novel. The novel traces the diasporas of a community whose struggles are rather undocumented. He also brings up a row of issues through the novel. It traces the history of Pondmudi tharavad. Chamiyarappan, his Son-in-law and his grandson. It doesn't follow a linear narration. It talks about the upheaval and the struggles of people who are born in Ponmudi tharavad and their attempt to get rid of once prevalent \`Jatheeyatha' in Kerala Community.Pondmudi tharavad where Chamiyarappnan born is having the history of wriggling away from the caste based system prevalent. And there were attempt from his uncle to achieve Braminhood through learning Sanskirt. The quest for achieving salvation through Brhaminhood, and in the final count, revelation of its meaninglessness. Chamayiarappan, a one time communist and an ardent follower of Stalin who believes that Russia will come. His son-in-law Velappan, a strict and disciplined MSP officer, loyal to Britishers. And the last link in the lineage, Chandran an uprising communist who talks about Stockholm piece process when his own father straddled in the web of militant trade unionism.This is a novel which should be read in its totality.

I suggest this book to anyone who has a daughter about 6 to 13 years old, becuase she WILL love it! I suggest it to adults as well because it's a story that really takes you back to a simpler time, when the biggest concern in your life was how to be a third grader!

And, read my review of Ramona The Pest!!!"},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"Ramona Quimby is eager to be grown up and treated with respect. The main character in Beverly Cleary's Ramona Quimby, Age 8 is the youngest child in a family of four and has just started the third grade. Ramona finds that being in third grade at a new school does not prove to be one hundred percent fun as she had anticipated. Along with school, Ramona finds life frustrating at home, with her parents constantly worrying about money and her older sister Beezus constantly in a bad mood. However, Ramona discovers that no matter how bad things may be, she can always turn to her family for the help and love that she needs. Ramona's main worry throughout the novel is school, especially her teacher, Mrs. Whaley. Ramona loves to be the center of attention, but manages more than one time to attract more looks than even than even she can enjoy. At one point Ramona, in an attempt to crack a \\"hard-boiled\\" egg on her head, ends up with runny egg-mess all over her face. After the incident, she overhears her teacher referring to her as the \\"nuisance.\\" Not long after the egg incident, Ramona manages to make another scene when she vomits in class. Ramona is devastated by these events, and turns home for comfort. She tells he parents about the incidents. In the 1999 Children's Literature in Education, Linda Benson exemplifies the notion of home support. She states, \\" both her mother and her father let her know that the egg incident and the throwing up were not intentional and therefore not the nuisance that intentional behavior would have been\\" (25). With the support of her family, Ramona is able to return to school with her head held high. Though Ramona seeks home for comfort from the stresses of everyday life, she finds that home can be a stress in itself. Ramona's mother and father often get into serious discussions about money that they think she and Beezus cannot hear. The Quimby family does not have a lot of money and because of this often the mood in the house is tense. On one particularly rainy Sunday afternoon the whole family is in a fight. Mr. Quimby has finally had enough and offers to take the whole family out to dinner, despite the fact that in actuality he cannot afford to go to a restaurant. At dinner they are able to relax and enjoy one another's company. When Mr. Quimby attempts to pay for his family's meal he finds that a kind old man who had been observing the Quimby's has already done so, because he sees they are such a nice family. On the way home, Ramona is content and thinks to herself. \\" She was a member of a nice sticking-together family, and she was old enough to be depended upon, and so she could ignore- or at least try to ignore- a lot of things\\" (Cleary 189). Cleary uses Ramona's family as her backbone throughout the story. Despite the problems they constantly encounter, the Quimby family is able to stick together in the end. By drawing from her family's support Ramona is able to face anything that comes her way.Benson, Linda. \\" The Hidden Curriculum and the Child's New Discourse: Beverly Cleary's Ramona Goes to School\\" Children's Literature in Education 30.1 (1999): 9-29.Cleary, Beverly.

This is a list of the things we liked best about this book.*Ramona was brave when the boy took her eraser.* When her dad messed up her hair.*When her dad sang \\"High Hopes\\".*She's a girl in third grade, close to our age, like us.*Her cat commercial.*When she got eggs in her hair."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"Ramona Quimby Age 8This is one of the best books I ever read. It was about Ramona, Beezus,& the rest of the Quimbys. One day in class , Ramona got sick.Her teacher called her a nuisence. Then she apologized. She got egg in her hair at lunch.She got it all out though. Well that is about all I have to say.I think you might like it if you read it."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8 is wriiten by Beverly Cleary and gets a 5 star rating by me.I am rating this book 5 stars because it just brings back memories to kids older than 8. If you aren't older than 8 then it shows you sort of what is to come in the future. Her lifestyle is a lot like a real human's lifestyle. That is another reason why I enjoyed reading this book so much. The author just amazes me because she makes a charcter that is not really a real person turn to life. As an example she lives with her sister who always bothers her. She has a cat and a next door neighbor named Henry.My life relates to hers so much. When I was in 2nd grade people would like to take my things without asking. Just like in the novel, when Danny \\"The yard ape\\" steals her eraser and throws it around with his friend. This book also relates to my life when Ramona got that egg dropped on her head. When I was in fourth grade one of the same situations happen to me. My friend Eric started laughing really hard and spit his yogurt all over me then after that I had to go to the nurse and get it all cleaned up.Some other books I would recommend are, Ramona and Her Mother, Ramona and her Father, and all the other Ramona Quimby books. I really recommend you to read this book."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"My 8 year old son and I read together about 3 hours a week and this book is definitely one of the most touching books in the Ramona series. We've both grown to love Ramona Quimby. In fact, my son gasped when we read about Ramona overhearing her teacher, Mrs. Whaley, calling her a nuisance and couldn't believe anyone could say anything mean about poor Ramona. Beverly Cleary has a knack for expressing Ramona's thoughts in a way that reminds adults about how great an impact our words and actions have on children."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"A characteristically enjoyable Ramona book. Obviously Beverly Cleary has never forgotten what it's like to be a kid. She's very good at showing that children have feelings and thoughts of their own and how children can be both petty and noble. Also, Cleary never talks down to her young readers, using such words as \\"reflect\\" and \\"apparent,\\" which not all grade-schoolers might be familiar with. I think her books are very aspirational, showing children that they can be more than they are. Ramona, to me, is the embodiment of aspiration, with her creativity, imagination, and talent for self-actualization. I liked this book because it introduced the character of Yard Ape, who is described as \\"sturdy\\" and \\"smart and lively,\\" the perfect foil to Ramona herself."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"I like Beezuz because she could be a good sister,she is funny and really not patient.Did I say she bothers Ramona a lot?I think the book is funny because of the way the characters act in the story.I also liked Ramona ,she could get mad sometimes just like Beezuz.\\"Ramona Age 8\\" is a really good book for children or people who like to read because it shows people how to share and make friends.Ramona's family is a little bit typical and I think the characters are funny because they act silly and how they get mad,that's funny.The funniest part that is when they make a big mess in the kitchen.Ramona and Beezus are almost the same and when they get mad they explode.Read the book,you'll like it!!!"},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"Ramona Quimby is a silly 8 year old girl who is always getting into trouble. Beezus her intelligent older sister is always getting her out of trouble. Ramona is now moving on to the third grade without Beezus. Ramona never thought the third grade could be so hard. Mrs.Whaley, her teacher, thinks she is a show off and a nuisance, just because Ramona mistakenly cracked an unboiled egg on her head thinking it was boiled, and threw up in front of the class! Ramona is very sad and lonley. What will Ramona do without Beezus on her side to help?"},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"I think people should read this book because Ramona is a very interesting girl to read about, and they should learn to be as happy as she is. She is sometimes silly, but she is still a fun girl. She is also the same age as I am."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"I think that Ramona Quiby age 8 is a good book and I think that Beverly Cleary put a lot of work.I do recommend this book to kids"},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"This book is about a girl in third grade who doesn't like her teacher very much but who in the end likes her. We didn't love this story because sometimes it was confusing.

They make me smile and she is totally engaged!"},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"This book was one of the funniest books I've ever read. It hasthings you least expect in it. It's full of surprises. It was sofunny I laughed out loud when I read it."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"In Ramona Quimby, Age 8, Beverly Cleary demonstrates the positive effects that reading can bring into the life of a child. She does this in such a way that readers can measure the actual growth resulting from Ramona's reading. Since starting school, teacher expect Ramona to list unfamiliar words as she reads class assignments. This school year, she can read without being expected to list words. Toward the end of the year, Ramona describes a book assignment, an age-appropriate book, as using \\"babyish words\\" (148). The transition that occurs in Ramona is a result of the importance that she places on her reading. The more she reads, the easier it becomes until there are few words that she does not know. She not only reads better, but her vocabulary increases from learning new words by looking at the context in which the word is used in the sentence. While writing her oral book report and presentation, Ramona becomes so involved in her ideas that she forgets that it is an assignment and thinks of it as enjoyment. Ramona uses colorful paper to make cat masks and puts on a commercial to her entire class. Here, Cleary stresses one of multiple ways that children can learn and teach others their interpretation of a certain book. They not only enjoy the book, but they show their creative side; these oral reports give other students ideas how to express themselves, and also give them self-confidence to perform in front of a group. Cleary examines one way to teach literacy that keeps children excited and shows how that way affects a certain child. Ramona's teacher lets the class read a book of their choice every day. This is Ramona's favorite part of school. She looks forward to her silent reading time because it makes school enjoyable for her. Even when nothing else is going well for her, this positive experience serves as her one escape from reality. Ramona Quimby, Age 8, is a refreshing tale of some of the challenges a child faces in school. Beverly Cleary consistently demonstrates the impact of reading on children. This could quite possibly be why her books are so popular. She develops books that involve children reading for pleasure and captures the attention of the children that she depicts so accurately."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"The book was about Ramona's first time going on a school bus ,the first day she meets a bully that takes away her eraser her dad had given her and her sister Beezus after breakfast. She has a terrible year. I really love this book I've read it 7 times in 2 months."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"This book series has always been a favorite! Mom read them to my siblings and me before we were able to read ourselves, and now my girlfriend and I occasionally read them before bed. Turns out they were childhood favorites for her too. Definitely keepers!!"},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"Ramona Geraldine Quimby is my all-time favorite girl children's book character. She's in fantastic company, but she is a girl after my own heart.The wonderful Beverly Cleary has written several books about sweet Ramona. I love every one of them, but this is my favorite. Ramona feels like she is always being compared to her sister and like nobody really likes her that much. She wishes life were easier. Isn't this how we all feel when we are young? Ms. Cleary identified a feeling that I felt when I was a young child. As a child, I latched onto Ramona because she went through some of the same things that I went through. Now, as a mother, Ramona is going through the things that my eight-year-old twin girls are going through, and I am lucky enough to be living it all over again. How wonderful and how lucky I am!Here are some of the best things about this book:1. There's always that one kid in the class that makes fun of you. In this instance, Ramona's class has Danny. Ramona calls him Yard Ape. He's so mean. He steals her shiny new pink eraser on the first day of school and won't give it back. He makes fun of her big feet. He always irritates her.2. Learning to write cursive is hard, and not everyone can do it well. Poor Ramona's last name starts with a Q. She has issues with making that Q and comes a some decision about that.3. There's always a new trend. In Ramona's case, the new trend of cracking a hard-boiled egg on your head turns out to be a disaster.4. People are always going to talk about you. Ramona hears someone important talking about her, and it devastates her. Until she learns to resolve the issue....much later, after lots of suffering. (ahem, VERY BIG issue with this age group, speaking from experience with my girls.)5. Nobody likes to be sick, but NOBODY wants or needs to throw up in front of other people, especially your third grade class. But guess what? Ramona pukes in front of her entire class and is so embarrassed! So she learns how to deal with the embarrassment.Ramona goes through a million, bazillion things in this little book (really, in the entire series) but it is the way Ms. Cleary presents each event and the way that Ramona deals with it that is so incredible. As a child, I laughed at Ramona while I learned from her. As a mother, I watch my children do the same thing. They are listening to Ramona and Ms. Cleary in some instances where a mother's words just aren't enough. Because mother's are supposed to say nice, encouraging, and great things to their child. Ms. Cleary, Ramona's family, and Ramona's teachers are saying the same things that I am, and my children are listening to them.I'm not going to get on a big soapbox about childrens literature or middle-grade literature or YA literature and how important it is (because I could, but now is not the time)...but it is very possibly to enjoy the heck out of a book that means something big. This is one of those for me. I love Ramona Geraldine Quimby to pieces. That little kid has done things for me that she will never know, and now she is doing the same things for my two girls. AND, even better, we are all enjoying Ramona together. My kids are all excellent readers, but just to spend time together, I've been reading this book out loud to them, little by little, a few pages at the time. It is one of the best things ever."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"The book, Ramona Quimby,Age 8, is about Ramona's third grade school life. The main character, Ramona, had a terrible first day of school. She lost her pink eraser and fought with a boy named Danny. Her teacher Mrs. Whaley thought she was a nuisance. Ramona had many problems in third grade. I had a similar experience like Ramona because I am 8 years old and she is 8 years old. We are also both in third grade. We both had our first day of third grade but mine was better! When I read this story, I felt that I needed to be polite to adults because Ramona always got in trouble and Mrs. Whaley thinks she is a nuisance. Also, my favorite part is when Ramona presents her book report to the class and when she sings \\"Meow, meow, meow, meow\\" while she does her book report. I like it when she sings because I like that song! I would recommend this book to a girl that is 8 years old and in third grade. I think they will like it because this book is perfect for them. I think a girl that is 8 years old will like it because it will be fun for her to read.

Ramona and smashing the egg in her hair because she thought it was hard-boiled....only it wasn't, the Yard-Ape, the umm dinner that could taste you back. I remember it being a reassurance to read about Ramona's life and to know that all of that stuff was normal. Families fought, parent's were annoying, school was tough, but in the end, everything was okay.I loved sharing it with my daughters this time around. My oldest is eight, which makes her a \\"young adult\\" according to her. She could totally relate with Ramona. I think the mind of an eight-year-old was clearly captured by Cleary. Ramona is a bit more trouble that my daughter, but I'm pretty sure she feels the same way, she just doesn't act on it!This is my first post relating to my \`official' Newbery Challenge I am hosting.

I find it pretty funny when Ramona can't remember what comes next in her book report and says, \\"I can't believe I read the whole thing!\\" or when Howie and Ramona walk on tin can stilts and sing, \\"Ninety nine bottles of beer on the wall!\\" When Ramona gets mad at someone, she shows it, which is good, because you can express yourself. My favorite part in Ramona Quimby, Age 8, is when Ramona cracks raw egg in her hair and is mad for a few days. My second favorite part is when Ramona and Beezus have to cook dinner."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"My daughter has been reading all the Beverly Cleary books this summer and this one is one of her favorites.

She's expected to be old enough to \\"play nicely\\" with her baby-sitter's toddler and to understand why the family hasn't enough money for life's little extras...but somehow, she isn't old enough to be included in her older sister Beezus' plans or to understand why her teacher might not like her.Although written decades ago, Ramona's life is plain to anyone who reads about her today. What child can't relate to her joys and worries? Best of all, no matter what happens, it's apparent that Ramona will be all right...she has a family that love one another and will stick together through good and bad times alike."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"Woo, this rocks!

My mother bought it for me when I was 8 and had pneumonia, so I definitely related to the part when she threw up in the classroom (as I almost did). Ramona was always a character that I could identify with--being the younger sister, having to go to the neighbor's house to go to school, doing something stupid in public (remember when she broke the egg in the school cafeteria and it went in her hair?) and being embarrassed by it. I would definitely recommend this book to any child because as I said, Ramona Quimby is a character that almost any girl little girl who is boisterous and outgoing as she is could relate to."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"This story takes place in 2003 were all the Quimby's have their ups and their downs, but none fills them more intensely than Ramona. Her low point is the day she throws up in the class and Mrs. Whaley instructs the class to hold their noses and file into the hal way. But three days later Ramona recovers her sickness to give a book report in a style of a T.V. commercial, and bringing down the house with her final ad-line of \\"I can't believe I read the whole thing\\".This book is mostly about Ramona and her family and how she deals with it all. She has to deal with school teachers and students especially yard-ape and Willa Jean. But in all her despite she loves her family.In my opinion I personally like it a lot, because it showed a lot of funny stuff and it showed happiness too, any way it is a really good book to read.I would recommend this book because it is very good and entertaining book to read plus there are many more books out there to be read."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"Ramona Quimby Age EightIn the book Ramona Quimby Age 8 Beverly Cleary tells the life of Ramona.

New York: Avon Books, 1981.Benson, Linda. &quot;The Hidden Curriculum and the Child's New Discourse: Beverly Cleary's Ramona Goes to School. Children's-Literature-in-Education. 30.1 (1999): 9-29.Mackey, Margaret. &quot;Ramona the Chronotope: The Young Reader and Social Theories of Narrative.&quot; Children's-Literature-in-Education. 22.2 (1981): 97-109.The Newbery Award-Winning novel, Ramona Quimby, Age 8, by Beverly Cleary, paints a vivid picture of the distresses of childhood. Ramona is a tenacious third grader, learning the ins and outs of the social confines of elementary school. Evolution of her character occurs through the novel as she comes to terms with her identity and self-expression primarily by means of trail and error. Often, her energy and self-confusion is channeled through her own literacy. Literature serves as the vehicle for Ramona to focus her negative and inadequate feelings. Once she has done this successfully, she is able to share her love of literature with others. As are most third graders, Ramona is challenged to learn the social rules of the elementary school classroom. Much of this challenge stems from her own feelings of incompetence which is supplemented by her perception of herself based upon how she feels others see her. For instance, in one portion of the book, Ramona assimilates herself into the third grade by cracking and egg that she assumes is hardboiled on her head. Seconds later, it is very apparent that the egg was indeed not hardboiled. With egg oozing down her face, she trots to the school office to get cleaned up. While there, she overhears her teacher say, &quot;What a nuisance&quot; (Cleary 68). She is so hurt by this statement that she attempts to figuratively run from her teacher, Mrs. Whaley. &quot;The episode again underscores Ramona's dependence on and vulnerability to what her teachers think of her: Mrs. Whaley's conversational gambit has redefined Ramona for Ramona&quot; (Benson 24). Luckily, Ramona was able to use her reading skills to overcome her feelings of ineptitude towards Mrs. Whaley when assigned a book report. She uses her creativity to write an interactive report on a book she does not even like. After accomplishing this task, she knows within herself that she has done an exemplary job in using her ideas to &quot;sell&quot; this book to her class. Her newfound confidence through this process allows her to confront her teacher about her comment regarding Ramona being a nuisance. The conflict clears as Mrs. Whaley explains that she merely meant it was a nuisance to clean the egg out of her hair. Therefore, Ramona's literacy allows her to gain self-confidence, thereby mending the relationship with her teacher. Another prime example of the influence of literacy in the novel appears when Mrs. Whaley presents the idea of &quot;Sustained Silent Reading&quot; to her class. As Margaret Mackey points out in her article, &quot;Ramona the Chronotope: The Young Reader and Social Theories of Narrative,&quot; this time set apart in the day to read for pleasure allows Ramona to escape from her problems and from herself. &quot;Ramona masters words, stores, chapters, books. She reads when things are unbearable elsewhere&quot; (Mackey). The pivotal issue surrounding Sustained Silent Reading is the fact that Ramona is able to gain independence through this endeavor. In turn, she is able to transform into a non-selfish character and share her love of literature with a younger generation. This is displayed through her interactions with her opponent, four-year-old Willa Jean Kemp. Ramona is forced to be well mannered around Willa Jean because her grandmother is Ramona's caregiver. Throughout the novel, Ramona struggles with this demand and often is displayed as an egotistical character, jealous because she is not old like her sister Beezus, nor is she young like Willa Jean. This conflict also resolves as Ramona uses her sustained silent reading as a tool to escape from having to play with Willa Jean. Gradually, Ramona realizes that she can share with Willa Jean by sharing her sustained silent reading with her. In essence, Ramona displays the true meaning of service learning, as she becomes a stronger reader through oral reading while Willa Jean benefits from her exposure to literature. Therefore, both Ramona and her relationship with Willa Jean are transformed through her ability to read and share. As has been demonstrated, literacy is used by Beverly Cleary in Ramona Quimby, Age 8 to assist in the evolution of the character of Ramona as well as a catalyst in solving conflicts. Ramona is able to comprehend her self-identity more and more as she learns to use her literacy for her benefit. Upon gaining more self-esteem through this act, she is able to resolve conflicts between her two &quot;rivals,&quot; Mrs. Whaley and Willa Jean."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"I first had to read this book in third grade (now i'm in seventh) and I thought the cover made it look dumb, but it ended up being a really good book."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"I liked it when Ramona wears her pyjamas under her clothes.

From Ramona's interactions with her new classmates and after school \\"family,\\" to her adjusting to the changes in her real family's circumstances, the situations that Beverly Cleary creates for Ramona in this book are situations to which the average person can relate.

The third grade is harder than Ramona expected. Ramona is funny and intelligent. Beezes is starting junior high school and has a lot of homework. Ramona's dad is going to college, and Ramona's mom has a new job.I think the book was great. It was funny. I recommend this book to 3rd graders.

It's a great book for eight-year-olds and for those who were eight a long time ago!"},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"Although it is easy for many of us to forget what it was like to be little it is obvious that Beverly Cleary has never suffered from this problem. She shows that children have feelings and thoughts of their own. Her skills as an author are also present in the way she regards her younger readers as intelligent individuals while teaching them that they can be more than they are with a little thought and work.Ramona is creative, imaginative, talented, and of course active just as every other eight year old would be. Not only are her active escapades entertaining, but so are her thought processes.

On Ramonas first day of school she is faced with Danny a bully who steals her eraser. Ramona gets the best of Danny and calls him Yard Ape. After this Danny respects her and Ramona kinda has a crush on him. Ramona is indifferent with her new teacher Ms. Whaley. Throughout the book Ramona is faced with problems such as being a nuisence to her teacher, \\"Yard Ape\\", her sister Beezus and her mother and fathers tiresome struggle to pay for bills, manage a family and work and go to school. In the end of the book after a much hard day of frustration the family goes on a limb and goes to Whopperburger. While there they come across an old man who is interested in the family. Towards the end of the meal the Quimbys find out that the man has paid for their dinner, because they remind him of his family and how nice of a family the Quimbys are. This action makes the whole family realize how special their relationship is and how even though they all may be cross in some situations that they are in fact one happy family!Ramona Quimby is such a great character. A teacher could use this book to simply engage students in reading and allow them to connect with reading and the characters involved. Students can understand what it means to be a \\"family\\" and what it is like to grow up. A teacher could do a lesson on manners and what to do in situations that Ramona faced with her classmates and especially \\"Yard Ape\\". Students could be involved in a lesson that goes over what to do in a situation where a bully is involved and what actions to take when a circumstance such as a bully occurs. Also, students could do an art lesson that involves perspective with the example of Ramonas father drawing her foot.I really enjoyed this book. I never really read any of the Ramona books when I was younger. I love how Beverly Cleary makes Ramona come to life and how her troubles in life seem to work out one way or the other. This book I feel holds up to the good literature framework and I love how even though each character is flawed in some way that in the end they all seen to come together and make their messed up life work. I found myself really connected with this family and many of the situations that Ramona faced in her school life the same things that I faced when I was in school. I overheard one time my teacher say something about me. It really had an impact on my life and my feeings toward school. I, like Ramona, took what I heard and placed the emphasis and meaning of what the teacher said wrong. The teacher however meant something different. I really loved this book and cannot wait to read the rest of the Ramona Quimbys crazy life!"},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8 is written by Beverly Cleary and gets a 5 star rating by me.I am rating this book 5 stars because it just brings back memories to kids older than 8. If you aren't older than 8 then it shows you sort of shows you what is to come in the future. Her lifestyle is a lot like a real human's lifestyle. That is another reason why I enjoyed reading this book so much. The author just amazes me because she makes a charcter that is not really a real person turn to life. As an example she lives with her sister who always bothers her. She has a cat and a next door neighbor named Henry.My life relates to hers so much. When I was in 2nd grade people would like to take my things without asking. Just like in the novel, when Danny \\"The yard ape\\" steals her eraser and throws it around with his friend. This book also relates to my life when Ramona got that egg dropped on her head. When I was in fourth grade one of the same situations happen to me. My friend Eric started laughing really hard and spit his yogurt all over me then after that I had to go to the nurse and get it all cleaned up.Some other books I would recommend are, Ramona and Her Mother, Ramona and her Father, and all the other Ramona Quimby books. I really recommend you to read this book."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"This was a great book because it is about a girl and some of the things that happen to her during 3rd grade. Her dad used to be a check out person at the grocery store, now he is going back to college. Her mom works at a doctors office. Her older sister Beezus just started middle school. Money is tight in the Quimby house and Ramona and Beezus try to help out as much as they can. Some bad things happen to Ramona. One day at lunch she cracks an egg against her haed and realizes that it is not hard boiled and it meeses up her hair. The she gets sick and throws up all over her desk at school. The Quimby's car gets sick and needs a new transmission and it costs a lot of money. One rainy Sunday tha Quimbys decide to go to Whopperburger for dinner and a nice old man pays for their dinner. They realize that they may not have money but they sure do have love!

Ramona Quimby goes to the third grade. She has to go to a new school, Cedarhurst. On the bus she meets a boy named Danny. Ramona calls him &quot;Yard Ape&quot;. In the beginning of the school year, Ramona tried to crack an egg on her head and got her hair eggy. Ramona thinks it's good to be eight. She likes her new teacher, Mrs. Whaley. If only she didn't throw up in school, one day, and if her mother wouldn't remind her to be nice to Willa Jean Kemp, Ramona's life would be perfect. I don't want to spoil this for all of you who haven't read this book.

But three days later Ramona recovers her sickness to give a book report in a style of a T.V. commercial, and bringing down the house with her final ad-line of \\"I can't believe I read the whole thing\\".This book is mostly about Ramona and her family and how she deals with it all. She has to deal with school teachers and students especially yard-ape and Willa Jean. But in all her despite she loves her family.In my opinion I personally like it a lot, because it showed a lot of funny stuff and it showed happiness too, any way it is a really good book to read.I would recommend this book because it is very good and entertaining book to read plus there are many more books out there to be read."},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","review":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8 is a great book.

Court intrigues abound in this highly stylized, far future techno-medieval world at the crossroads. The author's eye for imaginative detail is remarkable. A\\"Beyond the Dead Reef\\" by James Tiptree, Jr. (Alice Sheldon). Spine-tingling science-horror with a diver stranded out beyond a ghostly and ghastly reef. Features one of the most terrifying and palpable images I can recall in science-fiction. A+\\"Slow Birds\\" by Ian Watson. Speaking of powerful images, the slow birds inhabiting this far future, pastoral Earth are utterly fascinating, along with the strange doom they portend. Wonderful plot, well crafted characters. A+\\"Vulcan's Forge\\" by Poul Anderson. Curmudgeonly scientist on Mercury has an unusual relationship with his female colleague&iexcl;and his space probe. Excellent hard science, but alas the plot is predictable. C\\"Man-Mountain Gentian\\" by Howard Waldrop. Sumo wrestlers in 2014 find new applications for Zen. Clever, entertaining story with a couple marvelous characters and an appropriately enigmatic, Zen-like finish. A\\"Hardfought\\" by Greg Bear. Dozios' preface says it well: \\"...a brilliant tour-de-force about the interplay between science and history that takes us simultaneously to the far reaches of the universe and deep inside the hearts of our distant descendants--people so changed by the consequence of a millennia-long war that they have become nearly as alien as the enigmatic enemy they fight...\\" Bear pushes scientific speculation to the imaginative limits. A+\\"Manifest Destiny\\" by Joe Haldeman. After exercising my brain on \\"Hardfought\\", I enjoyed taking a breather with this amusing, cleverly written memoir about fortunes--material and ethereal--in the Old West. A\\"Full Chicken Richness\\" by Avram Davidson. Quirky, choppy and above all silly time-travel story about an underachieving entrepreneur. C\\"Multiples\\", by Richard Silverberg. If you think dating is tough with only one personality each... As always Silverberg writes with great clarity, but here, his premise seems completely implausible. C\\"Cryptic\\" by Jack McDevitt. Skillful combination of mystery, suspense, and science as a bored SETI physicist/administrator gets out of his rut grappling with a cryptic message from space and an equally cryptic warning from a predecessor. A\\"The Sidon in the Mirror\\" by Connie Willis. Youthful anti-hero takes on cunning villain to aid damsel in distress in a frontier mining town...on a distant dying sun. The offworld dialect is highly distracting, making the whole thing hard to follow. C-\\"Golden Gate\\" by R. A. Lafferty. Reality blurs for a man watching a melodrama in a bizarre bar. Although Laffety's idiosyncratic style isn't for me, I did like his description of the villain as having \\"arms like a python.\\" C\\"Blind Shemmy\\" by Jack Dann. Grisly tale about some very literal mind games in a future Paris casino, as two thrill seeking, adversarial gamblers play their hearts out. Literally. A-\\"In the Islands\\" by Pat Murphy. Young marine biologist in the Caribbean agonizes over the imminent loss of his mutant friend to the sea. C\\"Nunc Dimittis\\" by Tanith Lee. (Title from Luke, 2:29: \\"Now Master, you may let your servant go in peace.\\") Tanith Lee's brooding, gothic voice speaks hauntingly in this melancholy story of a loyal but aging servant, his streetwise replacement-to-be, and the seductive vampire princess to whom they are drawn. Lee serves up dark reflections on love, mortality, and immortality as seen from each of their three very different perspectives. A+\\"Blood Music\\" by Greg Bear. A brilliant but appallingly rash researcher allows some of his intelligent, genetically engineered microbes to set up shop in his body. Dire consequences ensue for both him and the universe. More fascinating science from Bear, and a page-turning narrative to boot. A\\"Her Furry Face\\" by Leigh Kennedy. Thoroughly disgusting \\"character\\" study about a teacher who rapes his orangutan student. How this monkey business got in here qualifies for Best Mystery of 1983. Opposable thumbs down. F-\\"Knight of Shallows\\" by Rand B. Lee. A troubled man's exciting journey through alternate realities ends up taking a wrong turn on Plot Street. C\\"The Cat\\" by Gene Wolf. Not a big fantasy fan--can't venture a guess on the merits of this one.\\"The Monkey Treatment\\" by George R. R. Martin. Impossible to put down--simultaneously funny and frightening, this story is about a lovelorn 367-pound gourmand who signs up for a rather unique weight loss program. Results, to say the least, are mixed. Ingenious concept (with apologies to Oscar Wilde), witty, fast-paced narrative, perfectly constructed plot, unforgettably ghoulish images. Opposable thumbs up! A+\\"Nearly Departed\\" by Pat Cadigan. Unremarkable fare about a mind prober probing a dead poet's memories. C\\"Hearts Do Not in Eyes Shine\\" by John Kessel. Troubled turn-of-the twenty-first married couple attempts to rekindle their romance by torching their memories of each other. B\\"Carrion Comfort\\" by Dan Simmons. Like a Quentin Tarantino film: well crafted disgustingly graphic violence. Creepy cold-hearted senior citizens with psychic powers induce hapless nobodies to commit horrendous crimes--then turn on each other. I could find no redeemable qualities beneath the carnage. C\\"Gemstone\\" by Vernor Vinge. The life story of an alien rock moves along at the speed of...well, a rock. Zzzz\\"Black Air\\" by Kim Stanley Robinson. Disaster closes in on the crippled remnants of the Spanish Armada in the frozen North Atlantic, as seen from the eyes of a spiritually sensitive youth dragooned into service. Similar in structure to Robinson's story from the fourth edition, \\"Down and Out in the Year 2000\\", where bit by bit, sentence by sentence, the inevitable doom tightens its grip. A"},{"Title":"The Year's Best Science Fiction: First Annual Collection","review":"This is the very first annual collection of Year's Best Science Fiction stories edited by Gardner Dozois. As the series approaches the three-decade mark, it is gratifying to see the earlier volumes released in Kindle format. You can buy all of them and take them everywhere with you!Five of my favorites from the twenty-five stories selected from 1983:Poul Anderson's \\"Vulcan's Forge\\" takes place on and near Mercury. A pilot's concern for his space probe's computer becomes apparent when she is damaged. Not beyond repair.Greg Bear's \\"Hardfought\\" shows humanity becoming more like its alien enemy during an immeasurably long interstellar conflict. There is also a heart-splitting love story between several versions of a soldier and a researcher. There is strange comfort here for lost love.Jack McDevitt's \\"Cryptic\\" follows an astronomer's efforts to solve a puzzle left by a colleague. The clues are both scientific and historical. This short story is a good choice to illustrate McDevitt's style to a new reader. If you like it, you will certainly enjoyA Talent For War.Greg Bear's \\"Blood Music\\" demonstrates the powers and perils of nanotechnology. And why it's not good to test new technologies on yourself. Or on everybody else.Leigh Kennedy's \\"Her Furry Face\\" is one of those stories written to provoke a specific response from the reader. It does this so well that you have to admire the story even though the response is disgust. In the story a teacher has an inappropriate relationship with his student. The story helps you to understand him more than you would care to.The collection is recommended for selective reading. There are some very good stories and a few that just don't connect. But it's worth experiencing as the first of its kind. The best is yet to come in later volumes."},{"Title":"The Year's Best Science Fiction: First Annual Collection","review":"I have been searching for the 1st and 2nd annual collections of Dozois' Year's Best Science Fiction for many, many years. I have searched vast used-book emporiums and have canvassed the internet in vain. The only copies I could find were going for several hundred dollars (not going to happen). These were the only 2 that I did not have on my shelves. I can't believe they are finally available and in Kindle edition no less. I have the hard-back editions of the rest of the series, but since I am trying to streamline my physical library I am hoping the publisher makes all of the books available for Kindle.Great bang for the buck.

Learn about s pacific & ww2 in Mitchner's historical/ fictional style."},{"Title":"Return to Paradise","review":"The pieces on Fijian-Indians in 'Fiji' and 'The Mynah Birds', in which local Indians are shown up in an ugly and racist manner, are just bad writing. To his credit Michener apologised about his untoward remarks years after the publication of the book."},{"Title":"Return to Paradise","review":"In this \\"sequel\\" to the more highly regarded TALES OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC, author Michener adopts a somewhat different format. For each of the South Pacific islands included, he first writes an essay about its history and culture. He follows the essay with fiction, an original story set on that island. He not only writes about such obvious choices as Tahiti and Fiji; he also includes both Australia and New Zealand. His story set in New Zealand, a World War II homefront piece entitled UNTIL THEY SAIL, later became a film. That's the one part of this book that I remembered clearly, after a good 40 years, when I sat down to read RETURN TO PARADISE for the second time.Michener's essays describe the South Pacific as it was in the late 1940s, several years before this \\"tail end\\" baby boomer was born, so today's reader needs to approach them as history and treat them accordingly. As such, they're intriguing. Some of the accompanying stories are equally dated, but I was surprised to find others echoing with human dilemmas only too familiar in today's world. UNTIL THEY SAIL didn't disappoint me a bit when read from a mature (think \\"old enough to be a grandma\\") woman's viewpoint, even though I last read it as a girl not long into adolescence. It helped me understand my parents' generation, then. This time around it reminded me that what happens to men and women separated (or brought together) by war is universal, and its dynamics never change.Michener is always worth reading. 5 stars for sheer durability!"},{"Title":"Return to Paradise","review":"I loved this book. While reading Tales of the South Pacific, I was interested in the island cultures which played behind the main stories. This book delves into those cultures, as they were when the book was written. Nice stories."},{"Title":"Return to Paradise","review":"I purchased this book after seeing the 1953 movie based on one of the stories in \\"Return to Paradise\\". After reading the book, I discovered that Michener painted a picture of Polynesia and the South Pacific as being both a heaven and a hell. Unlike the 'travelog\\" descriptions by the media and travel indusrty, Michener is brutally honest. He describes both the things that make the South Pacific a place of indescribable beauty and a place exactly the opposite by telling interweaving tales of events and people in various places. These stories are eye-opening giving a taste of reality in this blend of fact and fiction.I recommend this as a mandatory reading for any American who wishes to go beyond the typical tourist venues of any of these South Pacific Paradises, otherwise they may be in for a shock. Until I read this book, I wanted to retire to and live in one of the many places Michener writes about. I now realize, where I live is closer to my idea of Paradise than what I envisioned the places of the South Pacific."},{"Title":"Return to Paradise","review":"This is, in a way, a follow-up to Mitchner'sTales of the South Pacific. The time is five years after the end of World War II. It is more like Mitchner's later books with factual chapters about the South Pacific interspersed with anecdotal chapters giving life, flavor, and character to its inhabitants. From Australia and New Zealand to the New Hebrides and Polynesia, he describes each islands' unique features; how some you may want to live in, why some you would want to avoid. The detail is intense with out being tedious, truly captivating, a great, fun-read as only Mitchner can provide."},{"Title":"Return to Paradise","review":"This is an outstanding book and is a worthy continuation to Michener's Tales of the South Pacific. It is full of excellent stories about the south Pacific which will entertain the reader to its fullest."},{"Title":"Return to Paradise","review":"While I would be the first to say this is not as good as Tales of the south pacific, few books are. A very good read that any Michener fan will love."},{"Title":"Return to Paradise","review":"The descriptions of the islands makes one want to vacation there or possible live for a short period of time."},{"Title":"Return to Paradise","review":"Michener is the lazy man's way to learn history. I have read many of Michener's works over the years. In terms of form, this book represents the transition from the Tales of the South Pacific to the type of work we know best and his biggest successes--Hawaii, Alaska, Centennial and so on. In these works, Michener blended or weaved a series of stories around a historic place or events. Yeah, it was cookie cutter, but it was also immensely readable. For history buffs, reading Michener is a secret sin. His books were perennial bestsellers.Trying to figure out how Michener got to this model is tough when you read the Tales of the South Pacific, where the everything was contemporary. The Tales were essentially a set of very charming interrelated stories with the theme of the \\"fish out of water\\". Americans in the South Pacific during WWII were that indeed and the historic period need not be introduced to the reader as the book was published a few years after WWII. It is BTW his best work by far. The characters are the most human of any of his works.In Return to Paradise, Michener introduces history and then tells a story in subsequent chapter. This is what we read in Hawaii and others. Return to Paradise is his first try at this. This book is the bridge between the Tales and later works like Hawaii and Alaska.In Return to Paradise, some of the stories are better than others. I think \\"Morgan\\" is my personal favorite."},{"Title":"Return to Paradise","review":"Is this a reprint of \\"The Voices of Asia?\\" Som of the reviews read like it might be.

I wished I hadn't bothered. It seemed as if the great wordsmith was just writing because his publisher demanded to cash in on the success of 'Tales'. Disappointed, I put it down about a third of the way through and never bothered to pick it up again. It takes two to tango - even in a novel.

What is remarkable in de Gaulle's rise to power is his sheer irrelevance prior to the 1940 invasion of France. Prior, he was just another obscure, if somewhat rebellious French General. After he became a player on the world stage. Historically there are very few parallels - none that I know of. As another author pointed out - if the plane carrying him and Spears from France to England in 1940 would have crashed, he would have been a minor footnote in French history.As Aidan Crawley indicates, both Churchill and particularly Roosevelt tried many times to circumvent de Gaulle. They ignored him or wanted to replace him with Giraud - who was mere putty to de Gaulle.What is also astounding about his career is that prior to 1940 - when de Gaulle turned 50 - he had little political experience- after arriving in England he became a virtual political maestro. This is not to say that he did not make mistakes - he made several. But in England in 1940 he started from nothing and organized a political machine that was able to take over France during the Allied invasion. As Mr. Crawley notes they were well organized and when each village and city was liberated they had people selected to take over from the Vichy administration. There were many reprisals when France was liberated, but a potential civil war was averted - between Vichy remnants and its opponents.Perhaps Mr. Crawley ignores some of the magnanimity of de Gaulle. He wrote many letters to Churchill and the King and Queen thanking them profusely for their generosity and expressing gratitude and sincere admiration to the British people for their strength and adversity during six years of war. He wrote letters to Roosevelt in a similar vein. He did quarrel violently (and stupidly) with Churchill, but he deeply admired him.The passages on Algeria are very well explained. We can see how de Gaulle wavered back and forth, but eventually withdrew French forces. One gets the impression that de Gaulle was never a strong colonialist (like Churchill) and felt that even with a strong French presence in Algeria (there were close to one million French in Algeria) it was never worth the struggle to keep it within the French empire. Nevertheless withdrawal was extremely bloody and de Gaulle just managed to hang onto power in France.Mr. Crawley also points out that although de Gaulle was good for France - he succeeded in putting France back as an economic, political and social power in Europe - de Gaulle antagonized within France and beyond France. France was left with few friends on the world stage. De Gaulle was nobody's toady, but he had little charm."},{"Title":"Galatians (New International Biblical Commentary, 9.)","review":"I have used this one several times. It is a great short commentary. Over and over I have found this commentary gives succinct reviews without skimping on the most important aspects.It is a beautiful complement to a fuller treatment like Fung or Bruce.Jervis brings clear and often teachable/preachable points for each passage. She also gives a careful handling of the text. I have not found a passage yet where she makes the error many commentators make, to insert their favorite theological persuasion into the text.I have used this book as a jumpstart when doing sermon exegesis and am short on time...or just when I need another perspective. It's one of my top five commentaries on Galatians. I give it a big thumbs up."},{"Title":"Tale of the White Crow: Coming of Age in Post-Soviet Latvia","review":"On one level, this book tells the story of a young woman coming of age in any culture. There are delightful descriptions of the ups and downs, the fantasies and cynicism, the longings and the resignation - one can see this young woman in every culture.On another level, however, this book is the story of a very personal triumph. Ms. Melnika describes in vivid detail the difficult reality of those living in Latvia during the past two decades. From the scarcity of goods and services, to the mind-controlling religious cults, to the hedonism that supposedly represents the freedoms of the West, the author encountered them all and portrays her experiences with an honesty of which only the young are capable.Tale of the White Crow is a journal. Some readers may object to the broken English translation, but I found it strangely appropriate.I have only two small criticisms: the journal simply ends - I very much wanted to know what became of the author. Also, there are several photos in the book but no descriptions of what they are of. I would like to have seen photos of the people referred to in the book."},{"Title":"Tale of the White Crow: Coming of Age in Post-Soviet Latvia","review":"Latvia, My favorite country.

I bought this book for my daughter and found that I enjoyed it just as much as she did as we read it together.The photos capture the essence of the city so well, we enjoyed seeing places we had visited.A great book and I look forward to other books by this author.James HatsisJames1@OconeeAirService.com"},{"Title":"Tale of the White Crow: Coming of Age in Post-Soviet Latvia","review":"I missed my favorite TV show to read this book to it's completion. To those of us who have a vested interest in Latvia, the author gives us a rare glimpse into a native heart.

It is one of those books that make you want to meet the author to talk it all out."},{"Title":"The merry month of May","review":"For those of us who thought James Jones could only write war stories, this relatively obscure title is a nice surprise. Of course, there is a warlike element to the story's backdrop of 1968 Paris, but ultimately the student riots are just that - a backdrop.The main focus of the story is on the descent of an American expat family into chaos, in part as a reflection of the generational divides laid bare by the riots. There are bits of sex and violence thrown into the mix (although far more of both are referred to indirectly without actually being portrayed), but the story is more concerned with changing values and the bonds of family and friendship than with anything melodramatic. It turns out that Jones was far better at telling such a tale than his earlier and better known novels had let on.Since most of the lead characters are defined by their uglier sides, there aren't many people to root for. But as the story progresses, it increasingly becomes a story of the well-to-do American community in Paris as a whole, which makes for a somewhat more sympathetic picture. Jones also did a great job of bringing in real-life events of May-June 1968 on both sides of the Atlantic to influence his fictional characters and their story, which is told from the point of view of an intimate observer of the chaos just a few weeks after it's all over. Is it really the end of an era for the Americans of Paris, or just for one dysfunctional family? For once, as the reader, you're free to decide on your own."},{"Title":"The merry month of May","review":"... \\"The Merry Month of May\\" is a brilliant, perfectly structured novel which was misunderstood when it was first published, and is apparently still misunderstood. Like Jake Barnes in \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" Hartley is a wounded man who finds himself emotionally impotent to help the people he loves most, even when his own godchild's future is in question. He is an observer, in the tradition of Barnes, or Nick Carraway, and to observe is his JOB. His own feelings of guilt and shame come from the very fact that he can't bring himself to act, take sides, or take a stand, even when his friends demand it of him. This is actually, in my estimation, one of the few novels of its time that deals honestly and compassionately with women's true roles in the \\"sexual revolution\\" of the Sixties."},{"Title":"The merry month of May","review":"For awhile there, I was thinking I don't want to read this book, and thought I wouldn't finish it, BUT I kept reaching for it and I think it was more about my mood lately, I can't seem to find anything to read. There's something about this book that reels me back IN. I find it kind of silly here & there, but I think that's because of the era in which it was published. If I'd read it when I was 20 in 1971, instead of NOW when I'll be 60, I would have seen it all much differently! So, I have to say, I AM enjoying it and I'm glad I read the reviews here. I came specifically for that, to see what others have to say. I'm not quite finished with the book, but it's LURE intrigues me! I can't stop reading it."},{"Title":"The merry month of May","review":"The Merry Month of May is centered on the student protests of May 1968 in Paris. Jones' protagonist, Jack Hartley, is a middle-aged American writer who is friends with a family personally affected by the summer's events. The family, the Gallaghers, consist of Harry, a sex-crazed film writer, his long-suffering wife Louisa, and their rebellious, anarchist-wannabe son, Hill. Hill is involved with a radical group bent on filming the protests; Harry's sympathy and help is not welcomed by the boy. Meanwhile, Harry is having a hard time remaining faithful to his wife. Obviously, little of this has anything todo with Jack Hartley. Because of Hartley's outsider status, he is able to make witty comments about the absurdity of the young idealists' perceptions of the world and the worth of what they are doing. However, Hartley's irrelevance to the action shows in dull passages where he is simply walking around before, during, and after riot action. He is an annoying meddler in the Gallaghers' problems; despite insistent claims to the reader thathe doesn't want to get involved, he continually does so. Here politics and social upheaval are awkwardly mixed with sexual dalliances, particularly Harry's irresponsible ones, for which Hartley condemns him. Gallagher's wife is portrayed as nearly a saint, while all the other women in the book (sexuallyliberated by 1968 standards) are physically described at length in vulgar terms, considered amoral if not evil, and whatever efforts they make for the cause are belittled by male characters. This is not uncommon for a novel published in 1970, and perhaps it says something about the so-called sexual revolution that Jones can so easily milk it for sexploitation. Or, perhaps, it just says something about Jones.Jones' writing has improved since the clunky, adverb-heavy prose of From Here to Eternity, or perhaps he simply acquired better editors by this, his sixth, novel. The book is at times funny in a cynical way that seems before its time, but for the most part, it's windy, too distanced, and terribly dated."},{"Title":"The merry month of May","review":"I started this book and then stopped. I was about to dispose of it and then read some of the middle parts and started reading it again. I really enjoyed parts. Others, not so much. The almost journalistic parts about the revolution are excellent. The Gallagher soap opera is turgid. Sam Everton is a wholly unrealistic character, mainly a vehicle. The biggest fault with the second half of the novel is it requires sympathizing with \\"dear, darling Louisa,\\" a character who left me cold."},{"Title":"The merry month of May","review":"The only reason I read this book was because I've just read a book (Saveage Grace) about the Baekwell family who lived in Paris during the 1950's and 1960's, were good friends of James Jones & his wife, and on whom he based the Gallagher family in this novel.The best things I can say about this book is that it's a decent short history of the student uprising in France in 1968 & if you're familiar with Paris at all, it gives an accurate description of the city. Other than that, the book is verbose, its depiction of women woefully sexist and out of date, and gives the reader the cringing feeling one gets when an older person is tring to be \\"with it.\\" This book definitely has not stood the test of time."},{"Title":"The merry month of May","review":"I haven't read this book, but came here to read the reviews because i plan to read it in the near future.

It is a true, intimate recollection of one brave woman's battle with a debilitating disease, lupus. Marilyn Gibson's superb book grabs the reader during the introduction and won't let go. From experiments with non-traditional healing methods to multiple near-death experiences, she offers a ringside seat to intimate, painful episodes few people have endured. Her lucid writing style pampers the reader with a thesis of medical, religious, and technical concepts that inform without imposing the rigors of jargon and esotericism.Gibson believes much about life, including disease, is governed by a lack in our souls. Pain forces us to analyze our actions in quest of the source of our suffering. Diagnosed with lupus erythematosus, she went on a spiritual journey - seeking a cure for a disease that attacked her kidneys and almost took her life. She spent seventeen years trying to cure herself, becoming an expert in the nuances of this and other related diseases.Viewing music as a transcendent force, this accomplished violinist believes a strong constitution is needed to heal as well as make good music. Physical and emotional stress exacerbates the affects of a disease, leading to a search of the fathomable recesses of her soul for clues that might have triggered it. In the process, she decides if medicine isn't the solution, she will seek answers from a higher power. Triumphantly, her beliefs and commitment move her closer to those answers that may save her life. Her description of the hospital sessions is compelling; the reader can almost feel the pain from the medical devices.Continuing to perform professionally in spite of the disease, Gibson travels around the nation, as well as abroad - remaining one step ahead of the inevitable. She discovers yoga, becomes a vegetarian; embracing ideals from a new counterculture to open her mind to new healing possibilities. She becomes convinced that lupus can be held at bay if she maintains pure habits. Unlike her mother who suffers with rheumatoid arthritis and believes in doctors and healing through drugs, Marilyn's faith has always been suspect. As her mother becomes progressively more disabled, it reinforces Marilyn's skepticism.In spite of her quest for solutions, Gibson is diagnosed with life-threatening hemolytic anemia. The prescribed drugs simply delay her destiny. As she lies on a cold table in the emergency room, she feels her life force slipping away: \\"Suddenly, I found myself in another dimension. A glowing golden tunnel appeared in front of me. Far, far into the tunnel, almost as if at its distant openings, stood a man dressed in a splendid robe. A luminous white light emanated from behind his magnificent form. With a small smile on his barely intelligible features, he beckoned to me gently. There was a transcendent peace about him, yet I sensed incredible power. . . . As I slipped into the tunnel, he pulled me back. . . . I had survived my near-death experience.\\"After a failed marriage, Gibson finally finds her life's mate. She and husband Tim form a polarity; they are opposites. His pragmatic nature brings her closer to the very world she had wanted to leave. In spite of this new happiness, lupus flare-ups threaten this new security. She soon faces death again when her hemoglobin level registers around four, 36 points below normal. A transfusion is the only thing that can save her life.Throughout the book, Gibson introduces concepts which, under the circumstances, may be regarded as the actions of a desperate person clinging to life. However, her attitude and candor illustrate that these actions are motivated by strong, often unconventional, beliefs: \\"My familiarity with Zen Buddhism defied logical explanation. Although I had never studied it, somehow I \`knew' the experience of satori. During an experience known as self-regression, I discovered I had been a Japanese man in another lifetime. Another such regression brought images of a former life as a silversmith in Colonial America . . . I knew that each past life was correct.\\"Gibson later encounters a death-threatening bout with spinal meningitis. Enveloped in an ice suit to control her skyrocketing temperature, she again is barely able to cling to the physical world. \\"Hallucinations crowded my vision as I floated through a pleasant, ethereal dimension. Returning to reality for a check on my body sent me back up to the stratosphere to escape my physical agony. Hours passed as I slipped in and out of consciousness. . . . As in my previous near-death experiences, it was more difficult to put on the mantle of physicality than to pull it off.\\"Throughout her ordeal, Gibson retains her innate love for music, and her profession as a concert violinist. \\"In particularly emotional times, music mingles with life like blood with tears. My violin was like a beautiful lover. I knew every inch of its dark brown varnish and sensual curves as well as I knew my own body. The sides reminded me of an Italian painting, or an ancient map, with snaking lines of age pointing to random destinations.\\"After spending excruciating, dehumanizing periods on dialysis machines, Gibson receives a gift of life - one that returns her life to normal. Robert, her 71-year-old father, donates one of his kidneys. Prior to the surgery, she makes a decision: \\"The mind will direct the body successfully if given a chance, but it must be guided to the correct results. My happy result hinges on unswerving faith.\\"She left the hospital eleven days after the transplant and has experienced no rejection problems. She resumed her music career, playing in such big shows as Shogun, Phantom of the Opera, and Miss Saigon. She also founded and leads a group, the Herrick Trio.Today, Marilyn Gibson lives a normal life. She resides in New Jersey with her husband Tim Malosh, two parrots, three finches, a shar-pei, a pekingese, and three cats."},{"Title":"Hanging by a String","review":"Wow! This is a life-changing, life-saving book that will help soooo many people! Marilyn's story of overcoming adversity in her courageous battle with lupus is a marvelous example for everyone. She exemplifies how we all can master the mind-body connection. The magic bullet for cure (any cure) exists within us, if we can only acknowledge the role of spirit in healing.Marilyn's story will grip you from the very beginning. Her expertise in writing captures you through her entire book. It's as though you experience everything along with her--from the beginning to the end and back again. Her darkest nights of the soul embrace dialysis, kidney transplant, near death experiences, recovery, and new disease crises and finally cure through spiritual enlightenment, love and acceptance.Here are some thought-provoking insights you won't want to miss:. The most powerful healing force is Love.. Each individual must take responsibility for his own healing.. Self-hate, fear and guilt must be released for healing to happen.. It is our destiny to heal ourselves.. Our Love and creative works must be allowed to flow outward, unimpeded, or everything turns inward, and we create our own disease.Don't miss the incredible healing message of this book!Jean Krueger, Author of \\"WHY THE WEIGHT? DARE TO BE GREAT!\\" ISBN#: 0972208607"},{"Title":"Hanging by a String","review":"A talented lady meets a dramatic health situation with courage and dignity. Marilyn leads us to inner strength. It was my honor to know her and to find her greater depth in this book."},{"Title":"Hanging by a String","review":"&quot;Hanging by a String&quot; is a many-faceted book which details the author's tumultuous life with lupus, from her first medical confirmation of the disease as a teenager through the several times that, were it not for fine doctors and her own spiritual strength and determination to live, the disease &quot;should&quot; have claimed her. I heartily recommend this well-written labor-of-love which Marilyn Gibson was uniquely qualified to pen.The author makes bluntly clear at the beginning of the book that she does not believe health and disease to be mere circumstances of luck or genes, and is never timid or evasive about her belief in their spiritual and metaphysical origins, and thus in spiritual and metaphysical solutions. Indeed, lest there be any doubt in the reader's mind, the author makes her premise starkly clear in the first two sentences of the Introduction : &quot;I believe that we choose what we need throughout life to address lack in our souls. This includes disease.&quot; This proclamation prepares the reader for often unexpected detours in a book that is far more than a history of one person's fight against a devastating and incurable disease.While few people today would question the profound effect of state-of-mind in one's physical health, many readers (myself among them) will disagree with the extent to which the author attributes non-medical causes, cures, and indeed the very &quot;reasons&quot; for disease. Yet none of her premises were casually formed. In the course of decades of seeking answers to the origins and remedies for her disease, the author explores Buddhism and other transcendental disciplines, while never abandoning the Christianity with which she was raised. Without pre-judgment, every insight which is loving and beneficial is welcomed and assimilated. Not only her present life is scrutinized for clues to her disease, but also those of her parents and grandparents, and even of her own, previous lives.Some readers may categorically dismiss such non-empirical observations as previous incarnations and spiritual explanations for disease. Even such a seemingly peripheral event as the manner in which she finds an apartment to share in New York City, is given an explanation which may seem mystical to some. I don't doubt her apartment story; yet even if I did, the straight-forward manner in which it is recounted would allow even the most ardent skeptic to accept it as her own history of herself, and to move forward from there. And although I, for one, did not accept as fact some historical paranormal phenomenon which Gibson cites, these details were nonetheless important in illustrating her literal and inner journey. She expresses her beliefs directly and clearly, without pre-judgment and without requiring the reader to concur.Since the author is a concert violinist, along the way one gets a sense of the enormous love and passion that are prerequisites for any such monumental pursuit, all of which ultimately tie in to her central theme. She expresses beautifully the concept that for her to play the violin is as necessary as for her to breathe. Indeed, one gets a sense that the violin was part of her life-long cure. &quot;My violin ... was like a beautiful lover. I knew every inch of its dark brown varnish and sensual curves as well as I knew my own body. The sides reminded me of an Italian painting, or an ancient map, with snaking lines of age pointing to random destinations.&quot;In fact, in Gibson's book, as in her life, music assumes the role of a life energy unto itself. Readers, such as myself, for whom such a concept is utterly natural will find her story all the more accessible. Those who begin the book believing music to be the mere juxtaposition of aesthetically pleasing sounds will have that much more to learn from it. Just as music is, symbolically, a life unto itself, so is disease. In recounting several rhapsodic images dancing through her mind when near death and under debilitating drugs, the Disease symbolically takes on the guise of a demon, not merely a biological horror.Perhaps the parts of the book which most affected me were the occasional unexpected phrases which succinctly convey our great fortune to be blessed with life and sharing this Earth. For example, one such jolting phrase comes when she is in the mountains of Aspen, too ill to truly partake of the miraculous splendor about her : &quot;I felt like an alien who had beamed down into paradise.&quot; Equally jarring are the author's hospital recollections when near death, before a kidney transplant turned her life around : &quot;In this distorted world, I lurked in the shadows. Here in the murky recesses of my new life underwater, everyone spoke without sound or meaning. The surface, where healthy people lived, was a place where my admission pass had just run out.&quot;Ms. Gibson extols the Western medical tradition which repeatedly saved her life, while questioning whether it in itself may on another level contribute to disease. These opinions are never expressed as a lack of gratitude of Western medicine, but rather in an effort to improve it. And who else better equipped to compose such a chapter? The author struggled for decades against a hideous disease, and skimmed so close to death that the most subtle thought of acceptance on her part would have effected it. She has endured massive, risky surgery, experienced various hospitals and diverse medical systems, and suffered the excruciating, life-numbing side-effects of the medicines needed to cope with the disease. And all through it, she meticulously explored varied religions and philosophies, evaluating how they might benefit people's physical and spiritual health. Combine the author's rare combination of experiences, expertise, and spiritual quest with her obvious intellect and fine writing, and her book should command wide attention.No book has better reminded me of our incomprehensible fortune of being alive on this wonderland we call Earth, and of the tragedy that any of us might squander it.Tom Suarez"},{"Title":"Prehistoric Man on the Great Plains","review":"Good for reading and research.

Fantastic."},{"Title":"THE ELIZABETH STORIES.","review":"&quot;The Elizabeth Stories&quot; is a collection of linked short stories about a young girl growing up in a small, stultifying Canadian town. There is constant conflict between Elizabeth's mother's emphasis on propriety and Elizabeth's own nature, which is honest, lusty, forthright and innocent. Elizabeth encounters difficult situations she cannot change, only observe.Isabel Huggan's observations on childhood and adolescence are amazing. Her sharply accurate prose, clean and fresh, delivers instantly recognizable experiences and emotions. Though many of Elizabeth's experiences are painful, the stories are told with warmth and compassion, and some subtle humor, so they are not unbearable at all.If you love fine writing, this is a book for you."},{"Title":"THE ELIZABETH STORIES.","review":"These interconnected short stories are about the dark and mysterious side of a girl coming of age in a small, rural Canadian community. The mundane quality of puberty is intermeshed with sexual awakening. The girl has cold, unfeeling parents who try to instill the values of puritanism vs. sexual curiosity. The stories also deal with domestic violence and other secrets and shame of home life. The stories are all interesting but some require slow reading to really take them in."},{"Title":"Mathematics of classical and quantum physics (Addison-Wesley series in advanced physics)","review":"One should buy this book just because of the way Green functions are explained.

By that it is meant that it isnot necessarily an 'easy read' unless one has just completedgraduate work in mathematics or physics.It can be read however on a chapter by chapter basis and if one isa little rusty in certain areas such as advanced calculus or linearalgebra one can supplement the various chapters with review ofappropriate material to refresh the mind.A good book but not one for the mathematically challenged orfaint of heart."},{"Title":"Mathematics of classical and quantum physics (Addison-Wesley series in advanced physics)","review":"I am an undergraduate, and while I find the book interesting and good, I just wanted to emphasize that it is very sophisticated and dense.

Often concise means missing details, but not in this case. This is not an easy and breezy read. It is a densely packed little book with each page full of critical information on approaches to problems, so it will likely be slow going - it was for me. In the end, however, you will understand the information being presented at a price tag that is often one fifth of standard modern textbooks on this subject that do not do nearly as good a job. Also, often a book this old means either a lack of figures or very small handwritten ones. I found this book to be well illustrated for a text of its age, and good illustrations go a long way in explaining mathematical concepts.For the mathematics of physics I have two recommendations - this one for a \\"teach a man to fish\\" approach, andMathematical Methods for Physicists, Sixth Edition: A Comprehensive Guidefor the \\"give a man a fish\\" approach.

I used this at UC San Diego for a year long graduate course on Mathematical methods in physics and engineering. If one has the time, there is really a lot to be gained by carefully studying this book. A big part of the book is geared toward developing in detail the mathematics of the Quantum Theory. This is a good thing because in my experience most QM books are too eager to &quot;get to the physics&quot;. It is true that you can get by with a superficial understanding of functional analysis and still do QM, but this book will give you an immensely deeper understanding of the underlying structure of the theory. In particular, the treatment of Green's functions and integral equations is good. There is chapter on Group Theory and it's uses in QM. Also is a chapter on Complex analysis, although it is a wise idea to read a book entirely devoted to this subject. Overall, I like this book very much."},{"Title":"Mathematics of classical and quantum physics (Addison-Wesley series in advanced physics)","review":"The first chapter on vector analysis from the component view is the best treatment of the subject I've seen anywhere. I worked through it and the subsequent chapters on linear algebra before going to college, and it literally doubled or tripled my mathematical confidence/ability.Now that i've had some more physics, i've been going through some of the other chapters. The treatment of each subject is framed in a way that makes immediate application to physics natural and intuitive. However, while the level of rigor falls somewhat short of many pure math analysis textbooks (ex: lebesque integration is discussed qualitatively, whereas ideally one would have studied measure theory and lebesque integration before hilbert spaces and other topics), the author does a good job of giving appropriate mathematical caveats this book (in my opinion) strikes an excellent balance of practicality without sacrificing rigor. I think this makes the book useful for physicists who would like a rigorous intro to the math without getting bogged down in (relatively) unappliable mathematical constructs.Overall, this book is a must. I'd recommend the book early (as soon as one's taken multivariable calculus).

The notation, the viewpoint and the emphasis are exactly what you need to master just about all the mathematics in graduate physics. This is all done not as Afken or Matthews and Walker do it, by slapping together hodgepodges of this and that into a cookbook, but by unifying mathematical physics into a beautiful tapestry, with the underlying fabric of linear vector spaces.This book would be worth it if the price were 10 times more than it is."},{"Title":"Mathematics of classical and quantum physics (Addison-Wesley series in advanced physics)","review":"If you're tired of reading descriptive physics like Paul Davies' books and want to be able to read the original papers and follow the math, this is the book.

No doubt that they will have fun reading the theory of vector spaces.For the others, just like me, not really specialized in physics and maths, but maybe just curious, this book can bring you a lot of fun too. It reminds you of what you may have studied a few years ago... And more than that, you cover with this book other fields of mathematics that are not taught to non specialized students like Hilbert space, quantum physics, theory of analytic functions, Green's functions and integral equations.To conclude, if you're curious about mathematics and physics, you should buy this book.

At the time I bought it, when I was 9, the vast majority of the book was way, way, way above my head, but that did not stop me from reading it more and more, trying the best I could to make sense of it. I think it is a true testimony to the greatness of this set that it could hold the attention of someone who had no comprehension of about 90% of the material. In the course of almost eight years, I was inspired by this book to get material on calculus, first basic but then advanced, followed by many books on physics. It was largely because of these studies that I started college at 15, and again largely because of these studies that I am now getting A's in quantum field theory eight years later. I do not bring up these facts of my existance to impress people; if that were my intent, I would be ashamed to write this review. My intent is to give people an example which to some extent gives a slight indication of how wonderful this book is; I only hope that others enjoy this text as much as I do.Personal stories aside, perhaps I should talk about specific details of this book. Every chapter is excellent, but I feel that some of them deserve special mention: chapters 5, 6, and 7. Chapter 5 is absolutely perfect, and contains a presentation of Hilbert spaces that is hard to find elsewhere. It is very unified, especially in its treatment of Sturm-Louiville polynomials; in other texts, the principal members of this set are given individual treatment, with little or no sense of unification, but here, the enlightening knowledge is revealed that they are all really the same thing, but with different weight functions. Chapter six is a fine treatment of analytic function theory, with special emphasis on the unifying Cauchy-Goursat theorem, and a precise discussion on which theorems imply others, what are the particularly strong results, and what are the most valuable techniques for the practising physicist in this vast field. Chapter 7 is an excellent introduction to Green's function theory, with special emphasis on the fact that the Green's function is not only determined by the differential equation, but also, and very importantly, by the boudary conditions. There are many other wonderful things about this book, but to express them all, I would have to write a book myself."},{"Title":"Adorno on Popular Culture (International Library of Sociology)","review":"A layer of scholarship is antibody to liberation. The bonafide purpose of an introduction to a first rate thinker is to give the student a precis of the first rate.But the obvious question, one raised by Adorno in his lectures on Kant, is why the student needs a mentor to explain the guru.Adorno's answer was that Kantianism exists in partial independence from Kant and even from Kant's thought, in the sense that Kant raised concerns that Kant did not have the time to think through.There is nothing mystical about this. It may result in part from the fact that Kant himself, in Keyne's image, heard &quot;voices in the air&quot; in the form of thoughts that arose out of material struggles during Kant's epoch.Unfortunately, Witkin seems unaware of this possibility and provides instead a precis of &quot;Adorno on Popular Culture&quot; which reduces Adorno's thought to a biographical series of complaints about the way in which popular culture moronizes its consumer.This biographical approach forces Witken unconsciously and by default into the role of answering Adorno, and laying Adorno to rest; Witkin becomes an Adorno antibody in the manner of antibodies to the HIV virus which are the diagnosis of AIDs.In Adorno's own words and Adorno's own theory (which is almost never self-applied by texts in the Adorno industry) the thing represented is conquered by its representation in a way that has the Tedster, probably, spinning in his grave.Witkin's Adorno machine is constructed by a scholar who is tone deaf to the music of the dialectic.Witkin's Adorno machine emits racist music about jazz and Witkin seems to fail to realize that in the 1930s and 1940s, the word &quot;jazz&quot; was coterminous with popular music in an era before Coltrane. Adorno should not be forgiven, in writing about American music, for his apparently complete failure to inform himself about country blues and Scott Joplin but when asked to write about Jazz, he used the word in the same way ordinary GI's of occupied Germany used the word.Witkin's major case against his Adorno machine is Woody Allen, a filmmaker who probably knows about Adorno: an Adorno figure appears in Woody's Hannah and Her Sisters.Allen's films considered as a static *oeuvre* are thought by Witkin to constitute a riposte or counterexample to Adorno, for they are films with mass appeal that do not reject &quot;inwardness and erudition.&quot;The problem is the failure to apply Adorno's deep methodology. When he appeared in the 1920s in Weimar Germany, his colleagues were struck by the thoroughgoing influence of dialectical thinking on Adorno's details of thought and for better or worse, this makes a thinker unlikely to think in terms of a closure, which Witkin is seeking in raising the case of Woody Allen.Witkin fails both the appreciate Hegel, and read Variety: for in fact, ever since the 1980s, Allen's personal and professional reputation have been under continual attack beginning with accusations about his relationships with his step-daughter.The horror was based on the failure, of a large number of moviegoers, to connect with a Manhattan island of inwardness and erudition that was, in this period, diminishing both in Manhattan, and, at a rapid rate, elsewhere.During Reagan's presidency, universities in self-defense conducted a *kulturkampf* on universites, and inwardness and erudition, in the form of commodified education, the replacement of tenured faculty with adjunct faculty, and student moronization.The modal Allen clone became in this period a figure under increasing suspicion, and Allen himself expresses his rather bitter reaction to this in Deconstructing Harry.The dialectic was not suspended, and a frozen, hypostatized Adorno not counter-exampled and demolished by Allen's now very retro oeuvre. Instead the gradual brutalization of the Allen &quot;type&quot; becomes a confirmation of Adorno's critique and more interesting than old Woody Allen films.University faculty too often survive by pretending to celebrate liberation while in fact performing an older ideological function: thought control, and ensuring that things don't get outa hand. The reassurance, however, that popular culture is in any way a medium by means of which ordinary people can express their needs or find satisfaction is malarkey.The reassurance requires Witkin's nonsensical theory of transparency of communication (something predemolished by Adorno in The Jargon of Authenticity) in which the mechanisms of popular culture provide a way for fellow spirits to communicate in Buber's mode, and eliminates a &quot;third&quot; term consisting of a shared set of ideals, considered unnecessary and indeed Quixotic.The problem is that for Cervantes as for Adorno, humanity is the reverse of a brutalized, face-to-face, &quot;I and thou&quot; humanity which in fact is the face of one-on-one authority. Don Quixote was able to escape this exhausting struggle not by reification but by integrating an ontology into his praxis in a redemptory way..It is dehumanizing to so erase the possibility of shared ideals and Witkin fails to show how this creates anything but twilight struggle in the name of &quot;authenticity.&quot;As I write, abstract ideals labeled Quixotic a year ago are proving to have weight, like the physicist's light. The Bush administration finds itself today in front of an obsidian wall, carved with serpent shapes, expressing abstract Enlightenment ideals and although it may circumvent this barrier it will be perceived, world-wide, as untrue to its own professed ideals. This will have enormous consequences for the United States in the real world of economics and diplomacy.American media uses a jargon of authenticity and indeed, a debased, confrontational I and thou ethical style to REDUCE the hard work of arms inspectors to a series of completely misleading sound bytes. It is an anti-Quixote in that it refuses to test its results against any texts, whether chivalric novels or the Charter of the UN.In this context, we do not need to exorcise Adorno but instead to channel him."},{"Title":"Raising Faithful Kids in a Fast-Paced World","review":"What an inspiring book!

This book literally changed the way people thought about famines and hunger, according to Robert Solow. Human beings are deprived of food in many ways. Sen points out that food availability dedcline is only one possible cause of occurrence of a famine. Famines can occur even if the food output is sufficient in a region, for example in a situation when certain groups of people become richer and purchase more food leading to a steep rise in the prices, while the poor find the food increasingly unaffordable. Sen conceptualizes these issues in the framework of entitlement and ownership. Obviously, a person gets starved when his 'exchange entitlement set' is a null set, i.e., he owns nothing worth exchanging for bundles of food. A famine occurs when a large number of people in a country or a region suffer from such entitlement failures at a same time. In the second chapter, Sen discusses two alternative methods to measure poverty - the Income method and the Direct method. Both methods essentially represent two alternative conceptions of poverty analysis. The inequality approach to poverty is also found to be very common.Can poverty analysis be put into a policy framework? Sen answers this question in the negative pointing out its difficulties. Sen says that a policy definition is based on a fundamental confusion. But at the same time, Sen fails to answer the question of how then the problem can be solved. Famine Enquiry Commission of 1945 had argued that the famine was due to cyclones, floods, fungus diseases, loss of Burma rice, etc., etc. The essence of these theses was that the famine was mainly an outcome of a food shortage. Sen in his analysis of the famine contests this. Point by point, with the use of statistics on food production and other parameters, he states that although there was a decline in food output in Bengal in 1943, it cannot be accepted as a prime cause as there was a still higher decline in food output during 1941 which did not cause any famine. The per capita food availability in 1943 was also higher than that in 1941. The major cause of the famine was the inability of the British government to forecast the shortfall in food. Sen uses his own 'entitlement theory' to describe the famine. The major cause of the famine was shrinkage of the E-mappings for individuals resulting from spiraling food prices and the prevailing inequalities among the population. The situation was not different in the case of the Ethiopian famine of 1972-74. There also there was not any evidence of a major shortfall in the food output; in fact Sen argues that there was indeed a slight increase in the food output vis-&agrave;-vis the preceding years during the famine years. The overall consumption of food at the peak famine period was actually normal. But the purchasing power of the people was low resulting in inability to command food from outside. As in the Bengal famine, the highest casualities were among the agricultural workers. But in contrast with Bengal famine, the food prices rose only very little in Ethiopia and were not very different from those prevailing during the pre-drought periods. Sen explains this phenomenon by understanding it in terms of the entitlement failures of various sections of the Ethiopian population.The next case study is that of Sahel famine in Africa during 1968-73. This resulted in the decline of food availability that eventually led to the famine. An analysis of region wise food output revealed that in the regions where the output was low, the effect of the famine was actually lower comparatively. Firstly, it makes the farmer more dependent on the market forces for his basic food requirements. When one has an ability to command food in the market legally, then market approach may work.Sen's major argument in the whole book is that against the popular feeling that famines are caused only due to the decline in availability of food (the FAD approach). He puts in a number of arguments against it citing specific case studies of the above famines. Arnold (1988) pointed out that there were a number of famines in history which were actually caused by food output decline and thus to project entitlement as the major cause of famines was incorrect. Patnaik says that the entitlement approach, while rejecting the FAD theory, takes an unduly short run view of food availability. While agreeing that during famine periods food availability is a major issue, she argues that the long term trend in per capita food availability is also of utmost importance, which Sen does not consider in his entitlement approach. These trends could set the stage for famines even though famines do not thereby become inevitable. There are arguments following Devereux's words that one can not discuss famines without constantly taking into account the aggregate supply of food (Bowbrick, 1986). There are some other major authors also who have come out against the entitlement approach of Sen for that there is nothing 'new' in Sen's approach (Srinivasan, 1983; Mitra, 1982).Poverty and Famines have remained to haunt the dreams of many underdeveloped countries. The issues, as the book, still live on. As Castro lamented at Rome - &quot;The bells that are presently tolling for those starving to death everyday will tomorrow be tolling for all mankind if it did not want, or did not know, or if it could not be sufficiently wise, to save itself&quot;.ReferencesArnold, D., (1988) Famine: Social Crisis and Historical Change, Basil Blackwell, Oxford.

But poverty and starvation are better known than he is. Better still, the author is in full realisation of this fact. So, no self-elevating adjectives or poignant criticism can be found in the book. The book focuses on starvation in general and famines in particular. At the very outset, Amartya comes out to be a Keynesian in approach rather than a classicist. As his critics would put it - &quot;This paper is not concerned with long-term food policy&quot;. This is true to some extent but the author here is trying to fit in a jigsaw puzzle with two or more puzzles thrown in at once. The book can be further divided into three parts for reading purposes: * For layman [Chapter 1-5,10] * Case Studies [Chapter 6-9] * For the erudite economist [Appendix A-D] This is what sets the book apart - a simple treatment of such a complex subject! For an issue as basic as hunger, you do require a simple treatment that masses can understand and not only a Master at some reputed economic school. The first and second section can be read by anyone slightly concerned with the word - Poverty while appendices are for the more learned. Chapter I introduces the elementary concepts of his approach to starvation - &quot;The Entitlement Approach&quot;. He clearly distinguishes between the food availability and the relationships between a person and the food available. According to him, a person can get food to which he is legally or socially entitled. He can exchange his owned entitlements for other entitlements. Thus, even if plenty is available in author's words - &quot;Starvation is seen as the result of his inability to establish entitlement to enough food&quot;. The second and the third chapter deal with concept of poverty, its identification and aggregation. He presents various methods of poverty evaluation and a critique of each- 1. The most usual head count method (i.e. relative number of poor) 2. Biological and nutritional approach (i.e. minimum amount of nutrition required). The aggregation is dealt with by advocating the axiom of &quot;Ranked Relative Deprivation&quot;. This deals with the relative poverty amongst the 'poor'. Chapter III brings out the difference between starvation and famines. It sets a stage for discussion of famines in particular. He distinguishes both on - 1. Time Contrast (Long term and Short Term) 2. Group Contrast (Endemic and Specific Community) Chapter IV critically examines the entitlement approach with explanations of endowment and exchange. He examines the limitations of entitlement approach. The author seems to be very much aware of this e.g. '....some transfers that include violation of entitlement approach as looting'. The Case Studies cover the- * Bengal Famine of 1943 * Ethiopian famine of 1972-4 * Sahel Drought and Famine of 1968-73 * Famine of Bangladesh in 1974. The case studies chosen are of widely different nature and lend credit to his work. He goes about justifying the entitlement approach both in times of low food availability and adequate food availability. The Bengal famine case has been taken to illustrate the failure of FAD (Food Availability Decline). From the data of Famine Inquiry Commission of 1945, he proves that actually per capita availability rose about 9% form 1941-43. Since rural workers were as a community affected the most, exchange entitlement could have been a reason. The 'class-basis of destitution' further corroborates the food entitlement approach. The causes of sharp movements of exchange entitlements in this case can be briefed as- 1. Printing of currency leading to inflationary pressures 2. Speculation and Hoarding (A typical Keynesian!) 3. 'Indifferent' winter crop 4. Prohibition of cereal export 5. An uneven expansion of income and purchasing power 6. Impoverishment of groups not directly related to food production He further examines the bad policy of Bengal govt. at that time. The policy was largely FAD approach based and believed in merely creating supplies of food in the affected region, which, obviously, did not help much. The critics have strongly challenged the validity of Famine Commission report (Sen too is aware of that) and actually contend that crop availability was less than that reported (a large upward bias). This hits at the root of his analysis as he works on the initial analysis that there was actually a rise in food available. Also, the critics lay claim to inefficiency of PDS used to funnel the food into Bengal. To quote-&quot;...and what was put on the market vanished without a ripple&quot;. They further proved that the inflation was pretty much the same throughout India. So why this should have only hit Bengal. Sen has neglected the infrastructural breakdown. The Ethiopian Famine, again, according to him proved the validity of entitlement approach, as there was little price rise of commodities. But in Sahel famine decrease in food availability was the causal factor. Sen analysed region wise food output to declare that the effect of famine was actually lower in food deprived areas. The approach of Sen seems to be of a short-term nature but does, indeed, subtly propose a long-term vision too. The focus of govt. should not only be to concentrate on food availability but as Sen points out towards ensuring no sudden changes in exchange entitlements. He advocates govt. intervention in these situations (Keynesian approach!). The critics who oppose the above may please note that that at no time does he propose to completely eliminate the FAD approach. Rather, in opening lines of Chapter I he says- &quot;Starvation is characteristic of some people not having enough to eat. It is not the characteristic of there being not enough to eat. While the latter can be a cause of the former, it is but one of many possible causes&quot;. In conclusion, the book is a must read for everyone. This is a simply written book with lots of conviction and healthy refute of the theories he disposes of."},{"Title":"Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation","review":"A very persuasive acount of the famine problem is displayed by Nobel Laureate Dr. Sen.

Wake-Robin is the takealong guide for bird lovers who want to do more than just identify them by feather or call. This book (I have the old hardback) is one of my treasures. Kindle version is obviously easier to tuck into a pocket and take along."},{"Title":"Wake Robin","review":"\\"According to biographers at the American Memory project at the Library of Congress, John Burroughs was the most important practitioner after Thoreau of that especially American literary genre, the nature essay. By the turn of the century he had become a virtual cultural institution in his own right: the Grand Old Man of Nature at a time when the American romance with the idea of nature, and the American conservation movement, had come fully into their own.\\" (Wikipedia)Wake Robin is the first of Burroughs' published essays. The title is taken from the common name of the white trillium, which blooms just as migratory birds (including robins) show up in the northern states in the Spring. Burroughs is an ardent reporter of the natural world, and of songbirds in particular. His writing, however, is not that of the well-informed naturalist. Wake Robin reads more like a diary of his wanderings and his casual observations in the woods. Burroughs' reputation as a co-founder of the conservation movement is likely due more to the timing of his publications than on their content. In the modern era we look for more than the musings of an unstudied amateur when we wish to become better informed about the natural world.Clearly adapted from entries in his personal diary, Burroughs' writing is frequently self-conscious, detracting from his message. He labors at his craft, but when it works, it is very good. Speaking of the wood or bush sparrow, he says, \\"It was a perfect piece of wood music, and was, of course, all the more noticeable for being projected upon such a broad unoccupied page of silence.\\" Burroughs wrote just after the Civil War and he frequently references and credits Henry Thoreau, who wrote just before the Civil War. It is difficult not to compare the writings and observations of the two. In fact, Burroughs' writing suffers in the comparison.The early conservation movement needed a few articulate reporters, and Burroughs was ahead of his time in writing of his woodland meanderings. No one will be drawn to Burroughs for his craft at writing, but we should credit him with his inspiration, and appreciate Wake Robin for what it is, \\"an invitation to the study of ornithology.\\""},{"Title":"Lau V. Nichols: Bilingual Education in Public Schools (Landmark Supreme Court Cases)","review":"Lau V. Nichols was the case that granted rights to students whose first language is not English. This case was brought by the San Francisco parents of several Cantonese speaking children. Their contention was that because their children were not getting help with their English they could not effectively participate in the educational process. In some ways this case mirrors Brown V. Board of Education. In Brown the fight was over equal access and equal treatment. In Lau the judges finally ruled that equal treatment did not facilitate equal access and participation in the educational system. Today fedral law mandates that public school students who do not possess adequate English language skills receive ESL, English as a second language classes or ELL English language learning.

Baruch, which he published in 1957 at the age of 87, after a long career as a public servant following a couple decades of fortune-making on Wall Street. Baruch starts with histories of his parents and tales of his South Carolina childhood before his family moved to New York when he was 10, where his father, a physician, became a pioneer in public sanitation and physical therapy. Baruch got his big break on Wall Street in 1891 when he joined the firm of A. A. Houseman, where he would enjoy great success for over a decade. Although Baruch retired from Wall Street, gave up his seat on the Stock Exchange, and sold all of his stocks when President Woodrow Wilson appointed him to the War Industries Board in 1918, \\"My Own Story\\" is dominated by his days investing, making deals, and building companies before middle age. Baruch says next to nothing about his role on the War Industries Board or the Treaty of Versailles. He mentions his duties on the U.N.'s Atomic Energy Commission only in passing at the end of the book.Most of Baruch's experiences with the stock market are found in Chapters 7-14 and in Chapter 19, entitled \\"My Investment Philosophy\\", where he lays out his rules for speculating. Baruch's method was nearly identical to Gerald Loeb's, which Mr. Loeb articulated in his 1935 book \\"The Battle for Investment Survival\\". Both men were investors, not traders, who succeeded because they knew when to get out of the market. Chapter 12 is dedicated to the \\"Waldorf crowd\\", the glamorous and fabulously wealthy businessmen who frequented the Waldorf-Astoria. Baruch gives us his personal take on the extravagant \\"Diamond\\" Jim Brady, reserved and optimistic James R. Keene, and the boisterous \\"Bet a Million\\" John Gates. Baruch also discusses his involvement in founding and financing several ventures in raw materials after he retired from A.A. Houseman in 1904, among them the International Rubber Company, the Utah Copper Company (which invented strip-mining), and the Gulf Sulphur Company.The last few chapters of the book recall Baruch's adventures at his South Carolina estate Hobcaw Barony, where several presidents went for rest and relaxation, including Roosevelt during WWII. Baruch ends with some discussion of his political philosophy, which seems to have vacillated with the wind over the course of his lifetime. From anti-carpetbagger Southern Democrat to laissez-faire capitalist to Prohibition advocate to New Deal Democrat to Cold War crusader for high taxes and arms build-up. Yikes! Baruch seems like a generous man, but his politics are incoherent. His prose style is direct and clear, his tone always amiable. I think Baruch is at his best when discussing Wall Street's era of \\"unrestrained individualism\\", dominated by \\"the titans of finance at the zenith of their power\\", and contrasting it with today's more regulated and more diverse financial market. Too bad Bernard Baruch was always on the outs with J.P. Morgan. But he has interesting stories to tell about Morgan's contemporaries, including his own role in the panic of 1901, precipitated by a corner on Northern Pacific stock."},{"Title":"Baruch: My own story","review":"Though legislation and time changes, human minds and rules of the game dont. In this book, the great &quot;operator&quot; of the first half of the twentieth century (I really think only Jesse Livermore and Bernard Baruch deserve the honor) talked of his political views, family relationship, and most importantly to trader readers like me, a lot about his &quot;operation&quot;. Dont wanna be so hard sell here. However, if you like Reminiscences of a stock operator, you shouldnt miss this. In fact, there are many commonalities between the two, like their strong avoidance of tips and influence of &quot;insiders&quot;, searching and acting on facts and facts only, mass psychology as the dominant market driver, demand and supply as the ultimate axiom, extravagant hopes and talk of a &quot;New Era&quot; in advance of financial panics, the seeming almightiness of Morgan, the formation of a pool by a speculative crowd is a sign of weakness, etc etc.I am quite surprised to have found so few reviews here about this book relative to ROSO. Anyway, dont miss this.p.s. I would like to quote some paragraphs from the book for your reference.1. Page 105: Speculator comes from Latin speculari, which means to spy out and observe.... To be successful ....in all human affairs including the making of peace and war, three things are necessary. First, one must get the facts of a situation or problem. Second, one must form a judgement as to what those facts portend. Third, one must act in time before it is too late.2. Page 183: ...when money came into the hands of people too easily. Such money did not seem real. When men tossed around such huge sums in bets....they had lost all sense of value and of economics. No market in the hands of such people could be a stable or genuine one.....behind their bantering I sensed a feeling of insecurity, as if they were talking strong to cover up their own weaknesses.3. Page 184: To enjoy the advantages of a free market one must have both buyers and sellers, both bulls and bears. A market without bears would be like a nation without a free press. There would be no one to criticise and restrain the false optimism that always leads to disaster.4. Page 248: The true speculator is one who observes teh future and acts before it occurs. Like a surgeon he must be able to search through a mass of complex and contradictory details to the significant facts. Then still like the surgeon, he must be able to operate coldly, clearly and skillfully on the basis of the facts before him. What makes this tasks so difficult is that in the stock market the facts of any situation come to us through a curtain of human emotions....how to disentangle the cold, hard economic facts from the rather warm feelings of the people dealing with these facts.5. Page 318: This test of our ability to govern ourselves is really threefold. First, it is a test of values, of what things we will give up in order to make other things secure. Second, it is a test of our reasoning powers, of whether we have the wit to think our problems through to an effective solution. Third, it is a test of self discipline, of our ability to stand by our values and see our policies through, whatever the personal cost."},{"Title":"Baruch: My own story","review":"A great account of the life of one of the world's most famous investment speculators.

It was an autobiography on one of America's most successful political advisers and Wall Street Stockbrokers. Not only did Baruch share many life experiences, he also gave many words of wisdom that were very inspirational. I felt like I got to know Bernard Baruch and I now have a huge respect for the man he was. He truly cared about the United States and all of the people in it. He made his work personal. On page 85 he states that, &quot;Above all else...the stock market is people (that)...pit their conflicting judgments, their hopes and fears, strengths and weaknesses, greeds and ideals.&quot; Baruch was extremely wealthy as a stock broker, yet he knew life was more than money earned. &quot;....I realized how much there was could not be bought for money (178)&quot; He was also very generous with the money he made. His mother told him to &quot;do something for the Negro (289)&quot;, which he did. He donated money to help build a hospital but required that the hospital in South Carolina leave beds reserved for Negros. He also contributed money for college scholarships solely to African Americans. Overall this book showed me what a great man he was. It also gave many stories about his adventures has a stock broker and a political adviser under Woodrow Wilso and Franklin Roosevelt. Baruch found his passion in politics and economics. &quot;A skilled operator in any field acquires an almost instinctive 'feel' which enables him to sense many things even without being able to explain them.

Baruch, the Wall Street financier and advisor to Presidents Wilson through Truman, lived an amazing life. Unlike many autobiographies, which are written with an eye to aggrandizement, this one accurately portrays Baruch as a decent humanitarian that did not let his success and power go to his head. There are no intimations here (or elsewhere) that Baruch was dishonest or untrustworthy, and he served in many public service capacities without pay. Baruch writes about his friendships with guys like John \\"Bet a Million\\" Gates and \\"Diamond\\" Jim Brady.

Some say his novels are fun or youthful, which strikes me as another way of saying that he doesn't take a plot all that seriously. Jupiter Legacy (also irksomely published asPlague from SpaceandThe Jupiter Plague) is exactly as I thought it would be: a plot based on one man, a big problem with no regard to either the start or end of the novel. So, in this regard the novel could be said to have met my expectation and therefore give it 5-stars. And yet I was hoping for my preconceptions to be false and was met with a fairly cardboard-like novel, easily read in a few days without giving much thought to it.Rear cover synopsis: \\"The space probe returned carrying a cargo of writhing death! No form of life on Earth seemed safe from the savage epidemic brought back from a distant planet. Quickly and mysteriously it spread over the earth's surface, drawing its victims into a slow and violent death. If Earth was to escape annihilation, the horrible plague had to be stopped! But there was so little left to track down the cause of the Jupiter Legacy!\\"The line where it says, \\"Quickly and mysteriously it spread over the earth's surface, drawing its victims into a slow and violent death\\" is as faulty as the wiring in my condo. The plague was limited to New York and the area of New England rather than the entire earth's surface and the plague killed its victim rather quickly, within the day... nothing so slow or violent about a fever and some boils.One thing Harrison has down to an art (mmm, that's a bit of a stretch) is plot flow. It starts with a bang when Sam, our intern doctor and to-be heartthrob is raced to an accident involving a dismemberment and being raced back to the hospital to be warned of a pending danger of unknown proportions at the airport... which is where the behemoth spaceship has returned to Earth while crushing one plane and burning another to a cinder. Sam observes the astronaut descend from the ship and fall. Caring for him, Sam sees blisters around his face and neck with a fever of 105. Knowing he's near death, Sam and his love-interest-to-be (of course) give the man a notepad where he write something like \\"sick in ship.\\" I considered this a key in understanding WHAT was inside the ship and was especially interested when the police closed the ship off. In the end, the message played no importance and it was all fairly predictable.For some added flavor, Harrison has thrown in some medical terminology, which, as a fan of anatomy, I just love. Harrison also added some more ridiculous elements of extremely large handguns with calibers of .50 and 0.75 inches, which are ALL recoilless, the author must note. Other elements of science fiction include some ideas about traffic control, Mach 5 air transport and life on a Reef in Jupiter (?).If you're looking for a fast-paced requiring very little brain power and a few annoyance (i.e. the ending), then look no further than The Jupiter Legacy. Crichton'sThe Andromeda Strain, while different in format, was actually a better read. This book, however, is going back to the second-hand books store."},{"Title":"Storm Tide","review":"After a shaky bit of exposition, in which the author attempts to explain the protagonists'marital woes, this thriller shifts into high gear and never lets up until its explosive finale. Sean and Rob are lovers vacationing off the Australian coast who inadvertently run into drug smugglers and gun runners. They spend the remainder of the book trying to save their good-looking hides from sure extinction (or, in Rob's case, white slavery). Keegan has paired the boys off with a villian every bit as peripatetic and determined as The Terminator or Jason from the Friday the 13th series. Chandler is a study in sheer human relentlessness. A previous reviewer has cited as a fault the seeming lack of romantic conflict between Sean and Rob. I should say they've got conflict a-plenty! Besides, it is their steadfast, uncomplicated love which helps them survive a very dangerous situation. It also adds a note of sweetness to an otherwise very taut tale. I hope Mr. Keegan is plotting a sequel featuring Sean and Rob. Storm Tide is a hugely entertaining book. But be sure to take Drammamine first."},{"Title":"Storm Tide","review":"This has all the speed of EQUINOX with a sound modern day setting and another very sound relationship between two strong characters. Sean loses the plot at times, but Rob is very believable as the rookie trailing a far more dynamic partner through apparently endless trials and tribulations. Once started, the plot never slows up, which occasionally makes you wonder if the characters wouldn't just collapse from sheer exhaustion in the real world, but this is written in Keegan's usual, excellent and thoroughly absorbing style and keeps you involved with the characters and their partnership up to the very end. Keegan writes real relationships- not always perfect, not always steady, but based on two different people and an enduring love. Rob and Sean are understandable, from the start where they are trying to patch their faltering relationship to the end where Rob's insecurity comes far enough out for Sean to see it. How many writers can get inside people's heads like this? At times I wish the plot would step aside and let a little more of this wonderful detail too, but then this is a thriller. One of Keegan's best - I wish he'd write a few more in modern settings."},{"Title":"Storm Tide","review":"Mel Keegan has been best known for his gay sci-fi novels, but this is a change of scenery, setting a modern day thriller off the coast of South Australia. Our intrepid heroes, Sean and Rob, seem to have a knack of finding their way into trouble, when all they want to do is have sex. While not the most romantic pair ever to have graced the planet, they are the archtypical strong macho characters needed for this novel to be taken seriously by the reader. The descriptions of the trials caused by floods are excellent and gave it a really eerie atmosphere which would make a great movie. Its very difficult to put down, it really rattles along and reaches an acceptable, but a little bloody conclusion. Thoroughly enjoyed, and I'd really love Mr. keegan to produced some more homegrown stuff--as there really aren't too many others writing in a similar genre."},{"Title":"Storm Tide","review":"It's &quot;one damn thing after another&quot; (as Mark Twain used to say) for lovers Sean Brodie and Rob Markham when they try to salvage their foundering relationship with a fishing trip off the Australian coast, and run afoul of drug smugglers.Mel Keegan sets a killing pace and keeps it up to the explosive finish in this contemporary thriller. If the novel has a flaw it lies in the lack of conflict, the lack of romantic tension between Sean and Rob. They simply get along too well from the start. The only explanation offered for their previous trouble (and Sean's cheating) is that when Rob got a fulltime job he no longer had time to nurture the relationship. Huh?So maybe Keegan isn't one of the great romance writers of our generation. He still knows how to tell a cracking good story with enough action, thrills and suspense for a till-your-eyes-fall-out-of-your-head read"},{"Title":"A practical guide to small-scale goatkeeping","review":"Great little book that gets to the point about goat keeping for the small scale goat keeper.Many books overwhelm, this is straight forward and to the point, a nice read as well as aresourse book.

The lecturer/author starts in ancient times and progresses through to his own day. He quotes healers and doctors of the past frequently, and he gives lots of examples of how medicine and surgery were practiced. The last chapter is titled The Rise of Preventive Medicine and is about the relatively new concept of identifying the causes of disease and preventing the spread of diseases."},{"Title":"Evolution of modern medicine (Classics in medical literature)","review":"This now historical series of lectures, presented by the father of modern clinical medicine at the end of the 19th century is a nice summary of the evolution of modern medicine, beginning before the Greeks. Some will find the style \\"stuffy\\", but it is appropriate to the time of its presentation and gives a good insight into the evolution of modern medicine as well as the talents of its author, William Osler."},{"Title":"Medieval English Literature (College)","review":"Dr. Garbaty's light touch as an editor coupled with the wonderfully helpful additional material helps open modern readers to another world. The depth and breadth of the collection shows just how much more there was in Medieval times than just Chaucer (as great as he was). A must have for any student, professional or amateur, of the English language."},{"Title":"Medieval English Literature (College)","review":"I haven't read this book yet, but I studied at U. of Michigan and Thomas Garbaty was one of the most exciting and beloved professors in the English Department. I ended up studying whatever he was teaching, whether or not the subject matter was directly related to my major, just because I knew it would be fascinating."},{"Title":"Changing Ourselves, Changing the World","review":"If you are deeply concerned with global issues, maybe feeling powerless or hopeless in face of them, and despite this you are looking for a way to contribute to changing the world 'Changing Ourselves, Changing the World' may interest you. Gary Reiss is a natural story teller who weaves together his own life experiences together with the theory and skills of Process Oriented Psychology as developed by Dr Arnold Mindell and his colleagues, giving us a book which offers practical solutions in a troubled world. The book rides upon the premise that world issues is reflected in our own psychology and in the dynamics and experiences of small towns and communities in which many of us live. The reader is given valuable insights into how it may be possible to work with an array of problems which afflict most small communities, such as; suicide, drug and alcohol abuse, relationship problems, feeling issues of anger and violence; and racism. Gary pays homage to the discovery of meaning behind even the most complex or difficult conflicts, and complements the theory with frequent examples of his own work in his own home town. The idea is that the small town is a microcosm of the wider world, and change effected at the local level will naturally contribute it's effect to world as a whole. 'Changing Ourselves' also implicitly addresses another important level of changing the world, our ability to work on ourselves and develop our awareness personally and in relationships. Many books on sustainability leave out this most important aspect, that facilitators of change need to model and reflect the changes they wish to see in the world at large. This book has something for everybody. Most readers will find large portions of the book speaking to their own life experience. But in particular I would recommend this book to; Therapists; Group Facilitators; Political Activists; Social Workers and other Professionals; and people in small towns and communities interested in how they can work locally for global effect. Students of Process Oriented Psychology will also find this book has plentiful examples, less available elsewhere, of the broad application of process work skills and theory in both private practice and small town meetings, although this is not a book for in depth Process Work theory. A great introduction to and overview of Process Work in practice 'Changing Ourselves' engenders hope when hopelessness abounds."},{"Title":"Changing Ourselves, Changing the World","review":"We've all seen it, especially in the last 6 months. It sometimes seems like the world is crashing down around us. How can we strive to be good people in such a hostile environment? Changing Ourselves, Changing the World is a guide to remaining spiritual while surrounded by chaos. Why is there accelerated violence, drug and sexual abuse? Our children are angry, our marriages are challenging, and we are all looking for a way to achieve balance in life. This book will help you through the tensions we face every day, and help you learn to establish freedom at least in your internal world. Gary Reiss is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, and has written this great book to help us understand the stress we feel in our lives, jobs, homes, and in ourselves. Changing Ourselves, Changing the World is a release from New Falcon Publications."},{"Title":"Control Diabetes the Easy Way : Counting Carbohydrates","review":"Finally! Someone has told us how to manage our diabetes without going crazy. This unassuming book packs a dynamite amount of information. I finally understand what to do and how to do it while making meals for my family that I can eat too. No complicated formulas or shopping lists.

Thank you authors!"},{"Title":"Control Diabetes the Easy Way : Counting Carbohydrates","review":"This book was given to me by a friend and I just have to say that I love it! Never have I seen the explanations for what to do, to get my diabetes under control, made clearer. They have the meal plans, carb counting made so easy, and I could adapt it to my everyday living. Grocery shopping was a breeze. I had the plan in my head and I didn't have to buy special foods! If I had known about how to do this a long time ago, I would have been a lot healthier."},{"Title":"Control Diabetes the Easy Way : Counting Carbohydrates","review":"This book doesn't beat around the bush.

Sure it tells you how to count carbs, but it doesn't say what you can do with that knowledge."},{"Title":"Go for It, Marmaduke","review":"&quot;Go For It, Marmaduke&quot; is the quintessential Marmaduke collection. Within these pages, M'duke finds the voice for which he has become famous the world over. All of the great themes are here: being in the wrong chair, eating people-food, even angering the neighbors!Those who madly claim Anderson didn't nail down his comic canine until &quot;Hams it Up&quot; (1988) need to read this book right now. And then they need to have their heads examined.&quot;Go For It, Marmaduke&quot; is hilarious, sometimes painfully true and, most importantly, good reading. The fact that it is (temporarily) out of print is a badge of shame for the publishing community."},{"Title":"Go for It, Marmaduke","review":"Anyone who claims that this is one of Andersons stronger 'Duke tomes is hardly a Marmaduke fan at all. This book was written during what I consider a very week period in the history of the strip. Rather than the witty social commentary that Marmaduke was (and would be) known for, this book focuses mainly on such hackneyed comic devices as attempting to bury bones in the couch, waking Phil up early in the morning to go for a walk, and avoiding the dog catcher. I recommend any books from the early 80's (or the the late 90's revival) for a true taste of Brad Andersonion genius."},{"Title":"Go for It, Marmaduke","review":"\\"Go For It, Marmaduke\\" worked on a lot of levels for me. But am I the only one who has noticed the changes in the character of \\"Phil\\"?One the positive side of the ledger, the artwork was some of Anderson's best. In many of the cartoons, I could guess what the written caption would be, just by looking at Marmaduke's expression. It was almost as if I'd seen the exact same cartoon before!Similary, I enjoyed the way that Anderson had made Marmaduke's interactions with other canines a little more \\"adult\\" (if one can use that work in referring to a dog). No longer does Marmaduke meet a cute poodle or Pomeranian, and signal his affection by slobbering on her. Now, Marmaduke backs off a little, and, through his eyes, we can finally see vulnerabilty, a vulnerabilty surprising, but all the more heart-warming, in dog that must weigh 350 lbs. or more.But where Anderson failed was in the portrayal of Phil, Marmaduke's once hapless, long-suffering, but ultimately loyal, \\"owner\\". Over the years, I have watched, with mounting alarm, the shortening of Phil's mustache, until it has reached the point where it is uncomfortably similar to that of Germany's Fuehrer in the 1930-40s. In the same vein, Phil's increasingly totalitarian treatment of Marmaduke (and his own human family) causes me to wonder exactly what Anderson is doing here.The next time Marmaduke misbehaves, will he be sent to a punishment K-9 battalion serving on the Eastern Front? Will Phil's kids soon be drafted into the Army, to be little more than cannon fodder against the rapidly advancing Allied armies? And will Phil himself soon be portrayed in uniform, living in a concrete-reinfored basement 30 feet below Marmaduke's dog house, muttering to himself about victories lost, and the betrayal of those to whom he was closest?No, Mr. Anderson, we do not need to relive your destructive fantasies here. Give us back our old Phil, he of the good-old-days of shoveling snow off the top of Marmaduke's dog house, cooking for Marmaduke a secretive rasher of bacon, and shopping for doggie treats at the local K-Mart. Please Mr. Anderson, bring Phil back!"},{"Title":"Go for It, Marmaduke","review":"This Book was dumb. I give it just the one star because the cover was kind of cool. Otherwise it gets ZERO STARS. Marmaduke is too big to be a real dog. And I hate the way he looks.

Unfortunately, the book disintegrated before the second of our two children arrived, and we wanted to replace it. Being that the book was out of print, we weren't sure we'd be able to locate a copy, but Amazon.com didn't let us down! We purchased a used copy, and received it in a timely fashion. The book was just as we remembered--almost. There seemed to be an additional section at the end. The additional ending, however, did nothing to mar the childlike memory of the original story/song."},{"Title":"People in My Family (Golden Shape Book)","review":"The Sesame Street, People in My Family, A golden Shape Book, is great for toddlers. The text counts up to five three times, first with family members, then with monsters(the Sesame Street kind), and then with fingers on each hand. There are lots of things to count in the pictures too, balloons, hats, spools of ribbon and more."},{"Title":"In the Blood","review":"This is an absolutely roaring high-paced page turner with the one and only Sonja Blue! Sonja is a vampire for the feminist within any female reader. This is no sultry seduction-artist kind of babe vampire; she's badder than bad, tough as nails mentally and physically, and yet has an admirable code of personal honor at her core.I first met Sonja in &quot;Sunglasses After Dark&quot;, which is excellent. &quot;In the Blood&quot; is even better! Vampire and private eye team up when Sonja meets Palmer, a P.I. with &quot;the sight&quot;. Love and partnership build, blossom, and morph into various flavors as the action relentlessly continues. With Palmers help, Sonja continues her hunt for her roots - the vampire who callously created her, and her human parents as well.A great vampire book, with a flavor all its own."},{"Title":"In the Blood","review":"The chemistry behind the two main characters Palmer and Sonja Blue is incredible. Both characters help each other get through their personal pain while going on a joyride through hell and back. This book is definitely a page turner for Sonja Blue fans."},{"Title":"In the Blood","review":"Supernatural team-up.When you have a psychic detective vampire slayer, what else would happen?

The dialogue is sometimes awkward, too. A disappointment after Sunglasses After Dark."},{"Title":"The Dark Remains (The Last Rune, Book 3)","review":"This book took me a while to get into. It had been a while since I read the other two books in the series, so I had to re-figure out all the characters. I like the variety of characters in the book. Each new character adds something to the mix. However, some characters are ignored after the first section, which is odd--because they could figure into the rest of the book.Some of the very enjoyable characters in this book are Marji, Mitchell & Davis (the cowboys), Ellie (the chimp), Glinda, and the fairy. The usual characters are still interesting, but I felt like the whole \\"who does he really love\\" thing was getting old after a while.All the characters come to face their greatest fears. Grace finds out who her parents really are (now THAT'S a plot twist I didn't see coming). Travis still has to figure out where he belongs, but at least he is not as wimpy in this book as in others. Aryn has many things to figure out in this book, and it isn't quite known if she does figure them out.This book is about defeating evil, in its many forms. Duratek and the Seekers play prominently in this book. Some interesting clues are given throughout the book to lead readers to other things. I call this book a placeholder because while it does advance the series, it still seems that there is something larger on the horizon, and this is just a prelude.I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Dark Remains (The Last Rune, Book 3)","review":"I guess I'm one of the few people who is enjoying this series more with each book. I liked this book just as much as the first two. I like the fact that the author is able to juggle a number of subplots and keep them all interesting, whether they're occurring on Earth involving the Seekers and Duratek, or on the alternate world named Eldh involving gods, myths and magic.I have no problem with the increasing number of characters in the book, in fact I think it adds to the story since each character brings something unique into the mix. Mr. Anthony has managed to give us some essential scenes with each of the characters, revealing some of their motivations and secrets, making them that much more real. All are essential to the plot. It's interesting to see how the friendships are growing and the romantic interests are weaving together. In each book, the characters have been evolving and deepening. Some reviewers seem to have a problem with the way some of the relationships appear to be developing, but to me, the characters have become so familiar and so real that their yearnings and growing awareness are all the more poignant. How can you not wish them well?In this third book of the series, Travis and Grace return to Earth to seek medical care for the gravely wounded knight, Beltan. However, while there, the evil Duratek Corporation (who are planning to rape the ecological resources of the world Eldh) have managed to locate them due to the betrayal of a friend, have captured Beltan, and plan to conduct medical experiments on him. Travis and Grace are forced to turn to the Seekers for assistance. Meanwhile, back on Eldh, Melia, Falken and the others travel to the fabled city of Tarras to find out who is killing the New Gods. Grace and Travis are finally forced to come to terms with the shadows of their pasts that have haunted them all of their lives. This, of course, is a great simplification of the plot, which has many more twists and turns, trials and tribulations. It is a fast-moving, interesting, and enjoyable story, and I for one am looking forward to Book Four."},{"Title":"The Dark Remains (The Last Rune, Book 3)","review":"Once again Anthony had me spellbound with story-telling ability!

Meanwhile on Eldh Baroness Aryn and her witch friend Lirith aid the goddess Melia and immortal bard Falken stop a powerful evil that is killing gods!Anthony's world-building skills get better in each installment of his series.He is able to bring more focus to his world of Eldh and it's history and mythology.He also knows how add more interesting characters such as Marji, a kind-hearted transvetite and lethal lady assasin,Vani a woman so tough she could give Xena a run for her money!Anthony also knows how combines chills with his thrills with descriptions of unrelenting evil as deadly golden spiders who bite kills in seconds and some terrifying ape-like monsters terrorizing our heroes on both worlds! Anthony also puts a little X-file type conspiracy with this one with it's sinister corporation,Duratek and the mysterious group called Seekers.But a word of warning to everyone: this novel does end with a cliffhanger other than that your hands will be glued to the pages of gripping fantasy novel with it's memorable cast of characters, chilling scenes of evil and nearly nonstop action and suspense!"},{"Title":"The Dark Remains (The Last Rune, Book 3)","review":"I love this whole series. One of my favorites. I find the characters engaging. I can't put these books down."},{"Title":"The Dark Remains (The Last Rune, Book 3)","review":"I cannot understand the magic in The Last Rune series, with the blood, and runes and gates and Weirding. I was completely confused by the gate magic in this book. But you get the feeling that it's all going to come together in the end. It is quite depressing to have a likable character imprisoned in a lab, and being experimented on, but you have to admit, this makes a fairly routine fantasy a little different. There are far too many subplots, and the core group of characters--Travis, Grace, Beltan, Durge and Arya--needs to come together soon. The book uses too much of one my least favorite fantasy-epic devices: Having different characters doing things in different locations. How are these events related? It's all going to come together, in the end, but Mr. Anthony best not drag this series out, the way Bob Jordan did with the monstrous Wheel of Time. He needs to refocus, in the next book."},{"Title":"The Dark Remains (The Last Rune, Book 3)","review":"Mark Anthony continues to meld the world of Eldh (and for that matter, the world of Earth) into a more elaborate and rich place. Symbols, myths, science, rituals, strong characters, rich detail, consistency, and even noble drag queens all are woven into a rich pattern without a tangle in sight! &quot;Blood of Mystery&quot; cannot come out soon enough to please me. Bravo."},{"Title":"The Dark Remains (The Last Rune, Book 3)","review":"Why is it that every new installation in this series not only introduces new characters but also new plot twists?It seems that Mark Anthony is making up the story as he goes along. There are no frameworks, no build up, things just &quot;happen&quot; and there are no explanations... The first book in the series could have been forgiven as the first attempt but the rest?

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel."},{"Title":"Menstruation: A Novel (Saqi Books)","review":"The story is overly unadorned and intellectually unchallenging. The description, if at all, of the characters is poor and insufficient. One finishes reading the book wondering, how do these persons look like, dress, and move or behave? The emphasis is on Hasan's ability to smell menstruating women, and indeed, there is a portrayal of different instances where Hasan experiences such episodes. However, the author does not at all depict the actual sense of this smell or its aesthesis on the main character of the novel. Thus, the reader cannot share, appreciate and evaluate Hasan's experience, as well as the resulting feelings, reactions and stance that this occurrence entails. It is more than obvious that English is not the author's first language. The sense emanating from the whole writing is that the author translates into English, words and phrases from his native language. Consequently, the end - product is hard to read and follow smoothly and effortlessly. The final point concerns the excessive use of the word \\"damn\\", in the writing. This hyperbole adds nothing to the story or to the understanding of the characters' psychosynthesis, which the reader tries so hard to capture and comprehend, but due to the limitations of exposition, that is an impossible task to accomplish. The book is a disappointment and definitely not recommended, although one cannot ignore the fact that it is the author's first published novel."},{"Title":"Menstruation: A Novel (Saqi Books)","review":"Ammar abdulhamid attempts to demonstrate how the culture of Islam in Syria is sexually and morally repressive. Through the use of a few simple character narrations, he tells the story of two people raised under the umbrella of Islam and who can find no way to escape from a place of emotional suppression, sexual frustration and fear of physical danger for speaking out. Accompanying these two characters are two saviors - a married couple who have been westernly educated by returned to Syrian to decry the intellectual death they find there.While I would not suggest this book for a fun read, the author is talented and gets his point across clearly and with style."},{"Title":"Menstruation: A Novel (Saqi Books)","review":"We do not remember our histories or our lives by those dull periods of conscious stasis; rather, we look upon those pivotal moments where our world-views are shaken, our emotions in shambles, and our futures unpredictable, as being the ones most important to defining ourselves. If it is indeed those moments of change that capture the essence of the human condition and define the individual, then Ammar Abdulhamid's taboo challenging Menstruation is about them; it is a novel about epiphanies. Menstruation is a ground-breaking novel, if not in its conclusion about the universality of the \\"Religion of Love,\\" then in its noteworthy perspective from that of a former Muslim raised in Syria.Not shy with his subject matter, Abdulhamid does not hesitate to introduce the controversial subject matter of his book at the outset. The central character in the novel, Hasan, has refined his ability to identify menstruating women after years of scavenging through trash dumps for used tampons and developing a complicated classification system by odor and color. A peculiar admixture of revulsion and comedy, Hasan's sixth sense has a cleansing effect on the reader's mind, allowing for the complete absorption of other more pertinent issues presented in the text. Hasan's fetish for menstruation, which originates in his faulty belief that the fetus is nurtured upon blood in the womb, is later explained in one of the many interstitial narratives as being a symbolic purge in the human body; and, just as this purge occurs physiologically, it occurs also as \\"intellectual\\" and \\"spiritual menstruation.\\" We are reminded, though, that despite the unsavory image of the menstrual cycle, that it \\"also denotes an ability to to bring forth a new life in this world\\"--whether it be intellectual, spiritual, or physical. These cycles, then, are the opportunities at which the personal epiphany manifests itself.A recurring theme throughout the novel is that of the characters' sexual exploits. We become intimate with Wisam, an unsatisfied married woman who wants love-not-sex from her begrudging husband, and her adventures into lesbianism and infidelity. The brutal and dehumanizing nature of the sex Wisam has with her husband contrasted with the orgasmic and convivial encounters she has with Batul and Fatin, two other women, demands that the definition of \\"love\\" and its relationship with social norms be challenged. Indeed, these encounters and the many others throughout the book do serve a higher intellectual purpose besides being provocative as explained in the unpublished final chapter of the book. At the same time, they also affect Wisam personally. \\"Nice people can't be devils regardless of certain acts of theirs,\\" she repeats to herself as she makes love to Fatin. \\"How can a sin feel so right?\\" How is it that sex with her husband was okay but wholly unsatisfying and somewhat torturous, while this supposedly insidious encounter fulfilled her needs physically and emotionally?While Wisam never formally rejects her faith in Islam despite such heretical questions, other characters like Hasan, Batul, and Fatin do take this step, though not publicly at first. Batul, another married woman, openly states that she does not believe and intends to leave everything behind when the opportunity presents itself--Fatin, on the other hand, is a brave sixteen year-old veil-wearing teenager who revels in privately mocking the other women that attend religious study sessions with her. She is in a similar social situation as Hasan who, as the son of an acclaimed imam, is forced to be quiet in his new beliefs until he can establish his own financial independence from his father. Despite this apparent duplicity, there is nothing malicious about Hasan and Fatin's move towards intellectual freedom. Hasan, for example, authentically strives to reconcile his doubts by consulting his religious sister-in-law. Nevertheless, during this coming-of-age he comes to the conclusion that \\"the more in need of faith [he] grow[s], the less capable of faith [he] become[s].\\" Together, Hasan and Fatin illustrate another pressure of modern Syrian society: that, despite the supposedly secular nature of the ruling authoritarian regime, pressures against religious freedom continue to exist within society, manifesting themselves in the pragmatic considerations one must take regarding familial, fraternal, and financial relations.A review of Menstruation would be incomplete without noting the unique and innovative narrative style that Abdulhamid adopts. Chapters are organized by the perspective of one or more of the characters, and are further subdivided and classified according to function: innermost thoughts, for example, are separated from the narration of events. This organization allows us to witness the secretive natural thoughts that oft occur but are rarely shared, given the superstitious nature in which we understand them. According to the Qur'an, for example, such thoughts should prompt the recitation of certain incantations against \\"the evil whisperer... who whispers in the breasts of mankind.\\" Nevertheless, because of Abdulhamid's approach, we are completely aware of Hasan's lust for his sister-in-law and his heretical thoughts regarding religion.More importantly, though, this organization allows for the easy introduction of a number of characters, many of whom never meet each other during the story. It is through this technique that we are allowed to be acquainted with the brilliant academic work of married couple Nadim Qanawati and Kindah Kayali, who function in the novel as the intellectual 'mentors' of other characters, and whose moral clarity serves as the basis of the novel's narrative framework. Indeed, it is through Nadim and Kindah that we understand the threatening position Hasan and others are in--under the former's guidance, Hasan and others participate in a secretive club for like-minded individuals. Nadim, who could very well be an older and more mature version of Hasan, writes of this secrecy with disgust and horror:\\"You could be the greatest killer of all time, the hungriest of all known assassins, the most infamous shedder of blood, human blood, in all of our glorious history, still, you will never be able to stir up, to tap into, as much feeling of hatred in people's souls as can a simple, but earnest, jotter of words. We, the thinkers of the world, are forever an accursed and undesired breed.\\"Ultimately, Nadim and Kindah's message is one of self-empowerment and individualism: as Nadim explains whilst between the bed-sheets with Kindah, \\"I am my own messiah, you are your own messiah, everybody is his own messiah.\\" The importance of Nadim and Kindah to the meaning of the novel cannot be overestimated, and yet I cannot elaborate thoroughly on it without risking a \\"spoiler\\" about too much of the novel's content or its conclusion. I am also unable to touch on a number of other themes expressed in the novel, such as the importance of the heretic to human progress, the threat to the heretic from all parties (from the CIA to the Islamists to the Syrian government, as Nadim explains), and the status of women, among others. Thus, I will leave those tasks to the reader who makes his way through the pages of this book."},{"Title":"A Historical Guide to Langston Hughes (Historical Guides to American Authors)","review":"I really love it, it's clear and very accurate. Style is not boring. It's been very helpful for my thesis!"},{"Title":"Ramblings From Rocco: Hockey, Radio, Life, and Our Urban Environment","review":"I don't normally write reviews on here, but I thought that the last one was a little too harsh. There were a few typos in the book, yes, but the sentences were not necessarily run-ons. They were just more complex than I ever expected from the author.This is not a masterpiece, but if you are a Tickethead, I suggest it. It gives a good behind the scenes look at the station and what happened when Rocco was let go. The urban and suburban stuff, while often rhetoric, is substantive and will either make you mad or grin in agreement. It is incoherent, but Rocco points that out himself. He apparently is going to offer a more focused book someday. Anyhow, I recommend it. And Rocco, I am glad you are doing well. You have kept enough of your abrasiveness to stay edgy, but lost enough of it to be entertaining and more than tolerable."},{"Title":"Ramblings From Rocco: Hockey, Radio, Life, and Our Urban Environment","review":"Rocco got fired from the ticket and basically lost his mind.This guy used to hack me off when he was on the radio, now I can hack him off....Hey Rocco, I live in a gated community and drive a Hummer. Oh, and I stole your book."},{"Title":"Ramblings From Rocco: Hockey, Radio, Life, and Our Urban Environment","review":"One chapter isn't bad reading, if you're a Tickethead. The hockey stories are pretty interesting, also. Unfortunately, his ramblings about the environment are an all-too-painful reminder of the cluelessness that made his Dallas radio show unlistenable. Making a long story short, the village idiot may have grown up, but he didn't get any smarter."},{"Title":"Ramblings From Rocco: Hockey, Radio, Life, and Our Urban Environment","review":"I don't think anyone edited this book. After getting through all the misspelled words and run-on sentences, I was convinced that I had died and gone to reading hell. These weren't ramblings; these were incoherent thoughts and meaningless stories that were pretty unrelated. The only saving grace is that this guy's wheels are so far off, that you can't help but laugh at him."},{"Title":"The Grand Sophy","review":"The Grand Sophy is another wonderful Regency from Georgette Heyer - a book to enjoy again and again.Sophy Stanton-Lacy has been brought up by her diplomat father, Sir Horace, in continental Europe. However, Sir Horace is travelling to South America and so he arranges for Sophy to stay with his sister, Lady Ombersley, in London. His sister agrees to look after his \\"little\\" Sophy who is sweet and good and kind.As soon as Sophy arrives there is mayhem. She's not \\"little\\" at all but a tall lady with a dog and a monkey and her own ideas about how to behave. She arrives in the Ombersley household like a whirlwind - and proceeds to turn their ordered and dull lives upside down. The eldest son, Charles Rivenhall, is running the house (his father is a hopeless gambler) with an iron fist and a lack of humour and Charles' betrothed, Miss Wraxton, keeps poking her nose into the younger Rivenhalls' business; Cecilia Rivenhall, surrounded by suitors, looks to be choosing the wrong one; Hubert, up at Oxford, is getting himself into serious trouble with gambling and poor young Amabel comes down with a serious illness. Sophie inserts herself into these situations, bringing them all to positive resolutions and along the way bringing Charles Rivenhall to many occasions where he completely loses his temper.As with all other Heyer books the writing is masterful, the situations well-plotted and the characters just brilliant, even the minor ones. I loved the way that Lord Charlbury is scolded by Sophy for his ill-judged catching of mumps, and how Sophy manages to goad Charles into firing her pistol inside the house. The events all work up to the final scene at Lacy Manor, Sophy's father's house in Sussex, where two inappropriate engagements are broken, Sophy shoots a man in the arm and a lot of ducklings get involved. It's a brilliant read, of course, and although one that I didn't initially enjoy as much as others it has grown on me massively and I often turn to it for a re-read. If you liked Cotillion you'll enjoy this one, and if you like a good read you will certainly love The Grand Sophy."},{"Title":"No Direction Home","review":"An inside page of this book has a quote from Ursula K. LeGuin stating Norman Spinrad is one of the best SF short story writers, if not THE best.I don't see how any one could disagree with that statement. Spinrad can tackle \\"serious\\" themes but also write stories that are hilarious. And he does both without losing the incredible sense of wonder that drew many people, including me, to the science fiction field. There is no better collection of short stories in the sf fiction than this book, except maybe Spinrad's other short story collection.\\"No Direction Home\\" and \\"The Big Flash\\" are incredibly powerful stories. And I don't understand how \\"The Lost Continent\\" did not win a Hugo and Nebula. In fact, it is appalling that Spinrad never won a Nebula. (Writers do have blind spots. The great mystery writer Ross MacDonald never won a Edgar for any of his books...I don't think. His classic novel \\"The Chill\\" lost to a forgettable mystery. Nebula voters gave an award to the atrocious \\"Behold the Man.\\")\\"A Thing of Beauty\\" and \\"The National Pastime' are wry and incredibly amusing stories. The collection shows the vastness ofSpinrad's imagination and his talent. In the category of short stories, I don't think anyone in the sf field could match Spinrad. Get this book. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Camino de luz","review":"Sencillo y escrito con claridad. Me encant&oacute; su lectura.

This is not a picture book (although it contains plenty of pictoral material) - rather, it is a resource book for those truely interested in learning the meaning and history behind the pattern, its variances, nuances, etc. It will not list prices and give you dates of pieces you may have, but will give you all the insight you need in order to make informed purchases of Willow-ware pieces for your collection. The author possesses a unique and entertaining writing style that true willow-lovers and avid readers will appreciate. I highly recommend this book for educating yourself, as well as for your reference library."},{"Title":"Willow!: Solving the Mystery of Our 200-Year Love Affair With the Willow Pattern","review":"I enjoyed the book, because it was a willow book, however it is very hard to read. I found myself skimming it, disappointed there were so many black and white photos. Very wordy, with little substance, if you are looking for a book to increase your knowledge in collecting, this isn't the book. It is the book, though, to add to your collection if you just want more willow &quot;stuff&quot;. New collectors, stick with the tried and true Gaston book. No value to me, just his research, which I'm sure may be valuable to some. But...to each his own....enjoy!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"This book is exactly what I had hoped it would be...a man capturing his memories and adventures from his walk across america (partial walk). I loved hearing about the different characters he came across and the generosity of the people. For those of you that have done some traveling through our great country, I am sure you have experienced some of the same. Peter Jenkins is not a professional writer and never professed to be...he is just sharing his experiences and I am grateful that he did."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I am 39 years old. I first discovered this book when I was 15; it was required reading for 10th grade. I loved it and even cried in one part. Since then I think I have read it 3 more times. I read the second part (Walk West), Walk Across China, and Close Friends. My parents both read his books and enjoyed them as well. I grew attached to his wife in the book, so when I heard they got a divorce I was too upset to read anything of his for awhile, but I do plan to read the rest of the books he wrote on traveling, as I assume I should \\"get over it\\".I have never gotten the opportunity to travel much in life, but whenever I read one of Peter's books I feel like I am on a journey. I used to think if I were to go anywhere I would want to go to Europe or someplace glamorous, but he made ordinary places, like the south and small towns seem like the most exciting places I could ever go to...not because of what I could see or what I would do...but becuase of the people and the stories they could tell. He made me want to listen."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I enjoyed the pictures as much as the story. Some of the story I was just incredibly impressed with but he admits that he didn't take notes on his journey and depended greatly on his memory. I was left wondering how much he got correct in the recalling. It is a true story and it shows some of the better parts of American life. It was heartwarming and wonderful in a lot of ways, but being true it does have heart ache and disappointment but the author doesn't focus on these. It's a good read."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I read this book years ago after I returned from a similar trip. I was in my early 20s and disillusioned with what life had to offer. I didn't make my trip by foot and I didn't have a dog but I did find out a lot about myself and answer many questions. For anyone that has ever searched for deeper meaning in life or is searching now this book is a wonderful companion. You will feel like a close friend of Peter's once you finish reading this book.I noticed some very negative reviews and I believe those are from folks that hate Christianity or religious books. I still found the book to be an instant classic and a true representation of America. The personal struggles of Jenkins were the same the entire nation experienced. He found answers and comfort in God. For those that reject this they still can relate in whatever answers they find in their search for meaning."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I first read this book in high school in the early 1980's. At that time, I felt secure in the 'faith' of the religion I'd been taught and found Mr. Jenkins' lack of faith really odd and confusing.However, here I am a middle aged person and finding myself with the same ambiguity about faith in God or in America. While reading the text again didn't necessarily answer my own quandaries about faith, it does make me wish I had the ability to walk across America and find myself as he did. There are amazing stories and amazing people all over the planet, and is someone could take a truly accurate poll, I believe we'd find that there is much more good than bad on our planet.I suspect Mr. Jenkins would agree."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I remember first reading this book as part of a school assignment as a junior in high school. At the time I thought not that much of it. But once I bought the book and started to read it, I could not put it down. It was a well written book and Mr. Jenkins writes in a way that you, the reader, are right there walking beside him and Cooper and sharing thoughts and experiences."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Good travel adventure book. Jenkins walked from Alfred,NY to New Orleans. Jenkins met the common American people that make this country great. Jenkins teach the reader all he learn from his walk. I read this book because of a college assignment. Jenkins is one of the best current American writers. I recommend you to read it."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I paged through this book before I read it, and fell in love with the pictures first. Then when I started to read it, I could not put it down! Mr. Jenkins is a fabulous storyteller, and takes you from one adventure to the next with such ease. I found myself seeing America with his words, not just his pictures. I was genuinely moved by his experiences, and I am thankful that he decided to share them with everyone."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"When I began to read this book I first thought that I would be reading a book similar to a book about the Appalachain Trail or a Wilderness book. Although he writes about some of his expierence walking in the wilderness he mostly writes about the people he meets and the life lessons he learns.I was shocked at the end when he finished the book in New Orleans but he writes that he will continue his walk Westward across America and then write about it.If you are expecting a book about being out in the Wilderness this is not it, but if you want to read about a guys stories about his hike from NY to New Orleans with his best pal as a dog I suggest this."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"This book is wonderful. Before I read this book, I did not appreciate America at all. I thought that the United States was made up of a lot of terrible people. I also for some reason feared the southern states of America, because I have always been tauught that the south is old-fashioned and prejudice. After reading the book A Walk Across America, my views of America has changed. While reading this book, I learned right along with Peter how great our country truly is. I also learned that America is really made up of a lot of amazing, caring, and giving people. I reccomend this book for anyone who feels that America is a terrible place. After reading this book, I will guarantee you that your views of America will change from negative to positive."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I didn't give this as high of marks as some as I felt it lacked something. Certainly, it was interesting to read about Peter's journey on foot with his dog, Cooper. However, I wanted more connectedness in his description in his relationship with his dog and those he encountered on his journey.I found myself skimming halfway through the book. It didn't grab me as other books have done!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"If you are one of those people who sees everyone by location, race, politics or economic status, this travel through America will let you see the great people of this country as they really are: Americans."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"i remember the first time i read this, i was young and read it from my grandparents readers digest books, i eneded up buying a real copy and still have it.

The impression I went away with was the author has a new appreciation for the people and country we are privileged to live in and with."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I read this book when it was first published in the 70's. Now I'm buying it so that my 18 year old can read it and we can talk about the goodness in people. I've always felt that I've known Peter Jenkins through his writing, it's so beautiful and truthful."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Peter Jenkins' \\"A Walk Across America\\" at first glance is just another book in the Travel Essay section of a bookstore. The words are plain, the prose at times feels unnatural (like Jenkins opened his high-school creative writing book and added all of the suggestions at once). But for as immemorable as the writing in this book is, the story is unnaturally sincere and humane. Jenkins' story of being disillusioned at twenty, searching for the real world, and deciding to walk across America to find it is at once an instant American classic. The highs, the lows, the incredible amount of passion he puts into the book gives the reader the sense that he is sitting at Jenkins' feet listening to him tell the story. His accounts of the people he meets, the lessons he learns and the hardships he overcomes can be enjoyed by people from all walks of life, young and old. A must-read."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"This is a classic that came out in 1979, and has deservedly stayed in print. It is ostensibly a backpacking journey across the country begun by a young, somewhat disenchanted man, but it is also very much a journey of self-discovery. A good portion of the memoir takes place in Alabama-in fact, it ends in Mobile-such as a stay in Mountain Brook as well as an eventful Alabama football game in Birmingham. The author's meeting with Governor George Wallace has to be read to be believed. It's a special book."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Absolutely one of the best reads that I've ever encountered. Of course, throughout this book, I continued to hopelessly imagine myself taking this journey along with Peter. Its just a down to earth, true speaking, journey across the eastern US. I wish I could have been there to experience it too. Great read!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I once read an article in National Geographic, I believe 1978. I told my mother how inspiring it was. I was an outdoorsy type, and to hear of a young man in 1973 who gave up everything for a trip to try and understand the disillusion he had of his generation, his life and the bad taste so many expressed of his own country. My life had changed from this article, It was soon after this my mother found the book in the library and brought it home. I read it 3 times, each time it was just and good. It felt as though I was walking right there along side of him, I felt the pain, the joy and the intriguing moments of his life, the moments exploring and meeting new people. He had a special love for his best friend he called Cooper &quot;Coops&quot; a half Husky/Alaskan Malemute dog who had actually kept him alive during a spell of the flu on a cold mountaintop. Cooper died midway through the book, Peter expressed very well his loss and I cried as well, he explained his emptiness afterwards and I felt his pain.Peter Jenkins has written several other books since and I've read them all but this one will always hold a special place in my heart."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. It was a quick read and left a very favorable impression on the how each of us can rise above our preconceptions of others. Some very deep and probing subjects were only brushed upon which to some extent allows each of us to fill in the depth based on our experiences. However, I would have loved to hear more of how the hermit in the mountain became so &quot;magical&quot; for him. Also, at the end, everything races forward at a pace well beyond and out of sync with the beginning of the story. I highly recommend the book and wished that the journey lasted a lot longer so as to more fully explore some of the more magical and cathartic experiences in this person's life."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Peter Jenkins story of his 1973-1975 walk from New York to New Orleans is one of those books that you just can not put done once you have started. You will find yourself thinking about the book when you should be doing other things and you can't wait to pick it up again. When I finished reading the book I wanted more. I even purchased the old April 1977 National Geographic Magazine to read his article that he wrote for them and see even more of the pictures of his journey. Luckly, Jenkins journey does not stop in New Orleans, his walk continues and so do his books: The Walk West, The Road Unseen, Close Friends, and Across China.Peter Jenkins says, &quot;I started out searching for myself and my country and found both.&quot; The story would have been good enough just hearing about the trip, the things that he saw, how he survived, and the companionship of his faithful dog; but what make the book great is the people. The people that he meets, how they accept him, and in some cases don't. It is the sociology as well as the adventure that make this one of the best books I ever read for pleasure."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Even before I had ever heard of this book, I wanted to do what Peter Jenkins did and just hit the road. So my judgement might be more than a little biased.Nevertheless, I thought this was a very good read. There's at least two levels to the book. The first of course is the journey. Some guy walks from Upstate New York to New Orleans. How could that be boring? It's a really good story with adventure, freindship (I felt like I knew his dog), thrills, big thoughts, a little bit of romance at the end, and most impoartant of all, great characters.That brings me to the second level of this book. The characters Jenkins meets make you stop and think. From the poor black family that invited him into their meager home for several months, to the lonesome mountain hermit, and the Guv'nah of Alabamy. I don't want to sound like an after-school special, but Jenkins's experiences make you rethink your assumptions and sterotypes. Take the hippie commune farm, for example. I won't reveal the biggest plot point that occurred there, but one thing that really struck me was their pushiness. Even though hippies are \\"supposed to be\\" accepting, peaceful, and have a kind of \\"do whatever you want, man\\" attitude, they were relentless on pushing their ideas onto Jenkins, insisting that he join them and that their way of life was the best.So in short, I say read this book. EVen if you don't want to get into the sociology of it, it can stand up as a fantastic adventure story. Heck, if I had a couple million dollars and could cram the whole thing into two hours (and still do it justice), I'd make it a movie, just so even more people could know about it."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I have been using A Walk Across America, by Peter Jenkins as a required reading for over ten years, in The Lifestyle Enhancement class I instruct at Southeast Missouri State University. I also require: Tuesday's With Maurie. These two exemplary accounts of life and its meaning and purpose, serve as a primary source of motivation for the seventy five behavior change projects each student must engage in each semester.At the conclusion of each semester I ask the over 100 students enrolled in all three sections, if I should reduce the required readings, by eliminating either book? The answer is an emphatic, no! I have included some comments from students presently enrolled in the class.&quot;This book definitely affected me in a positive way. I believe that I always look for the deeper meaning in things, and this book had a pretty obvious one. In a time period where everything is getting ready to change for me (I am graduating in May, moving, and starting a career), it made me realize that other people are scared too, and that you can be successful even if you are afraid and unsure now&quot;.&quot;Reading this book has made me think more about the decisions I've made in the past and now. I believe that my life is somewhat like Peter's life was before he decided to &quot;walk&quot;. I have done, and still do a lot of things that other people expect of me. Don't get me wrong they are all beneficial things, but they are done for the wrong reasons. Things I do, choices I make should be for me, not for one that wishes they could've live their own life in a different way. I admire the fact that peter just decided that he was going to &quot;walk&quot; his life out. He now could have some control over the problems he faced and how he would, himself, solve them&quot;.The words and tales Peter Jenkins described helped move my students out of their comfort zone, and created an amenability and impetus for change. A Walk Across America is an outstanding tool to create insight and pride in our country and most importantly the book serves as the motivation for students to walk out of the ordinary and into an extraordinary lifestyle.Additionally, students are assigned a take home midterm and are asked to answer four questions about the book and must summarize each in two pages. I have included some student responses, which document the progress students have made in both intra and interpersonal growth. I am aware of no better way to get students to examine their lifestyle.&quot;I think that I will grow from this book, because it has showed me that I can do anything that I put my mind to. There is nothing that is impossible it is just a matter of me getting out there and doing it. This man trained himself, put his body through hell, and still was victorious in what he wanted to do. This also showed me that there is a great world out there and many great people. Sometimes it seems that when things are not going so well in my life that I want to blame it on other people. I now realize that I am the only person that can make myself happy. I am in charge of my own fate, and no one can take that away from me. The main thing that I learned from this book is that anything is possible once you put your mind to it. I want to leave this paper with one of my favorite quotes that I feel is most fitting for Peter Jenkin's story. &quot;A Journey of a Thousand Miles begins with one step&quot;.&quot;I think I will grow by letting myself &quot;walk&quot; after graduation. I am not going to walk across the country, but I think I will explore my options a little more. Maybe it isn't so important that I get a job in my field immediately. There are some things I would love to do first and maybe this is the perfect time to try them.&quot;I am certain, that without this classic book, A Walk Across America, I would not be able to move my students from where they begin to where they need to be."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"...I am a professor at a well known, highly ranked college and before that for ten years a high school teacher.For all the years I have been using A WALK ACROSS AMERICA in my classes, no book I have ever used has been so beloved and accessable and taught so much in Peter Jenkins' ever so subtle way to my students. That means, no book, including several classics. Of course, Jenkins book having been a best seller since 1979 and having had over 100 printings is no considered a classic...There is no travel book, and for that matter almost no other book, published in the last twenty years that can match the sales and reaction performance of A WALK ACROSS AMERICA.Obviously no book appeals to everyone but A WALK ACROSS AMERICA comes close based on reactions over my fifteen years of teaching thousands of very opinionated students..."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Read this one severl years ago, when it was first published, and it has stuck with me since that time. As other reviewers have pointed out, yes, the author can be a bit naive at times and no, he is not Heminway. This is the story of a young man on a personal journey. We do not even have to question his motives as they are his own. We do not have to agree with his conclusions, they they too are his own. The nice thing is, this young man took a journey, had an adventure and had the nerve to write about it. This book, and it's follow up \\"The Walk West,\\" have been out for a number of years now and have been extremely successful. A lot of people have truely enjoyed them (myself included). This sort of work tends to draw out the rock throwers after a few years. Would strongly suggest you read this one yourself. It does not take that long and you will may quite well like what you find. As a added note: I note that several reviews have taken almost a venomous view as to the author's relationship to his traveling companion, a dog. While I agree, a dog is not a person, I do understand how the author could and apparently did become so attached to his pet. I travel with a dog, have for years, as my only companion, and you do tend to attribute qualities to your four legged fuzzy friend that many cannot see. All in all, recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"When I was 18 and my great-grandmother was 78, she gave me this paperback, saying, &quot;I loved this book! Full of laughter -- and tears.&quot; Almost twenty years later, I still consider it to be the best story I have ever read. It has inspired me to read more, write more, and especially, love my country and the people in it more. Peter Jenkins' printed words are so richly descriptive and heartfelt, the reader will know each character as a close friend and each location as if the Keds were his/her own! This is a timeless classic."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I read this many years ago and am writing it from memory of that time. One thing that really impressed me about the book was that he got out of his comfort zone. He was challenged on his anti-Vietnam war and even somewhat anti-American views and challenged to get to know America. And so he did.It was refreshing as he told of some of his stereotypes of say Southern rednecks and others and yet as he travels he gets to meet some of these people as people and realizes they were different than he had thought.And then there was the Black family he ended up staying with. He tells of his fears and misgivings when he first encounters the young men but he gets past that and ends up living with them and getting to know them. We can see how his views are changed as he gets to know the different people.With all the polarization these days as different people attack and talk about others of different ethnic, racial, political, religious or regional views without getting to know them, I remember how he got past that and actually got to know people who were different than he was. It blew some of his stereotypes and he was willing to get past that.When the subject of race or different political groups has come up, I have recommended this book as it shows how he took the challenge and got to know people. More of us would benefit in getting to know people who are different than we are. We, like he did, will often find out that they are people just like us in a lot of ways."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Peter Jenkins describes his life in the months leading up to his early 1970's odyssey in a way I can probably best sum up as \\"lost\\". Coming of age amid the political maelstrom of the late 1960's, the idealistic Jenkins had felt his faith in America's future slip away, he had a crisis of personal direction, and he was a man who had somewhere in his twenty-odd years fallen away from the hopeful dreams that had once shaped him as who he was. One day while talking with a friend about all the things wrong with the world, the nation, himself, Jenkins was half-seriously told that he should try to seek out the real America and see how much good there was in it. For a man who had become convinced his nation was mired in hopelessness, this challenge to find what was right in the US inspired him to begin a walk--yes a walk on foot-- that began along the Atlantic coast and would eventually end (in his second book) 4,000 miles away in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Setting off with a backpack, his dog and a lot of courageous ambition, Peter Jenkins, who received backing in his mission from the National Geographic Society, began a meandering trek that took him through the rural countryside of a dozen states and finally, after being adopted by a devout black family in North Carolina, surviving a tornado, the loss of his best friend, walking pneumonia, intimidations by bullying thugs, and attempts to dissuade him from finishing his planned march to the ocean, Jenkins stops for a breather in New Orleans and there meets a woman who becomes the love of his life, and in short order, his bride. This book pauses here but the story of the Jenkins' (yes, his wife begins the walk west with him) hike across the Heartland to the Oregon coast is concluded in this book's sequel. Not only is this an interesting travelogue, and not only is it also the story of America at a particular time in its history, it is the memoir of a man's transformation from cynic back to glorious idealist, and from a spiritual doubter to a spiritually living human being."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I think Walk across America Was a grab you by the Brain and pull you in. The way he wrote the book you were there walking with him.I read this book 10 years ago and still tell people about it.The people he meets on the way are true Americans. The one part I will never forget is the part about Church. This is something else. I could not put this book down. I think everyone would love this book. It has a little of all of us in it"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I admit, the writing style was not amazing or creative but it was well said. Jenkins told his story through his own experience, even if it may or never can relate to me, I still found his stories to be full of depth. I bawled my eyes out at teh water truck chapter and afterwards, i kept feeling incredible empitness and loss. Alothough he had a happy ending, as well as full of energy-- I still found myself mourning for Cooper. I couldnt give him 5 stars because, his writing styles got a little bit too songsy for my taste, some of his comments were cheesy. However, if you are willing to overlook his style and look at the story itself, i promise you, it will make you laugh, cry and wonder!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Great product cheaper than others!!!! Definitely would buy this product again, good quality no hassle buying from buyer no problems"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"It's basically a collection of short anecdotes, which is why I love it so much. These kinds of books, a quasi-collection of short stories, can be read not just by people who love to read, but are also easily read by people who aren't so fond of literature or just don't have much of an attention span. I've read other Peter Jenkin's work - this is the best. It's sincere, sometimes approaches over-sentimentality but never quite reaches it, and is generally inspiring. Cannot recommend it enough."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Peter did what most of us hiker types have thought about doing - just packing up and moving down the road. But the mortgages and maintaining a career always slowed us down, along with girl friends and wives who are not too interested in wandering into unknown and sometimes dangerous areas. They can handle different beds and climates, and even snakes and bugs, but safety is always a big factor while traveling and Peter managed to survive in some pretty tough spots. In some ways, I was very envious of Peter but conversely I do enjoy a good meal and clean bed, behind locked doors. I enjoyed his thoughts and insights - a good read!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"This book changed my life. It will stick with me forever.

Since then I have read it multiple times, and every time I love it even more. I felt like I was walking right along with Peter during his journey, and wished that I had been. I fell in love with the characters, and wished there was sad the book was over (luckily I discovered 'The Walk West' and Jenkins other books) I laughed and cried, and truly lost myself in the book. If you are considering buying this book, please do yourself a favor and do it!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I have read this book several times over the years because it's so good!

At the beginning, he abandoned his young wife for no apparent reason (he does not really explain what happened except by saying things got unbearable between them), in the end, he dragged another girl to walk across the country with him, even though he realized that this would totally disrupt her career. Even his treatment of his dog shows that he is obsessed with himself -- he thought his dog could think like a human (actually, like him) and he used plural to describe what he and his dog think (we remembered, we liked or did not like this place, etc.), which is completely ridiculous, mildly irritating and totally laughable. I guess that what long, lonely walks do to people, and if you get stranded on an island, you may also talk to a volleyball.Even though he tried to distance himself from the hippies, he really is just another hippie who cares only about himself and his \\"spiritual journey\\" rather than the people who care about him. How his whole walk started is still not very clear to me, he said it was because he hated his country and wanted to see it for himself, but from the book I did not get a strong impression of this. Instead, I got the impression that it was just another excuse for him to walk away from responsibility.But, I guess we shouldn't be too harsh on the author. Despite the somewhat juvenile writing style, irksome overuse of exclamation marks, the absurdity of using plural to describe himself and his dog, the trite story of how he found god in some southern evangelical congregations, and the adolescent and melodramatic love affair at the end, walking and working his way from upper state New York to New Orleans is no small feat, neither is writing a book about it. Overall, it was an easy, mostly enjoyable (though occasionally irritating) read.The parts about the mountain hermit and when he lived with a black family are the highlights of the book. I also think the author did an adequate, if not excellent, job of recording the conversations of people with different background and origins. The part about \\"The Farm\\" (a place where a group of hippie cult people lived) is kind of confusing. Why did he go back and in the process got his dog killed? Why didn't he just walk away?I also found some of his self-confessed \\"preconceptions\\" about southerners are so stereotypical that they do not appear very believable anymore; they sound more like what he made up afterwards to build a contrast between his preconceptions and reality in order to tell the story (\\"I thought they were just undereducated rednecks, but wait, they are actually nice folks\\"). More importantly, The religious undertone almost got out of hand at the end and was in danger of ruining the book. Had it happened earlier in the book, it must have made it intolerable. Fortunately that was not the case.I wavered between giving it a 3 or 4 stars (truthfully I would give it a 3.5 stars), but considering he walked the walk and wrote the book, both are no small feats, I will give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I was given this book as a kid by a nice old man at my church. I stopped going to church in my teens and am now agnostic. I have since become very critical of religion and my country (mainly the government and our corporate culture). However I think it's important not to become too cynical. In writing a review of this book I find it necessary to point this out because it is a very simply told, innocent story written by a young man who is not a professional writer or an intellectual. He's just a normal, young guy who walked across America and wrote about it with no secret intentions. As a result you get a very entertaining and heartfelt old fashioned adventure story through America's heartland. If you're looking for anything deeper, then you're reading the wrong book."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I finished reading Peter Jenkins' book for the first time just a few days ago. As has been stated by other reviewers, this book chronicles the first section of Jenkins' walk across America in the early 1970's to see what the country is about. Along the way he meets interesting people and has a scare or two. His story is told in an easy-to-read style that flows fairly well. It's not a complex tale, but it is very engaging.If I had one negative comment about the book, I'd say that it is a bit slow out of the gate. While I understand Jenkins has to lay the foundation for the story, and why he is undertaking this journey in the first place, I found this to be a bit dry. Perhaps I just wanted him to get on with the walk. But having finished the book, I certainly understand why Jenkins spent the time laying the foundation - it helps one understand the internal conversion he went through while traveling. Once Peter reaches Smokey Hollow, the book has fully hit its stride. Having spent much of my life either in the mountains of North Carolina or the deep south of southern Georgia, his experiences certainly rang true. I had no qualms about finishing this book; it was just getting past the first chapters.In reflection, this book really reminded me in many ways of Kenn Kaufman's book &quot;The Kingbird Highway&quot;. Both books are true accounts of journeys taken by young men about the same time in U.S. history. While Kaufman's book is more about a journey while birding, he also goes through a sort of transformation during his journeys. I found the books to be similar also in their easy, breezy writing. As someone mentioned in another review, William Least Heat-Moon's book &quot;Blue Highways&quot; is also somewhat similar. That trip took place several years after this long walking journey, and while aspects of the books are quite similar I find big differences as well. One of the biggest being that Heat-Moon had a vehicle to drive and sleep in. It may not seem like much, but I think that integrally affected how both Jenkins and Heat-Moon interacted with the folks they met.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to understand a bit of what the U.S. was like in the early 1970's. Yes, anything in this book is filtered through Jenkins' experiences and perceptions, but this is an interesting first-hand account of a man's discovery of his country and himself."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"unlike william least-heat moon's &quot;blue highways, &quot; peter jenkins didn't see the country by truck; he walked acrossed america with only a backpack, his dog, and a few dollars..he wanted to see if the country was still worth believing in...and it was...he met a mountain man and learned the importance of living off the land...he lived with a black family and discovered the power of love and the sense of community that shatter prejudices...he went to alabama, met the governor, who told him to discover the south and then judge it for himself, and finally, he met a woman and fell in love...the writing is nothing special...but he just wanted to tell you what happened...i was not suprised at the treatment he recieved from southerners,; southern whites have always viewed northern whites as snooty intellectuals with no common sense; northerners see southerners as ignorant, lazy, uneducated, and racist...i thought it was funny how jenkins condemned southerners whites for wanting to &quot;rub black people off the face of the earth,&quot; when northern people can be just as racist;only difference is southerners are just open with their hatred.It took alot of guts for him to take the journey..to be harrassed for being a free spirit...it was good to see that while he lived an alternative lifestyle, he didn't resorting to forcing it on anyone. i'm an agnostic, but his finding god was refreshing and uplifting...and how fitting that he met the love of his life in new orleans ! i grew up 80 miles west of new orleans in baton rouge,louisiana and visited it alot when i was in high school and college...new orleans has an european old-world charm that anyone can fall in love with...and i fell in love with this book..."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I had to read this book for Mrs. Shaw's history class....i didn't want to....but when i picked up the book...my journey began!!!

What a great way to experience the Appalachian Trail!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"By coincidence, I found a copy of this 1979 book in my sister's \\"Donate\\" box and quickly read it right after having finished Cheryl Strayed's much publicized 2012 book \\"Wild\\", and I found the contrast of the two books about cross-country walking journeys interesting. Whereas Strayed used her trek (and thus the focus of the book) as a journey of introspection and coping with personal demons/tragedies, Jenkins' aim was to learn about and focus on the people he met so that he could learn more about the variety and character of Americans. To me, this key difference is at the root of why I enjoyed Jenkins' tale more than Strayed. Although Strayed's book has received glowing critical reviews, I personally felt like it was generally too much about her and her hangups, like I was taking a long journey with a whiny, self-absorbed, self-destructive drama queen. Jenkins, on the other hand, talks less about himself and more about the wide variety of fascinating characters he met and his experiences, which I found much more interesting, He makes it his mission to stop for extended periods to immerse himself in the families and communities along his journey, partially to work and earn money but also to gain better understanding of the people and their ways of life.I wonder if the difference in these two books is in a way indicative somewhat of how Americans themselves have changed from the free-love 1970s to the self-absorbed, Facebooking/Tweeting 2012 (which I admittedly write in my social media review). While Jenkins still writes travelogues these days, they don't receive the attention and acclaim Strayed's book has, perhaps because it doesn't contain as much \\"edgy\\" self-flagellation. I also think if someone attempted a \\"Walk Across America\\" journey today, their experiences would be much different from Jenkins' at that time, with people today being more fearful of and less generous to homeless strangers in general.\\"A Walk Across America\\" is not without flaws. Sometimes Jenkins' narrative is disjointed or meandering. Sometimes it gets a little hokey, especially near the end. But overall, I really liked the book and look forward to reading some of Jenkins' other books, including the sequel to this, \\"The Walk West: A Walk Across America 2.\\"By the way, the paperback version I read included many artful photos of people and places referenced by Jenkins, but I will warn you not to skip ahead because one of the photos is a major spoiler for one of the dramatic turns in the story."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I was required to read this book for a college course I took several years ago, and I loved it so much that I have bought several more copies along the years as gifts for family and friends. The tale is amazing, and you really feel you are a part of the story. This is one of those books you could read in one sitting, front to back, because it captivates you so much you can't put it down!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"First off, let it be said that I love adventure! This book was first purchased for me as a gift while deployed on an 8 month Navy cruise. 99% of that time we are underway and the adventure is dampened by horribly long and strenuous work days. The best part of the day (Besides a warm shower if you're lucky) is falling into a great book. Since I was not able to see the mountains, smell the trees, and feel cool mountain air, this book took me on a journey I would love to have been a part of. It's been said that is is difficult to understand Peter Jenkins' style of writing, but I had no problems following along. If you simply long for adventure and cannot get out and \\"make\\" your own story, this is a great way to fill his shoes and live thorough his ups and downs. I ended up leaving this book in the ships library so others could enjoy it, and years later found myself wanting to take his journey again. My wife knowing how much the book meant to me originally, purchased another copy for me. Once again I was engrossed in this story. I simply cannot get enough of it. Highly recommended, you won't regret picking this one up!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"If you are a true road dog you will read this book more than once I promise you! 70's ? It's timeless.The same type of people Peter Jenkins met then are people you could meet traveling to this day. The book proves there were good people just about everywhere he traveled.There were some real jerks also.This book is actually required reading at some schools.It is a true classic[if you like to travel]If you dont enjoy traveling and meeting people why would you bother, it would just give you an excuse to complain about something you already knew you were far removed from.I personally feel sympathy for someone who doesn't have a wanderlust.If it wasn't for books like this to 'tide me over' I would be a really miserable person."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"My father read this book and recommended it to me. It's an incredible story and exceptionally inspirational. The way Jenkins was able to have such an adventure on so little a budget, and recount the tale in such a vivid way is enough to make anybody long for life on the road."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I've really been getting into the travel books lately. And this one ranks pretty high with me. The author was excellent and really described his trip with a different tone than I've seen from most travel writers. Sure there were a couple of things that could be changed, but despite these, it really is an excellent book.After leaving college Peter Jenkins isn't quite sure what he wants to do with his life. He is discontent, most especially with America in general. After voicing this to a friend, the friends surprises him by suggesting that he get out and see America before making judgments. That fall, he takes off from his home to the North and starts heading South, towards the gulf, on the first let of his journey. Accompanying him is his half Malamute Cooper (who despite being a bit wild, is really a good dog). Through their trip they encounter some dangers (storms, sickness, etc.) but the real stand outs are the good things on the trip. Most especially the people. Since this trip takes place in the early seventies Jenkins has an attitude starting out that may be considered offensive today. But he changes his thoughts throughout the journey as he learns more. For instance, despite racial tensions in the South around that time, he finds himself living with a Black family where he forgets color and instead just enjoys being a part of everything. He also expects to hate Alabama and die there, but then finds that it is better than he thought. While he doesn't get clear across America in this book, he does get pretty far.Peter is a great narrator. He tells everything how it is and isn't afraid to show how he's wrong. As mentioned before he holds different views about parts of the country and its inhabitants and doesn't mind being wrong about them. In fact, he relishes the fact that he was wrong and is appreciative. This is kind of a spiritual quest for him too and he brings up his experiences with different faiths and what he's thinking throughout the book. He also loves his dog Cooper, which makes him a good person in my eyes and in many other people's eyes.The writing is smooth and descriptive and I was saddened by the fact the end of the novel did come so soon. The first half of the book had a lot of description while he was with Cooper. But then (and this is a spoiler, you have been warned) Cooper dies! I think the book must have fallen from my hands I was so shocked and saddened by this. But it was real life, so it's not like Peter could change that. This makes the second half of the book go quicker and he doesn't spend as much time in description. As previously mentioned, there are some religious aspects to this book, but it isn't overly preachy, its just showing Peter's thought processes and journey with religion. Since this is a book about his trip, it is appropriate.Another great thing about this book is the amount of pictures. After visiting National Geographic, Peter obtained a camera from them for use on his travels (he also wrote an article for them). There is a whole section of colored photos and another section of black and white photos in the book. However, these pictures do give away spoilers for later in the book so proceed with caution.I did love this book and despite its flaws I think it is one of the best I've ever read. I'm going to be eagerly searching to see if there is another edition with more of his travels out there and do all I can to get my hands on it. I highly recommend this book to anyone.A Walk Across AmericaCopyright 1979291 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I found this book at my parents house stashed away somewhere. What a find! It was an original copy from 1979. If you enjoy travel novels (Such as Bill Bryson's a \\"Walk in the Woods\\") you will really enjoy this book. The book took me both across the country and back in time.As someone in his 20s I can identify with the author and the way he felt at the start of his journey. But this book was set in the mid 70s, just under a decade before I was born. It is interesting to hear about all the people he meets along the way, and what America was like in 35 years ago. Jenkins paints a very vivid picture of the places he visits and the people he meets along the way. He also goes on an inner journey of self discovery. From a lost recent college grad disillusioned with the US he gains an appreciation for his country and a better understanding of himself. I really enjoyed it and even ordered a copy for one of my friends."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Peter goes on an incredible journey with his best friend, Cooper, and takes us along with well-told chapters, each covering a different section of the hiking trail. He tells of the many Americans he comes across, most of them good-hearted, generous people who offer him unconditional hospitality and love. He doesn't say much of the technicalities of trail life itself, so it is not really a good hikers guide. This is more like a collection of individual stories, each with their own theme and lesson and his own revelations he discovers about himself and the world. What's great is that he discovers himself in the most complete way any human being could that it seemed like it was fate that he needed to take that hike. What a great, story-book ending to true-life non-fiction novel."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Love this book. I've read a library copy 3 or 4 times and wanted my own.

One year I was unable to finish the book before the end of the school year and a student begged his parents to track down a copy of it so he could finish it on his own."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Although Peter Jenkins took his journey in the early 1970's during the Vietnam war and Watergate, his story rings true for many today. As our culture again seeks to find fulfilment in material things, Peter reminds us that much of what we seek cannot be found in that which can be bought.In one regard, he chose to take on the appearance of his &quot;generation&quot; with long hair and an unshaven beard. Yet in another way, chose to be true to himself and refused to &quot;go along to get along.&quot;In this book Peter recounts his discontent as a recent college graduate after a failed marriage. Dealing with the turmoil of Vietnam and Watergate, he decided to give the USA one more chance by walking out of his protected upper middle class world in New England and experiencing America.Through his journey down the original colonies to New Orleans he experienced many triumps and trials. He was adoped by a southern black family while he earned money to continue his journey. He was more than once in fear of his life for being a &quot;drug-dealing hippie.&quot; He lost his traveling companion, &quot;Cooper half-malamute&quot; while working at a religous commune.Along the way Peter recounts the many times his soul was refreshed when he thought he was at the point of breaking. By the time he reached New Orleans, he found hope, life, and his wife."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Twenty-five years from this book's writing, anyone who takes a similar venture as his personal quest for self-discovery is faced with the same problems, questions, and surprises. America is so big and diverse that no one can make generalizations about its people and their values, beliefs, and traditions. I thoroughly enjoyed Peter Jenkins' book. I never had a dog, but it was easy to empathize with his feelings for his faithful companion Cooper. I never attempted to do a similar undertaking, yet it was easy to relate to his personal mission. The commune he ran into in Tennessee sounded like Alex Garland's community of expatriates in &quot;The Beach&quot;. His immersion with home cooking from people who lived off the land sounded better than any fancy-schmanzy cooking production that I see in gourmet magazines and cookbooks. He had a very keen sense of place in Mobile, Alabama that I found engrossing, especially the way he described how the urban layout was in tune with the native fauna, like the &quot;grandfather&quot; oak trees. Anybody who embarks on a risky and high-commitment type of venture like Jenkins is bound to win friendships that armchair travelers who are curious about the rest of the country will find moving. My praises also go to his erstwhile dog who helped &quot;prime&quot; him in his unforgettable adventure."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"In my life I would say that I have read at least 1,000 books; this one is my all time favorite. You will fall in love with this book and his dog Cooper. This book will stay with you for years. If you are an animal lover expect to do some heavy crying. 19 years after first reading this book it is still far and away above any other. Nothing is even a close second. You will fall in love with his dog Cooper. Has there ever been a better pet? This book will haunt you. You'll read it in one sitting. God Bless Cooper!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Walking across America is quite an endeavour, to write a book about it another. The theme of the book is very interesting, however the style of writing is very dramatic which is a bit tiresome. Jenkins experiences are either rated as total bliss or complete catastrophe, and unfortunately so are the people he meets. The book bleaches in comparison with Krakauers \\"Into the Wild\\". I did buy the sequel before reading this book and will actually read it because I really like the theme. Hopefully Jenkins has matured on the next section of his walk."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"wonderful story about a man's remarkable journey with his dog as they walk across America and experience the rekindling of human kindness and that generally folks do really care about each others well being is still alive as they comtinue their journey although some parts are very sad but in all a great book a must readbook .I really enjoyed this book and recommend it highly"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I read a few other reviews where the writing in this book was described as amateur, lacking focus and ham-fisted (what a great word). The premise of this book is so great but the author's poor writing style and lack of meaning is incredibly disappointing. The book feels like a work log of what he did every day and misses so many opportunities to share insight and depth. One of my favorite inconsistencies is when the author shares that he has been a strict vegetarian for the prior 3 years and then only 13 pages later describes how he orders 15 \\"big-man\\" burgers from a fast food drive in. What?!?!I was generous and gave this book a 2 because I really like the idea of seeing the country by walking across it. Unfortunately the title was probably the best part of the book. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I really feel as though I took this journey with Peter Jenkins. He is a hiker who can make you feel as though you're on the trail with him. I fell in love with him and I fell in love with his dog, Cooper. I came to realize why dogs have been referred to as man's best friends. I'd thought from the title that Jenkins would be walking the entire time, not realizing that he would need to stop and work in order to continue to survive. On the whole, Jenkins was treated well. Ask yourself if you ever imagined that a white man in the seventies could move into a black neighborhood, live with a black family, and go to church with them every Sunday and become like one of the family? Or could you imagine a mountain man who raises all his own food, a virtual hermit, welcoming Jenkins into his home and treating him like a son? Still, there are some scary experiences on the road--some close calls--ones that will make your heart pound a little faster.Jenkins enjoys neighborly love in this book and by the end falls in love two more times (I won't spoil the story by providing details). Let me just say that I feel this book has it all--a little of every type of connection a healthy man or woman needs for the good life. Dog lovers and even those who have never felt a deep connection with animals of any sort (the exception for me would be my brother's dog in recent years) will feel an emotional investment in this story of a man and his beloved dog and the many wonderful, amazing, and occasionally scary people they meet."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"It is important to keep in mind that this book was written during troubled times in America. The Vietnam War was nearing it close, the hippy movement was strong and civil rights movement was in its infancy. Thus; reading this book (almost 35 years after it was written) reflected more to me how America has managed to progress from the stigma of bigotary and racism that has plagued our history for far too long. For example: the fact that a young Peter Jenkins had the courage to befriend a colored family, and stay with them for 6 months) would have been unchartered waters for very few in the early 70's. Without furor or protest, it was young men like Jenkins that broke these barriers down at the 'grass roots' level of society (not at all deprecating the works of MLK and others).The story begins with a young college graduate disalusioned with life in suburban America. In an effort to 'find himself' he embarks on a walk from his native New York to Louisiana with his beloved dog (and best friend) Cooper. As the book progresses, the reader will become more and more attached to this dog and reading of his exploits are as entertaining as the walk itself. Any dog owner would appreciate this deep sense of loyalty that a dog enjoys with its owner - in fact after the lovable Cooper dies at the 'Farm', you almost feel the loss as much as Jenkins did. Definitely a sad part of the tale.Along the way, Peter meets a wide variety of friends, acquaintancies, strangers and sometimes family. These colorful personalities are interspersed throughout the book and bring with them the unique and rich tapestry of the people of America (sometimes in an unflavorable light). In conjunction with these folks, he also writes about the weather conditions and hunger that he faced along the way. The book ends with the writer finding faith in the Lord Jesus and love for woman who would become his wife - these later chapters really meant a lot to me.A great read, but one thing (to me) remains unanswered... why did Jenkins depart on this journey in October (surely recognizing that the impending north east winter could lead to his peril?) He could have left sooner, or later and ensured that he was traveling in the warmer temperatures of the north and the cooler temperatures of the deep south. This should not detract from the book - merely a question...Enjoyable and refreshing read."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"... I like travelogues and road trip stories and have spent some time hiking in various places across America so I thought I would give it a shot. I was disappointed enough after having starting it that I gave thought to putting it down and starting something else. It's an adequate enough story: young man disillusioned with his country goes on walkabout with his dog to rediscover his country, the people who give it its character and somewhere along the way find God too. It's an old idea that never loses punch. However, as one reviewer here noted the author doesn't quite make it across America in this book. He doesn't even come close so the reader gets somewhat gypped if he expects a travelogue that samples the entire country as the title suggests. But worse is the author's writing style. It's not very creative. In fact, it's downright cliched. He seems to have run out of ways to express himself and falls back on excessive and unimaginative use of similes and makes far too many distracting references to his \\"forever friend\\" dog Coops. In summary, I have no problem recommending this book as a compelling read for grade schoolers but I have to think that to read this as an adult forfeits the opportunity to digest something of greater significance and artistry. For better travel stories try Blue Highways, On the Road and Huckleberry Finn."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Reading this book for a book club, I found it incredibly boring and superficial. Peter spends 3 days on the mountain with Homer and writes nothing of depth about this amazing mountain man. Peter's writing is pedestrian. He talks about wanting to discover America and yet only writes about people when someone else directs him to! Someone told him he had to go see Homer the Mountain Man. This was the first people story after 7 weeks of walking. Homer was a character and shared himself with Peter and yet Peter is insensitive and self-absorbed in his responses to Homer. The next story in the book written about actual people is when someone directs him to spend the night in the police station. There Peter talks to a Vietnam Vet. Peter writes that the Vet's stories would awaken a person from a 6 month coma and then writes NOTHING about those conversations. Wasted opportunities. The concept of the book is a great idea, but the writing is juvenile."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Guy walks across America, meets girl and God on the way, marries girl in the end. Guy and girl walk across America again (The Walk West), meet with God constantly, make children and write about Him. Today, guy and girl write separately and are divorced and have since remarried. Go figure."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"The product had good delivery time and safe packaging. The item was described as new, but had a print date of 1979. It was, however, in very good condition."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I believe Mr. Jenkins must have been paid by the exclamation point, so liberal is he with their use. While his story should be interesting to the wanderers among us, his telling of it is so hamfisted that I just couldn't bear to continue. Jenkins needs a harsher editor or better yet, a ghost-writer. This book reads like a high-school senior's lengthy \\"personal narrative\\" for a college admissions essay. But perhaps I'm being too generous."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I just finished this book and want my money back. I felt like I was expected to write a book report after reading this. If this book is any indication, I won't insult my inteligence by reading any more of his work. He didn't even make it \\"across\\" the US in any meaningful sense of the term. In THIS book that is. For the entire trip west, you have to buy the sequel. Sounds like someone is milking a story...I do envy him his journey. The entire reason I bought this book was to learn about the logistics of undertaking such a long hike, as I plan on walking from the east coast to the west coast someday. Unfortunately he would rather write of his love affair with his \\"forever friend\\" and make up lame similes for every little thing he encounters. I would give an example, but I've already given away the book.In my opinion, check your local library or buy it in a quarter bin at a flea market. Any more time or money invested in this book is a waste."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Its a classic, but whoa. ZzzzZzzzZzzzZzzz. The book is actually pretty good until he hits Alabama. After that, put it down. Its a snore."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Ugh, ugly book. This book, while original, was definitely not a book I'd sit down and read on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn't worth my time, and I doubt it will be worth yours.Peter Jenkins, author and protagonist, decides to walk across America for no good reason besides curiosity. He takes an exaggerated super-dog named Cooper with him. He explores all different aspects of society in his quest and eventually finds himself a girl and gets married. Many things in this I find hard to believe. The author believes that Cooper and himself share a level of implied communication of feelings to each other (implying that the animal is sentient). The some of the ridiculous characters encountered represent the crazies of American society. The lack of interesting plot left me gasping for something solid.The only thing and I found that I liked in this book was that the author found God in the end and felt the power of God affect his life."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I would say that a worse book could not be produced, but I know that there's some hot-blooded hippy out there who is ten seconds away from jumping up from his pottery wheel to shout, &quot;Hey! I'm gonna walk across America and WRITE ABOUT IT!&quot; (Or, rather, since he's a hippy, &quot;Hey, MAN! I'm gonna walk across America and WRITE ABOUT IT!&quot;) Nothing against hippies; most of them know how to write well. It's the hippies that don't who really annoy me, such as Mr. Peter &quot;My Life Partner is an Alaskan Malamute&quot; Jenkins. He even admits it! &quot;. . . I was not a writer. I could barely spell my name&quot; (p. 57). So, please tell us, Peaterr Jinkyns, why'd you do it? Do you enjoy lacing together poorly-worded images and emotions into a story that's actually PAINFUL to read? The whole book seems as if it were written like a high school student writes an English essay on &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; at 4 A.M. the day it's due. (Yes, that's right, I used a similie--something Peter Jenkins should never ever do again.) He should let his dog do the writing, instead. (Which he does, in some points. He's one of those people who thinks his dog can talk.)This book got good reviews from other people because of it's optimistic outlook on our country, but I say don't listen to the optimists. They think that George W. Bush is a good president. It's the cynics who see the truth as it really is.Don't get me wrong, I love this country and I'm very proud of it. In fact, I even wrote my own book about it. It's called &quot;My Feet Hurt, America&quot;. Here's an excerpt:&quot;Today I started walking across this great country of ours, but half a mile out, I got tired and decided to go home and eat a Super-Sized BigMac combo meal with lots of ketchup. God bless the USA from sea to shining sea and the home of the brave. THE END&quot;MY POINT: I think it's great that people love this country so much that they want to walk across it and write books about it. But I do think people should learn to write first. So don't read this book, unless you want a story about a hippy-turned-Republican."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I couldn't put it down. I have read this book three times, twice straight through. Peter's book is not just a story of a man looking for direction. It is a story of the question we all must answer. Sheer inspiration-"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Peter adventure isn't one he takes by himself. It is an adventure we all must undergo in our lives. His books are written in the highest standard, inspiration."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"This is a freat novel which really makes you appreciate living in America. As Peter walks you feel like you are there walking with him and meeting the people that he meets. You learn from this book that we may be all different in the way we live and where we are from but we still have things in common. Peter shows this many times throughout the book when he stays and meets many people from all over the southern part of the country. This book really makes you think about what is important in your life. I recommend it to all to read."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"A Walk Across America was a wonderful book. The book was full of adventure. Peter Jenkins, the author, hikes from New York to Louisiana with his trusty dog, Cooper. This book allows the reader to take a wild journey. Peter discovers what it is like to be truly hungry, to travel in the mountains, to live in very different cultures, to make new friends, and to learn about religions. This book contains interesting photographs that bring the stories to life. One thing amazing about this book is that it is a true story. Peter Jenkins actually &quot;walked across America.&quot; After reading this book I felt energized. Knowing I can go anywhere and do anything if I put my mind to it. I would recommend this book to others. You won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"A Walk Across America is a compelling journey that winds us in and out of many cultures, spiritual courses and peoples of this great country of ours. The strong sense of spirituality is a compelling force of this book, and the flavors, sights, sounds and vibrant characters are much more than background to this great adventure. A moving, touching and enlightening piece that will warm many hearts and restore faith. This is a very touching journey...not only an exploration of the people and country but one of great insight, and self-discovery. Peter's lone quest is not his alone. And those he meets on his way restore all our faith in humanity and in life.Each character, big and small, light a path to freedom from judgment. From Homer Davenport's vision of life on the mountain, to the preachers that Peter meets in a variety of spiritual encounters...to the trials and difficulties he meets along the roads...and safe homes he is welcomed into...this is a striking and most timely/timeless piece of work.Living with a black family in N. Carolina is the books highlight in many ways, as they are faced with conflict and bonding.All in all, the only coments here are ones of sheer joy in sharing, just for a few hours, this amazing experience of Peter's journey towards self-discovery, and restored belief in humanity."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"What a great book this is. Peter Jenkins in the 1970's walked across America and not only had interesting stories to tell, but also had his own spiritual journey to undertake. I first read this many years ago and it left a lasting impression upon me. Having recently re-read it, I still feel the journey he took and wish I too could take a journey such as his.Maybe America was a tad more safe in the 1970's than it is today, but fortunately Peter only had a few incidents, that could also be because his trusting companion Cooper, a Siberian Husky also travelled with him many, many miles. From Peter's beginning travels in New England down the Atlantic states and across to Louisiana, he tells the reader his encounters as he faced them on the trails, roads, and forests, he also talks about his own self journey and inner strugle to find his &quot;own path&quot;. His tales about the &quot;Mountain Man&quot; to his &quot;adoption&quot; by a black family is interesting and wonderful to read. He at last finds his &quot;soul mate&quot; and also what he is looking for. I love this book, and hopefully one day I would like to meet Peter Jenkins and let him know that his book made an impact upon me. I recommend this to anyone who would like to make a journey across America and get to know the people and land, also those who need a &quot;spiritual journey&quot; would find comfort in this book as well. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Well, it's been over a year since I read this book, and yet it still constantly echoes in my mind. Essentially, A Walk Across America is a collection of encounters with enlightening individuals, each who shares something about their lives that will stay with you forever. At times I was disappointed with Jenkins' style; his writing skills are not on par with John Irving, for example, but he definitely gets his point across."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"This is such an excellent book.

Reading it again made me wonder what Peter was up to these days and how the Farm had survived in Tennessee. I learned a lot from reading this book."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"This book is definitely a 5 star book. Anyone who is interested in travel, the United States, or enjoy adventure should read this book. It touches every known emotion, ranging from extreme happiness to the sadness felt from loss.

I was very inspired by Peter's life and the manner in which he set out to discover the soul of America. The book was written in a way that allowed me to feel as if I was on the journey with him. A Walk Across America both motivated me and challenged me to discover the answers to questions that I seek."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I found this book to be one that I couldn't put down. Peter's walk was very inspirational to me. As a person who will be entering the real world shortly, it gave me great insight. I admire Peter for taking the time to discover who is was as a person. During his walk, he not only learned more about himself, but also about those around him. Viewpoints and lifestyles were shared with Peter from people living in small towns to those living in bigger cities. What a great perspective I gained on life itself. This is a must read for anyone who is ready to move to a different part of their life! All of the bases were covered in this book!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I really enjoyed the book, A Walk Across America. The book reminded me that life is not about the destination; it is about the journey and the sights you see, the things you do, the memories you create and the people you love.

He walked through my town (I was a only a gleam in my mom's eye when he did), and I find pleasure knowing my town was important enough for an unintintional revelutionary to walk through.

I read it cover to cover in three days and ordered &quot;The Walk West&quot; and &quot;Along the Edge of America&quot; immediately. This book is for anyone who loves the outdoors, dogs, adventure or just a heartfelt excellent story. I now plan on reading anything and everything that Peter Jenkins writes.

He takes the reader to parts of the country that we all see on TV and dream of its existence but are too busy to visit. The reader will enjoy reading about the people that call these areas of the country home, and spend time living a small portion of their interesting lives with them. Great book, this is a keeper for my book collection that I will re-read again!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"When reading that initial page for the first time I knew my life would change with each passage. Jenkins' true story of &quot;fully realistic life&quot; was my call to self discovery. A wonderfully entertaining read, &quot;A Walk Across America&quot; provides one with hints of the warmth and nuturance our America offers. Jenkins simply did what the majority of us do not, he took the &quot;first step&quot; in the rest of his life. Anyone seeking to identify with this world and extract some quality meaning will undoubtedly be touched by the angelic Jenkins and his cherub in tow, Cooper. If you never read another book in your life be sure to read &quot;A Walk Across America&quot;. Life, you may find, will take on a completely new meaning and purpose."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I read this book in 1986 while in the Marine Corps stationed at Pearl Harbor. After geting out of the service I still haven't settled down. I,ve trekked from Florida to Alaska to India and beyond with no sight of settling down and no reason to.Jenkins lit a fire in my conciousness that stirred an unquenchable couriosity. This book should have a disclaimer warning that you may just bag what is expected of you and find your own path.This is a heartfelt account of one mans journey. Be careful!! You just might do it yourself."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I received a copy of A Walk Across America as a Christmas gift. Now exactly one month later I have finished not only that book but the sequel, A Walk West. Being a college student I do not have much time to read outside of my assigned readings. However with both of these books I set aside time to read them and most importantly contemplate what Mr. Jenkins was saying. I am 19 and Mr. Jenkins wrote this book over twenty years ago expressing thoughts and concerns that most teen-agers share today. I applaud Mr. Jenkins and thank him for sharing his story. Every child who is unsure about there path in life or is sure needs to read this book."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Peter Jenkins' odyssey provides a look into the soul of a wonderful writer as he traverses the country. This guy has guts: he camps, he walks, he opens his life for others to examine, he shares his life with various unbelievable people along the way. The only thing that tempers my enthusiasm for Mr. Jenkins is the knowledge that the marriage described at the book's end didn't work out. But I really respect any author who writes a book I can't put down."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"This is a simple story of an amazing journey, narrated by a man who writes in a refreshingly open manner. Whether you enjoy walking or not, or whether you have the slightest interest in the geography or social customs of the United States, this book is written for everyone who has a desire to read a beautiful story.Peter Jenkins walks across America in this book, with his faithful, tireless companion, his dog Cooper. The dog is an integral part of this story and almost made me go out and buy one of Cooper's breed. He is the epitome of what a dog should be, and canine lovers will adore all the little vignettes about this amazing fellow. Of course there are setbacks, heartaches and crises along the way, but there are also some old-fashioned heartwarming moments as well. The people in the South are especially helpful to a thirsty, hungry traveler. Jenkins' stories of their hospitality is touching.Yes, there are a few sections of the book which border almost on the mawkish and the &quot;aw, shucks&quot; John Denver-ish approach of the main character might seem a little dated or folksy. But I challenge the naysayers to attempt (and succeed) at what Jenkins managed to do, it's an amazing book and one which many people will read in a single evening. One note: there is a second part to this narrative, which encompases the rest of the journey across America. This book is also available on Amazon."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"My Dad &amp; Mom both read this book and loved it. That's somewhat unusual because my parents' reading tastes are usually different. My Dad enjoyed it so much that anytime he was given a chance, he would mention this book. Nearly a decade later, I finally got around to reading it. I wish I would have read it much sooner.The book was first published about twenty-five years ago, but it's content will probably never be dated. It is true that many things have changed in America since Jenkins first set out to walk across America: Vietnam is just another chapter in the history books instead of a recent memory, the cold war has ended, and there aren't as many hippies roaming the country as there used to be. Nevertheless, the more things change the more things stay the same.Most people are truly remarkable. We tend to forget that in our current times where violence and abuse seem the norm. We live in a society where children kill each other because some other kid called them a name. People are murdered, beat, raped, and abused every day. In the violent times in which we live, Peter Jenkins' story is more meaningful than ever. We are a culture that seems to be plagued by violence. However, this doesn't have to be the case and for the most part it isn't. There really are people out there like Homer the Mountaineer and the commune of The Farm; people who don't live according to the system. However, most people do play by the system and are like the people Jenkins met and lived with in Tennessee and Alabama: people who will stop to see if you need a lift or a place to stay, buy you a meal, or give you a glass of water. You don't hear about these people much. They are the silent majority. You don't hear much about them because a murder sells more papers and makes for better television that an old man picking up a stranger and buying his meal for him. If you don't believe me, maybe you should try taking your own walk across America."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"In his book, Peter Jenkins discusses his discontent with his life following college. He plans to leave the country, but in a last minute decision decides to take the advice of a friend and discover America. After some training for the adventure, he sets forth on his journey with his dog Cooper, who is his closest companion.Jenkins first heads first (on foot) to the National Geographic office in Washington DC, where he obtains a camera. His experiences and adventures will be recorded for an article in the popular magazine.From Washington, he starts south (destination unknown at this time). As he hikes through the mountains, he begins meeting all different types of people. His American journey takes him through a variety of places and introduces him to people of all backgrounds.Following a tradgedy on a Farm in Tennessee, Peter's adventure becomes even more insightful as he attempts to discern life in general.His walk takes him on many adventures, le! ! ads him to a religious experience, and introduces him to the woman that he eventually marries.The book is truly sensational, and impossible to put down once you have begun to read it! A must-read, for sure!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I read this wonderful book more than 20 years ago, as well as the follow-on book, The Walk West. I'm currently in Iraq and met a man from the United Kingdom last month. We were talking and he said he always planned to walk across America, and still might do that when he finishes his work here. I told him about this book...and after I returned to my base, I decided to order it and will mail it to my friend. I know he'll enjoy this book and that it will inspire him to fulfill his dream of walking across our great country someday."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Peter Jenkins wrote an book in this one. It needs to be noted that it is not a work of art, nor a great wonder in nonfiction writing. Of course, the author did not intend it to be. I found it very inspiring to read an individual's account of something of this nature. I would pass this book along to anyone searching for a read that will capture their imagination."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"When I bought this book I hadn't noticed it wasn't the whole trip end to end. As I read, I realized this story was going to spill over into another book. I also realized what a mistake I made not having the second one in hand! \\"A Walk Across America\\" is an excellent read! Highly recommended. My only complaint was I couldn't put it down and other things went to the wayside for the afternoon it took me to read it."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"This is a great read that teaches you what America is truely like. Although this book was written over 20 years ago, its story still hits home today. Happiness, sadless, love, friendship, heatache - this book has it all.I was amazed to read a book in which the events took place when I was just a baby. I wouldn't call it a history book, but it does teach you what the United States were like in the 70's.I had a hard time putting this book down. I started reading and just fell in love with the story and the people (and animals), especially Cooper, Peter's amazing dog that joins him on this journey from upstate New York to New Orleans.I can't wait to read the follow up book A Walk West"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I first read this book in the early 80's and every night I would dream of what I just read, so I woke feeling like I was walking with Peter. I became so engrossed in his adventures that through his words, I shared his journey. That sense of adventure has stayed with me, and because of it, when I travel, I appreciate and enjoy my own journey much more fully. I am getting a copy for my husband, so he can read it and experience this amazing work himself and we can share it together."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I was disappointed in this book. The author is not a strong writer. He tries to compensate for it by being overly dramatic, which only makes some passages border on the absurd, such as worrying about the \\"shark-infested waters\\" while crossing a bridge over an inlet of Lake Ponchartrain!With a personal narrative it's also important for the reader to form a bond with or at least take an interest in the narrator. I found that difficult to do with what the author gave me to work with.Frankly I'm surprised this book sold so well. I agree with another reveiwer that \\"Blue Highways\\" is a much better written book of this genre."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"When I was 21, I didn't have the nerve to just pick up and drive across America like some friends from college did. I wish I did. So now, even as a mom and a wife, my husband and I plan trips across the country to see what it is like and what we can share with our boys.I picked this book up at my church library and it's a wonderful book ~~ so what if the grammar and writing style are awkward? It's wonderful. I am literally jealous because he experienced some things that I wish I did. He got on the road and traveled to see America with his very best friend, Cooper. Did I mention that Cooper is his dog? (As a dog owner, I totally relate to Jenkins' view that Cooper is his best friend.) So Jenkins decided to figure out if America is really a beautiful country ~~ disillusioned with the Vietnam War, politics, the \\"American Way\\" and with people. He decided that the only way he can ever know what he thinks or believes in is to hike across America. Apparently, this is the first book of that journey where he walks with Cooper, whom he lost due to an accident in Tennessee on The Farm. But all ends well in New Orleans.Along the way, he meets a lonely mountain man and learned about the life on the mountains. He meets strangers who aren't friendly. He meets strangers that knew about him by word of mouth. He meets Governor Wallace in Alabama. He gets adopted by a family in the Carolinas, where he stopped for several months to work and earn money. He almost gets killed by a drunken posse who decided that he was alright after all ~~ without laying a finger on him. The man came back the next day and apologized for scaring him. He gets kicked out of a small community because he was a \\"hippie\\" with a beard and long hair. He communes on The Farm where everyone worked together and raised vegetables/fruits, children together. He traveled long and hard before reaching the Gulf. And his stories are just fascinating.If you like travel stories, this is definitely a good one to pick up. If you want to hear about a man's viewpoint about different parts of the country ~~ this is a good choice. It's clean, refreshing and stark. It's not the best writing in the world, but he was 22 when he did that and he wasn't trained to be a writer. But he did something that a lot of people wish that they could do (including me).8-31-07"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"This is by far one of the best books I've ever read. In fact, it's required reading for all of my homeschooled children. Peter Jenkins did a wonderful job writing about his experiences and this story evokes WANDERLUST!I highly recommend this book for those who love to dream from their armchairs. If you love true adventure stories, please check out the following books:PADDLE TO THE AMAZON: (1200 mile canoe ride)andMILES FROM NOWHERE: (bicycle adventure around the world.)These 3 books are at the top of my list as AWESOME adventure stories to read - and all time favorites!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I have often traveled in the United States, but unfortunately never taken the time to get to know the &quot;real&quot; people as well as Peter Jenkins on his admittedly much longer journey. This, then, is also the strength of his book: the clear, feeling description of a completely arbitrary yet strangely representative cross-section of the American people. All of Jenkins' narrative is of course deeply tainted by his own personality and sometimes annotated by what hindsight has taught him, which makes this a highly personal read.The weaknesses of this book are in the language: Peter Jenkins himself admits to being no writer. Odd similes and metaphors are relatively frequent, as are repetitions or platitudes, just like in spoken, somewhat unreflected language. A diamond in the rough, some may say, but nevertheless at times annoying.Still, this book is an entertaining read and deserves its four stars."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"A few things occurred to me while zipping through this novel. One, Peter Jenkins obviously should not be idolized as a legendary outdoorsman. He made countless mistakes that but his life in danger, namely not starting his hike earlier and avoiding the harsh northern winter. However, he really never claimed to be one, as he reminded us numerous times of his suburban background. He also admitted to not being much of writer, which was also true. I would say the redeeming quality of his story was his willingness to explore \\"our\\" America. His life could have gone in a completely different direction, especially after his early divorce. I commend him for this, and he has added to my desire for long-distance backpacking.The final section of the book dealing with his pursuit of his wife was nauseating and hardly belonged. I am bitter that was the ending instead of a successful trip \\"across\\" America. The highlight was his time with the black family in Texana. I would recommend reading another travel journal over this one."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"This book is my all time favorite. It is true adventure with a new happening one every page. A must read !!!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"The condition of the book is awesome. I got a nice discount from what my University wanted to charge for this book."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"If I were to rate only the first 3/4 of this book, &quot;Walk&quot; would recieve 5 stars. The story of Jenkin's efforts to explore the fabric of this country is truly inspiring. The various people he encounters along his journey are the marvelous centerpiece of this grand tale. Unfortunately, Jenkins loses focus toward the conclusion of this book. Although I fully appreciate the inner quest he embarked on, and agree with many of the conclusions he reached, I was really hoping to hear more about the people and places he was discovering, and less about his Christian rebirth.&quot;Across China&quot; and &quot;Edge of America&quot; are much better, in my opinion. Nevertheless, &quot;Walk&quot; is an interesting book and worth a read. Check it out and reach your own conclusions."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"This book was very cheap.My child needed it for class and we got it super fast..I well order from them again.."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"When I read this book many years ago when it was first published, little did I know that it would be a part of the internet. I would encourage anyone who likes adventure and self-discovery to get a copy of this book. Peter (the author) and Cooper (his dog/pal) awakened me to the possibility of one day having a journey of my own. For now though, this fantastic tale has kept my zest for reaching out to people alive and well. Someday I too will make the trip. Thanks to the author Peter Jenkins. I think you will be inspired as well. Start with this story and continue with all of his other works. Your mind will be taken to new places with each page you turn. If you enjoy discovery, I also recommend a book titled &quot;Blue Highways&quot; by William Least-Heat Moon -- a travelogue of people and places."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Peter started his journey out of sheer frustration and discontent with his surrounding culture and society. He was fed up with the way things were, and this walk was his search for reality, for truth and authenticy in the world. Along the way he learns a great deal about survival and the people of America, but mostly about himself. His journey on foot was just part of the journey, you see. The inward spiritual journey that Peter took, resulting in him giving his life to Christ, is the true story of pilgrimage we find in this book."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"The first time I saw this book I was a teen in High School, filled with adventure! Wanting to break out and go anywhere! I didn't get a chance to read it back then, but finally in 1993 I did-and am so glad too. Peter (and Barbara too) is one of my favorite authors. The book is filled with such emotion, and a true taste of what american lives were like then. I remember the 70's and they were different then now in the 90's. I had a hard time in putting the book down, just so I could get some sleep at night! It is an enjoyable book for anyone wanting to read of how we americans really are with eachother. It is not all bad. There were a lot of good folk that Peter came in contact with, and who is still in contact with even today! Very wonderful reading!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"As a high school student forced to read many books in school, this was the first book I have read cover to cover and have enjoyed thourally. It captures the authors true feeling at specific situations that actually allows the reader to visualize what Peter is seeing. It brings to light the backroads and modest good-hearted people of America. A very good read!!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Instead of succumbing to his feelings of loathe and disgust with America Peter Jenkins leaves his comfortable surburban haven to embark on a journey across America. Along with his dog Cooper, Peterbegins walking. His goal, a simple one, to walk across America to discover perhaps his homeland isn't as awful as it appears to be. From Peter's first step onto his pathway to the Pacific he is confrontedwith the true America. The simple honest people and places that receive no attention in the media's spotlight but have a nobleness no millionaire sports player or celebrity can ever have. These people bare theirheart and souls to Peter because it is all they have. From the reclusive mountain man Homer to Peter's future wife Barbara he is exposed to an America we should all know."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"You know, I think I expected something more along the lines of Least Heat-Moon's Blue Highways. It pales in comparison. It has its moments but most of the time I found myself getting irritated by the guy. As a \\"finding yourself\\" autobiographical piece it will pass but just barely. I give him kudos for being young and for this being his first book."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"One of the books that has had a greater impact on me. This is personal testimony of a young man who set out walking across half of America, disillusioned with the world he knew. Along the way he will discover people who will show him a different way to look at life.Written in a simple style, with humility and candidness. A spiritual journey that we have the privilege to witness, and that can be a great benefit for those who sit at home prisoners of their empty selfs. A portrait of rural America, of real people and of real places. Real life always excells fiction. A most highly recommended book, don't lose this opportunity and read it."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"To level with all the readers of this review: most of the books I read probably wouldn't be considered poignant or life-altering. A fan of mysteries, most of the things I read are pure entertainment. I had to read either Kon Tiki or A Walk Across America for summer reading two years ago (7th grade) so I bought both and ended up reading this one; it was one of the smartest things I've ever done in my life. This is without a doubt the best book I have ever put my hands on and feel it was something more that inspired me to choose it over Kon Tiki. The reality with which Jenkins writes is unequaled; you feel like you're alongside him as Cooper is underneath the truck, and in the family's trailer, and the thousand other situations where Jenkins places you in the novel itself. If you haven't read this book, either order it off here or go to your bookstore and pick it up; it shows compassion and spirit that unites all humans, and is not only touching, but entertaining as well. There are no other words that I can use to describe it; some situations give me chills even thinking about them. Rating: The strongest 5 stars I've ever awarded."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Peter Jenkins at age 22 and freshly degreed was smart enough to realize that his knowledge of American life was really quite narrow and heavily influenced by his upper middle class background. He hit upon a walk across America as means to gain perspective.The foremost fact of his journey was its sheer difficulty: having to endure hunger, cold, loneliness, sickness, etc. There is no way anyone could anticipate that and Peter did not. But his purpose had a lot more to do with the people that he hoped to encounter. But his contacts with people actually were quite limited and were almost exclusively with rural people (except towards the end). It would be hard to make any general claims concerning the general character of the American people based on Jenkins' journey. He had some good experiences with people and some not so good, even frightening. Most people were civil to him if that is the claim.Some of his experiences were quite compelling. He had great rapport with a reclusive mountain man in Virginia that he stumbled upon and visited for three days. By far the most noteworthy experience of the journey was the four months that he spent living with a black family in cramped quarters in Murphy, NC while becoming a part of the entire community including backbreaking work at a sawmill. But just prior to arriving in Murphy the white law enforcement officials of Robbinsville, NC threatened to hang him if he did not leave town - there goes any general goodness theory.Other highlights of the journey were meeting and being pleasantly surprised by George Wallace, the governor of Alabama, and meeting his future wife in New Orleans. Less compelling aspects of the journey were the showing up of his family members at various points of the journey which detracts from his self-discovery assignment and a turn towards religious overtones as the book progressed.For purposes of rating the book, it hard to separate the book from the journey. Any rating of the book is bound to influenced by whether the reviewer found the journey to be compelling. The book is written simply - no pontification. Personally for this reviewer two aspects of the book/journey stand out: the physical effort of the journey and the various personal encounters. There is no great lesson to be learned from the journey. Life is an accumulation of journeys - so to speak."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Note that the cover of this book, showing a Rocky Mountain scene, is inaccurate. This book covers Jenkins' walk from New York State to Louisiana, while his trek to the Rockies is in a later book. In this story Jenkins starts as a disillusioned hippie in 1973 and decides to walk across America to restore his faith in the country. He started with little knowledge of the challenges of hiking - embarking in New York in the fall and thus suffering through winter in the Northern Appalachians, then spending the sweltering summer in the Deep South. There are many surprises in this book concerning the people Jenkins met along the way. This is especially true of his run-in with racial prejudice in the Deep South, and his perspective as an extremely nave hippie white boy from up north is rather interesting. In the North Carolina mountains he was harassed by Yankee-hating rednecks who threatened to lynch him. But in the very next town he found shelter with a friendly black family who let him live with them in their cramped trailer home for five months. Jenkins' time with the Oliver family is the best part of this book, even though it interrupted his walk - and his account of his first service at their church is hilarious.Other than meetings with some interesting people, this book cracks under Jenkins' completely juvenile and nave writing style. Examples can be found in odes to his faithful and personality-rich dog Cooper, who was his traveling companion. Try not to gag on lines like \\"my irresistible friend brought, for the thousandth time, a smile like all of sunshine to my face\\" or \\"he and I were going to be together forever!\\" Jenkins is unable to convey any sort of emotion without an over-reliance on exclamation points and remedial platitudes - some examples are \\"Oh! I was mad!\\" and \\"Mobile made me want to sing and shout!\\" This tendency ruins for the reader the truly monumental events in Jenkins' life during his trip - the death of his dog, an unexpected religious conversion, and falling in love with a southern belle. Worst yet is his total lack of insight into his own efforts at soul searching, the freedom of unrestricted travel, or the real America that he was looking for and found. That all makes this book little more than a dry travel diary, and I sure hope that Jenkins' later books show more skill and insight."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I found this book long forgotten on a shelf in an extra bedroom during the holidays. Having read Bill Bryson's &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; several months ago, I thought a good travelogue would be an interesting read. Other reviewers have provided an ample summary of the storyline, but I simply saw this as being a personal travel journal written by a typical recent college grad of his adventures (I wouldn't call him a hippie - weren't we all pseudo hippies at that day and age). The book seemed to be very genuine accounts of his thoughts and exploits - an interesting glimpse for the rest of us - not only of his travels within these geographic regions, but of America and people in general in that day and age. There is certainly no comparison in the writing sophistication of Bryson's excellent book and this first Peter Jennings endeavor, however for light reading (sometimes a little corny and naive), but enough going on to keep you interested and reading, I recommend it. I found it very uplifting and reconfirming as to what America's really like beyond the turbulent newspaper headlines."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I have read A Walk Across America (and A Walk West) so many times, I'm on my third set of paperbacks! I have traveled this great country for years and appreciate Mr. Jenkins' capture of the honest, wonderful spirit and diversity of America and her people. A Walk Across America takes you on a truly uplifting journey."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"A Walk Across America is a different kind of story about a man and his dog in the 1970's. Peter Jenkins id fed up with America and is about ready to head to a foreign country when a friend tells him to take a closer look before he decides to abandon it. So Peter and his dog, Cooper, decide to walk across America. As they travel they meet many wonderful people along the way, with unique stories. There are a few, of course, who do not like them, like a small town who thinks Peter is a drug dealer trying to &quot;grt&quot; their kids. Most, though, like Peter and Cooper and some evern offer them places to stay. This is a true story , an overall good book. I liked hearing the interesting stories of the diierent people Peter me (he wrote the book). If you expecting to hear the whole tale, all the way to the Californian coast, though, you may disappointed, this book only goes about half way there. That's because Peter stopped to write this book. I think people who like interesting, true stories about human nature in general will like this book."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I was buying Peter's new book, LOOKING FOR ALASKA, when I decided to read the reviews on amazon.com for some of his other books.After reading a couple by some people with limited vision I had to write one for his classic A WALK ACROSS AMERICA. This amazing book has been a best seller since 1979, it has sold a couple million copies.The reason is that it obviously communicates extremely effectively and to all ages, all backgrounds, just read the reviews.I know because I used to own one of the most successful bookstores in the midwest. I had autoworkers from GM buying it, professorts at MSU, students at MSU, high school students from town, Grandmothers in reading groups, grown-up hippies, stock traders in their suits.The most powerful and effective communication is done, whether by writing or painting or music or religion even, simply.The Rolling Stones write and perform songs that reach out and grab all. Great artists, religious leaders, writers do the same.Peter Jenkins has done this with A WALK ACROSS AMERICA.Remember Peter is 21 years old when beginning this now famous, yet solitary journey. His book is written from a young persons perspective, yet the masses feel it, love it, and keep buying and buying it.What a rare book this is. The readers have spoken. And now I have had my turn. Peace."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I know it'll be the first thing you do, but if you buy this book, try not to look at the pictures ahead of time. There's a few spoilers there. It's a great book, although the end leaves the reader waiting to hear what's next. Also, reader beware: you will get a bad case of wanderlust about 20 pages into this book."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Personally, I think this may have been Jenkin's best stuff, but in ways I think it fell a bit short. In my opinion, he met few individuals who made me marvel at their craziness, eccentricity, wisdom, courage, patriotism, toughness, gentleness, kindness, etc. His account was interesting and he's a fairly good writer, and I read the whole book and that's saying something. He doesn't try to present himself dishonestly and I didn't sense a spirit of self-aggrandizement. I can't believe there haven't been more who did what he did but did it much better. Personally, in some ways I preferred Walk Across America to Blue Highways, though Blue Highways had some interesting moments. I would like to see someone take off across our nation looking for the most extreme individuals of all types he could find and interview them in some depth. As in extremely courageous, extremely devout, extremely stupid, extremely eccentric, extremely psychotic, extremely patriotic, etc. Now that could yield some fascinating copy. Jenkins went off aimlessly and had a few adventurous moments, met a few interesting people, and told a few endearing stories. I'd like to see a cross between Peter Jenkins and Studs Terkel do the trip. That could be interesting."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"I read Jenkins' book 20+ ears ago. I also had the chance to meet him. I can, honestly say that this book changed my life. He made me so curious about places I'd never seen that my native Ohio seemed pretty small. I worked toward an international career and ended up living in Europe for six years and traveling all over Asia. This is a pretty wonderful world with a lot of wonderful people. Thanks to this book, I got off my butt and went out to see it for myself. Thanks Peter!"},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Everyone has different likes and dislikes so I should not be surprised to read a negatve review of a Walk West. As with A Walk Across America I found it difficult to put it down and go to work or sleep. My family took regular summer vacations to Colorado/New Mexico so I am familier with many of rhe places mentioned in the book. I have camped and rented cabins in the area from Creede to Lake City so it was a personal guided trip to read Peter's descriptions. I have stayed many times at Vickers Ranch in Lake City. I took my book with me one year and Perk Vickers and his wife autographed it for me. The last time I was in Lake City Perk was still living and working. The ranch was up for sale so times change. I try to buy and read all of Peters books. I enjoy his writing style."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"This story is wonderful, a must read. i admire Peter so much, next to \\"the Dove\\" by Robin Graham, this is my favorite book.you can experience the walk along with him as he goes on his journey. the people he meets, the tired feet, sleeping in the rain, all of it, good and bad, you'll feel you've been there yourself by the end of the book.sweet Cooper... the dog. i love dogs. visiting the farm, and all the people and how he is feeling as he walks, is what makes this so good.my darling Norman even liked it, and he hates \\"adventure\\" books!wonderful stuff. i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A walk across America","review":"Everyone should have this book on their shelf. After all these years it is still in print, so that should tell you something! Peter was a hippie disillusioned by America. He decided to set out on a literal walk across America with nothing but his backpack and malamute dog to keep him company. There are, of course, ups and downs to his journey - times of loneliness, sickness, danger, and peril. But he met many wonderful people. Some would surprise you - like a recluse mountain man who turned out to be friendlier than he thought, and a poor black family in the rural south who were very generous and welcomed him into their humble home. He even lived on a cult-like, alternative, free-love \\"farm\\" for while. Peter, at the end of his walk, had a spiritual awakening and his faith in America was re-newed. It is an inspiring story. But does not end here. The next book chronicles his walk west with his new wife!"},{"Title":"Priests and People in Pre-Famine Ireland 1780-1845","review":"It's a sign of how trailblazing Connolly's work was in 1982 that in its updated edition two decades later, that now it reads like the standard word on the subject of popular religious practices and their intersection with matters of rebellion, marriage and sex, folk culture, hierarchical struggles for power, and the relation between the clergy and those they tried to lead.If I had read this in 1982, then, it would have been eye-opening. Now, as his new introduction points out, he's the establishment! Most scholars seem to have accepted his findings, largely based upon the massive amount of archival sources he has exhumed, and Connolly proves tenacious in defending his perspectives.The book thankfully does not lapse into jargon or grudge matches against academic rivals. Largely left to stand on its own, the text proper is revised less, leaving readers needing a catch-up on the issues raised in the past twenty years to turn to Connolly's introduction. While I wish he had taken on the issues he raises in his introduction and worked them back into the original text more, the likely symptom of many scholars--he doesn't want to go back and rewrite his dissertation again--doubtless may be the reason for this selective revision.Readable and detailed, yet never overwhelming the newcomer to 18-19 c.Irish history, this book's the place to start for pre-Famine analyses of the Church."},{"Title":"Justification: The doctrine of Karl Barth and a Catholic reflection;","review":"received the product on time. It was better quality than I expected and a very reasonable price. \\"Justification by Hans Kung\\" thanks: JNA"},{"Title":"Justification: The doctrine of Karl Barth and a Catholic reflection;","review":"Justification has been regarded by many as the articulus stantis aut cadentis ecclesiae. Luther wrote in his Commentary to Galatians (1535): \\"If the article of justification goes, everything goes. It is therefore necessary that we daily stress and strongly urge this article. We can never say that we think about it or hold to it enough or too much.\\" (In reference to Gal 1:3). Barth nevertheless sees it only as a special aspect of the Christian message of salvation; the real article is the confession of Jesus Christ. The eternal foundation of justification is grounded in God's eternity, in the eternal gracious choice of God made in Christ Jesus. The Covenant is the prerequisite for justification. In his Church Dogmatics IV, 1 Barth attacks the Catholic negation (for all practical purposes, even though not a priori) of the unity of grace as always God's grace to man. Catholic theology diversifies too much and emphasizes analogia entis (At this point, Kung makes an objection: does he emphasize grace so much that the human element is sacrificed at the expense of the divine?)Kung suggests that we put Barth's concept of justification thoroughly to the test, then we shall have a basis for comparing it with the Catholic concept.What is Sin? A) Pride, the dark, opposite pole to the kenosis of the Son of God, to Taoist emptiness; B) Sloth, stupidity, to be like \\"the fool\\" in the Proverbs or in Ecclesiastes; inhumanity, or like in Amos' prophecy of judgment; decadence, as in David's lust; C) Lying.With the Formula of Concord, we call man truncus et lapis (a log and a stone) in order to describe his inability to help and save himself, not his ontological status: \\"All the features that make him a man remain\\" (47). Barth revises the Reformation's positions on the freedom of man: servum arbitrium (not liberum), but in a deterministic sense. But if man could not really choose, he would only be a machine. Barth writes (IV, 2) against Trent's human assentire and cooperari with the gratia praeveniens. The practical consequence of this is that the misery of man is not regarded as dramatic. He rejects Anselm's substitutionary atonement (IV, 1, p486-87). Man is an insolvent debtor; there is no relic or core of goodness which persists in man despite of his sin. Justice of man is alien to him: the only justice man can exhibit is the justice of Jesus Christ. Barth also rejects the Reformed idea of limited atonement (IV, I, 630)Justification and sanctification are two quite distinct aspects of ONE divine act: sanctification is not a second divine action that takes place simultaneously with justification or precedes it or follows it in time. Sanctification is:a)participation in the holiness of Jesus Christb)the call to follow himc)an awakening to repentanced)praise given by workse)carrying the crossJustification through sola fides means that no human work as such is or includes man'justification (not even the work of faith as such) and that the believer is the man justified by God. To him justification denotes the divine judgement executed in Christ's death on the cross and revealed on the cross. Barth's second major polemic against Catholic teaching: Trent does not leave intact the sovereign character of justification as a divine work done for man. The Catholic Church does not take seriously the sovereignity of God; it flounders in anthropocentricity. Trent reduces divine justification to a physical process taking place within the human subject (IV,1)As an attempt at a Catholic response (either/or vs. et et). P. 117, Kung argues that Justification is not the central dogma of Christianity: the mystery of Christ is, and of his revelation (his eternal pre-existence). Everything originates and exists in Jesus Christ (Col 1:16). Thus, no autonomous, theoretical and practical naturalism is possible (see De Lubac's The Supernatural). The sinner, who revolts against his being-in-Christ is still in Christ, though in a different manner than that of the justified man (p. 145), who has found in Christ and through Christ the Holy Spirit, the Father, and the infinite and thus completely self-transcendent fulfillment of his being (p. 146)For a description of Scotist and Thomist views of the Incarnation, see p. 168 and ff.The Reformers erred when they conceived of the condition of the sinner as one absolutely without grace (p. 179)About Free Will, see p. 183, 184, 193, 194, 203, 206, 207.Is justification merely forensic (declaration of righteousness) or does it make a man just (renewal)? Kung answers: both. God's word accomplishes what it says. The Council of Trent rejected an exclusively extrinsic character (Rm 2:13; 3:20; 8:33). The massive attack of the Reformers called for an equally massive counter-attack and provoked a certain anthropocentricity in the council (see p. 232).Justification includes a) forgiveness of sins; b) granting the right of the children of God; c) granting the inheritance of eternal lifeCooperari is not in the objective event of salvation (death and resurrection of Jesus), but in the subjective process of salvation. Cooperation not in the sense of collaboration but of involvement: no synergism in which God and man pull the same rope. It is never as if justification came partly from God and partly from man. Justification is not identified with salvation, which follows it. See p. 271, 272, 281-84.Oh, by the way: and the reason why the previous two idiots who read my review did not find it helpful is........?"},{"Title":"Justification: The doctrine of Karl Barth and a Catholic reflection;","review":"This book is an intricate argument about justification, which is easily associated with those who are righteous in a juridical sense. But this book is about a theological sense, in which the grace of God makes justification a gift to sinners. The argument is old, springing from the author's examination of the concept of justification in CHURCH DOGMATICS by Karl Barth, a multi-volume work published in English in the years 1936-62, according to the Bibliography (p. 304), from original German volumes dated 1932 to 1955. (p. 303). The American edition of JUSTIFICATION by Hans Kung has a Preface dated August, 1964. Barth is accused of petrifying the teachings of the Catholic Church (p. 103) because he picks an argument with the Council of Trent that condemned Martin Luther as heretical on this issue. Adolf von Harnack, in a book published in 1910, wrote of the decree which was issued on January 13, 1547, &quot;Although it is a work of artifice, the decree on justification is in many respects admirably worked out.&quot; (p. 105).A number of languages show up in this book. Titles in the Bibliography tend to be in German, Latin, or French. Discussions of scripture sometimes include the Greek and Hebrew terms which appeared in the earliest versions. Using the list of Greek words in the back of YOUNG'S ANALYTICAL CONCORDANCE TO THE BIBLE, I was able to find that the Greek words associated with Catholic in this book approximate a Greek word in Acts 4:18.&quot;In fact, Catholic teaching is too Catholic (kappa alpha theta' omicron lambda omicron nu) to be readily spotted in any one place, for it still lays claim to all truth.&quot; (p. 111).If the last letter had been upsilon, which looks much like nu, the word would be the same as AT ALL used in the decree in Jerusalem against the teaching of Peter and John in Acts 4: 18: &quot;So they called them and commanded them not to speak AT ALL nor teach in the name of Jesus.&quot;The author of this book is a priest who is a German theologian, but in 1980 the Vatican declared that he could no longer be considered a Catholic theologian. The history of this kind of conflict, from the time of the Reformation, is the main topic of JUSTIFICATION: THE DOCTRINE OF KARL BARTH AND A CATHOLIC REFLECTION. The English translation includes a letter from Karl Barth dated 31 January, 1957, acknowledging how well this book accords with his own views. Anyone who has a solid foundation in religious thinking ought to be able to appreciate the situation of the author, who is free to embrace as much thought as his mind can hold, only to be warned in 1980 that such thinking does not reflect Catholic theology simply because it appeals to him. What does he know? Part Two of this book is called: An Attempt at a Catholic Response. Considering Holy Scripture as the principle source of Catholic theology in Chapter 20, Christocentricity in Chapter 21, Creation in Chapter 22, forbearance and grace in Chapter 23, the incapacity of every form of self-justification in Chapter 24, Grace as Graciousness in Chapter 27, and embracing Essential change in Chapter 31, it is not difficult to see how the Vatican might question which side the author was on. This translation was published in 1964, long before the Vatican made its declaration in 1980 that its author was not totally committed to church doctrine.I consider this book highly scholarly. It is prone to lose those who are not familiar with each element of its argument. There are only 17 entries in the list of Abbreviations on page xvii, before the main explanation, &quot;Karl Barth's CHURCH DOGMATICS is cited with volume and page numbers thus: IV/1, 355.&quot; That does not explain what LXX means in Chapter 28, The Declaration of the Sinner's Justice. Possibly it covers a ten-year period, 70-79 A.D. or even 61-70 A.D., in which Paul was writing Romans 3.20, obviously the subject of the following comment: &quot;It is significant, as Zorell says, that [delta iota kappa alpha iota omicron upsilon nu] in the LXX generally means forensic justification. On this cf. the Pauline citation in Rom. 3.20 with Ps. 143.2.&quot; (p. 209). If that does not ring any bells for you, consider the following comment, in a list of &quot;some hints as to what can be said in favor of the forensic meaning of the word DIKAIOUN, especially in Pauline usage: . . .

It sticks to theology. There isn't even an entry in the index for Kant, but Hegel is mentioned on four pages. As you might know, &quot;Barth has assimilated, especially through the theology of Schleiermacher, the whole development from Kant through Fichte and Schelling to Hegel. He has also drawn upon later Protestant theology, particularly that of Overbeck, Feuerbach, Strauss, and especially the theological existentialism of his own teacher, Herrmann.&quot; (p. 3).

(The other two books were \\"The Dallas Family Album\\" and \\"The Ewings of Dallas\\" novelization.)

It's not any real substance, just some \\"Dallas\\" fun!"},{"Title":"The Way to Paradise : A Novel","review":"If Mario Vargas Llosa had not lost the election to Alberto Fujimori in the late 1980s and had become president of Peru, it's interesting to imagine how that country would be faring today. What we do know is that the literary world would have missed this writer of intelligent, politically-influenced fiction. With \\"Feast of the Goat\\" and now with \\"The Way to Paradise,\\" Vargas Llosa turns his astute gaze to Europe and the Pacific, and demonstrates that he can write masterfully about cultures and countries other than his own.In the new book he traces the life of painter Paul Gauguin and his grandmother, the socialist feminist Flora Tristan. Set in France and the South Pacific with a brief sojourn in Peru, he charts the courses of two related people who never knew each other, and whose lives were similar in that they found the conventions of their times impossible to live with.Flora Tristan grew up in poverty as the illegitimate daughter of a French mother and a Peruvian father. Her marriage was abusive and she escaped her husband to reinvent herself as a popular writer and campaigner for workers' rights. Despite failing health, she tours the small towns of France recruiting members for her Workers' Union. Her grandson Paul abandons his large family and friendship with other painters to escape to Tahiti to paint. Riddled with syphilis, his health is failing as well.Natasha Wimmer's translation is excellent. There are scenes that glow with the golden light of Arles or sting with the scent of the sea. Where \\"Paradise\\" misses the mark is through an irritating literary device where rhetorical questions or comments are made of the characters in the second person: \\"Was it because of the woman in Panama that your vision was weakened, your heart was failing, and your legs were covered with pustules?\\" or: \\"You would later remember those two hours of absurd debate, Florita.\\" You get the idea. It adds nothing to the narrative and is a jarringly false step from such a sure-footed writer."},{"Title":"The Way to Paradise : A Novel","review":"At first glance, The Way To Paradise is a classic example of Mario Vargas Llosa's style: interesting and unusual characters, colorful settings, poetic prose. The book even uses Mr. Vargas Llosa's preferred device of switching between narratives in alternating chapters as he did with such great success in Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter and The Feast of the Goat, among others.But in the end, I think, the story falls well short of those other two wonderful books, for a variety of reasons that left me puzzled.First, I'll add my name to the chorus of reviewers who were left confused by Mr. Vargas Llosa's decision to pepper his narrative with second-hand comments from the book's two main characters (especially with Flora Trist&aacute;n, who seems to ask herself at least once every page something like &quot;but you could not have known that, could you, Flora?&quot;).More importantly, the style of alternating chapters between the story of Ms. Trist&aacute;n, a 19th century social reformer, and her grandson Paul Gauguin, the painter, doesn't work nearly as well here as it does elsewhere. That is mostly because the two stories have very little to do with each other. Ms. Trist&aacute;n and Mr. Gauguin were related -- though they never met each other -- but aside from a few passing and insignificant comments by Mr. Gauguin about his grandmother, one story line never crossed. Are you interested in the story of Ms. Trist&aacute;n's epic battle to mobilize workers in France in the 1840s? Then read the odd-numbered chapters. Do you prefer the story of the famous painter of Tahiti and Tahitians around the turn of the 20th Century? Then skip the odd and read only the even-numbered installments.The one common thread between the two narratives is hinted at in the title: in their own way, both Ms. Trist&aacute;n and Mr. Gauguin spend their lives trying to reach a certain kind of paradise. In the case of the former, it's through trying to create a kind of workers' paradise in which women and laborers are protagonists. In the case of the latter, it is through fleeing the closed art world of Paris in the 1880s for the paradise of Tahiti, where Mr. Gauguin felt the savage and pure soul of mankind was still bare to see. But in the end, all both characters find is frustration and, of course, death.Days after finishing the book, it is both characters' deaths that stick with me the most. Mr. Vargas Llosa describes their physical declines with horrible consistency. The biting and consuming gut pains that crippled Ms. Trist&aacute;n upset my own stomach. And the periodic descriptions of the insects attracted to the foul-smelling puss dripping from Mr. Gauguin's syphilis sores more than once left a bitter scowl on my face.Mr. Vargas Llosa does deserve kudos for the way he brings two distant and distinct historical characters to life, his second consecutive historical novel in which mounds of research make the actual history seem at once central and effortless. If you are a fan of Mr. Vargas Llosa's work, you'll no doubt find plenty to enjoy in The Way To Paradise. But to everyone else, I'd recommend one of the author's real top-shelf efforts. There are plenty to pick from."},{"Title":"The Way to Paradise : A Novel","review":"I had waited to read this book since hearing about it. I was not disappointed. Vargas Llosa is most masterful in describing the life of Flora Tristan, the little known early 19th century century women's and worker's rights activits. I hope this book will help renew interest in this fascinating woman. While the prose style of moving back and forth between Tristan and her grandson the painter Gauguin may appear difficult at first, it is materful in execution. Vargas Llosa has a brilliant manner in covering time, allowing for flashbacks to many important events in his main characters lives. Flora Tristan and Paul Gauguin each found &quot;The Way to Paradise&quot; in a unique way. I felt much more sympathy for Tristan, who faced numerous injustices and fought for a cause. Gauguin, while a brilliant artist, comes across as a bit crazed at the end. One does leave this work wondering more about Flora's daughter (and Gauguin's mother) Aline -- the one interconnecting person between these two. Reviews have not highlighted the fact that Vargas Llosa, who was born in Arequipa, Peru, is, as I understand, a descendant of one of Flora's Tristan uncles, though not the Uncle Pio, who played a crucial role in disinheriting Flora. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the personalities of these fascinating individuals. However, it is written as fiction, and I felt fortunate to have previously read portions of David Sweetman's brilliant biography &quot;Paul Gauguin, A Complete Life&quot;, since it presented a factual context for both Flora and Gauguin's lives."},{"Title":"The Way to Paradise : A Novel","review":"Where Vargas Llosa simply shines, again, is in the very telling of these lives, his writing continues to mature becoming so much its own and, at the same time, achieving such transparence that the reader is left to be with the novel's characters, Paul Gauguin and Flora Tristan, without an overwhelming author's voice to guide her or him -something that even great writers could find so easy to indulge in.Whether biographical accuracy is respected or not, it is truly irrelevant. This is a novel, and it is free to ponder on more important things than that.This is the story of human beings, almost a century apart, facing their own forms of finding paradise, perhaps the kind of paradise that Arthur Rimbaud called \\"Christmas on earth,\\" if not bliss, a certain peace that can only come after giving yourself over to the vision where desire may reign without stifling moral constrains or the vision of a society where its moral principle is justice. Flora and Paul, in their own circumstances, are devoted to seeing the glory of their visions which they long for, and suffer from, all their lives.For Flora it's the restless fight for having women finally considered peers to men. Her body agonizing exhausted with the little progress that her words can manage even among leaders of Utopian groups.For Gauguin it is painting nothing less than epiphany after epiphany, following a God who created and blesses the most essential ways of life. For him, this is what he travels to the Pacific Islands for. He's a Christian longing to be a \\"savage\\" -this is longing that has become his form of agony.It is interesting that both bodies suffer greatly from what their souls pursue. Also, one can conclude that, if these two ever met they would likely be at odds with each other, fail to see anything but an enemy before them.These are not people to be liked or cherished necessarily, specially Gauguin, yet they are to be understood for the genuine tenor of their passions, loved enough to have them teach you their own truths.Vargas Llosa, like Coetzee or Kundera, continues to deepen his craft and chance his reputation to pushing the boundaries of contemporary fiction, so willing these days to hail formulas. This alone, is remarkable.Please, read this novel and be enriched by Flora Tristan, by Paul Gauguin, and even more profoundly, by Mario Vargas Llosa."},{"Title":"The Way to Paradise : A Novel","review":"You probably already read some of the previous (great) reviews. I do agree with most of what was written so I will not be repeating that information. But I do give you a tip; buy, or borrow a book of Paul Gauguin's art, and read this novel watching the paintings. Then you will realize the great descriptions Mr. Llosa gives of the paintings and their meaning. It's Stunning.As for the second person references, it isn't that anoying, although at the end they are a little too common; but somehow they give you a link with Flora and Paul, maybe an empathic link.The characters are very well researched, realistic, with lots of flaws (like everyone) and hopes, past mistakes, glorious victories... but with one common goal - the search for paradise."},{"Title":"The Way to Paradise : A Novel","review":"I rarely read novels more than once. There are some I have read several times, but the list might just run to double figures. I have read The Way To Paradise by Mario Vargas Llosa twice, but not for the usual reasons. First time though I was so disappointed with the book that I thought I had to be mistaken. So I waited a few months and read it again. Second time through I enjoyed it much more but, on finishing it, I had many of the same reservations as I did first time round.The Way To Paradise juxtaposes two stories which, in essence, deal with how people pursue ideals. It identifies the inevitable selfishness associated with a person's obsession to achieve, how pragmatism and compromise inevitably dictate daily routine, and how fate, unpredictable and unyielding, has the ultimate say on all of our endeavours.The two stories of The Way To Paradise are related by family. One describes how the French painter, Paul Gaugin, left his job as a mildly successful stockbroker to pursue his dream of becoming an artist. A closet painter while he acted out the humdrum of nine to five to provide for his thoroughly and properly domesticated Danish wife and five children, Paul Gaugin drooled over canvases by impressionist painters such as Manet. The latter's nude depiction of Olympia played a significant role in crystallising Gaugin's ambitions. A provocative and highly erotic painting it is, for sure. What Gaugin did not know, it seems, was that the sitter shared the name of his grandmother's lesbian lover. It would add poignancy to the story if the painting's subject was actually the grandmother's lover, but the decades don't add up.Flora Tristan, Paul Gaugin's grandma, was born into potential wealth. But she was illegitimate, her wealthy Peruvian father having sired her via a poor French mother. So she grew up in poverty. She marries. She hates sex, abhorring everything to do with the act, so the marriage to an impatient husband does not last. There is a child, but there is also violence, threats, public scenes and estrangement. Flora takes up the struggle for women's rights, workers' rights and socialism. She dresses as a man to research the experience of prostitutes. She travels from town to town giving presentations and speeches to guilds, assemblies of the poor and groups of women.Both Paul Gaugin and Flora Tristan travel. The artist, of course, as we all know, went to live on various Pacific islands, where he painted most of the works that now make him famous. But at the time, the experience was far from idyllic. Having wanted to escape the constricting conventions and conservatism of France, he found it reincarnated in the officialdom that dealt with him, his poverty, and his illness, syphilis, which rendered him smelly, pussy and unsightly. On can only imagine what his grandmother would have thought of his processing of local women, whom he painted, infected, made pregnant and then deserted, sometimes in that order. The grandson was doing what the grandmother would have despised, derided. But then the women on the receiving end weren't Europeans, were they?Flora travelled to Peru in an attempt to claim the inheritance of her birthright. In South America, with colonial heritage all around, she brushed shoulders with the rich, with a way of life she could only dream about in Europe. The experience galvanised her, created the resolution to seek change, a resolve that drove her through her remaining years, prompted her to write, to seek self-expression that might widen and convince her audience.And so both grandmother and grandson pursue their own ideals, never consciously attaining them, of course, but the pursuit, like the life that bears it, is the point. The process is the end, the product merely existence.In reviewing The Way To Paradise I find I have taken much more from the book than I thought. I had problems with the style in that its unidentified narrator constantly seemed to address Flora and Paul directly, referred to them as \`you', almost implying that they were acquaintances. On reflection, that might be part of the book's point, in that celebrity renders those who possess it the friends of anyone. Both characters are thus part of our own common history. We already know them as Paul and Flora. In the case of Paul Gaugin, however, we meet a much lauded, selfish, self-obsessed, perhaps, painter whom everyone recognises. In Flora Tristan, Mario Vargas Llosa tells us, we have a member of the same family who ought to be known better than she is. In contrast with her grandson, however, her selflessness, her energy, her purity, paradoxically, identify her as a figure worthy of respect, worthy of history. The Way To Paradise was clearly worth its second read."},{"Title":"The Way to Paradise : A Novel","review":"A book in the genre of \\"Agony and Ecstasy\\" and \\"Lust for Life\\", this part-fact and part-fiction story (or novel?) is based on the life of the painter Paul Gauguin and that of his grandmother Flora Tristan.The book's chapters alternate between the lives of Gaugin and Tristan trying to draw a common thread between their seemingly uncommon lives.Though Gauguin is obviously better known of the 2 characters, Llosa's novel does well to bring to light the life and work of his illustrious socialist grandmother who devoted her life to the upliftment of the women.Each of the two central characters (adventurers in their own sense) are searching for paradise - the grandmother by trying to change the world and the grandson by escaping from his world. The question the reader is forced to ask is \\"Did both of them discover their respective paradises?\\"An extremely fast and engrossing read though it took me three chapters to figure out the writers style of writing (referring to the characters in second person) and his oscillation between the events in the lives of the two protagonists.

In fact, for those who have not read his books, this book may be the best place to start.The book tells the parallel stories of Ms Tristan - a social reformer of the 19th century who fought for worker's and women's rights- and her grand son, Paul Gaughin- the post-impressionist painter. The story tells of the lady's journey in the various parts of France spreading her message, interpersed with her experiences (as the ilegitimate child of athe peruvian landed aristocracy, a forced marriage).

It makes for a very rewarding read, even if as a novel it is hampered in one or two ways.The two plot lines never converge, and chapters alternate between the protagonists - switching, for instance, from Flora's rejection of some suitor or her activism in France, to an episode from Gauguin's time in Provence or Polynesia. Their lives never intersected significantly, so thematic connections must provide the book's unity. I consider it unlikely that our multilingual author actually approved this translation of his title as 'The Way to Paradise: A Novel'. His original reads literally as 'The Paradise on the Other Corner' - which is nowhere as wooden, and is far more eloquent. After all, it conjures the elusive goals that each protagonist pursues in a challenging but largely indifferent world.Both protagonists flouted conventions while trying to realize their aspirations, but each one comes to a solitary, painful end. In other ways they are near opposites: Gauguin was near-priapic, while Flora Trist&aacute;n found most sex repellent; social inequities drove her to passionate activism, while he was either indifferent to or deeply complicit in his world's injustices.The novel's dual structure not only raises an issue about its cohesiveness, but also the added difficulty that one plot line may be of greater interest than the other: beginning each new chapter, readers will inevitably welcome returning to their preferred plot or regret having to wade through another one before that. Other literary devices pose further challenges or distractions for readers, since they raise unintended questions such as: Is there a reason why this episode follows the previous chapter? Is some symmetry intended in the sequence of chapters? Another very important issue is: What solution will Vargas Llosa conjure to unravel how the narrator speaks (in the second person) to his protagonists ...and will it be satisfying? Unless some kind of gratification emerges from a resolution of these queries they tend to undermine the reader's engagement, blurring our focus on the novel's characters and their doings.Others in this forum have commented on the second-person remarks that intrude on the narrative, thereby raising questions about their speaker's identity. The narrator addresses Gauguin and Flora, sometimes in almost reproachful or nagging tones: \\"Was it your ill health that made you so impatient?\\", \\"...Te gust&oacute;, Andaluza, cuando te halagaba...?\\", etc. One may understandably begin to expect some crafty, Nabokovian solution to resolve these periodic metafictional interpolations - perhaps some revelation that the narrator is, for instance, a relative of both protagonists, perhaps performing some kind of review of their lives. But that hope is dashed: the source of all the remarks is, simply, an intruding Vargas Llosa.His adoption of this overt role in his artifact, his novel, could, of course, reflect Vargas Llosa's wish to escape third-person narrative forms, mirroring how Gauguin and Trist&aacute;n also railed against convention. Or he may regard these interventions into both narratives as providing the bridge they so clearly lack. Whatever the case, his intentions remain opaque, and the puzzlement never entirely vanishes. Then again, Vargas Llosa's writing has seldom gravitated toward iron-clad plots or fanciful devices: his literature has always ventured to explore history, and the untidy grit and sinew of human action - precisely the domain of this novel.He takes another curious liberty by articulating his characters' mental goings-on. This toys even further with the readers' suspension of disbelief, since these thoughts are ascribed to historical figures, not merely the author's figments. While probably supported by his research, their presentation as mental musings - rather than as correspondence, for instance, or as someone's say-so - suggests an omniscience that biographical works generally, and quite sensibly avoid. Streams-of-consciousness belong in fiction but not in biography, so muddying this line calls on readers to decide yet again if it 'works,' or if something is being violated.One or two chapters get weighed down by these soliloquies and the intruding narrator, although most are full of engrossing, well-spun incident. Good story-telling always attends to the question: '...and then what happened?' This book does this, and well, shining brightest with historical narrative and fiction, Vargas Llosa's m&eacute;tier. His account of Flora's times in an Arequipan nunnery, and in 1850s London and Parisian slums, raise her story close to the level of the Gauguin narrative. La Mariscala, an intriguing Amazon-warrior in Peru's 19th century civil wars, is also vividly portrayed, and Vargas Llosa chisels a fine, stony portrait of Gauguin's sexless wife, the Nordic \\"Vikinga,\\" whom he leaves with their kids so as to run off to Polynesia after his primitivist ideals - including the young Polynesian girls he beds even during his gradual putrefaction to death by syphilis. Along with the development of the central characters, all of these are handled masterfully.My reservations arise while recognizing Vargas Llosa as among our foremost living writers. This is not my favorite of his novels, but it offers rich rewards. Among an array of options, no doubt he considered two thematically-linked novellas rather than one long, dual novel - and by my reckoning, he chose wrong.

This work counterpoints these two figures. There is an extraordinary feature that the author. Mario Vargas Llosa, a noble prize winner, is from Peru, and that Gauguin's grandmother was of Peruvian and French extraction. Llosa himself, in all his works including this one, feels the tension for a \\"mestizo\\" of the counterpoint between the European and Indigenous cultures that runs within his veins, and exploring the \\"mind\\" of Gauguin painting in Tahiti living between European and Maori cultures is poignant.

This one I should have skipped. I like Vargas Llosa's writing style, but here the alternate narrators didn't work well.The two protagonists, Paul Gauguin and his grandmother Flora Tristan lived a generation apart and the narrator alternated chapters between them. Each narration was in third person, but often this \\"outside narrator\\" spoke to the character directly, such as:\\"you didn't know that, did you Paul?\\" This was jarring, and only served to confuse the reader rather than advance the story.Not only did I not like the writing style, but I didn't care for either Gauguin or his grandmother. Flora Tristan was a union advocate and a speaker for workers' rights, and although I'm sure she was real, she was not a believable character. Paul Gauguin came across as a total degenerate. I didn't like him at all and to me, even his art wasn't enough to save him. He was everything his grandmother Flora was against, and I think she would have disliked him as much as I did.Had this been the first book I read by Vargas Llosa, it would have been the last.

I hoped that The Way to Paradise would be helpful in this regard.I got more than I expected. The book is actually a novel based on the lives of two people, Flora Tristan, Gauguin's grandmother, as well as Gauguin. Each is told from the perspective of their final years, with flashback reflections. Chapters alternate looking at the two lives. At first, that seemed like a distraction. But later, the artistic design became clearer. Flora Tristan would not have approved of her grandson, and he comes across even less sympathetically than I expected in the context of his family heritage. Although I picked up details about Gauguin that I wanted to learn about the context for his final works, I learned a lot about a remarkable woman about whom I would like to learn more, his grandmother.Flora Tristan's life epitomizes the evils of the legal system and popular attitudes towards women in those waning decades before women began to earn equal rights. Because her parents' marriage was not a legal one, she could not inherit her father's wealth. Her husband was a brute who was not legally restrained after he committed many wrongs against her and her children . . . but only after he shot her. So she led much of her adult life like Jean Valjean, on the run from the laws which would have returned her and her children to the abuser. In the process, she developed a remarkable sensitivity to the downtrodden, including other women, slaves and industrial workers. She often dressed as a man to go places where women were not allowed or to pursue her goals of social reform. During a visit to England, she was encouraged by the Chartist movement to imagine a European-wide coalition of workers that would lead to reform. In pursuing her hopes for creating a better life on earth, she spent her final months while very ill recruiting workers for her union despite official resistance to her proselytizing. In one remarkable sequence, she traveled alone to Peru from France in hopes of gaining some of her father's estate.The book focuses on Gauguin's life from the time he first set out for Tahiti. You find out more about his interest in the native customs and his relationships with the people there than about his art. The story focuses on his physical and mental deterioration as syphilis ravaged his body. Despite warnings that he was infectious, he sought sexual gratification from a series of young women (and any other woman who would make herself available). He comes across as the worst sort of abuser, the sort his grandmother would have hated. His vision was of a primitive past that was more fundamental and pure than the present, to be found in expired Maori practices that he cannot contact.The contrast between the two lives is very powerful beginning around the middle of the book. Until then, I was often puzzled by why the book developed that way.I found two things to be unpleasant about reading the book. First, the author assumed that I knew a lot more about Gauguin's life than I did. So many of the early details were only revealed in flashbacks near the end of the book. They would have been much more interesting and relevant if portrayed much earlier. The flashbacks themselves were put in as extended ruminations about the past. As such, these flashbacks didn't work well in some cases. They made both characters seem overly introspective. Gauguin, in particular, struck me as someone who was probably not very introspective at all.Second, there is a lot of editorializing that comes in like an awkward third character. In most cases, the editorializing seems to add nothing to thoughts I had already had . . . such as how a married man acquired syphilis. I suspect that it would have worked better to have either skipped writing these sections or to have them develop as part of dialogue with another character. Here's an example: &quot;The game of Paradise! You had yet to find that slippery place, Koki. Did it exist? Was it an illusion, a mirage?&quot;The immense number of details about daily life of the two main characters is impressive. With those details, you feel closer to the characters than you could have imagined considering that they led much different lives than most of us do now.I was pleased to find that the book described the circumstances around the creation of many of the art works that I was most interested in. Unfortunately, the author doesn't seem to have the background in art to fully engage in describing the artistic processes that Gauguin used. Such a focus would have made the book much more appealing to me.So, despite my reservations, I do encourage you to read the book.When you finish, think about where you see the potential for paradise."},{"Title":"The Way to Paradise : A Novel","review":"I remember as a young man reading The Moon and The Six Pence by Somerset Maugham and being intriged by the persona of Gauguin , and now Mario Vargas Llosa took me to another level of Gauguin's life and I am impressed by such a good novel , connecting Gauguin , Gauguin's grandmother , France , Peru and Tahiti with such finese and style . A book worth reading as history , social evolution and the Lost Paradise we look for in Religion ( Is Not There , Believe Me ) . By the way , if U want to know where Paradise went , read The Story of B , by Daniel Quinn .

But, it is very confusing at first due to Llosa's style of writing. There seems to be a narrator as well as the dialogue from the characters. I got used to it after a while, but didn't care for it at all. Very annoying. Some people have referred to this as second person writing and third person writing. Based on this style, I'll not read any other of Llosa's works.In spite of the lousy writing style, it was interesting to hear more about Gauguin's possible reasons for his use of color, images, locations, etc. And, his grandmother's story was worth hearing about."},{"Title":"Virus: The Alien Strain","review":"Author David Jay Brown does it again - a wild and wicked trip into the secret places of our mind through a delicious fantasyland of science fiction.

It was extremely difficult to get through the book because not only was the plot an absolute bore, the characters also contributed to that boredom.After reading the book twice, trying to comprehend what was the point of the story, I still have yet to understand why Charlotte Bront even bothered writing this book. From what I can interpret, Jane Eyre is a girl who is lonely and dejected but finds love in a man called Mr. Rochester. Everything that happened in the middle is not significant. The story is extremely boring because it is too sentimental, too dull (just like Jane Eyre), and too long for a story with that plot line. What the characters say or do have no lasting effect in the reader's memory- it just blows right by. The characters are basic and have superficial, unoriginal motives. They do not do anything exciting or significant to help add to the plot. I kept skipping pages or rereading the same stuff because each and every page seems identical content-wise. The entire book has absolutely no memorable moments, proving how insignificant the work of literature truly is. Reading the book is a world of pain.If you are thinking about picking up this book and reading, save yourself the time and money, and go read something else worthwhile."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Reading this book was about as pleasant as a throwing knife to the face. I am going to be a senior in high school next year, and I just finished this book for my summer assignments for AP Literature. I literally took a victory lap around my house upon completion. I HATED this book. It was boring and rather pointless. No one cares about the romantic struggles of a fake character. This is basically the chick flick of books. I honestly believe this is the worst book I've ever read.

Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels.

There at Gateshead Hall, she is horribly mistreated by the Reeds, against the dying wish of her Uncle Reed.At the age of 10, Jane is accepted to Lowood School after being interviewed by the schools owner: Mr. Brocklehurst. Jane takes an instant disliking to him, and when she arrives at the school, he stands Jane on a pedestal and tells everyone that she is a liar, which is not true. She later proves to everyone that she is not a liar. During her time at the school, Jane meets a girl named Helen Burns. They immediately become best friends, to the very end. Sadly, this end comes all too soon. Helen is one of the 7 fatal cases during the typhus epidemic at the school. Jane remains at the school for a good 10 years, 2 of which were spent as a teacher, until she advertised as a governess.Jane's advertisement is answered by a Mrs. Fairfax, of Thornfeild Hall. Jane arrives to meet her pupil: Adel&eacute;, a French little girl, who was left to Mr. Rochester by her mother. Mr. Rochester is the master of the Thornfeild estate, and first meets Jane when she assists him and his spooked horse on a lane one afternoon. By this time, Jane has been at Thornfeild for a few months. Mrs. Fairfax had previously informed Jane that she will rarely see Mr. Rochester, as he sometimes leaves for days, weeks or even months at a time. Mr. Rochester then accuses her of being a witch and casting a spell on his horse, and then asks her some questions, learning that she is his newly appointed governess.When Jane returns to Thornfeild Hall, she sees the dog she encountered earlier, and discovers that the stranger from the road is Mr. Rochester himself when he calls for her later that evening.Evening talks become a daily habit, and both characters fondness for each other grows...One night, Mr. Rochester returns home with group of friends he has invited to stay. There Jane meets Blanche Ingram, one of the many people who treat her as if she is a servant, whom everyone expects Mr. Rochester will marry, although she is only attracted to his money.That night, another guest, Mr. Mason, is badly injured, but Jane is not told how, only that she must care for his wounds in silence until the doctor arrives. Jane assumes this has to do with the strange and violent Grace Poole.During Jane's stay at Thornfeild, Jane witnesses a series of strange happenings, as well as a strange laugh she will hear periodically at night. These are said to be the doings of a drunken servant named Grace Poole.Jane then receives a letter from Gateshead Hall, telling her that Mrs. Reed is requesting Jane to come visit her on her death bed. There she learns that a distant Uncle Eyre wished to adopt Jane, but Mrs. Reed replied saying that Jane died in the Typhus epidemic.Jane returns from Gateshead Hall 3 weeks late because of funeral arrangements for her aunt to an anxious Mr. Rochester, who feared her to never return. Later, in the garden, he asks Jane to marry him, and she gladly accepts, to the dismay of Mrs. Fairfax.The wedding was interrupted by a man who announced that Mr. Rochester was already married! Mr. Rochester then confesses as he brings the wedding attendees up to his attic. There he shows everyone his \\"wife:\\" Bertha Mason, an insane and deadly violent woman, looked over by Grace Poole. She is kept there because Mr. Rochester doesn't have the heart to send her to an asylum.In her dismay, Jane runs away from Thornfeild Hall. Leaving her belongings in a stage coach by accident, she has no other option other than to become a beggar or die on the streets.She finnally is taken into the Rivers residence. Here St. John, and his 2 sisters care for her, and she becomes like one of the family. She later learns that John Eyre (the uncle from the letter) has died and left Jane his fortune. During this, she learns that the Rivers are her cousins. She shares the fortune with them.St. John repeatedly asks her to marry him and join him as a missionary during her time there. They both know he does not love her, but he thinks Jane would be a good missionary wife.One night, Jane hears Mr. Rochester's voice calling to her, and runs from St. Johns house to Thornfeild Hall. There she finds the estate burned to the ground. Bertha had set fire to it and Mr. Rochester was blinded when he unsuccessfully tried to save her life.Jane and Mr. Rochester, never losing any feelings for each other during their time apart, then marry."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I really enjoyed this novel.

I have read it quite a few times and I have enjoyed it each time. Actually Charlotte Bronte was being quite daring in creating this heroine. Jane was a new development in fiction during the time of the writing of this novel (1847). Jane was intelligent, passionate and totally unconventional. The other characters in this novel are just as memorable. Who can forget Rochester - broody, moody, and somewhat sinister? The plot of the book is exciting and it carries the reader along with a sense of urgency. This is an enduring novel that I continue to love and enjoy."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"A true classic. In this not so typical love story, the heroine, Jane Eyre is unlike any other. As opposed to the archetypal heroine, Jane is simple in both demeanor and appearance. She is a modest young woman who has been raised with much turmoil and tragedy, but despite this is able to deeply care for others. A deep and mysterious romance develops between Jane and Mr. Rochester, the man whom employs her as a governess. But will it last? Will a mystifying secret destroy their relationship and leave Jane with another emotional scar? This book is quite the page-turner, you will not be able to put it down for the anticipation of what comes next. Bronte evokes strong, intimate emotions within the reader that give hope and motivation to love in life to the fullest. The character of Jane proves that any one can be a heroine, no matter what your physical appearance or character, that any woman is capable of being loved and of vast romance.

Jane is a very defined character, and although some of what happens is unlikely to the point of being almost unrealistic, it seemed to make sense.The only complaint I have is that I felt, many times, like I needed a French dictionary at my side. When Jane talks to Adele, and occasionally other people, it is usually in French, with no translation whatsoever.But since it was written in a time when most educated people took French, what can you expect?I would suggest publishers put footnotes with translations. The French is not, perhaps, very important to the story line (not that I would know), but it really bothered me to have no idea what they were saying."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I was a little apprehensive to read this book at first because it was written in the 19th century, and I speculated that it would not be an easy read. I figured that I would give it a try though, and I am glad that I did. Jane Eyre is the best book I have ever read.It is a love story, but not in the typical sense of traditional romances. It incorporates an actual plot line as to how two characters fall in love over a long period of time and follows through the depths of despair and joy. The twisting of conflicts and happiness throughout the story leave the reader laughing and crying, and never being able to predict an outcome.Jane Eyre has a well-developed plot that includes rounded characters whom the reader comes to identify with. Bronte's heroine, Jane, (who also narrates the book) is a believable character because she is not exceedingly intellectual, she is not beautiful, she is not wealthy, yet she is autonomous and strong-willed, unlike Jane Austen's heroines (i.e. Emma Woodhouse), who are invariably the opposite. Although Jane is simple and modest, her life is full of constant suffering. She is easy to like because of these characteristics, just as some of the other characters are easy not to like because of their own unique characteristics.Bronte highlights certain aspects in this novel that people of the 19th century went through and experienced through the depiction of Jane's own life: being poverty-stricken, being orphaned, being unwanted, being plain, or being driven insane with the unattainable. This book not only gives the reader a deeper sense of the past, but also allows him to empathize for people that lived in it, and therefore to empathize with Jane.Each time I read Jane Eyre I cry over and over again. It is a fantastic piece of work that should be read by everyone. Truly a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I have read it twice, and I LOVE IT!!!

Classics are hard to get into, and maybe the first chapter was slow but at the same time ghostly.I picked out few faults and though I'm an inexperienced school girl I haven't read many more books which were so intense, an yet somehow managed to keep the reader on tenterhooks.How real life her writing is, but at the same time supernatural. For me, Jane Eyre is a living person and she always will be."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"In short, Jane Eyre is the story of a fairly unconventional life.

She falls in love with Mr. Rochester but his secrets may make it imposible for them to ever be together.The book has a really slow, melodic feel to it, so if you like fast reads, it is not the book you're looking for.This is one of the best books I have ever read, so good its one of few that I have actually read several times over. Definately a classic."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful and captivating book. Once you start it you just gotta finish it!The best part of Jane Eyre (pronounced \\"air\\") is the love story between Jane and Edward, her employer. Edward keeps a dark secret , the nature of which isn't telegraphed but instead thrust upon the reader all at once (very well done!!!), that makes him both penurious and tragic. This makes him a somewhat odd match for Jane who is the epitome of virtue and is self denying. The cat and mouse play in the begining of their relationship, the way they individually struggle after the secret is revealed, and the ultimate resolution of their love story makes this one of the greatest novels in Engish literature.This brings me to the movie. It isn't a very good adaptation of the book. Major parts of the plot are missing or altered beyond recognition and signifigance. I watched the movie AFTER I read the book and was glad I did it in that order. Their are some stories that just have to be read in order for you to enjoy them;Jane Eyre is one of them (David Copperfield is another). But that's o.k., Charlotte Bronte has provided us with a tale that mesmerizes and impacts its reader like few others can. If it comes down to the movie or the book...read the book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I recently finished Jane Erye and I couldn't bear the thought of there not being more of it to read. At first I thought it was strange that Jane could fall in love with such a cold, hard man. But then it turned out that he had a certain charm and gentleness that was buried deep inside him, not to show its face until Jane uncovered it. I think a big reason that some people don't like this book is because they expect Jane to fall in love with a handsome, obviously charming man. But that kind of romance is done too often in literary works, and eventually it loses its effect. In his own suttle way, Mr. Rochester is Prince Charming, though it takes time and patience to see. The book has a slow start, but stick with it. I've seen two movie versions of this story already, and it's a shame to put the title Jane Eyre on them. They are great stories in themselves, of course, but they hardly do the book justice. I'm 14 years old now, and in a few years I plan to read this book again, in hopes of getting more out of it than I already have."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is a thrilling romance novel. Set in England in the 1800s, this novel tells of the life of Jane Eyre. Jane is an orphan left in the care of her aunt, Mrs. Reed. At Gateshead, the Reed's estate, she lives a life of solitude and hate, mistreated and misunderstood by all. At the age of ten, she is sent to grim Lowood school, a reformatory school for orphans. Her years at Lowood are gloomy and dull, and she has few friends. When she is 18, she advertises as a governess, and finds a job at Thornfield Hall. Thornfield is all she ever wanted; there she is happy and loved, until a twist of fate and a long kept secret find her once more in peril. This novel is very romantic and heart warming. Charlotte Bronte has a knack for making her characters and situations seem real. At times I felt as though I were right there with Jane, sharing her hopes and dreams. I found this book to be interesting and fun to read, although at times it became drawn out. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes romance novels with wonderful characters, settings, and situations."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I am a 14-year-old girl and a novice towards 19th century British lit. I've never read an Austen and I cannot compair this book to Wuthering Heights (as I have never read that one either). I can only offer my less than expert opinion.This book was very enjoyable, at times. Until Mr. Rochester shows up, however, the book is very slow. The heroine grows on you quickly, so it makes the reading more fun. Jane is likeable, and I certainly cared more and more about her as the book progressed. I liked how blunt she could be at times and how stubborn. She displayed a great deal of strengh and determination, in a tough world, without the gifts of beauty and fortune. Jane has to make it on her own steam, and I think that a lot of modern girls could learn from her example.The story line with Mr. Rochester's crazy wife is a bit random, but very interesting none-the-less, and it added a layer of mystery to the plot.The ending of this book irked me the most, however, because (without giving it away) everything sort of falls into place. This bugged me because, up until then, Jane had to overcome issues and, in the end, her happiness was more or less handed to her.My one other complaint is that dear Jane Eyre likes to ramble about God and life and whatever else she sees fit to ramble about. It is dull dull dull, as the young girl muses on and on in her own head and we have to sit through it.I still very much liked the book though, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting little romance with an awesome heroine."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"The Brontes were a family of brilliant minds; Charlotte was the most brilliant among them (so beat me up, Emily fans), and Jane Eyre is far and away her masterpiece. I have imagined Handel laying down his quill after penning the final note of the Hallelujah Chorus, reading it over, and exclaiming aloud, \\"Whoa--where did THAT come from?\\" Jane Eyre is the same type of work. The tricks and seams and recycled gimmicks on which artists rely to connect pieces of greatness are absent here. The novel seems unedited, unreviewed, untouched--uncreated, like Jack's beanstalk that just sprang up overnight.That Charlotte Bronte was a genius in the field of human psychology is best proved by the facts that she was a desperate 20-something daughter of a country parson, she craved love (and sex) and excitement and had none, yet she wrote a novel of moral self-denial that remains satisfying to people who have long since kissed their 20's good-bye--people who have, perhaps, denied themselves very little. Without having had the opportunity to kick up her heels (much less participated in the 12-Step program to bring her down to earth), she understood in advance the processes of temptation, restraint, remorse, and rejuvenation.The first 2/3 of the book concerns temptation. It is the Hollywood part of the work, and the section that most appealed to me as an adolescent. Without the final third, however, the novel is another dopey Cinderella story--Maid in England, maybe: nice ordinary girl somehow attracts the attention of prince, great happiness ensues, no one learns anything, close curtain. (The really interesting psychology in these Cinderella stories, if you ask me, is that of the Prince--what's he looking for under those rags and foreign accents? Who's he pissed off at in Prince-land?) To an adult reader, Jane Eyre is monumental because of the struggle through hardship and denial to a less perfect (but, of course, more perfect) happiness at the end. While Jane's moral quandry takes place within the limits of a 19th century British system of Christian ethics, there is surprisingly little hellfire involved. After all, to Bronte, the daughter of a parson, the answer to Jane Eyre's dilemma could have been a simpleminded, \\"It's wrong, don't do it--just get on with it!\\" just as the answer to modern western readers is, \\"It's wrong but fun--just do it!\\"This book is even great in Italian, which is how I reread it--and I'm not sure Italian even has words for restraint and self-denial.Jane Eyre should not be assigned reading for most teenagers, however, and it frequently is. I can't even imagine the torture it would be for that large percent of teenage boys who are just not interested in the human heart; there is very little action in it--it's purely character analysis. (\\"Ghostly happenings\\" occur now and then, but probably not enough to hold the interest of most modern kids.) On the other hand, some first-time adult readers might put it down early, finding the opening 2/3 of the book somewhat ridiculous--there are some broad character portraits, a plot that seems to be heading down that Cinderella path, and a pretty unbelievable series of events leading to the crisis. So, I'm going to recommend this book to people exactly like me: Girls, read it first in your early teenage years and keep it in the back of your brain; then, every 10 or 15 years, as you pass through another stage of life, pick it up again. There's more in there, believe me--even in a foreign tongue!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Every middle to high school student should read Jane Eyre because it is easy to relate to. It tells the story of a young girl who is mistreated as a child.She wants to go to school so her Aunt sends her to a boarding school. The boarding school develops a serious disease that takes on an important role in her life. I enjoyed it because it is a book where you just can't put it down. It was really interesting. I was able to understand it because of the extrordinary details that Charlotte Bronte included in the story.The story of Jane Eyre is about adapting to new places and conflict between characters. The story starts when Jane is living at her Aunts house because her Uncle died. Then she goes to school. Her Aunt only cares about her three children. The only person Jane likes at her Aunts house is the maid. When Jane grows up she moves to a lot of places.The characters in this book are very different than many people. When Jane is young her Aunt mentally abuses her. That is because she has to live with her Aunt. When her Uncle died she felt betrayed so now she wants revenge. She wants to go to school so her Aunt sends her to an awful boarding school.The setting takes place in many different areas. The main place that the story of Jane Eyre takes place in is England. I think that is cool because I live in the U.S. I also think it is cool because I don't know that much about England. In the story it seems like Jane just can't settle down in one place.Overall I thought that this book was interesting because it is based on a true story. It was easy to get a good picture because of the great details. It is easy for middle school students to read Jane Eyre because many don't realize that someone's life can be so horrible and change into a life that everyone wants.I recommend that you read this book because it is a book about overcoming challenges."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Not intended for the melancholy, this classic literature is full of hope, full of love that you rarely find in writings those days. Jane Eyre, a plain and poor girl, a cast out among her known rich relatives, tried to make her way in this world when she advertised for governess position and received a call from Thornfield Hall. In this place, she was presented with a very agreeable student and company, Mr. Edward F. Rochester. The courting game began slowly but surely towards Jane who was still a naive girl of eighteen. Together they overcame their differences such in age and had planned to be married soon. But a terrible secret broke out and Jane fled from the Hall, leaving her crushed love behind. In her sanctuary, she found another kind of suitor in the form of a cousin, St. John Rivers. She loved him as a brother and she thought the feeling is mutual until a proposal came and the true character of St John revealed but still with power to control her resolution, in the name of his holy purpose. Right at that moment, a supernatural thing happen (which I guarantee will cause your hair stand on end) that called her back to the beloved Thornfield Hall and its master. I don't think this event was out of place. In fact, it served as the last, elegant seal on the round up.A profound love story with two unlikely characters. No beauty beyond compare and no handsome prince 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder'. Through this tale, Ms Bronte also conveyed her opinion and principle about love, marriage, physical display, conceited faith, gender equality and sound educated mind, especially of women.Her style in expressing the main characters' personality and principal was a thorough exploration of the mind and heart without too much side comments which often sidetracked a narrative. Expressive dialogs and vivid description were her main strengths that I like most. Though it is still consistent with the writing style of its era, it will reward satisfactorily every modern reader who faithfully peruses its chapters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre has been my favorite since I first read it way back in middle school, the 6th grade I believe. I loved it then and I continue to love it. Jane is a remarkable heroine, she is not beautiful or charming, she is quite and bookish. She goes from a smart abused child to a smart stronge young woman. She has hope and bravery when she has no reason to believe in happy endings and that is why I love her. I do love her, for being to my mind one of the strongest female characters written and she does it all without batting her eyes. Not even once. This book may be listed as a romance, but it is also a mystery and a drama. I would highly recommended it for character building."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Many are familiar with the story of the orphaned Jane Eyre. If they haven't read Charlote Bronte's story, they may have seen one of several film versions (my personal favorite being the pairing of Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles). Nonetheless, this classic Gothic tale holds such an important place in the annals of literature that if no introduction is necessary it more than merits revisiting. The audio book edition produced by Penguin Classics and read by Joanna David offers just that opportunity. It's a chance to be introduced to an unforgettable tale or to see the familiar in a new light through the estimable voice performance given by Ms. David.David, an accomplished actress, has experience in the classics - she appeared in a televised version of Pride and Prejudice and played the young Mrs. de Winter in the BBC adaptation of Rebecca. She carries listeners through Jane's resignation, incredulity, dismay, and happiness with an assured, insightful performance.Quite briefly, we meet Jane when she is living with a wealthy but unkind aunt. After being locked in a room where her uncle died, Jane is sent away to a charity boarding school. Regrettably, her lot is not improved as the school's headmaster is a cruel, selfish man who deprives the students while providing luxuries for his own family. When, at last, he is replaced, Jane days are happier and she even remains at the school to teach.Following that, she takes a position as governess at Thornfield Manor where she meets the love of her life, Mr. Rochester. When, to her amazement, he proposes, she happily accepts. Her joy is short lived as she discovers that he is already married, to a mad woman kept locked on the third floor of Thornfield Manor. Distraught and miserable, Jane runs away.After suffering all forms of deprivation, Jane is taken in by a kind family and finds work at a school. Then, almost unbelievably she comes into a small fortune left to her by an Uncle. She also receives another marriage proposal, but knows that there is only one man that she truly loves. Few will forget the sound of Mr. Rochester's voice calling to Jane over the moors.This audio edition of Jane Eyre offers an extraordinary listening experience - don't miss it!- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"We had to choose between 5 novels in my english 10 honors class and I choose this one. I definitley advise you to read this book, but only if you're up for a challenge. This is a great novel a great story of a woman fighting her way into society and finding out that she must only marry for one reason pure and simple love. I would recommend this novel for age 14+ I dont think others younger than this age would most likley enjoy it. I personally loved this story at parts the book does drage on with Bronte's many many descriptions. The plot though is one very well planned and thought out and the last 9 or 10 chapters you race through. If you can get through a few dry parts you will enjoy a truly gem of a book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I absolutely love this romantic classic. Although it is something that I might be asked to read in an English class, this is my favorite book ever and I have read it many times. Nice and thick and full of details, it paints a colorful image of life in England during that time period.This book shows the struggles of poor, unwanted Jane, first in the Lowood charity school, then in her search to find a family that will hire her as a governess. This is how she ends up at Thornsfield Hall, employed by Mr. Rochester, a man who is old enough to be Jane's father. Despite this fact, Jabe slowly falls in love with him. However, Mr. Rochester is hiding a secret in the attic that could destroy his and Jane's love.This is the most romantic story I've ever read, and I recommend anyone buying it!

It's filled with heartache, pain, disappointment, turned to love, joy and happiness. It has twists and turns and mysterious and, at some moments, sheer terror! But you'll always love the ending!

Really, though, once you get into it you are in for a treat. The book is an emotional rollacoaster, and though it was written more than a hundred and fifty years ago (I think) it still heldgreat resonance for me; I too could identify with Jane Eyre's dilema over the cerbral duty prescribed by her mind and the emotinal neccessity calling out from her heart. The chemistry between her and Rochester blows away anything you'd see on the cinema screen, and the passages where they are together practically set the pages on fire. I guess it's down to the readers temperment in the end, wether or not they emaphise, and the style is nuanced and therefore could be thought overly wordy ocaissionally, but if you like reading this is such a good book to try. Some people say it's the best novel ever written in english; I'd be inclined to believe them."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"\\"The truest love that ever heart felt at it's kindled core, did through each vein in quickened start, the tide of being pour. Her coming was my hope each day, her parting was my pain; The chance that did her steps delay was ice in every vein. I dreamed it would be nameless bliss, As I loved,loved to be: and to this object did I press as blind as eagerly. But wide as pathless was the space that lay our lives between, and dangerous as the foamy race of ocean surges green. And haunted as a robber-path through wilderness or wood; For might and right, and woa and wrath, between our spirits stood.Well that's all that I can remember of the little song Rochester sang to Jane. I realy love the book. I cried when Helen Burns died, and I cried when Thornfield was a ruin, and I Laughed at how [bad] Wuthering Heights [is]! I even made started puting CBJE on my notebook. Which stands fo Charlotte Bronte Jane Eyre. I totaly recomend it, but you will cry trust me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a suspensful novel that includes new excitements on every page. It is the story of a young orphan who is raised by her mean and unloving aunt who sends Jane away to Lowood boarding school at age ten. Lowood isn't the most loving place either. It is a charity school where all the students have lost at least one of their parents. This means that the conditions are far worse then other schools. These poor conditions result in a great erupion of typhoid within the school and many die at school or are sent home to die. Jane Eyre survives this however and stays at Lowood for eight years. She is a student there for six years, and a teacher for two. Then she decides that it is time to move on, and puts an ad in the paper for a job as a governess. Her ad is answered by Alice Fairfax. Alice Fairfax is the house keeper at Thornfeild and it is her job to also find a governess for the ward Adele. Thornfeild is owned by a man by the name of Edward Rochester. He offers money a job, a house, love, and everything else that money can buy to Jane, but it is still not enough for her. All through her life Jane has craved loving family and she is determined to find her relatives.After Jane learns the terrible secret of the attic she decides that she must find her way on her own. She leaves Thornfeild and travels by foot, and by carriage. She is turned into a beggar because she leaves many of her belongings in the parcel that she carlessly left on the carriage. When she is at the point of almost dying she is found on the door step of Moor house, where St. John brings her in and his sisters Mary and Diana help bring her back to good health. St. John gets her a job and a little cottage to live in. There Jane is almost as happy as she could be, but still something is missing. Will Jane ever find this one last element to make her life perfect?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I first read Jane Eyre when I was 9 at the recommendation of my 4th grade teacher. After that, I would always say that it was my favorite book. At 25, I looked back and wondered if I had really understood the book at age nine. So I reread it, and realized how deeply I had understood. The character of Jane had seeped into my subconcious as a role model against whom I unwittingly checked myself. She is level-headed, but not rigid. She falls into things, but is conscious while falling. She is neither a namby-pamby nor a Polyanna. She stands up for herself, while still respecting others. On top of all of that, she is very real. Her mental journey is recognizable to me, more so the older I get. The book is also swooningly romantic at times. Mr. Rochester is wonderful and arrogant, and vunerable, and grouchy. The conversations they have are beautiful, and fully engaging. This book will live inside me until the end of my days, and I'm so grateful."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"When I first read Jane Eyre in high school, my initial reaction was one of ennui. I thought the book was a little slow with a heroine in serious need of some self-esteem lessons. However, after I finished it, I found myself wanting to read it again, and again, and again! Now, I am thoroughly addicted. I probably read the book at least once a year. After the second reading, the reader learns to appreciate the beautiful language and wonderful plot devises that make for a ripping good story. I now understand Jane and Rochester in accordance with their societal upbringings and their ability to overcome the social barriers between them. Jane is a strong and gentle heroine, unlike our blow-'em-up heroines of the 90's. I recommend this book to anyone who realizes that you don't have to be rude and aggresive to be a strong person. One more comment. My only qualm with this book is the aggrivating character of St. John Rivers. No matter how many times I read Jane Eyre, I can't bring myself to like his puritan presence. Oh, well, I guess its too late to mention the criticism to Charlotte!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Let me first note that I am still in high school but I didn't read this as an assignment. So far in the past couple of years I have had to have read numerous boks in a modern day point of view and I have just become so sick of all of these stereotypical plots. Girl finds boy, they fall in love, save the day, the end.But when i read this book I was so awakened, so jarred into the brutality of reality that I was fascinated by Ms.Bronte's writing and frank honesty of everything.It was disturbing, witty, insightful, and overall captivating. Nothing ese really compares to this classic. I was sometimes lost at points and was forced to look back. It was philosophical and even though it didn't have much elegance, it was charming. It showed loss, failure, a world without love. Jane Erye is like nothing I've ever read before.I know several people criticized the way Bronte took away all love from Jane's world. But to me it just made everything so much more worthwhile; whenever Jane got the slightest shred of kindness i truly felt it considering all of the hardships he went through.His review cannot do the justice that i wish i could explain but the book was just so amazing i cant put them into words. Please take my word for it and read this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I'm not sure what made me - at 37 - decide to read Jane Eyre. It's obviously been around my whole life. And it seems like the type of book I should have been forced to read -- if not in high school then surely in college. But I'm so glad I finally got around to it.Jane thoroughly frustrated me throughout the book and I actually found myself yelling at the book in much the same way I yell at the Buffalo Bills whenever they do something stupid (every game they play). I also found myself hoping for certain outcomes which is funny considering the ending was written oh so long ago.Jane Eyre is a love story. But more than that, its a story of perseverance, and dedication to principles.About half way through, I convinced my 15-year-old daughter that she had to read it -- just so I would have someone to talk to about it ... and because I knew she'd love it like I do."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Some spoilers are inevitable below, if you don't already know the basic plot.As part of a new series of Goodreads challenges, it was required of me to read Jane Eyre, and I wasn't too thrilled. I've started it before and never penetrated too far. But it was in exchange for the other person watching half of Firefly (it's a shared challenge - two of us read a book apiece in exchange for all the episodes), so ... I will do a great deal for Mal Reynolds, I said.I have a paperback, somewhere, but wound up reading it via literature.org for some reason - where, I should warn, there are a great many typos, and a startling use of all caps where I believe the original uses italics. It's odd to see Mr. Rochester exclaim in the manner of a web post.I was surprised at how very much I enjoyed this. The language has proven a barrier in the couple of times I've started it in the past - no patience for it, or something. But this time having to read it out of Browncoat devotion combined with the right mood and receptivity, and I clicked with it. The sense of humor of Jane and therefore of Charlotte Bront was a wonderful surprise; there was a snark and sarcasm and a touch of simple silliness which for some reason I never suspected in either Bront or book. My prejudgment of the book was purely as a girl's dark and Gothic \\"tale of woe\\", built with archaic language - and that is a big part of it, yes. (After all, Helen at fourteen is given lines like \\"she gives me my meed liberally\\" and \\"collecting all she says with assiduity\\", which simply leaves me wondering if children actually did speak this way in 1847, and my goodness has civilization degenerated if they did). But it's also fun, especially when Jane converses with Mr. Rochester.\\"Am I hideous, Jane?\\"\\"Very, sir: you always were, you know.\\"\\"St. John dresses well. He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue eyes, and a Grecian profile.\\"(Aside.) \\"Damn him!\\"--Jane as a child: Poor little precocious wretch. She's obviously much smarter and sharper and more thoughtful (in terms of giving thought to things more than solicitous; she is that, but not overwhelmingly so) than everyone around her - never an easy situation even for someone with a sweet disposition. Jane does not have a sweet disposition. This is undoubtedly due in part to how she's been treated all her life by the Reeds, but she fights fire with fire, no question. She's mad as hell and not going to take it anymore.And that's kind of a surprise. I haven't read so very much 19th century literature, but I have some familiarity with the stuff - and in my limited experience there weren't very many pre-Jane heroines like Jane. I'm thinking of course of Little Nell, the sweet and uncomplaining little orphan of The Old Curiosity Shop, who may or may not be the archetype, and also the much put-upon Fanny Price.Jane Eyre ain't no Little Nell. In fact what just struck me is that she is, in many ways, identical to the pre-Hogwarts Harry Potter. (Someone somewhere has to have done a study of orphans in young adult literature, a comprehensive list and investigation into why they're so prevalent. I can think of half a dozen immediately - Jane, Harry, Anne, Heidi, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield - and Pip. Seven. And then there are all the poor motherless ones, who are probably double in number.) Jane doesn't blow up her aunt, but she does attack her cousin. Her presence was resented, only tolerated out of duty to the dead, and she was ill-treated by everyone in the house to one degree or another, particularly by her male cousin. School came as a surprising solace - at least I was surprised, because again the impression I had formed was a terrible one, all Snape and no Gryffindor. And it actually wasn't. Even at its worst it was well-intentioned and there were positives; once it received reforming attention it improved drastically.It is in some ways so very much a product of its time, with its solid Christianity and its xenophobia (\\"a sound English education corrected in a great measure her French defects\\") - but Jane is a creature of the book's future. Mr. Rochester was incorrect: Jane was not a fairy. She was a time traveler. (Now I want to write that version. Never mind Jane Slayr, this is better.) She is independent, or wants very badly to be, and she is strong in ways women are not expected nor really desired to be in 1847. She has wings, and wants to spread them; the horizon line is too confining for her. And somehow it feels very modern that she is uncertain of her footing when people are kind to her, that she is in some ways more comfortable with rudeness, and can stand up for herself quite well in its face.At this remove, without a lot of research, I don't know if the Gothic themes in this book would have been something its contemporary audience would have been familiar with; my impression is that they would. The \\"madwoman in the attic\\" was apparently a time-worn plot device even then. In a way it was more fun reading it with a fair idea of the ending - even though I've never read it before I knew much of the plot. Even knowing the spoilers, it had some deliciously creepy moments, and Jane never succumbed to the usual behaviors of the swoon-prone Gothic heroine. She acquitted herself quite well."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I'd give the book itself 4 or 5 stars, the 3 star rating is because this Kindle version is a little flawed.'Jane' is sometimes spelled 'Janet' which is a little annoying, but not that bad.One thing I'm unsure of is whether or not this version is incomplete on place names... I kept seeing -shire and things like that, but sometimes the name of the town was complete. Since this is the only version of Jane Eyre I've ever read, I don't know if that's an error or if Bronte intended it that way. ???The book itself I'm glad to have read. It is a good story. I think some of the negative reviews by readers who didn't like it are influenced by the fact this book was written over 150 years ago. Writing styles have changed drastically, as have social norms. I got used to Bronte's way of speaking and it flowed better after that. Glad Kindle has the built in dictionary too. There are just a few passages of dialogue in French that you might want to translate, there are plenty of free translators online that would probably do well enough. I personally think it's possible to pass over them without knowing their meaning; they aren't crucial to the story. As far as the social themes, some of Jane's dilemmas wouldn't have been dilemmas in today's society but I suppose they were huge issues in the time period of the story so you have to think of them that way and think about how someone dealing with her set of circumstances then would handle it, not how you or someone in today's society would.Bronte was quite the author. Very descriptive, great use of analogy, etc. And in this day and age it's nothing for a female as a child or a woman to stand up for herself, speak her mind, and wish to be an equal, but I kept reminding myself this book was written in England in the mid 1800s... it must have been revolutionary at the time.

Crime and Punishment? Took me half a day. Middlemarch? A day and a half.Because I read quickly, I tend not to be overly moved by the triumphs and travails of literary characters. I exult with them momentarily, but their brightness fades quickly once I set down the book.Jane Eyre was different. So many of the book's elements defied nineteenth century convention; so many of the book's elements set my heart racing and my mind on edge. The unexpected first person perspective. Charlotte Bronte's mesmerizing lyrical prose. The strength--or, as the British might say, the pluck--of the book's indomitable heroine. The tenacity of Jane's love for Rochester and the reciprocal power of his love for her.I don't often cry when I read novels, but for the last twenty pages of Jane Eyre, I read transfixed while tears streamed down my face. I doubt a novel has ever made a heroine come to life as vividly as did Jane Eyre.Read this book. Love it. Treasure every breathtaking passage and every witty turn of phrase.

And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"If you are a Jane Eyre fan, junkie, or a first time reader, this is a wonderful edition to pick up.

After recieving an ok education Jane goes to be a governess at Thornfield where she meets the love of her life, Mr. Rochester. Yet she is only a governess and Mr. Rochester is going to be married to someone else. Jane has to make him change his mind before the dreaded wedding date.I don't want to give too much away but there is a lot more to this story than the summary above. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I read some parts over and over again. Sorry guys but this is mostly romance and drama. How the author tells the story and the plot are very interesting. This book is considered a classic. All of the characters are explained in such detail. You have a connection with Jane Eyre. When I read the back of this book there was one sentence in particular that caught my attention. I hope that will help you in thinking about reading this book. Jane Eyre is now one of my favorite books.\\"Published in 1847 under the pen name Currer Bell, the book heralded a new kind of heroine- one whose virtuous integrity, keen intellect, and tireless perserverance broke through class barriers to win equal stature with the man she loved.\\"That sentence and the quote at the top describe Jane Eyre best."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Although I found this novel a bit too windswept, making it hard to turn the pages in an orderly fashion, I was awe-struck by its darkly gothic mood, the barely suppressed passions of its characters, and the threat of violent transgression that seems to haunt every scene like a towering shih-tzu.My gym teacher used to warn me about books like this. One morning after dodge-ball, he pulled me aside, put his hand on my shoulder, and said, \\"Son, I know your English teacher is having you read a lot of gothic Victorian novels about frightened young women who fall for mysterious, unattainable men with a dark side...\\" He leaned down and looked me straight in the eye. \\"You know I'm worried, don't you. I'm worried about your manhood. I'm worried you're going to waste that great gift you've been given, that great dodge-ball arm, and just -- \\"Oh forget it. I'll save the rest of this story for my therapist."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Word has it that \\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the most imitated novels in literature, having almost singlehandedly spawned the genre of romantic fiction which supplies all those erotic-looking pulp paperbacks you see next to the magazine rack at the supermarket. What I found in Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece, however, was a smart, resolute, and independent heroine who stands out like a beacon in a sea of Victorian fictional women. As if obeying some sort of literary convention, the book does have a sad beginning and a happy ending, but in between there are some very rich surprises: moments of mystery, tension, and ghostly images, delivered in a tightly paced narrative.Jane Eyre is an orphan who has spent the first ten years of her life with a mean aunt who mistreats her and the next eight years at a miserable school for indigent girls called Lowood. With this education, she qualifies herself as a teacher and secures a position as a governess at a house called Thornfield Hall. Her employer is a man twice her age named Edward Rochester, and her charge is his ward, a little girl of French parentage named Adele.Given that Jane soon falls in love with him, it might be guessed that Rochester is a dashing, noble, gallant gentleman; but no: He is unattractive, eccentric, shifty, assumes disguises, and rarely gives a straight answer to a question. These might merely be manifestations of a quirky, enigmatic personality, or maybe he is so evasive because he is hiding something from his past -- as indeed he is, and that \\"something,\\" incriminating and dangerous, is locked up in Thornfield Hall, unknown to Jane and most of the servants.Rochester falls in love with Jane, too, despite his apparent attention to a conceited society woman named Blanche Ingram. After a short courtship and a marriage proposal, however, Jane breaks off with him when she discovers his secret. Abandoning Thornfield Hall for a new life, she meets a young parson named St. John Rivers who is planning to go to India to do missionary work and would like to marry her because he thinks she too would make a good missionary. Thus, she has had to reject two men in her life: the first because he was not honest with her and made her feel used and deceived; the second because he is not looking for a wife, but a co-worker.Jane is not foolish, but she is human. That she returns to Rochester does not mean she has decided to accept his faults, but that she realizes they have developed that special kind of mutually dependent relationship that only two people who are truly in love may foster. By the end of the novel, Rochester loses a great deal because of his mistakes, and Jane's love is his only redemption; Jane, on the other hand, gains much because of the strength of her character, and Rochester's love is the fulfillment of her desire."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"The book, Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is considered to be a work of genius, and with good reason. The story revolves around the life of an orphan, Jane Eyre, living in England in the 1900s. The book starts out during her childhood, when she lived with her cruel Aunt Reed and cousins Georgiana, John, and Eliza, and her years at the Lowood School as both a student and a teacher. Then, Jane takes a job as a governess at Thornfield Hall. When she lives there, she falls in love with her master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and they plan to marry. But Jane's happiness is destroyed when she learns of the horrible secret Mr. Rochester has keeping from her, and she leaves him. A few years pass, and Jane is now the head master at a small school, when she learns that she has cousins who are still alive, which is very important to her. She lives with her cousins for awhile, but eventually returns to the love of her life, Mr. Rochester, because she misses him. When she returns to him, she learns of the many bad things which have befallen him and Thornfield Hall, but in the end, she is very content with her life.This is an excellent book, especially because of the way the main character, Jane Eyre, is portrayed. She is not perfect, because she isn't very attractive, or very well liked. She is very shy and has many personality flaws, including \\"a wicked heart, especially for such a young girl\\" ( pg. 39). But she also has many good qualities about her; she is very kind and humble. The book provides just the right balance of good and bad to make Jane Eyre a very real and likeable character. Another reason why Jane Eyre is such a great book is because although it is very long, over 600 pages, the book moves very quickly, and there are almost no long portions of the book where nothing happens. Anytime there was a lull in the book, a major event would occur and the plot would move quicker, thus making the book seem shorter than it really was. Another reason why this book was so good was that it was a great picture of life for women in the 1900s. The book really showed that all that most women possessed was there title, and if they lost that, then they had nothing. However, Jane Eyre managed to rise above this, and in the end, the book's moral was about rising above your position in life, so that you could be truly happy.However, some people might disagree with my view on this book. Jane Eyre is at times a very sad book, and not everyone likes a sad book. Although Jane is generally happy, there is always a touch of sadness in her words and actions, which is why not everyone would agree with my review. However, there is plenty of good to out way the bad. This is a very interesting and compelling book which is very highly recommended. The plot is full of interesting people and places, it is written beautifully, and is a definite must read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I still have the copy of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; I first read when I was 12 years-old--it is now worn with love and many readings. I can think of no higher compliment to a book than to see its pages worn, cover creased by repeated use. With every reading over the years, I have gained new insight into Jane and Rochester.Jane is (as she describes herself) &quot;poor, obscure, plain and little&quot;, but she is also possesses incredible strength and conviction. Rochester is her match in passion, a dark and complicated hero. Theirs is a love story of two equals. Nowadays, this may seem commonplace (though, unfortunately, not as common as we may think); in Charlotte Bronte's time, this was a major revelation. Indeed, it was considered scandalous. Imagine--a woman asserting her own ideals and independence, considering herself equal to a man! Shocking!I have heard some say that they believe Emily Bronte's &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; to be the masterpiece of the Bronte family. While I loved that book, its protagonists cannot begin to compete with the strong, complex characters that Charlotte Bronte has given us. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is not only the masterwork of the Bronte family; it is one of the greatest books of the nineteenth century.Because I love this book so much, I cannot truly do it justice in this review. Please read it if you have not before. If you read it long ago, read it again. I promise you a great read and moving experience!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"A Realistic, Relatable Fairy Tale, by Michelle Giullain, student of Professor SWILUASome people never get sick of fairy tales. I, for one, have an incredible ability to hear the same story over and over again and never tire. Every once in a while, though, I crave something a little more realistic, while still maintaining that fairy tale \`happily ever after' ending. It is hard to appeal to both sides of the spectrum, but Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre accomplishes this daunting task. Though it does have the typical fairy tale ending, it is a novel the audience can relate to. Instead of a fairy tale princess, Jane Eyre is the fairy tale story of a plain girl who faces real struggles. Bronte's realistic, relatable characters who face normal struggles allow the reader to relate to the novel, making it a book that will be thoroughly enjoyed for years to come.The characterization Bronte uses is truly genius, combining archetypal characters with human flaws. Oddly enough, it contains some of the fairy tale archetypes we are oh so familiar with, the evil stepmother and stepsisters. In this case, it is an abusive aunt and her spoiled children, but they fulfill the same role. Other archetypes, such as the sacrificial best friend, Helen Burns, and the crazy ex, Bertha, all show up in the novel. It speaks to the reader's emotions, because everyone has and archetypal figure in their life of some form. Whether or not you have an evil stepmother, or mother in law, it is comforting to read about other people who go through the same struggles as you, especially if your ex is still haunting you.Additionally, the characterization of the protagonist, Jane Eyre, gives the reader a direct connection to the novel. Her imperfections are what make her so perfect. Her outside appearance pales in comparison to the beautiful princesses, literally. Her pale skin and her plain face do not match the description of the usual princess. But, because Jane is not perfect, the audience can relate to her. Not many of us look just like a princess, have a castle, or a fairy godmother to grant our every wish. When we read about someone who isn't that beautiful, those who feel they are not as beautiful as Cinderella have someone to relate to. However, it is not only the outer appearance that makes Jane so ideal. She also has character flaws. She does not posses the patience to tame a beast, like Belle, or Snow White's affinity to the caretaking of small innocent creatures. Rather, her honesty and stubbornness, un-princess like qualities, show that she is human. She is not entirely confident in herself and feels loneliness. In her own words, \\"I abhorred myself...I was hateful in my own eyes\\" (329). Though we may not loathe ourselves all of the time, there are many instances in which a normal human in the normal world would not like themselves. This additional perspective into the imperfect Jane helps the reader connect to the book.Bronte also makes the other character's flaws apparent, especially in the man Jane comes to love. Prince not-so-charming, Rochester, has his own flaws inside and out. He, like Jane, is not beautiful, dashing, or handsome. He is rustic, unrefined, and unkind and that is not all. He tries to control Jane's actions and play with her mind. He has hidden baggage, too. His crazy wife, Bertha, is locked up in his attic. By the end, however, he has proven that he is a good person, just like Jane. He heroically tries to save his servants and crazy wife from his burning house, and loses an eye in the process. The key to the audience connection is the imperfection of not only Jane, but also Rochester. For, how possible would it be that Jane could find a dashing prince charming when she is not beautiful? And if Rochester were handsome, why would he pursue a relationship with a plain Jane? The two is absolutely perfect for each other. To the reader, it makes perfect sense that these two imperfect characters should get together. And, it might even remind them of their own romantic endeavors, or give them a little hope for the future.Beyond the imperfect characters, the relationship between the characters also contributes to the appeal to the audience by creating even more reality amid a fairy tale story. The Rochester-Jane romance is not a love at first sight experience, even though she does sweep him off his feet. (Actually, his horse slips on the ice the first time they cross paths, but that is not really the same thing). Though Prince Charming and Cinderella lacked a bit of communication, they never had any significant relationship problems. Snow white didn't even need to meet her Prince. One kiss and he made her feel alive. However, like most human relationships, Jane and Rochester fight, argue, feel jealously and hurt. They keep secrets and experience disappointments. Rochester invites a party of beautiful women to his house to make Jane jealous. Then, on the morning of their wedding, she finds out that he has a wife in the attic. Jane then runs away because she cannot bear the thought of being a mistress to Rochester. Rochester is devastated and almost gives up living because he has lost Jane. Though they love each other, their relationship is not always perfect. Jane Eyre has no magic spells, princes, dragons, or balls. She has to deal with real life in the real world of relationships. Because this is more like the world we live in, the audience, who has likely experienced jealousy and conflict in a relationship, is able to see themselves in the story.Alas, all is well in the end, once the real life struggles are over. This fairy tale ending is the perfect finishing to the story, because it what the reader \`wants'. Though life doesn't always follow that pattern, sometimes it does. For Jane, something finally went right. Not many sentences in the novel provide as much joy as the simple declaration, \\"Reader, I married him\\" (462). Jane Eyre finds the love she has always wanted, and the reader, at that moment, experiences a small moment of triumph. That moment is the defining emotional moment of the novel, and what makes this novel so appealing to an audience. But, that is the same with any fairy tale.Because Jane Eyre does not simply focus on the \`happily ever after', but integrates the story into a complicated and realistic plot, it is a more believable story. The book does not begin or end with the usual \`Once upon a time\\" and \\"Happily ever after\\", nor does it focus on the marriage and courtship between the two characters. Jane has struggles throughout the novel, from the abusive cousins to the malnutrition at school to nearly dying from exhaustion. Even after she marries Rochester, she must deal with a blind husband who is an emotional wreck. With small triumphs are placed intermittently between many struggles, it reflects what life is like for the audience, and anyone who lives in the real world, for that matter. Jane may have struggles, but she sees the fulfillments of her dream.Ultimately, those who live in the real world have the opportunity to escape into a book that isn't just about some perfect fictional character in a far away kingdom. Jane Eyre is about the same world we live in because it presents the struggles many of us face, and the triumphs that even plain Jane can experience. No matter what time you may be reading this novel, the breadth of the archetypes and the imperfections of the characters give you the opportunity to enjoy and relate to this beautifully crafted novel. If you have not had the privilege to read this book, do so at once! You will be rewarded by one of the most enriching and inspiring books out there."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the best literary works I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It has the ability to keep you riveted, unable to put it down. Jane bears an uncanny resemblance to modern day women in that she is independent and strong willed. I had never even heard of this book before attending college and I almost feel cheated. This book does an excellent job of pointing out the many peaks and valleys one will have in their life. The author was able to use her own first-hand knowledge of having suffered through loss in her work.Early in the story we see that Jane has a thirst for knowledge as she finds solace in various books. As an adult she uses her own education to help her become a teacher. She also comes to know love not once but twice. First with Edward Rochester, whom she eventually leaves due to his deceitful ways only to return to later, and second with St. John Rivers who is a missionary on his way to India. Jane doesn't stay with St. John because she believes him to be looking towards her more as a possible missionary than as a wife.I eagerly recommend this book to anyone. It is a masterpiece of literary artwork and lengthy as well. I believe that the young women of today could benefit greatly from reading this book for it will teach them how to stand up for themselves and what they believe in.

Her childhood was dull and without anyone loved her, but she still lived bravely and did everything without regard. This was a romance novel which was written by Charlotte Bronte.At the beginning, Jane Eyre parents were dead. She lived with her aunt. Her aunt hated Jane Eyre very much. She broke her promise to her husband to bring Jane up as her own daughter. However, she was sent to Lowood School, study French Drawing and Music for 8 years. Luckily, she met a good friend called Helen to share her happiness and sadness in school since both of them were an orphan girl. Helen was then died of fever. The experience in school made she more mature, sweet and brave. After that, she found a job in thomfield hall to be a governess of a girl under 14year old. Then, she fall in love with the girl&iexcl;s father, the master Rochester. Although many twists between them before they had married, they were still end up happily.The book is a very famous love story. I like this book because the contradiction between two main characters, Jane and Rochester. It&iexcl;s different from others romance novel. It contains a lot of twist such as they loved each other but they were both afraid to tell their feeling to each other. It&iexcl;s because Rochester had a secret and Jane also had some misunderstanding to Rochester. Therefore, many love barriers between them. Besides, after Jane left Rochester. Jane still had many testes of true love. I dislike it only because the book contained many descriptions on background scene such as the background environment when Rochester requested Jane to be his wife. The background environment was a lightening shocking a big tree.I highly recommend this book to the readers above 12 years old.

I have Three different copies of the book, I own all of the movie versions that I could find of it (Four, as of now). To say that I am a fan is a huge understatement.Jane is such a great character, a survivor in every sense of the word. She loves her man, but he doesn't own her, no no! She's her own woman, and she makes sure that he knows it. One of my favorite scenes of the book is when Edward is trying to force gifts on Jane, and she gets increasingly annoyed about it. He sees that she is upset and tries to sweet talk her, but she brushes him off completely. You go girl.The emotions in this story are gut wrenching, especially the scene after the botched wedding ceremony. I feel for Jane and understand her despair, but I weep openly for Edward. All he has ever wanted in life is to find someone he can love who will love him back, and just when he finds her she's ripped away. Oh, my!

I will only go into the briefest details because to give anything away would be to steal a very meaningful experiance from the reader.The first time I read this novel I didn't really see the depth of the piece.

Ms. Bronte must have been quite courageous to write about a free spirited woman like Jane Eyre in Victorian Era. Even though there are so many memorable scenes in this book, what stands out most is the romance between Jane and Edward. The pathos underlying this romance reminds me of the desperate love that Hunchback of Notre Dam professed towards Esmeralda. The lyrical beauty of Bronte's English enhances the appeal of this timeless piece of artwork."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"This is the book that hooked me on reading! It has everything that I enjoy reading about: strong female characters, mysterious and preternatural occurrences, secret romances, and indelible love."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre whisks you away to a world of thoughtful detail and slowly evolving love. Although at times the journey is excruciatingly slow, Bronte makes up for that with her strong-willed heroine, Jane.Jane is not your average heroine. At first glance she is a quiet, boring, and tractable girl, but underneath lays an increasingly strong, virtuous, and independent young woman. After years of knowing only a quiet obedience and a passive submission, Jane finally discovers her true nature when she stands up to the Reeds and demands release from their cruel care. In another display of personal strength, through an effort of pure will and a moral code that allows no compromise, Jane gives up security and a life time of happiness and leaves Mr. Rochester to embark on an uncertain path which promises hardship and grief. Jane's moral integrity along with her steadfast and courageous character is what made this story famous. Jane reveals these qualities again and again in the unfolding story, which makes her more and more admirable. She foregoes marriage to St. John and honorable service as a missionary to stick to her beliefs. Also, Jane does not conform to the expectations of the time. Jane is not content to be used once and then forgotten. Originally, Jane was dependent on Mr. Rochester, playing the traditional subordinate female role. However, in the end when they are finally together forever, Mr. Rochester becomes dependent on Jane, and that is just how she likes it. She wants to play an active and vital role in her husband's life. Bronte did an excellent job creating an admirable character in Jane Eyre.When Jane arrives at Thornfield, serving as a poor and lowly governess, she immediately falls in love with her wealthy master. Bronte enriches the reader's experience of their love with long passages describing Jane's conflicting emotions. Such endearing moments add credibility to the author's claims about Jane's strength of character. As their relationship unfolds, tantalizing hints and subtle foreshadowing grip the audience in suspense and hope that perhaps Mr. Rochester loves Jane too. For instance, Mr. Rochester says, \\"'Goodnight my --\\", and Bronte adds, \\"He stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me\\". Although cheesy, such moments are effective in holding the reader's attention.Despite the novel's many charms and merits, at times I found myself wanting to rip my hair out at its agonizingly slow pace. My annoyance and impatience were magnified towards the story's end when Jane joins the River's household. Perhaps Bronte slows the story down purposely to contrast the speed and excitement of Jane and Rochester's relationship to its opposite in Jane and St. John's plodding relationship. Whatever the reason, the story takes a downward plunge as soon as Jane steps inside River's door.I also had a problem with the ending. Bronte concludes by quoting St. John's letter, \\"Amen; even so, come, Lord Jesus!\\" This is Jane's book, possibly Mr. Rochester's, but never St. John's! The last words are hardly relevant to the story. Sure, faith in God is a reoccurring theme, but hardly last word material. Bronte made a mistake; she should have either ended with Jane or Mr. Rochester saying something about love. Isn't love what this whole story is about!?Still, the good outweighs the bad in Jane Eyre, and I highly recommend it. Anyone who craves a dark love story between two very unlikely characters and possesses enormous patience should pick this book up immediately!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"...after 160+ years.THE STORY:I read Jane Eyre every 3-4 years because its truly the grading curve for so many writers of the genre. There are times even now when I read the book and I'll say to myself, \\"I LOVE this book!\\"When you think of the date in which it was written in and the author's limited worldly experience and resources, you can't help but appreciate her sharp wit and thoughtful insight into each character. In addition to that, Bront has a way of transporting you into Thornfield's dark eerie halls alongside Jane. It's truly a remarkable story!THE BARNES AND NOBLES CLASSICS EDITION:As for this particular edition, for quite some time I had been encouraging a friend to read Jane Eyre. The compact size was perfect for her to carry around in her bag for long grocery store lines, commuter rides, etc. She finished all 608 pages in one day because she loved it! It also has a great introduction filled with historical and bibliographical information on Ms. Bront to truly transport the reader into the mind and time of Jane Eyre.**If you simply want more Mr. Rochester and Jane after reading this, I suggest seeing the 1983 Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke made for TV version by the BBC. Out of all versions (and I've seen all) it is the TRUEST adaptation of Bronte's work and doesn't dumb down her beautiful prose (what the author is most famous for) with modern day slang, nor does it take liberties with Bronte's Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre to bring them down to Hollywood's standards. The strong characters you fell in love with while reading her book, are the same strong characters in this wonderful screen adaptation. Bronte would be proud as was this reader/viewer."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"This copy of Jane Eyre, \\"The Illustrated Jane Eyre\\", from Penguin Classics, is a truly lovely book to read, and look at. The illustrations by Dame Darcy, bring a modern, fearless, and unique look and feel to a very old story. I've read \\"Jane Eyre\\" three times, so it is one of my favorite novels. Of the copies I've read, the illustrations in this one really do the story justice: a modern, gifted, gutsy artist bringing new blood to the novel of a gifted, gutsy writer named Charlotte Bronte."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I bought this book about 10 years ago, and I did not read it till last year, i could not put this book down, This book is so relevant to a woman's heart, to the human being's gemotions, What I love about Jane Is that she always kept fighting through all her trials and never let hate poison her heart, always made the best of everything. I bought the miniseries from BBC, I recommend Pride and prejudice and sense and sensibility by Jane Austen to those who love this genre.Nobody writes this way anymore!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"The Audio was great until I reached disk 14.

She seems to truly understand the message Charlotte Bronte communicates in her superb dialogue. This is my favorite audio CD. Amanda Root's telling of the story does not sound like someone reading from a book, but rather like someone living a life. I highly recommend this audio book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"A classic, I know, and good story line, but very difficult to read - thanks to my Kindle, between the dictionary and translations, I was able to look up words or phrases on just about every page - made for very slow reading - but was still interesting enough to stick with it, even though it was probably the longest book I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"To get right to the point, this book is one that every girl needs to read. Jane never forgets or loses who she is no matter what she goes through. And in the end, not even her wildest dreams could compare to what became her reality and it's all because she stayed true to herself. Jane Eyre, in all her bravery, quickly and easily became my most beloved heroine. She never tried to change Mr. Rochester into something he wasn't. She wouldn't allow him to spoil her with superficial things. She didn't want anything his money could buy, she just wanted to be needed, to be loved. And in the end, that was all Mr. Rochester wanted as well. What more could you ask for? Charlotte Bronte worked wonders. She made Jane feel as if she is an old friend telling her life story through laughter and tears. Reading this book will be one of the best decisions you've ever made. I guarantee it. Disney princesses can suck it. Jane takes the crown."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"The reader can understand more of the past through the eyes of Jane Eyre.

Even if I am only 11, I can understand what Ms. Bronte is talking about."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"JANE EYRE is one of my favorite Victorian novels. The feistiness and lovableness of Jane has never faded for me, even after several readings. My favorite passages from the text are those when Jane leaves Rochester and ends up at Marsh End; and when she is &quot;called&quot; by Rochester from afar and flees to return to him. Charlotte Bronte's writing of these passages is raw with emotion and unforgettable. If you have not yet taken the time to read this outstanding piece of Victorian fiction, do so now. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"This book surpirsed me.

Letting alone the 100page chapters where Jane is off at school, this novel is an astonding romance with a deep rich plot that drives it's way into your body...I felt trimmers after reading the ubiquious &quot;Reader, I married him&quot; phrase.

I have read it at least 20 times through the years, I consider Jane Eyre a must read especially for all females regardless of age."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Today's literary environment is filled with books that read like a bowl of popcorn--they are quickly devoured and lack any substance. However, I understand why many readers shy away from the classics. Most of the time, when I pick up a book I'm just looking to be entertained and diverted--I don't want to feel like I'm in my 12th grade English class. Don't despair if that's you: there are some classic novels that capture the best of both worlds. Jane Eyre is one of those books.Jane Eyre is filled with poetic and beautiful prose that will enlarge your vocabulary and stimulate your imagination. I especially enjoy the dialogue between Jane and Edward Rochester. Not only do the characters speak beautifully, but they also speak intelligently. There are many times a soliloquy will cut right to the heart of the matter in question with the precision of a scalpel, but with language that is poetic as it is accurate. It's a pity many modern novels can't achieve this same balance.Reading Jane Eyre is not like eating your literary vegetables. This book is hugely entertaining. It's gothic romance at its best. Edward Rochester is brooding, seductive, passionate and troubled--the quintessential bad boy. He is infinitely more compelling than that other Edward you'll find lingering around Forks. Jane is a tower of strength. She is a woman who falls deeply in love, but is not defined by that relationship. She does not find her identity in any man, but in the treasure of the spirit God gave her. She faces what would seem to most of us like unendurable suffering in the most admirable way--yet she doesn't come off as superhuman. This is the kind of character teenage girls should be reading--not the simpering, swooning Bella Swan.If you pick up this book, I promise you'll be entertained--but while you are entertained, you will also be uplifted."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I've read the book and watched the excellent BBC video. But the audio book version is a revelation. The narrator teased apart the different strands that lie behind the obvious storyline with great sensitivity. Parts of the book that in my previously too-hurried reading I had found a bit slow and heavy-going, Susan Ericksen reads with considerable thoughtfulness and tenderness. Jane's provoking episodes come across with a gentle lightness, and I could go on. Sufficient to say that each character comes effortlessly and believably alive. I've come away with a whole new respect for Charlotte Bronte's skill and insight. In this reading the book becomes a very special experience.Oops!

Charlotte Bronte did a terrific job! Amidst the first hundred pages or so, I wasn't really into the book because it was full of lengthy descriptions and, I thought at the time, wasted words. But as I read on and got used to the book and fully grasped its meaning, I found that this was one of the best classics I had ever read! (And I am a BIG classics fan.) JANE EYRE made me shed a great many tears and touched me deeply. I am so glad I bought this book! I highly recommend this to all!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this novel, especially they way Charlotte Bronte captivates you with her vivid descrptions. She makes you feel like you are right there next to her experiencing everything she was experiencing. I also loved the whole romance part of it. How Jane never knew her love for Mr. Rochester was so strong until she left him. But then she came to her senses and went back to look for him. She still loved him as much as she did before, even when he was half blind, poor, and only had one hand. That's what you call true love. I love how Jane is such a courageous women to handle so many tribulations in her life. She never gave up and kept on living her life. I think Jane Eyre is an American Heroine for all young women."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's writing is poetical and her characters are well developed.

I read it about 20 times, and every time it was different, and I learned something more than I did before. if you see through all the comments, there are different types of people who read this, ones who read it because they were told to, and those who just try to enjoy a good book. be one of the enjoying, give the book a chance to show you all it has to show...you'll never be sorry for that!!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I am a Senior in high school and I have read this book for the second time for a literary analysis I was assigned. I read this book for the first time while I was an 8th grader. I did only read it as a romance novel then. When I read it again for my paper, I experienced a paradigm shift. My point of view changed as I realized that all of the families mentioned in the book are all dysfunctional, all of them had some sort of problem. I made this my thesis. In order to get the most out of this book, you must appreciate the detail of each thought that Charlotte Bronte put into text. I think this book is an excellent classic and anyone who thinks different does not appreciate classic romantics. I think Bronte did an excellent job and hope that she knows that there are people who appreciate all of her hard work.

She's not georgous, not excellent at any one thing, yet she gets her man. i found the characterization to be masterful, by the middle of the book you could tell what jane would do, yet the book wasn't as predictable as some other classic writers. (ahhem Charles ahhemmm Dickens ahheeemmm Ernest aaahheem Hemingway aaahhheeemmm)sorry, i just had to clear my throught there. this is definately a book for girls. i'm not sexist, but i find that if i can relate to a character in the book than i will find it entertaining. i would not reccomend this for any guys. but definately the best book i have ever read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I read this book when a friend challenged me to deliberately read more books by women authors.

A must-read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"The way you become a friend of Jane's, follow her experiences, and see things from her point of view would make me give it five stars. Charlotte Bronte is an excellent author, really gifted. Why, then, did I only give it four stars? This is because I grew sick and tired of the long, dull details towards the end of the book. I just wanted Jane to go away. I wanted it resolved, but quickly. I was becoming quickly agitated and annoyed. But still, as angered as I was towards the ending (by the way, I didn't care for the deal with the Rivers family at all), the beginning was so majestic I just couldn't insult it too much. I could feel Jane's pain so much. I even began saying, when I was notifying everyone I was going to go read it, that I was 'going to visit Jane.'"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I had to read this book for a school assignment, and I actually ended up liking it.

It is a wonderful example of a book that can be read over and over again and with each reading comes a new experience. Charlotte Bronte tells a formidible tale of one woman's intellect and passions which break across &quot;custom&quot; and &quot;caste,&quot; to use Bronte's own words. Bronte wonderfully describes the inner voice of Jane which Jane instinctually values from a young age. It leads her to take extraordinary emotional risks. She does not allow herself to be shamed into behavior, nor does she shy away from her own desires and ideas. This is a book for ANY person, male or female of any color who likes a great mystery and a profound tale of human strength and experience"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"This book has a very long, slow beginging but once you get into it, it gets interesting.

Charlotte Bronte's writing style is so wonderful, different and refreshing. Her descriptions are so vivid, I can see why she caused such controversy in her day! This novel is honest, compelling and Jane is way ahead of her time, as Charlotte must have been. This has sparked me to dive headfirst into more classics and see what truly makes them classic. I would really recommend this for summer vacation at the beach, or curled up in a storm."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I love the Bronte sisters.

Books tell you so much more than movies or TV shows can. I wasn't disappointed. The plot became clear, and the lessons taught in this story were timeless. How does a person come to have faith, when his past has been anything but perfect? How can we endure, when we have bad experience after bad experience? When &#34;bad&#34; things happen, that is when our character is developed, and this story shows that over and over."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"This is a great book and a classic.

As an American in 2012 the language is a bit challenging for my teenage daughters but I'm going read it aloud to them as a mother daughter thing over the winter holidays. Jane's character is such an inspiring role model for women today. She is faced with incredible temptation yet she choose to do what is right rather than what feels right and Providence rewards her for it.I have been reading this on my phone rather that a reader, but I've found the kindle edition to be just as easy to read as having the book and I always have it with me, even when I just have a few quiet minutes in the car waiting for kids."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I am not one to cry when reading a book, but this one made me cry, laugh and love.

Once she is educated, she becomes a teacher, and then a governess at an estate in the countryside. She loves the master of the estate, but will he love her? You must read this classic to find out, and you will be rooting for this story's heroine all the way. I loved the depth of this character's relationship, not just one of those dime-a-dozen love stories like Twilight. She was a fallible human being, and I admired her for it.

Jane Eyre was summer reading, and I figured he could knock out this assignment on our trip AND we could have some fun talking about it. This plan worked out wonderfully. The narration was great and we had some good discussions.One area that I made my son nuts was complaining about the character of Edward Rochester. I look at his behavior, and cannot understand why so many readers consider him a romantic hero.He treats women terribly. He ignores the emotional needs of Ad&egrave;le Varens. While it is noble that he pays for her care while his paternity is not clear, he has assumed the role of guardian and is not emotionally present for her.Next, Lady Ingram is a narcissistic gold digger. At the same time, she is a feeling human being (in the context of the story). Rochester just uses her to make Jane jealous. He gets Lady Ingram to dump him by telling her a lie when posing as a gypsy fortune teller. This is not an honorable way to end a relationship.He does his worst to Jane. He knows full well that he is already married. Yes, he really does not like Bertha Mason Rochester. No, he really REALLY does not like Bertha Rochester. But, he is legally married to Bertha and he knows it.We find that his plan is to wed her, take her on a honeymoon, ruin her for other men (by the standards of the time), and then drop the bombshell on her that he is already married and that their marriage is not legal.So why do so many women seem to overlook how badly Rochester was going to treat Jane and love this is a romantic story. Jane should have dumped him and not looked back. He is a cad and not worthy of true love. What am I missing?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I was just looking for a free classic to read for fun this summer; this book far exceeded my expectations. While others are reading 50 Shades of Grey, this strangely twisted love story is far more agreeable with my taste. It honestly touched me, and I will continue to reread it for years to come."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I downloaded this book after I kept seeing it mentioned in the Fifty Shades series. This book is 'old school' but very ineteresting and I'm glad to say I have now read it. It was difficult for me to put down at times and at times I needed to put it down just to process what I had read. I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys reading for the sake of reading and who can handle 'deep' reading. If you've not read a lot of classic books this is a good start to add one to your list."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Still a classic! I enjoyed the English of the 1840's. Some of the chapters, however, were a little long and became a bit tedious. Did the really talk like that? With the Kindle dictionary, I had to look up at least three unknown words per page to find out the old-style language."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"This is the 3rd time I've read this book. As an over 50 yr old female I enjoyed Jane Eyre in a different way to the times I read it earlier. Basically, the plot is a bodice ripper without the ribald sexual description (thank God).There is something contained, passionless and distant about Jane that disconnects as you read from the larger narrative,none the less I recommend this book as a good read - just don't expect Wuthering Heights"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Why did I wait until I was 57 years old to read this book?

It is a wonderful book and a great love story."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"One of the challenges in reading a great work of literature is that it often has many imitators. The imitations may be flattering or unflattering; they may be complimentary or subversive; they may borrow just little bits or just about everything. In addition to spoiling surprises (thanks a lot, I Walked with a Zombie!) it is possible for the original source to look cliched or hackneyed after experiencing all those others. Did that torpedo this book for me?Consider some various elements in the story: The first conversation between Jane and Helen Burns at Lowood School reads like the best of Dostoyevsky. The plot meanders from location to location across England like the best of Dickens. Jane has romantic entanglements with noblemen and churchmen (it's Church of England, after all) like the best of Austen. Ghosts, crazy people, and supernatural/horrific events pop up like the best of Val Lewton.Jane Eyre does not suffer at all by comparison. The story of the orphaned girl growing up in an unloving home with an indifferent aunt and cousins, moving out to a harsh boarding school where she gets her education, and taking a job as a governess at the lonely estate of Mr. Rochester is compelling reading. Her character grows throughout the book in believable and engaging ways. There are many deep conversations about Christianity, duty, missionary work, matrimony, etc., that fit naturally into the story and arise from the people's lives. I found the book fascinating and hard to put down. This is a great work of literature undiminished by other similar works.Thanks to Julie and Scott at A Good Story is Hard to Find for getting me to read this wonderful novel.I did read the book on Kindle for Android, which means I didn't really have a book. Unfortunately there was no annotations or notes and quite a bit of dialogue is in French (with a small bit of German, too). I remember just barely enough to get through but it would have been nice to have translations available. I don't know if other e-versions have better support for language-challenged readers. It is something to consider if you haven't read Jane Eyre and don't know French. I think a reader could get by without it but it can be frustrating."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"by far my favorite book of all time.

It's nice to get a copy of Jane Eyre on my Kindle - I like re-reading bits from this book from time to time, it's kind of inspirational. This edition's minor (and - it seems to me - the only) shortcoming is the impossibility of going to any specific chapter via &#34;go to&#34; option."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is never a disappointment. Bronte really can touch your heart with the struggles of the main character. A woman in the post-modern era could have easily been in the same situation. Bronte put forth a completely time-less quality in this book. If you have the patience, it can keep you nailed to your seat!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"A classic for a reason. EVERY woman should read this book! Jane's strength of character and respect for herself is an example to all.

Going to college after all of these years I have to watch my pennies."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"This is the first book I have read by the Bronte's, and I have heard that it is the best. I certainly thought that it was very good. The main character is not like any other heroine which I can think of. She was not beautiful like most, nor extremely cunning. Somehow Bronte manages to develop her personality perfectly, and gets you to like this Jane Eyre, though she is probably the only one in the story who you will like. Bronte makes all of the other characters extremely one sided in their personalities, all dominated by a fatal flaw of some type (the domineering spirit of Mr. Rochester, the extreme sacrafice of emotion by Saint John, the extreme simplicity of Mrs. Fairfax, etc.) This was both good (in that it helps one to see that nearly any character trait can be taken too far and become bad) and bad (the characters were rather stiff somehow).The only other complaint that I have is that it was a bit long and drawn out. Somehow it should have been about 50 pages shorter, though I am not quite sure where the 50 pages should be cut from. It seemed almost like too little butter scraped over too much bread."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I read this book in high school and liked it a lot..

Her mixed life mingles between feeling sorry for her orphaned self and trying to be a romantic wife to Mr. Rochester. The novel, Jane Eyre, is an excellent work of Charlotte Bront not only because of the work itself, but because it is a relation to herself as an autobiography. Charlotte Bront was not that much different than the main character, Jane Eyre, in that they both lived without parents and they both know what loss can be like. The book flows eloquently from start to finish and contains many life morals concerning pride, love, and what it takes to live in this world. Jane Eyre shows how one can mature in to the person that they will be for the rest of their life. Because of this book, my life has been enlightened with good morals and I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"This book is about Jane who is an orphan. When she grew up she found a job as a governess at Thornfield and fall in love with Mr. Rochester, who kept a terrible secret.Maybe it's because I'm only 10 years old,but I found this book rather [odd] and not very romantic at all"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"The book Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte is about a girl who is about ten years old, and she lives with her aunt, cousins because her parents had died when she was young. Her cousin John, who is the master of the house, always harasses her. Jane leaves to go to school, and then she put an ad in the newspaper. A lady named Mrs. Fairfax comes to take her to where she works so Jane can live with them. Jane is a governess who teaches a little girl named Adele. When the master of the house, Mr. Rochester, comes and Jane starts to like him. Jane is eighteen when she went to live at the house in Thornfield.After Jane has been at the Thornfield house for so long she gets a letter saying that her aunt is dying. So Jane goes to her aunts house before her aunt goes and stays for a little bit until she has to get back to work at Thornfield. After that she leaves Thornfield and found a nun who knew her parents. Jane heads back to Thornfield and falls in love and almost marries. But then she finds her self-alone and penniless, then Jane finds that she is rich. The book is good and exciting until the end because of what happens to Jane in the novel.The book has a lot of mystery like when Jane had to put out a fire in Mr. Rochester's bedroom, and romance. In the book in the beginning there is discrimination against woman's rights when master John hurts Jane with his bare hands, this book does have woman's rights in the beginning and in the middle of the book. This book is interesting because it was very expressive of how a teenage life is through this book. The reason why it is so expressive is that the book drags out a teenager life of how problems come and go around. When they explain what is going on in the story with Jane the author explains the weigh she takes the problem in the novel.This book would be really good for people who like love stories and mysteries all in one. This book is a good for maybe teens to high school or even the beginning college students that what a adventure or two with the love and passion in the novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"This is a great book. The only complaint I have is I think because it's the kindle version, sometimes I feel like I'm missing things here and there. For example, they keep mentioning a place called ***Shire....But all I can see is ***Shire. Anyway, not sure if it's like that in the hardcopy book, haven't checked. But I'm sure it has something to do with it being an electronic version. But, LOVE THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"If you love historical romances and classic literature, put JANE EYRE on your reading list. Superb characterization and setting, with an excellent pace of plot. Many readers might be a bit wary of picking up a classic, but JANE EYRE is a good place to start.

I would recommend this book to anyone, especially to young women above the age of twelve who want a clean love story and Christian readers who seek an inspirational message. A good choice for pleasure reading, book groups, or for school!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Excellent read - there is nothing like a good period novel - I would recommend this book to all Bronte readers who love a suspense, thriller and romance all in one!!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"The title says \\"Jane Eyre (Penguin Classics)\\" edited by Q.

Jane is a heroine we can all relate to.. she's plain, mousey, and she's had a difficult life, but she also has an underlying fire. She meets her match in Rochester, a gruff man with many secrets. It is depressing, but also redeeming. Sad, but also romantic.

It contains some aspects of our modern literature but the antics from its time of origin.As a book for AP English, I would rather have selected another book, but this is not the worst. Most readers will fare better in this book for school rather than the infamous \\"Invisible Man\\" and other commonly used senior lit. books.Be prepared for a long read, as JE is definitely longer than what a modern book usually will be. Otherwise, read away - this book has its own unique style that is interesting in all its own."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I had to read this book for school, and I was relatively impressed with it. The plot developed way too slowly for my liking though, and I found myself quickly reading through the \\"stuffing\\" to get to the juicy parts. Throughout the novel the reader gets to know the characters involved very well, and even though they aren't very realistic, they are pleasantly developed, and fun to watch grow; Jane, the main character, proved to be the most satisfying character to follow and watch grow. However, this book is written in Victorian style language, and I found this style to be incredibly boring and difficult to read through or understand at times, but the themes and motifs embedded within this novel are effectively incorporated, and they kept the reader interested in analyzing the text. As for the ending of the book, I must say that I was very satisfied; with most of the intense emotional action happening towards the end of the novel I'm not surprised Bronte found a nice, and pleasant way to end her story. Overall, this book is great for classroom discussions, or to just sit down and read for fun. Enjoy :)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is very inspiring piece of literature and motivates women to uprise against the society. I thought this book is very interesting but in some parts they are dull scenes. The language is well written; however, not modernize. The sentence structure is very long winded and contains a lot of imagery and metaphoric phrases. I hope to the outcome of Jane's life in the future, but I thought that its not very appropriate now in our modern society.The characters i think is well develop in the novel, but the only thing that don't convince me is the unfortunate events that the characters done in the novel is not very realistic.

A marvelous book for anyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"In British literature, my favorite writers are Bronte sisters.Bronte sisters are the genius that their names were known to by a few novels in the world.The heroine Jane Eyre in Charlotte Bronte's novel was brought up by a mean aunt.Therefore Jane Eyre received terrible bullying.The problem of the bullying becomes the great problem in Japan now.In a school a few children sometimes are bullied, and to my surprise, a few parents in Japan abuse their children.The first scene of Jane Eyre is her unhappy life's departureI watch deep depth of human existence there.That chief director who took care of Jane Eyre must be crazy , if we consider by modern sense.It is odd that he is a Christian .Because Christ taught love and impressed the human. And Christ taught us that we are the light of the world.Helen is a kind friend of Jane Eyre in the school and has the heart like the angel.That chief director did the evil that he lets weak Helen walk in the rain .Thus, Helen dies.Furthermore, everywhere in the novel, a British beautiful rural scenery is pictured with the fresh and young sensitivity of a young woman .The mansion which she visited as a tutor is right attractive like an old cave.A big mansion has a secret.A thing that suggests a modern horror novel drifts.Gradually young Jane Eyre is charmed by middle-aged Rochester with the naivete such as the wild beast.This description will be a example of the love story's masterpiece .There are \\"The sorrow of young Werther\\", French \\"The lily of the valley\\", Russian \\"Anna Karenina\\" in the world love stories.But in their novels ,three women are the noble or the rich.In that respect, Jane Eye is from the misfortune.I am interested by the existent problem that this human being is born.Jane Eyre gets true love by power of her intention in the misfortune.It is not at all a light novel.On the contrary, it is a heavy novel.I read Jane Eyre and remembered \\"Light in August\\" of Faulkner."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"It had been years since I read this book.

Years passed but JE didn't - have no idea how many times I read it! After some years of studying, I was able to read - and enjoy - Bronte in English. That was sublime! My printed version is really worn out now but I am enjoying my Kindle version greatly!Love all the features! Highlight and mark all my favourites paragraphs - and find them in a second! I gather more easily now all the lines that show how empty, wounded and deeply hurt EFR's soul was and how Jane gave Rochester's heart a voice. And a voice is meant to be heard... and followed.J+E's characters symbolize now to me an encounter of one spirit seemingly divided in two. But they both had to learn their lessons of acceptance and forgiveness before such awareness arose in their hearts.After leaving Thornfield, Jane's journey was about acceptance. She had to acknowledge - fully and wholeheartedly - her love for EFR past any conventionality. She came back to him out of love. She had no expectations but to be with his \\"best earthly companion\\".Rochester's journey was about forgiveness. He himself had to admit - heartily and unconditionally - his wrong actions and forgive himself. He lied, hid and manipulated out of fear. He did not know how to do things differently - out of love."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I love this book! Easily my favorite book to date.

The book is a little long--but then all Victorian novels are (people had more time to read then),but the material before about who Charlotte Bronte was and that she served as a governess herself gave tremendous background to what might seem like an over-dramatic story. Charlotte Bronte was one of the first novelists to talk about the plight of single women (who had to make a living) of that era in England. Descriptions of the country side and the travel by coach are amazing and the reader feels as if he/she can actually see and experience what it must have been like to live and travel there.Charlotte Bronte's characters are sharply delineated and the main character is a strong woman in an era of weak ones; I compared them with some of the strong women found in the novels of Jane Austen. I definitely recommend it for winter reading, when there is time to snuggle up to a wood stove or fireplace with a cup of cocoa or a glass of wine and immerse oneself in another era. Probably not for male readers unless they are English majors or really appreciate women."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok and it was free so not too bad"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Now this was a real surprise - a &#34;classic&#34; that was worth reading.

Yes, I've only just read it! Never had to at school, like so many people I know, so I had a totally open mind. I love Wuthering Heights, by sister Emily, and I was sort of expecting something of the same calibre. Maybe it is because Jane Eyre is more from the romance genre... I am not so sure. I certainly don't think that Charlotte's writing is anything near her sister's. I also find that there are two stories in Jane Eyre - the main one with Mr Rochester, and the second one with St Johns, and I found them slightly disjointed.

The love story in it was (in my opinion) very intense a lot of the time (the part where she comes back just kills me every time). I can understand how you would not like this book if you don't like cheesy love stories (and, trust me, the ending is VERY cheesy) but it's just a wonderful book in all. The parts where Jane is not with Rochester can be tedious sometimes but, fortunately, since I've read it, I can skip those parts and just read the good ones. When Jane leaves Rochester, Bronte describes it in such a way that it makes the reader feel as if they were leaveng their one true love. The only thing that gets me is the age difference between Rochester and Jane but I don't stress over it. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a good romantic pick-me-up."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is most definitely one of the most wonderful and captivating books that I've ever read.

Jane Eyre, a story of a girl who lived in a house that didn't belong to her, with a family that wasn't hers in which she was treated like a servant,and even less than that in certain occasions, and about her falling in love with a moody man.

However, I finally revisited the book after many years and enjoyed it much more this time around.Jane Eyre is a young, determined girl who is determined to find her proper place in the world. As an orphan who was brought up by her cruel aunt, Jane is sent away to boarding school at a young age, where she and the other students suffer under the hand of an evil headmaster. Things improve at the school when the institution's poor conditions are brought to light following a typhus epidemic, and Jane finishes her schooling and then remains at the facility as a teacher for several years.Although she's content working at the school, Jane still thinks that life has something else in store for her. She accepts a governess position at Thornfield Manor, where she is employed by the dark, brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite his rather surly disposition, Jane finds herself falling in love with Rochester, and is stunned when he returns her affections and proposes marriage. Unfortunately, the wedding never takes place due to a massive secret that Rochester unsuccessfully tries to keep hidden. Jane ultimately flees Thornfield and arrives at another manor called Marsh End, where many surprises await her. Another man eventually proposes marriage to Jane, but she must listen to her heart and return to the one place where she's ever truly felt at home.Jane possesses great strength, self-worth and personal dignity. She's a woman who stays true to her principles throughout her entire life, regardless of the many challenges thrown into her path. Also, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a love story of sorts, and it has a very romantic ending, which I always enjoy.I still think there are parts of this novel that really drag, but I appreciate it a lot more than I did when I was younger. \\"Jane Eyre\\" doesn't come close to \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" in my opinion (Emily was SO the better Bronte!), but it definitely stands on its own as one of the first truly feminist novels ever written."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"This was the first book I read by Charlotte Bronte, and after I finished it I immediately got Villette, then The Professor, and Shirley, and others! She quickly became my favorite author, mainly due to the spirit I felt coming through her writing. She seems to be a true Christian, free from a religious mind-set, and with hopeful views of humanity. I think she is very intelligent, and a little ahead of her time. I love her language and the flow of her writing. The book is romantic but a bit dark, which was a bit refreshing actually. (Although nowhere near as dark as her sister's Wuthering Heights). Read it, it is great, and don't stop at just this book. Shirley is by far my favorite."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Contrary to popular fiction of her day, Bront is keen to keep reminding us that Jane Eyre is no beauty, irregular in feature, and plain. That Rochester is dark, brooding, and not handsome, with a deficient moral history.Can such imperfects unite? Can earthy limits find heaven in love and devotion? Often he calls her by her own name. Other times he calls her by another name, an invention of endearment. What does he call her? From calling him Sir she moves to a name born of equality and devotion. What does she say? New naming is not so strange, as in Revelation 3:12: \\"I will write upon him my new name.\\"Can we ordinary persons unite? Can we couples live with each other's limitations, and be happy and joyful? We do it all the time. How many of us are perfect?Are the marriages of the \\"beautiful people,\\" the celebrities, superior to those of the rest of us?

But to fully appreciate this book requires that you be a \\"mature\\" reader. And also realize that this book was written in another era, where society and standards were much different than today.I originally read this book years ago for my highschool literature class. Although I didn't dis-like the book, I didn't exactly like it either. It did not have much of an impact on me. I think I was too immature (lacking in life experiences) to relate to and understand some of the strong emotions and the complex sides of human nature portrayed in the book.Reading this book years later as a mature adult, I was deeply touched by the story of Jane Eyre. You experience a variety of emotions: abandonment, despair, love, romance, mystery, danger, heartache. And Jane Eyre was really a character ahead of her time - Although content to conform to the standards expected of a woman in her time period, Jane had an independent mind and spirit. She would not do something against her will, heart, or conscience. She was not afraid to speak her mind. She had strong Christian moral beliefs and would not waver from them. She is a heroine to be admired and respected.So much more could be said, but I will leave it at that.

We immediately take Jane under our wing, feeling more her personal protector with each turn of the page. Then, one day, Jane is a woman. Though retaining many of her childlike tendencies, Jane is determined to be independent: leaving her old boarding school victorious and free, she begins a governess position at the manor home of the elusive and mysterious Mr. Edward Rochester. It is Jane who tames Rochester's brooding and arrogant heart, reducing him to schoolboyish desperation.So deliciously provactive is &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; that it is impossible not to devour it within days; my own worn-with-love copy sits next to a dog-eared &quot;Villette.&quot;It is sometimes speculated that Charlotte Bronte exercised her complicated mind through the written word; &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is beautiful evidence of that.As the story slows to its conclusion, you will find yourself lost: hungry for more of Jane, more of Rochester, and more of the magic that is &quot;Eyre.&quot; Quench that thirst with more Bronte (perhaps Emily's &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; or some of Anne's poetry?) or, if you're like me, a second read of the irresistible &quot;Jane.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Great purchase Great purchase Great purchase Great purchase and came when it was supposed to condition was also as stated I was very happy with this"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I just didn't have the TIME in my life to properly enjoy it.

She is poor and plain, yet she doesn't use that as an excuse to live with the man she loves in an improper relationship. She shows rare strength of character and wisdom when she literally runs away from temptation. She knows if she stays with Mr. Rochester, she will never be able to be truly happy, and that despite his promises to the contrary, that she will lose his respect, and she will lose her self-respect. She gives up everything to do what she knows is right, and in the end, she is rewarded in unexpected ways.

Some of the events Jane experiences are based on Bronte's own life. Bronte began writing Jane Eyre in 1846. It was an immediate and thorough success upon publication in 1847.

Not long after she was born her parents died of typhus by caring for the poor. Growing up and being raised in Gateshead by her aunt was not easy. This orphan girl never got loved from her aunt \\"Mrs. Reed\\" or her cousins \\"Eliza, Georgina\\", and her bullying cousin \\"John.\\" She was like any other child, trying to survive in this world.

Mrs. Reed decided to send Jane to Lowood for free, to an orphan school where she was treated harshly and overworked. Growing up in this school made her stronger.

I read it again the summer after seventh grade (last summer) and I still love it just as much. It's one of those books that you can just read over and over and over....and you never get tired of it. Charlotte Bronte tells Jane's heartbreaking storing of being mistreated as a child and growing up into a shy, reserved young adult so well. I can see everything in the book happening as I read it. I especially love the ending - I'm so glad it's a happy one. This book is SO a two thumbs up in my opinion!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"One of the things that I liked most about \\"Wuthering Heights\\", by Charlotte Bronte's sister Emily, was the \\"scenery\\", the way in which the author conveyed a weather, an opressive environment, a climate of tension and impending doom. In Jane Eyre this too happens, but in a different way. For one thing, the characters move around more and it is not always foggy and rainy. You can actually see the novel like a film, and feel the damp air and the ominous silence.\\"Jane Eyre\\" tells the story of a woman, since her childhood. The orphaned daughter of a poor Anglican priest, she goes to live with his uncle and aunt, but the man soon dies and she is left to live under the iron fist of the aunt, a horrible woman with horrible kids who torment Jane constantly. Of course, we get only her version, since the book is narrated in the first person. After an incident when Jane is left to terrorize in the \\"red room\\", where her uncle died and where she fears his ghost will appear, she gets out of control and sent to an orphanatory. A brief digresson is worth here: ever since she is a child, Jane shows enormous self-assurance and pride. Her strong character refuses to be mistreated, and she reacts even violently to injustice. Her personality will grow through the novel, giving her the endurance to sustain repeated blows of fate. So she goes to the orphanatory, where after a period of incredible suffering and mistreatment, she finds a home and a friend in one of the school teachers (a young woman). She becomes a teacher herself, and when she's 18 she feels the time to fly away has come, so she advertises in a newspaper as a tutor for children. She receives a positive answer and moves to a manor house far in the countryside, the typical Bronte scene in the moors. The job consists in teaching a young French girl, with whom she develops a strong, if not too intimate, bond. But, and it's a big but, there is a mystery. The girl is not (at least not legally) the manor's lord's daughter. He's not even there when Jane is hired. He's supposed to be a stern, unpredictable man near his forties called Mr. Rochester. Finally the man appears, and he and Jane slowly develop a strange relationship. He's initially cold and sarcastic, but somehow he becomes impressed by the girl's strong character, ability for irony, and her unwillingness to be defeated. As time goes by, the other mystery of the house starts to intrigue Jane: in the third floor there's a locked room, from where sometimes come, muffled, a hysterical laughter and incoherent and incomprehensible words. Jane is led to believe it's one of the servants, an efficient but \\"strange\\" person. Subsequent episodes not worth revealing in a review slowly happen, and believe me they are terrifying, Gothic and violent. Little by little Jane falls in love with Mr. Rochester, but it takes time for it to dawn upon her, and at some point, when she realizes, she realizes too taht she has no chance. He's rich, she's a poor thing without a name, heritage or fortune. She thinks he's going to marry a beautiful and arrogant woman from the neighborhood. One day, the horrible aunt gets terminally sick, and Jane is sent for. She shows remarkable ability for forgiveness and stands by her aunt's side until the witch finally dies. When she comes back to Mr. Rochester's house, she will find her Fate, which I won't spoil for you.This rare novel is a jewel. First, because of the perfect construction of the character, indeed a person. Even though unbelievable coincidences happen sometimes in the novel, Jane is created so well that she is totally fleshed out before us. She is rather plain and short, a tiny, seemingly insignificant woman. But in truth she happens to be charming, funny, a little shy but courageous to the point of recklesness. She has a penetrating and acid sense of humor. Jane's life is an example of braveness, of the truly free individual creating his or her own destiny. Sometimes you just want to take her in your arms and comfort her, only to receive a bitter comment. At the time the novel was published, it raised eyebrows for the uncondescending presentation of an independent woman, always figthing for her rights and conscious of her being a free spirit, slave to no one. Jane is easily on of the best created character is all literature. For people like us, usually living in big noisy cities, experiencing life in the moors is a refreshing, even if sometimes terrifying, thing.Finally, \\"Jane Eyre\\", like \\"Wuthering Heights\\", is totally original literature. It comes from the fantasies and dreams of a woman who, like her sisters, lived practically isolated from the outer world, from the inelligentsia and from any literary or political circles. The Brontes were girls from the wild, and lived tragic and Gothic lives which get greatly reflectd in their books. Excellent."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"And each time I still find something new to love. On about the fifth or sixth reading, you finally start reading all those long descriptions word for word rather than breezing through for plot. They're wonderful and frequently humerous. Bronte has a tremendous sense of humor.My favorite things about the work are its humor and how it attacks fundamentalist Protestant Christianity while embracing Christianity. Unfortunately it has little tolerance for Catholicism. But that is only a minor theme and I think Charlotte Bronte herself was much more liberal minded when she was dealing with particular individuals rather than stereotypes. At the very least it is a lesson in the prejudices of her day.Jane Eyre is ultimately a fairy tale. Everything is made right in the end. But it has far more edge than a mere romance. How many romances have ten year olds telling off the fundamentalist ministers who threaten them with hell? How many of them have the eight year old outlive her anger and grow into a generous and forgiving spirit. How many mere romances rely so heavily on playful intellectual banter? Jane Eyre is Cinderella and she is rescued not by beauty and a fairy godmother and pumpkin coach, but by wit and heart."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"This book was a complete surprise to me.

When her uncle dies, it falls to her aunt to provide her care. Unfortunately, her aunt despises the young girl and eventually finds a way to send the young girl away. The young girl, Jane Eyre, enters a boarding school for girls of less significant means and it is there she can truly begin to take charge of her life and where her adventures, so to speak, begin.Jane Eyre did catch me up immediately and keep me involved through the first half of the book. It moved fairly quickly. However, I thought the story dragged a bit about halfway and throughout the second half. Personally, I found the book suffered from what most Romance era and Gothic writers had an affinity for: why use 5 words when 15 or 20 will do. The novel became wordy and overlong at times and I found myself putting it down for long periods of time. Quite frankly, I think the story is better told in the myriad of movies that have been released. I am quite at a loss as to exactly why this novel is such the classic it is.The character of Jane Eyre bothered me as well, but I think she was more truthfully written and my dislike reflects the wordy nature of the book. Jane is morally strong - and that is to be admired - but she is so emotionally cold - I never imagined her being \\"in love,\\" passionate or otherwise. Even though she states she is in love, there seems to be no passion or fire. What an oddly matched pair! Though, I get the same feelings when I read Jane Austen, so perhaps readers of Ms. Austen's novels will appreciate this one.This novel is not all terrible, despite what I've said. It is engaging, though I think parts can be skimmed. Those who absolutely adore Gothic romance will love it. Those of us who find Gothic romance dull and dreary will find this novel less than enchanting."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"The main theme of Jane Eyre is that happiness and contentment can be found during our lives on earth. This is shown in the fact that Jane led a very discontented and sad childhood, but she found happiness in her relationship with Mr. Rochester. This theme also came out very strongly through Jane's cousin John. He was so dedicated to serving God and being a missionary that he asked Jane to marry him because he thought she was a hard worker. He didn't love her, but he believed that serving God came before his own happiness. The book makes it seem as though this is wrong, because in the end John goes to India by himself and does not enjoy the rest of his life. It is presented as though Jane did the fulfilling and satisfying thing by marrying Mr. Rochester, and John did the good but unhappy thing by becoming a missionary in India. Obviously, it is not good to marry someone that you don't love, but Charlotte Bronte seems to take this to the extreme by saying that unless you get married to the person you love, you will not lead a satisfied life. In truth, if you lead a life dedicated to serving and praising God, you will have a satisfied life. It is not just people and circumstances that can make us happy, but a close relationship with God. Nevertheless, I thought that Jane Eyre was a very good book. There was always a little hint of mystery to keep the reader interested, and the book presented some interesting ideas to think about. Jane Eyre did a good job of presenting Charlotte Bronte's ideas, and it is a very well-written, descriptive book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is the rarest kind of novel - one that conveys boundless emotion without stumbling too far into darkness and misery.Plain and poor, Jane works as a governess in the house of Mr Rochester, a brooding and temperamental man with a dark secret, and eventually falls in love with her wealthy employer.

The book starts off with Jane, a lonely ten year old abandoned by her aunt in a prison-like boarding school. It continues as Jane finds an occupation as a governess fro a little French girl. But, beware as Jane is falling madly in love with Mr. Rochester (her master as she calls him-is it just me or is I Dream of Jeanie popoing into my head), who has a secret terrible enough to destroy Jane and himself too. I recommemd this book for the older more mature reader (13 and up). Even though nine year olds can read this book, to fully understand the passion and adult situations you must be a little more mature. To really fully understand Jane Eyre you must read past the words and into the heart of little troubled Jane."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Although this book was written long ago, it was excellent.

The story is full of woe and sorrow along with love and beauty."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Anyone who has read Jane Eyre will be more than ready to assert that there is more to this novel than just a protracted love story. There's the issue of class boundaries, marriage, faith and religious zealotry, self-realization, the circumstance of women in Victorian times, and so on. But being a self-confessed simpering romantic, I have no choice but to focus on my favorite theme.I loved Jane most whenever she's in the company of Mr Rochester, or even when she's just thinking about him. Somehow, for me, she becomes quite fervent, feels more human and behaves more womanly. Plus, I loved the fact that the author fully expressed in words the love that Mr Rochester himself feels for our eccentric heroine--so passionate, in fact, that I think some readers may gag at the \\"syrupy-ness\\" of his avowals. Not for me though. In fact, I feel a sort of regret that such emotion from a male character is rarely encountered in romance novels nowadays.Though a bit rough for me to begin with, Jane Eyre, as both the novel and the woman, became engaging as the story progressed. Dark, emotional, often dialectic, at times drily humorous, this story is sure to be remembered for a long while."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"if i had to say anything about jane it would be that she seems to revel in pain. the injustic of her childhood caused it i suppose or, perhaps, she was always that way. was rodchesters wife crazy before she was locked up? or did locking her up make her that way? well, jane seems to like to be in pain and rodchester seems to like to cause it, they make a happy pair. it was a dark book with a happy ever after, as happily ever after as a dark book can be.the book was interesting, clear and well written though something of a slow read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"With an unexciting introduction of Jane's abusive childhood, Jane Eyre later develops into a dramatic struggle in search of autonomy and love. The story constantly shifts between poignant moments in Jane's life and triumphant ones. Like a typical classic, the novel starts with an abusive childhood and ends with a happy marriage. As mundane as it may sound, the story is unique and the reader grows to respect Jane for the hard choices she makes.Jane struggles to choose between her passionate love story and desire for independence, asserting that satisfaction results from a balance between emotions and desire. Jane develops from a miserable and mistreated child, to a well-respected and independent woman after she learns to discern between passion and reason.Jane decides to flee Thronfield and escape from the luxurious style of life to find her identity. She sacrifices her true love for Rochester and prefers starvation in order to flee from passions and desires. Yielding to her emotions would cause Jane to be a prisoner in her own eyes.Jane's social status does not compare to Rochester's wealthy possessions. When Jane, however, becomes rich, from an unexpected heritage, she willingly returns to Rochester, after having balanced between morals and passions.When Jane finally leads a comfortable life, she refuses to yield to reason, choosing love instead. Jane refuses St. John's proposal because she finds it necessary for her to choose love and happiness over the ideal woman society expects of her. Jane once again leaves her previous comfortable life in search for her true love. Even with Rochester's physical and social deteriorating conditions, she is able to find true love because she balances between desires and expectations. Jane's sense of freedom is to not yield to the position she is in if her conscience and desires are not both satisfied.Adding to its thrills, the Gothic character of Bertha Mason portrays the dark romanticism movement of the era in the late 19th century. Setting the house on fire, and tearing Jane's bridal gown on her wedding night, she is the conflict that tears Jane and Rochester apart. She also causes Rochester's blindness and loss of his house. She is killed in the fire and Jane, much stronger now, is back to compensate Rochester for all what he has suffered."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is an unusual, mysterious and refreshing love story. Right from the start Jane's suffering sets the tone for the novel. Jane is mistreated by her aunt Mrs. Read and abused by her cousins. When Jane is sent to the charity school Lowood, her life is not much better, as the neglectful school is a brutal place to grow up. Sad, plain and orphaned, Jane is a new kind of heroine.Jane Eyre is not the beautiful, perfect and delicate character dominates fairy tales. After years of watching Disney's various versions of handsome Prince Charming fall in love with a beautiful girl whom misfortune has befallen, Jane is most certainly a welcome change. After surviving an epidemic of typhus, near starvation, intense cold and chilblains, she certainly makes Sleeping Beauty look pretty pathetic for fainting at the prick of a needle. Indeed, Jane's life begins as more of a tragedy than a fairytale. However, her story really begins when she leaves Lowood and becomes a governess at Mr. Rochester's Thornfield.When Jane first encounters Mr. Rochester, she is happy to help him and feels comfortable doing so. As Jane and Mr. Rochester talk and spend time together, their love for each other grows. Despite the presence of haughty and beautiful Blanche Ingram, Mr. Rochester and Jane become engaged. At this point in a typical love story, the couple would be married and live happily ever after. However, in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre Mr. Rochester's mysterious past seizes the fairy tale moment to reveal itself and haunt the happy couple. This portion of the book is a bit long but is pleasantly new, as Mr. Rochester is a welcome substitute for the ubiquitous Prince Charming. Rochester is not handsome or young, instead he is bad tempered and is rescued by Jane more often than he does any rescuing of his own. It is very rare to find a novel with such fresh characters, and it's bracing that the book is not dominated by excessively beautiful people. Rather, Jane and Rochester are easy to relate to.After the marriage ceremony is interrupted and Rochester shows Jane his wife Bertha, the novel slows to about the pace of a sloth. Charlotte Bronte's novel would have benefitted greatly from an aggressive editor who could have cut about a hundred pages out of the book. Jane makes the dramatic and frustrating decision to leave Thornfield, and preserve her honor as well Mr. Rochester's. At this point in the book the level of my admiration for Jane plummeted along with my interest in the story. As starving Jane wanders through the wilderness in apparent agony over a decision she made of her own free will, she happens to stumble on the home of her distant relatives. After recovering, and beginning a job as a teacher she receives an inheritance from a long lost uncle. Unable to suppress her curiosity as to what had become of Rochester, and receiving no response from Mrs. Fairfax, Jane searches for her beloved Mr. Rochester.As the novel ends, it regains its excellence with the sweet reunion of Jane and Mr. Rochester. Although Rochester is crippled and blind, the story gets its long sought after happily ever after. Jane and Rochester are unusually fascinating characters, who make a more lasting impression than their beautiful fairy tale counterparts."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre, written in 1946 by Charlotte Bront, tells the story of an orphan girl who struggles to overcome the hardships that threaten her relationship with Mr. Rochester. After leaving her hateful aunt and cousins, and then her school, Lowood, Jane Eyre travels to Thornfield Hall to become a governess. It is here that she encounters Mr. Rochester, and the two fall in love. However, the novel is full of surprises and their love does not go untested.The chapters describing Jane's time at Gateshead and Lowood bring to mind characters such as Matilda and Harry Potter. As familiar as it is, the story is still heart-warming and builds up the reader's feelings for Jane for the rest of the novel. At Thornfield Hall, it is obvious that Jane is falling in love with Mr. Rochester. It is less clear that Mr. Rochester has feelings for Jane. After waiting out the suspense, the reader is finally rewarded with Mr. Rochester's proposal to Jane. Jane herself is not excited, and I found myself wishing that she was happier. Even though Charlotte Bronte's foreshadowing hints that something is not right at Thornfield, the horrific revelation of Mr. Rochester's deranged and murderous wife is a twist that surprised me. I was irritated with Jane for her choice of reason and pride over true love, but eager to find out what becomes of her.For one chapter, Jane wanders through villages in Yorkshire, desperate to find work, food, and shelter. I was angry with her for forgetting her parcel on the carriage, and I just wanted her to return to Thornfield Hall. Reluctantly, Jane reasons that returning to Mr. Rochester goes against her pride and sense and she refuses to go back. Eventually, she encounters the Rivers, who provide a place for her to stay. Simultaneously, Jane discovers that she has inherited a fortune and the Rivers are her cousins. Jane is far more overjoyed because she has a family rather than that she is rich.St. John Rivers trying to persuade Jane to marry him is the only really low point in Jane Eyre. These chapters are full of long conversations in which Jane agrees to go with him to India but not become his wife, followed by St. John saying that she must marry him. The same points are debated between the two many times, making this part of the book slow and boring. Finally, Jane leaves the Rivers and returns to Thornfield. I was disappointed that Jane didn't put her foot down immediately because it is obvious she will never marry St. John.Jane does suffer many hardships throughout the book, but Bronte rewards her with a happy ending. I liked the fact that Charlotte Bront wrote the prologue so that it took place ten years later. The reader finds out what happened to most of the characters in the book, including St. John, the Rivers sisters, and Ad&egrave;le. I like books that finish completely, with every loose end tied up, and Bront certainly does this in Jane Eyre. This novel is not a simple love story: it is filled with hardships, gothic elements, and mystery."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"The plot revolves around Jane as a child to adulthood. Orphaned since an infant, she grows up with her harsh aunt and unpleasant cousins. Around the age of ten, she gets sent to charity-school, where they provide education for the poor and orphaned. The school is run so poorly, many of the students die from meager provisions and disease. Jane survives the hardships of being at school; she would rather be anywhere than her aunt and cousins. She stays until the beginning of her adulthood, where she obtains a job as a governess to a child within the moors of England, namely Thornfield Hall. Thornfield Hall is owned by Edward Rochester, whose satirical character meets Jane's sharp wittiness, creating an intense bond between the two.Bronte intrigues the reader with the intricate development of the characters, making them truly realistic. For example, the choices she has Jane makes choice that are never straightforwardly done. As she goes through a great deal of obstacles, the author has Jane dwell on them in a heart-wrenching and analytical manner. The characters are also realistic to the Victorian time period in which it is set in. The roles of women and men are clearly distinct to the 1800's. It critically explains the patriarchal domination that she's constantly up against with the men in her life (Mr. Brocklehurst, Mr. Rochester, and Mr. Rivers) and England's social hierarchy while in her discovery of the complicated social position of governesses.****SPOILER ALERT****The author also explores a couple themes make the book quite interesting to its readers. One is the concept of morality. Jane decides whether her commitment to her philosophies is strong enough to resist the appeals of Mr. Rochester and refuses to be Rochester's mistress because of her \\"impassioned self-respect and moral conviction.\\" She rejects St. John Rivers' marriage proposal because they were not in love and forgives her Aunt Reed despite the cruelty she had Jane endure. Another was religion, when Jane attempts to gain a balance between happiness and faith. She encounters three extreme aspects of Christianity - Mr. Brocklehurst's strict religious discipline, Helen Burns' submissiveness, and St. John Rivers' commitment to charity and accomplishes stability between the three to help control her passionate personality but not completely changing her true self altogether.*****SPOILER ENDS*****Honestly, from the title and cover of the book, you would think it would be an uninteresting biography. However, Charlotte Bronte's story of Jane Eyre has a great deal of twists and turn of events and constantly keeps the reader interested.

Jane Eyre in no way is one of those bad books. I had to read Bronte's novel for my college English Lit class and at first thought it might not be that interesting seeing as it was written over 200 years ago. The story of Jane Eyre pulled me in and found myself thoroughly interested in what happened to her. I now know why Jane Eyre is such a classic novel and is still being read today. The character of Jane Eyre is very strong, however she keeps most of who she is to herself due to her class in society. She becomes a sort of female detective and finally discovers where she is meant to me in the end."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I really want to tell you what happens because I thought it was so good!

And I'm thinking maybe it's been a mistake. If only every book could be as wonderful as this one. I really loved it.My copy of Jane Eyre has an introduction by Joyce Carol Oats and I would caution those who don't know this story; do not read the introduction! It will spoil the story. Thankfully I didn't read it until after I finished the book and I am so glad, it tells everything that happens!Jane never forgets that she must love and respect herself first and foremost. She is clever, direct, honest and true to herself even when holding true to her principles costs her dearly.It is a gothic story, dark and heartbreaking full of love, devotion, obsession, isolation and oppression.

Bronte definitely has a way with words, and Jane's story, though in some parts a bit unrealistic, certainly makes for a good read. However, the dialogue is a little confusing sometimes because the author uses the wrong pronouns (like: &quot;Would she like a morsel of bread?&quot; when it ought to be &quot;Would YOU like a morsel of bread?&quot;)This happens pretty often near the end, and it's terribly annoying. These flaws not withstanding, however, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; will appeal to anyone who enjoys the romance and soap-opera plots of Victorian literature paired with some gothic characteristics (crazy Bertha screaming and doing mischief in her locked cell)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"As many people may know, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is the story of an orphaned girl who has an evil aunt that locks her away in an eerie red room where her uncle died in. Being the protagonist of the novel, Jane breaks away from her aunt's oppression and stands up for herself. As Jane lives life away from her aunt, she realizes that the outside world is just as strenuous. Against many odds, Jane pushes forward with her life. She finds a job as a governess and falls in love with her employer and he loves her back, but of course with Jane's luck, more obstacles are hurdled at her.Being set during the Victorian period, social status already plays a big obstacle in Jane's life. When obstacles, though some highly unlikely, beyond social class prevent her from marrying the love her life, Jane must establish her own code of ethics. What is wrong and what is right? What can she do and what can she not do?The novel may seem to focus much on the aspect of Jane's love life, but there's much more to it than that. Throughout Jane's love story, there's always eerie things going on, for example the shrieking yell coming from a room no one is allowed in and that's just the beginning. \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a book that has many different aspects and a hint of gothic fiction. There's love, mystery, strength, courage, and faith. It's the journey of a lost female on the road of identifying herself. This is a classic that should not be passed up especially if you're a person who believes that love prevails against all odds. This classic is a refreshing book to read; it's not every day that you find such a strong female character in literature.Even though the only complain I have to offer is the lengthiness and the endless dialogue, this novel is worth it all. Read along with Jane's story as she discovers what she has to offer the world and herself. The story will have you at the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next.

It's a different experience reading as an adult! I wish I could say I loved it but I just can't. Charlotte Bronte used so many words and descriptors when much less would have done just fine. (Have a dictionary handy. Many of the words used in Jane Eyre are archaic and need definition. Otherwise much of what Bronte is trying to convey is lost. This is not a criticism - just part of reading Jane Eyre.)I have 2 main difficulties with Jane Eyre. First, it was difficult for me to see either Mr. Rochester or St. John Rivers as desirable. Both were manipulative control freaks. Secondly, there are some \\"coincidences\\" (specifically with regard to the Rivers family) that seem so entirely unlikely that it's distracting. (As a side note, I question whether Jane's time with the Rivers was necessary to advance the story. That section of the book seemed especially plodding.)Last but not least, Jane Eyre is deeply religious. This is not a bad thing, but much of the book is spent sermonizing. This, too, adds to its length.I came away from Jane Eyre disappointed but also appreciative of Jane's amazing (if flawed) journey."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I'm going to rate the quality of the Kindle Edition since this seems to be the only place to do so. I won't go into the story since there's a perfectly good sysnopsis on the description page and several well written reivews on the work itself. The kindle edition was good to say the least. I did find a few spelling errors that were annoying, but none more so than the heroine, Jane, repeatedly being referred to as 'Janet' throughout the entire novel; I find this to be unacceptable. I do not know if this occurs in the print-versions as this was my first encounter with the story. Had there been less (or no) spelling errors as well as the correct name reference to the main character, I would have given it 5 stars on content alone---although it still creeps me out that 19 year olds and 40 year olds so frequently ended up marrying in that day and age, but I just had to put it out of my mind when reading.

So glad I made this purchase!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the world's best-loved classic novels for so many reasons.It's an exciting piece of feminist literature written at a time when feminist literature was little known and even more poorly accepted. That it is a semi-autobiographical novel written by a staunchly, independent female author who herself was struggling to survive by her own wits and means and stand on her own two feet makes the story all the more poignant and compelling. While it is a prime example of Gothic romance peppered with the typical fixtures of a Gothic novel - the spectral Thornfield manor that seems to attain a life of its own; the allusions to mythological characters such as ghosts and vampires; the uncanny timing of such weather phenomenon as lightning or a chilling, drenching downpour to accompany major events in the novel - it also breaks new ground in that it avoids some of the typical conventions of Victorian literature. And, finally, it is a piece of masterful story-telling built around larger than life characters that for over 150 years has enchanted readers of all ages and thrilled watchers of numerous television and movie adaptations.For those few of you that have yet to read this wonderful novel, the story can be summarized quickly enough. A dying father extracts a death bed promise from his sister to raise his infant daughter, Jane Eyre. The sister, a spiteful and mean spirited woman grows to hate the obligation that Jane represents and soon sends her away to a boarding school. (Did anyone else have flashbacks to Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby when they were reading this portion of the novel?) In spite of the harsh mental and physical cruelty she endures at the hands of the school's administrator and its teachers, Jane survives to become a teacher at the school. Ultimately she leaves to seek her own way in the world and secures a position as governess in the household of Edward Fairfax Rochester.At this point, most readers will correctly guess that Jane and Mr Rochester fall in love with each other but to tell more of the story would be to spoil the effect of this magnificent novel for first time readers.Suffice it to say that Charlotte Bront has woven an enthralling story into the exploration of a multiplicity of themes that will occupy students of the English language novel for decades to come - the interplay of self-respect, morality, conventional mores and religion; the effects of social standing and class discrimination; gender relations in a patriarchal staunchly male-dominated society; legal issues of the day that related to marriage, inheritance and ownership; contrasting extremes of religious zealotry as displayed by Brocklehurst's hypocritical Puritanism reflected against St John Rivers' obsessive but well-intentioned determination to spread Calvinist dogma as a missionary abroad.While many of these issues have clearly been relegated to the history of the 19th century, it's also a fact that much of the controversy that Bront has so eloquently built into her characters' lives persist as issues into our own 21st century. Little wonder that \\"Jane Eyre\\" has such enduring power in the world of English literature!Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"love the story of Jane Eyre, book was in good condition (ordered used) but cover differed from picture shown.

In fact, someone pointed out to me that her childhood dragging on and on helps you suffer with her and gives you a lot of sympathy for the character (Thanks Miriam!). Oddly enough, when I read this a second time before I saw the movie, I found the beginning went a lot faster. So you'll have to judge for yourself if you like the pace, but either way the beginning is worth it.The movie adaption of Jane Eyre by Focus Features was very well done and I really liked it. They were especially faithful to the characters. A few of my favorite scenes got left out, but I liked the characters so much I forgave them. The Gothic themes in the novel were played up as well making it a little spicy."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I had ordered two DVD's of Jane Eyre.

The point which haunted her was during the orphanage her aunt has consigned her to: she kept thinking those who are talented are destined for greatness, but her best friend with the fair hand was let off and killed. That was the most disappointing part of her youth and haunted her to no end and no beginning. She most willingly settled to be with a mocked up version of male counterpart of her friend from youth as repairing the damages she saw but could not escapes. Who could not but questioned her senses on why would she not accept the person who she is, but she tries to escape her own drawing ability and let the skinny girl have the crown, in the end, she makes up by letting her of all the grieves with which she felt as a child and watches another woman die in her own care. In fact, she condone murder twice to marry into her unloved imagination. I am not sure if in fact, when love being equal, she herself is any more sane and/or shameful for her desire to escape the part of her soul that does not want to see her friend as gone awry, but she could have chosen to say no, to the man who has thus found her to be a willing body for his child in custody. So the subject became the unacceptable girl and her mother became more of disowned love tale's antagonist. I don't believe the author hints at polygamy, but it wanted to be so to satiate its own desire to compete with all the other females at all cost for a chance at marriage."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"My mom encouraged me to read this book when I was 13. She said that it was a great classic for girls and that I would love it. And so I did read it and love it, but now I'm amazed that I got through it. I don't have a copy of it anymore, so I read some of it on-line, and I was surprised to see that the writing is rather ponderous and even tedious. I'm amazed at the length of some of the sentences. When I was young, I didn't worry about difficult words. I certainly never looked up unfamiliar words in the dictionary because I didn't want to destroy the momentum and flow of the story. I could usually tell from the context the meaning of the word. I'd been told that it was an exciting story so I buckled down and forced myself to get into it.Before I knew it, I'd put myself in Jane's shoes, and my own life started to look really good in comparison. Terrorized by the family who raised her, abused by the administrators of the school she attended, my heart was bleeding for her and then, finally, she received some emotional sustenance from a caring, understanding teacher and a saintly, loving classmate.When she goes to work for Mr. Rochester as a governess for his \\"ward,\\" Adele (actually his illegitimate child), she is a love-starved, vulnerable young woman. Worldly Mr. Rochester has been around shall we say, and his heart has been hardened by various circumstances in his life. However, Jane's goodness, innocence, and intelligence win him over. They fall in love and wish to marry.But remember this is a gothic novel, and there are mysteries in the big house they inhabit. Screams can be heard coming from the attic. There's a fire one night. Strange laughter can be heard on occasion.Suffice it to say, they're not allowed to marry--as they're about to exchange vows a man storms the church and insists that he can tell why the couple should not be allowed to marry.Jane goes away, she nearly marries someone else, and then one night she believes that Rochester is calling her...Enough said, this is the sort of information my mom gave me when she was seducing me into reading this book--a Cinderella sort of heroine falls in love with an older man who lives in a big spooky house--that was enough for me. I proceeded to make my way through all those long sentences and was richly rewarded at the end. I can tell you that this isn't exactly a fairy-tale ending but it's more happy than sad. Very poignant. You'll cry, but you'll be so happy that you shared Jane's misery and witnessed her happiness."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"At 50, with the kids all growing up and moving out, I'm finding more time to read, and most of it is on my Kindle I recieved for my birthday. Free classics from Amazon seemed like a good place to start. There are many books that I know the story line to from other sources (movies mostly), but never had a chance to read the original source material. Jane Eyre is one of those books. It wasn't a quick read, and it did drag on at times. Honestlyh, I thought to myself quite often, \\"What amd I doing reading a gothic romance\\", but I carried on. I had also seen the 2011 movie adaptation (which I also recommend) and wanted to fill in the missing pieces. I also wondered what I would have thought of this book if I HAD read it as a young person (teenager)? I probably would have hated it! I'm glad I read it this summer as upon reflection I did enjoy this Bronte novel. I hope you enjoy rereading the classics like I am."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre follows the life of a Jane Eyre - a poor, plain, unconnected and very small-bodied young woman. When the novel begins, she's ten years old and lives with her horrible Aunt Reed and her equally dreadful cousins, who enjoy bullying her. Deemed a troublesome and disagreeable girl (even \\"passionate\\", gasp, the horror!), Jane is passed onto Lowood, a school for orphaned girls.After six years in that hell-hole, having survived a typhus outbreak and malnourishment, Jane is promoted to teacher, and stays on for a further couple of years, until the headmistress gets married and takes off. Eager to broaden her horizons now that her friend is gone, Jane advertises for a position as a governess. The only response is from Thornfield Hall, where a young French girl needs tutoring.At Thornfield, Jane finds her pupil to be very vain, but agreeable nonetheless. The housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax, is an old dear and life is a bit monotonous ... until the master of the house happens to finally return. Edward Fairfax Rochester - harsh, sarcastic, brooding ... and oh such a darling deep within. And about 20 years older than Jane, but what does that matter when you're in love? Question is, can an unconnected governess really find happiness with the rich master of Thornfield?While I love the story and the characters, I'm not necessarily a huge fan of the novel itself, because it has issues. Charlotte Bront's pacing is peculiar - the first twelve chapters tend to drag on a bit and she's too fond of very long, rambling descriptions. Not to mention the over-the-top \\"coincidences\\" which might have been classed as \\"providence\\" back in the day, but today they sound far-fetched.Regardless of anything else, Jane Eyre is a powerful (and somewhat melodramatic) story of love against all odds, self-respect and female independence. It stays with you ... at least if you manage to get through the chapters where Jane isn't at Thornfield. I have to admit I find the Gateshead and Lowood parts quite tedious - I'm just waiting for her to get to Thornfield so the story can start for real. Then, I tend to shoot through the chapters and then it grinds to a halt in Morton and the pages drag on until finally, it picks up again at the very end.There is a reason some books are still read and cherished 160+ years after their first publication. It's because they're well-written, tell a compelling story and have themes which we can still associate with and understand. We can still relate to Jane's passion and a good love story always works. Charlotte Bront's most famous novel has stood the test of time so far, and I think it will live with us for many years yet.4 out of 5 dreadful charity schools for orphans, because while I love the story, I'm not keen on the very convenient \\"coincidences\\", nor at times the writing itself. Charlotte Bront was a great dialogue writer, but her descriptions ... sometimes she just doesn't know when to stop."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Got this book for my daughter.

I will admit that some parts are a bit boring. But it is still a good book, and a worthwhile to any classic literature collection.Personally, I feel that the plot could have done better without Mrs. Rochester. The story was interesting, but the part with the crazy wife felt rather contrived. I would have liked for Jane to leave Rochester Hall for another reason, since the ending felt rather cliched to me, the story of her childhood was more interesting in some ways than the later parts."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I had wanted to read Jane Eyre since I was a little girl because, for some strange reason, I was always drawn to the novel. It took eight years for me to finally get around to doing so (I'm 18 now) and my God, I could not be more pleased. Bronte's story is phenomenal! While some may say that the story is nothing original, it should be remembered that this was published in 1847, so it is everything that followed it that is unoriginal. I don't wish to give any of the plot away, but I must say one thing: The novel excellently explores numerous themes, but the one that particularly stood out to me upon reading it is the inability to ever truly love someone else and to stand side-by-side with them before learning to love oneself. Following Jane, our beloved heroine, as she journeyed down this long and winding road, was wonderful for me.

I absolutely loved this story and the writing was so beautiful and thought provoking and I immediately thought to myself &#34;THIS is what a writer should 'sound' like&#34;. I want my daughter to read it because I take away from the story that it is okay to be yourself, to be humble but proud of being who you are. To be true to yourself and be strong and though difficulties come your way, you can and will get through them. I wish I had read it when younger and had made it a part of my references as I grew and to have it to fall back on in my mind but I didn't but I am sure glad I have finally read it and now I look forward to also watching a movie about it that I found :).

However when it is forced down the throats of unwilling English students, Bronte's ultra-quixotic plot, and seemingly incessant need to detail the most superficial minutia only add to the painful legnth of the novel.By page 400, I had become so tired of Jane's apathetic nature, I was indifferent to the outcome, so long as it came swiftly."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I am not sure whether or not I enjoyed this book.

She starts out in the home of her aunt and three cousins all of whom despise her. She was left there as a young girl with her caring uncle when both of her parents died. Her uncle died shortly later and Jane was left in less than desirable conditions. After a blood-curdling incident her frustrated aunt sends her off to boarding school where, for the most part, she is treated worse than she was in her aunt's home. From there she becomes a governess and takes care of a little girl for a man whom she later falls in love with. This is where the story really gets interesting as several twists and turns take the couple towards an unexpected ending.Charlotte Bronte, the author, has a writing style typical of the romance period. Her vivid descriptions, while being wonderfully picturesque, can at times be lengthy. There are so many images of gardens and mountains and sunsets that the plot often gets lost somewhere along the way. The story can also become frustrating at times. I often longed to yell at the characters and set them in the right direction as they slowly picked their way through the tangled mess they were enveloped in.Bronte's heart was in the right place with this one. The story is one of a great love and an extraordinary woman. Jane Eyre is a one in a million kind of girl whose life story is definitely one worth telling. However, it is one that could have been told much more simply. There are parts of the novel that don't seem to have any real purpose other than to fill pages. They don't give away anything as to how she is going to end up. It merely confuses and frustrates the reader into utter boredom.

All I say is that there was an Anti-Semitic comment by Jane Eyre in the middle of the book that turned me down. I started to doubt Jane's moral and could not recover from that ignorant statement. I finished the book just to know how that story would end. I don't have any admiration for the character."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"It seems that the basic purpose of the character Jane Eyre is to suffer nobly and then eventually succeed. Both elements are highly problematic as presented. Her noble suffering acts to undermine her actual character, making someone that reacts the same to most of the challenges--stoic, determined, largely silent, resigned. This required attitude makes her too much of a blank slate, too reactive, with insufficient personal details to be memorable or seem like a complex psychological portrait. One gathers that Bronte was trying to subvert common norms in representation of woman, by making Jane a lot plainer and less accomplished than was the usual style. She may have made a major improvement in this, and as discussed below there are some interesting elements to all this, but the basic result undercuts the character's agency too much. Jane can work as a symbol, she does not work as a person, and the novel is too deeply linked to her consciousness for that to be a passable loss.As well there are major pacing issues and apparent questions on the larger arc, with much of the first hundred pages and the last hundred and fifty being off-tangent to the necessary interactions for the particular story. Still, it was hardly the worst or most difficult work to get through. For much of the first two hundred pages I found it moderately enjoyable, without thinking it was very good. I was reading it as a dark comedy, framed by a blank protagonist in a fundamentally ridiculous situation. The humor--genuine though presumably unintended--came from the contrast of the stylized language forms and general etiquette focus and how cruelly people acts. See in particular the treatment of Jane in the devil child scene, in the way that's she stiffly defends herself as opposed to how the school argues she's a literal follower of the devil, and how that's a bad thing. Amusing, in a twisted sense, at least as I took it.Where I stopped being able to do this was precisely the point that the horrid and creepy Mr. Rochester became crucial to the story. He was a fundamentally twisted, harsh and disturbing person in his own right, and the eventual arc of the book where Jane does marry him and this is apparently a good thing fatally undermines the book. The way Jane plods on is problematic in itself, but it's what he ultimately plods to that is truly wrong. Rochester's focus on pride and control, his lies, his age, his borderline-deranged manner of fixating on women, the fact we have only his own word on the true story with his first wife, all these make Jane's eventual marriage with him very far from a happy thing. Yet the book seems insistent to regard it in this light, as if Rochester's injury has in itself transformed his character enough that Jane waiting on him for the rest of his life a satisfying resolution. It's the ending scenario that makes the conclusion of the author and the whole structure of the narrative less than even good.Nevertheless, the novel is an accomplishment in a number of ways. That it exists at all, that early in the nineteenth century a woman could be published. Furthermore, it's extraordinary that she was able to include so centrally in her work a protest and anger against the systemic condition of women of her time, and that both elements have been perpetuated down into the present. Creepy as some of the above subtext is, that's a worthwhile development amidst what was a pretty terrifyingly close-minded century.There's also some interesting stuff at work with religion, class and attitudes in the nineteenth century context, Jane occupying a bit of a hybrid position in all of these, not affluent nor truly destitute, not tightly religious or a firm skeptic. The hybridity of her position is very revealing to a lot of norms that we might not see in novels of the period, as her very existence in the text portrays social structures even while it undermines them. Jane Eyre the character and book are transgressive in certain ways, then, and the way this plays out is interesting. Yet, I find this appealing and informative more in my hat as historian than as a reader. The book is quite revealing of the cultural context of the author, but that's going to be the case for almost every book ever published, and it's notably less effective in framing the context for its invented narrative, cast of characters, and atmosphere. I could forgive a lot more in this book, and even come to value much of it, if it weren't for that ending that pushes the whole thing into a disturbed romance. However the book does, and so let it rest.Jane Eyre reminds me of and is better than: Bronte's Wuthering HeightsJane Eyre reminds me of and is worse than: Shelly's Frankenstein"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is written by Charlotte Bronte, who is a famous female novelist in England during nineteen century. This is also the first famous book she wrote. The book was written in Sheffield, England which is also the hometown of Charlotte. A lot of people consider this book Charlotte's autobiography. That's not exactly true but we still can find many personal experiences of Charlotte's in that book. The entire book's theme shows the values that humans should always live with dignity and love.The book tells a story about a woman named Jane Eyre. Jane was born in a very poor churchman's family and her parents died of enterotyphus when she was very young. She had to live in her uncle's family. Her aunt was a very mean and snobbish woman. She used a lot of ways to abuse Jane and even taught her child to bully Jane. Jane lived there for ten years, but she never yielded to her aunt so her aunt just treated her worse and worse. After Jane's uncle died, her aunt sent her to an orphanage. Although the life in the orphanage was still hard, and children there could not get enough food and the teachers treat them very curly, Jane got her first friend in the orphanage, a girl named Helen. Helen gave Jane much comfort and support but this happiness for her did not last too long; Helen also died by enterotyphus. After that the orphanage improved. Jane studied there for six years and taught there for two more years. Then she left the orphanage and was hired by the steward of Thornfield Hall as a tutor. Thornfiled was a big manor owned by Edward Fairfax Rochester. The life in Thornfield was good and after a long time Mr. Rochester spent with Jane, he was deeply attracted by Jane's dignified character. Jane also fell in love with Mr. Rochester. Before their marriage, bad news come, Jane was told that Mr. Rochester was already married and his violently insane wife was locked in Thornfield Hall. Jane could not bear this shock and left Thronfiled manor. Her life truned harder after she left Thornfield. After a few months later, a clergyman named St. John took Jane in and gave her a job teaching at a local school. One day, Jane got a large amount of money as inheritance from her dead uncle, which her aunt had been keeping from her, Jane also learned from her aunt that St. John is her cousin. At this time St. John asks Jane to marry him and go to India to do missionary work. Jane refused him and realized she was still in love with Mr. Rochester so she decided to go back to him. When she came back to Thornfield Hall, it had already become a ruin. She was told that after she left, the insane woman set a fire in Thornfild Hall, and died during the fire. Mr. Rochester also was hurt during the fire. When Jane returned to him, he was not rich anymore and had become a poor disabled man. But Jane did not care about this at all; she found Mr. Rochester and married him.I strongly recommend Jane Eyre. This novel is very engaging. The plot of the novel is continuous and changes a lot. Every girl should read this book because it teaches you how to be an independent woman with dignity. There are so many characteristics of Jane's that are very valuable in today's society.When I first connected with Jane Eyre, I was a fairytale age girl. Strange thing was when my mother read the novel for me; I was fell in love with it very soon. The story was interesting and I was always curious about what's happen next. Little Jane's poor experiences and her brave impressed me deeply. Those contents really motivated me a strong sense of compassion which is really important for every child in their growth. I still remember when I knew that Jane was locked in a dark room by her aunt. I felt so worry about her and after her recovered form that disaster, I felt so happy for her. That's definitely a good lecture for me that how to share the same feeling with a friend. Little Jane also taught me that no matter how bad thing you experience, you should keep your heart pure and dignity, and always fight against unfair rules until you get the freedom. One more important thing I learned from the book is grasp every opportunity to study. Jane read a lot of book during she lived under her aunt abuse, she learned so much in the orphanage. The difference between Jane and others is she never gives up study or the process to enrich her inner world no matter how terrible the outside environment is. She successfully transfers her miserable live to her tenacious soul. All of these made her a thoughtful woman, and that also the reason for Mr. Rochester is attracted by Jane.The second time I read Jane Eyre was during my high school. At that period I was very depressed due to a heavy course load and a sharp competition. In an unexpected chance, I decided read Jane Eyre again. From I opened the book; I could not drop it any more. I finished it in three days. During I read the book, I felt so peaceful and calm. That's exactly what I needed for that period and I had lost this feeling for a long time. Beside my spiritual enjoyment, the book also gives me a strong influence on my value system. Until now, I still strongly believe that true love should build on the respect of each other. That's what Jane Eyre told me. This time I have a deeper understanding on the relationship between Jane Eyre and Edward Fairfax Rochester. At the beginning, Edward is a rich, strong and talented upper class man. But the real of him is a lonely heart, until he met Jane. A lot of women approach him in order of him money, but Jane is totally different. She did not care about him money or his social statue, she care about him just because she loves Edward and she really wants to comfort him from his painful experiences. Edward also loves Jane and appreciates her. He respects Jane and views her as his true friend in soul, he likes to talk with Jane and share his feeling with her. Their love is deep and stable. The ending of the story is not perfect but it's the best ending for Jane. She needn't choose from her love or her majesty. She obtains both of them. In the end, Edward became an old and poor blind man, but Jane still married with him. The only thing changed is they love each other deeper. This ending emphasizes Jane's characteristics as well as the substance of the book, which is the wroth of live should be respect and love.The negative part of Jane Eyre is the writer strength too much on Jane's insistence and independence. But in real world, things may much more complexes and cannot be overcome just by insistence and independence. However, I still believe Jane's characteristics will always shining in all times. Another negative echo for Jane Eyre is the book is not profundity enough. It only tells a story about a woman's life and her love experience, it did not tell enough about the time-background or the class contradiction. But I think that's just the reason that Jane Eyre do not bring too much heaviness to reader but the enjoyable feeling.All in all, I love the novel Jane Eyre. I believe everyone should read it; because it likes a cup of ice water, simple and clean, purify every reader's sprite."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I love this book. I am a hopeless romantic and I read this book because it is a classic, but I thought it would be boring. I was so wrong. The love in this book is so good! I love how Mr. Rochester is so witty -he is so smart and i don't know, his wittiness just makes him really attractive. I love it how he is a bit out there and he is always asking for her hand, he shows simple ways that he wants Jane. I love how he was trying to make her jealous, I don't know why I just like it! I love how he treats her when they are together, like she is so precious to him. The way he explains his love, I just want to swoon and have someone say these things to me. He is a bit odd though, but it suited him. There were such funny moments between them also! Even though he is not described as handsome, It doesn't matter- the affection he feels for her is just beautiful, something which is hard to find. But he has a secret and things happen....I have read many romantic books and this is my all time favorite even though this isnt really classified as romance. This book doesn't have things that a romance book has like shagging scenes. That makes it all the better because the dialoge is so good that you don't need scenes like that. I love when the characters in a book really get to know eachother before they fall in love and in many romance books you won't find that. I take out this book almost every week to reread what I feel are the good parts; I look foward to doing that in free time that is how good it is. I don't know what your tastes are in books but this book is as good as it gets for me. There are times where it does get a bit slow, but I just love to read the bits with Jane and Mr. Rochester; they just make the book. I love the scene where she is leaving and he asks her about money; it is very funny."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"It is said that you accidentally trip on a stone and find it out to be a gem. Jane Eyre for me is something like tripping on a book full of gems. Never in my life, have I ever read for which my heart has so passionately cried, laughed and felt sad. Every page of this book is craftfully written to make you want read the next. Oh, from where does the author gets a vision to make someone cry over what are essentially black inked words. When Jane leaves Rochester to go to the Moors, my heart really sanked into an oblivion. And when she came back was overjoyed as though Jane Eyre is me. Right from the first page till the last, the author has painted a picture. One that induces you to travel with Jane from her childhood to adulthood. A piece of gem, one that you can cherish for ever. As a reviewer had written earlier, it is one that would force you to give up watching that stupid idiot box, it really does. At least it did that for me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Someone below complained that only English teachers were giving this book 5-star ratings. And while I'm guilty of this, it's the other way around: I don't love this book because I'm an English teacher. I became an English teacher (in part) because I have always loved this book. I suspect there's been a school project somewhere requiring the class to write Amazon reviews of JE. If that's the case, hang in there, kids: it's a spooky, touching, dramatic story, well worth some of the less interesting bits (like the St. John subplot). Not all of you will like it, and yes, the language can be a bit difficult. (In case this shows up on the test, it's Victorian, not Old English--a difference of approximately 1000 years.) You don't have to love it or have it change your life. But it's a window into the literary tastes of the past (almost like 19th-C chick lit), which shaped and reflected pretty much all other ideology of the time. That's why it's important, and that's why a lot of people, even those who didn't have to read it (like me), continue to genuinely love it.My only problem is with the ending. It still bugs me that Jane can be so powerful and end up doing such a cop-out. I hate to think that Bronte was pandering to popular taste, but that's the only explanation I can think of."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"I adored this book. I cried over and over again. Jane Eyre is beautifully wtitten. I give a standing ovation to Ms. Bronte."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics)","review":"Odd, how re-reading a classic can become a meaningful experience. I'm sure I read Jane Eyre at least two times when I was in high school and again at college. Then there were the films, the most memorable being the one with William Hurt playing Rochester. Yet, last weekend when I was visiting friends and had nothing at hand, I looked at the first chapter and thought &quot;I've don't remember any of this,&quot; and was hooked.No wonder this book endures and no wonder that readers are entranced: it is an extraordinary story of an individual's struggle to live in a harsh world, find and create physical comfort and sustain an unacceptable love. Even though the story is intensely atmospheric (food, structures, furniture, temperature, clothes and flora are in constant reference), it is Jane herself who drives the story. Where she will find herself and what she will do next is the surprise. No wonder feminists were interested in this book: Jane never succumbs to anyone's idea of what she should do, she wrestles with decisions and bases her choices (that she insists on having choises is already delightful) on her own moral, social code. Hard choices she makes too and we wonder if she'll manage when, for example, she leaves Thornfield and finds herself forced to beg for food.The writing is sharp and intelligent and...funny too: take, for example, the little girls toppling off their stools during prayers, or the description of Adele's &quot;French&quot; personality. The plot is a stretch but a loveable one. Jane, we are told often, has neither beauty nor stature, the type of person that gets ignored in any social situation. However, this seemingly ineffectual person has two highbrow offers of marriage,inherits a fortune and reaps the bounty of a geniune, loving relationship with the one man who is her intellectual and emotional equal. Not bad for a poor, plain governess in the 1830s.Today, it might be that religion, scripture and even the idea of morality are concepts that carry too much weight for popular fiction. Jane, a level-headed girl, is neither silly nor preachy. That her thoughts are informed with the religious moral tone of the period makes this story more than a romance or tale of finding true love. It demonstrates how conviction is founded."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},J={class:"card-container"},F=["disabled"],E={key:0},P={key:1};function R(n,a,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",J,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",P,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",E,"See more"))],8,F)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(H,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-1167e69a"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/59.md","filePath":"quotes/59.md"}'),B={name:"quotes/59.md"},j=Object.assign(B,{setup(n){return(a,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(W)]))}});export{q as __pageData,j as default};
