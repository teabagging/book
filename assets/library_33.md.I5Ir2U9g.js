I give \\"Jane Eyre\\" one monkey, ten minutes.While recognizing Bronte's derring-do in writing a novel about a homely 17-year-old governess who rejects a virtuous adonis (St. John Rivers) for her much older and unattractive employer, this is a book I cannot see reading again unless it's the only way to save a terminally ill relative.This book is a slow read. And I mean slow. A snail? Greased lightning. Molasses on a cold day? Quicksilver. Eighth-period study hall in high school on a Friday? Over in a flash. We're talking a slow, boring read here, even without the benefit of a high school English teacher's enthusiasm for ruining literature.The novel chronicles the story of Jane Eyre from her childhood as an orphan up until the birth of her first child. Life was hard for orphans in 19th-century England, particularly when their parents' marriage was considered improper. Fair enough, I suppose: that's why Jane's childhood is so rotten, and she is picked on by the cousins she lives with, misliked and mistreated by her aunt and so on. Unfortunately, Bronte's writing is so dry and lifeless that it's hard to care.It just gets worse from there. The book is written in the first person, with the result that we get to hear every self-pitying thought Jane has (and there are plenty of them), about how plain she is, how her employer Mr. Rochester could never love her, how beautiful her imagined rival in love is, and on and on and on for page after tedious page.My standard joke is \\"This is both good and original. Unfortunately, the parts that are good are not original, and the parts that are original are not good.\\" I will give Charlotte Bronte the benefit of the doubt, and will say that \\"Jane Eyre\\" is thoroughly original. Unlike the works of Shakespeare and a number of other classics of English and world literature, I can't say it is particularly good.Jocko Grinn"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I have previously reviewed Jasper Fforde's The Eyre Affair and stated that although I had never read Jane Eyre, I enjoyed Fforde's take on it. I had also prided myself on never having read recreationally anything that could be considered literature that wasn't required for school. I started Jane Eyre with the attitude that I'll read it until I get bored, then stop. I didn't get bored. Charlotte Bronte created a masterpiece that kept me enthralled from start to finish. There was crime, passion, mystery and women's rights rolled into one effort. For the era in which it was written, Jane Eyre was an amazing book showing a woman of intelligence and strong character. Now I have to reread The Eyre Affair to really appreciate it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"The first time I had ever heard about Jane Eyre I was a senior in high school, and no it was not required reading. I feel as though more and more the school systems are moving away from great literary classics. I for one did not read very many, and as an English major in college, I find I have to do a lot of catching up on my classics . . . but that's a totally different topic.I saw very early on in Jane Eyre a sort of Cinderella story unfolding, and it turned out to be very close to the story, however it was by no means exactly like the Disney version everyone knows. I loved her struggle, independence and stop-at-nothing-to-be-happy-and-fulfilled drive to change her life. At first I was angry with her for leaving Rochester, but then I felt respect for her because she was just standing up for her morals and values. Plus, it all turns out happy in the end!The one part of the novel I was unhappy with was when she runs off into the country side and coincidentally discovers her long lost cousins, the Rivers. This part of the book is very dry and dull in my opinion. It also gets creepy when her male cousin St. John tries to marry her. Yuck! But, going through that section makes the ending that much more enjoyable and happy. Some men may not like the end, but it is very beautiful and romantic. Cinderella gets her prince. This is a great feminist novel as well."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I had never seen any of the movies before I read the book, but I wanted to see what all the fuss was about since the newestJane Eyre [Blu-ray] came out.Jane Eyrehas now become one of my favorite novels. It's great literature, written very beautifully and in which every sentence, every chapter is important to the events in the book. When Jane Eyre begins telling the reader her story, you're immediately drawn in. The book wasn't that difficult for me to read--I occasionally had to look up some words on my Kindle's built in dictionary and I know absolutely no French (some characters speak sentences/words in French, but it's very minor), however this didn't take away from the beauty of the book at all.The whole romance between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester is amazing. It's definitely not trashy...it's classy and sophisticated...it's romantic.Charlotte Bronte evens manages to weave in a deep mystery at Thornfield Hall, done VERY successfully. I love mysteries and I had my own hypothesis of \\"who-done-it\\" and why, and was WRONG. I love that.I don't want to give anything away, if you're a new reader like I was. The movies do not even compare to the book (I went to compare as soon as I finished the book); the book is so much better, it's a delicious classic to read. I was very sad to finally put the book down when I was finished. Jane Eyre is a must read, and definitely a re-read. One of my top favorite books now.For Kindle readers: There are little to no errors in the Kindle Edition ofJane Eyre. Reading on the kindle definitely took out the anxiety factor of reading a thick book. No TOC. The only thing that slightly bothered me was instead of having the whole name of a city/town/county that ended in \\"shire\\" it was presented as \\"---shire\\". But not a huge dealbreaker considering it's free. I'm not sure if this is how it was supposed to be presented or not."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I have to say I am truly surprised. This is the third time I've read Jane Eyre, and yet the first time I've found anything positive about the experience. I read it once as an 11/12 year old because my mother bought me a lovely red leather-bound edition (apparently she loved the book and thought I would too). I hated it- too hard to read, too much philosophical rambling, no action, annoying heroine, etc. I read it for the second time as a freshman in high school because it was required. I no longer found it hard to read, but I still found Jane annoying and unsympathetic, and I still hated the book.Fast forward to this year and my decision to revisit the classics, including giving Jane Eyre one last try before forever consigning it to the \\"I just don't understand how people can like this book\\" pile. All I can say is thank goodness I gave it that one last try because the book is a masterpiece. All the philosophical rambling that bored me before is now a central element to the text, superior in many way to the storyline itself. I see now that there is a lot of action for a book of its time, and Jane is certainly not annoying so much as she is inspirational. I mean, she is still a bit pious for my taste, but even so she rebels strongly against the conventions of her time to try to live a life that she finds both emotionally and spiritually satisfying.All of the things that annoyed me when I read this book as a child are the elements that resonate most strongly with me as an adult. I read this book too early, and was too dismissive of it at the time. Like with Anna Karenina, I saw everything in black and white with the merciless clarity of a teenager; I now understand how wonderfully shaded with grey life (and good literature) often is. If you haven't read Jane Eyre since high school, I highly recommend giving it another try- definitely a 5 star!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I remember that I read Jane Eyre back in high school... This time, it was completely different!! I can only guess that, as a teen, I was impatient for action, and skipped over large parts, not taking the time to truly read the book.This is a very absorbing tale! Yes, it is clear that it was written from a very non-modern outlook, and that it is not completely timeless. However, it is also clear just how different this character is from the norms of her time. The characters and their personalities are clearly drawn, and it is easy to see that they broke the mold then, and that they still break the mold now.I ended up re-reading the book immediately after finishing it. It remained fresh and fascinating. What a great book! No wonder Jasper Fforde chose this for Thursday Next's first adventures..."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I have just finished reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte for the fifth time in my life. I find that every time I read this book I learn something new or interpret a scene differently. I have read this book during all different phases of my life and I find that through every reading I am completely affected with the story even though I know exactly what is going to happen.The premise of the book everyone knows, our story is about the life of Jane Eyre through her childhood living at the home of her aunt who doesn't love or want to keep her to her adult years as governesses for the ward of Mr. Rochester of Thornfield Hall. Jane develops a relationship with her employer that soon blossoms into a fierce love but Mr. Rochester has a secret that he is keeping from Jane that threatens to rip everything apart leaving Jane utterly homeless and alone.This book has been talked about time and time again and I think one of the main reasons it stands the testament of time is that Charlotte Bronte creates a heroine who is so easy to sympathize with and Jane's connections with her audience is felt throughout the entire book and begins on the first page. This to me is the best thing about the book because we know exactly how Jane thinks, and feels and we come to love and adore her for her plainness, intelligence, and spirit. Of course it also helps that our hero Mr. Rochester is so attractive with his brooding, temperamental personality but he is one of my favorite male characters in all of literature because he is so developed I can picture him perfectly in my mind. Every young woman dreams of meeting their Mr. Rochester because he loves Jane with a passion that is hard to believe could exist. So I highly recommend reading this novel because I think it deserves all of the attention it gets. Charlotte Bronte is a master storyteller and uses such elements of horror to create a timeless gothic romance novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Though it took me a while to find the time to read this lengthy tome, I am so glad I did, because I absolutely adore this novel. I loved the story, the characters, the blend of romance, mystery, and gothic elements--in short, I loved everything about it!The story is a fictional memoir, which narrates the life of Jane Eyre from the age of 10 to about age 19. We follow Jane from her miserable childhood living with an aunt and three cousins to her sojourn in a charitable boarding school for girls, and then to her station as a governess (at age 18) in the country estate of Mr. Rochester. I will not spoil any of the plot twists (if you don't already know them), for there are several and they make the story truly compelling. Jane herself is an immensely likeable protagonist, right from the start. Even at the tender age of 10, she is full of spirited passion, which makes her real and believable. She grows up before her reader's very eyes, and for me, it was a pleasure to watch her development as a person and character.It has been a long while since a \\"classic\\" work has so absorbed my attentions and thoughts. Once I found the time to read it, I raced to reach the book's conclusion, and then I was sad when I finished the final page--which to me is always the mark of a truly great book! I wholeheartedly recommend \\"Jane Eyre\\" to any lover of literature, and to any and all romantic souls...it (and Jane) will not disappoint!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Hands down one of the best pieces of literature I've ever read, I mean this book is somewhere in my Top 3 and I've read a lot of books. At first glance, some people might think this is a cheesy love story, but it's not. It is very much a love story but actually a REALLY GOOD one!! I love the main character Jane Eyre and how she's able to be humble and respectful, at the same time growing in the story and speaking her mind when she needs to, standing up for herself. The story flows soooo well and takes you on a journey that is brave, devastating and beautiful all at the same time.Charlotte Bronte, correct me if I'm wrong, hasn't written too many novels, but she didn't even need to. This book stands on its own and I can call her one of my favorite writers of all time, solely based off this one book. Just incredible stuff all around, incredible writing, story, description, imagery - this book has everything you want from a piece of literature. Please get it and you'll be thrilled you did! I can guarantee this book will become one of your favorites of all time :)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"One of the great gothic romance classics of all time. This novel was written and published in the 1840's, well before women were conceived to be \\"gifted\\" enough to command an audience. In fact, all the Bronte sisters published under male pseundoyms (Currier Bell, Acton Bell, etc.) in order to be considered serious writers.This novel is a story about enduring character and its ability to strive for the unattainable and inconceivable. A poor orphan raised by an aunt and uncle, Jane is schooled in a loveless environment of neglect. She graduates from this dreary environment and is hired by Rochester to tutor his ward, Adele.The employer-employee relationship between Rochester and Jane grows into a solid friendship. From there, it graduates to love. Unfortunately, there is a shadow over this relationship that precludes a happy ending and Rochester's past comes to haunt him. Fortunately, Jane's strength and enduring character help Rochester surmount his painful past. Her love nurtures Rochester in his darkest hours.This book has continued to be one of my favorites over the years. The Kindle version is free, so if anyone is looking for an excellent book to add to their Kindle collection, I heartily recommend this."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Jane Eyre was orphaned at an age where she didn't remember her parents and was raised by a real she-wolf of a mean aunt. She is sent away to a very strict school which sad to say, was an improvement on her aunt's residence.

The book comes with a built in bookmark and the cover is a perfect fit for this beautiful story!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I always heard of this book but never read it. When I saw the 2011 Jane Eyre with Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender, I had to read the book because I was hooked.Charlotte Bronte has such talent for words. She brings you to Jane's life, her experiences, her thoughts, her feelings with such clarity that you feel like you are actually there. The narrative proceeds with great pace, just right, not too slow nor too fast. She'll take you to those great houses....those \\" Halls \\" ... Manor ....those big beautiful homes we see only in travel books.... But she has put life in them. So we see what it is like to actually live there. And what a \\" life\\" she has put in those houses!Charlotte narrated a life that is so full of passion! Among others.....grief from death, isolation,, fear, courage, sympathy, faith in the goodness of others, and Love! Mr. Rochester is a very attractive character...full of life.The dynamic between a young 18 year old girl and a 38 year old man is realistic enough. The young inexperienced girl had to earn \\"life out there in the real world\\" before she can actually be on the same level , (somehow) as Mr. Rochester. This is not the typical beautiful underdog being saved by a handsome powerful man. It is more about 2 people completing each other."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I have read this book a number of times and am always intrigued by the plot. This is also a vocabulary-building book if you enjoy learning new words."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Even I find it a little hard to believe that I only just now read this classic, and specifically because it was for book club. Even more surprising is that after all this time, I was unaware of how the book ended, so the entire conclusion was unspoiled for me. I am not a huge fan of literature from this period, although I could appreciate the gothic atmosphere and the very puritanical British-ness. Jane is a profound character and it's no wonder she is a favorite literary figure. Her determination is inspiring and I very much enjoyed witnessing her evolution. I don't think I can say much more about this most fundamental novel, other than it was so much better than I expected."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"After reading Jane Eyre 5 times, I learn more and more things.

While all the people associated with Christianity are shown in a negative light, Jane's search for freedom and willingness to forego comfort for truth inspired me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"This is an age-old book that remains a favourite.

Yet Jane Eyre transcends the thrilling parts of the book to become one of English's greatest novels.The novel is not without weakness; the entire St. John section is a bit overdramatic and somewhat contrived; yet it is essential to the novel not only for the symmetry but also to contrast a life that would only satisfy the flesh and sacrifice the soul (Mr. Rochester's proposal) versus a life sacrificing the flesh entirely for the sake of the soul (St. John.) Jane Eyre never falters from her conviction that, to be whole and true to oneself, both the spiritual and the carnal sides must be fulfilled. This was a daring proposal in Victorian England, and Jane Eyre was labeled \\"coarse\\" by one critic. Even more daring was that this philosophy was espoused by a woman writer, which is why Charlotte Bronte wrote the book under a gender-neutral pseudonym (Currer Bell.)Why should you read this classic? Initially, Jane Eyre can be enjoyed for its well-told and enjoyable story--very romantic and exciting. What makes Jane Eyre an enduring classic is that you can read it and re-read it many times over for the perfection of its structure. I have a hard time choosing between Jane Eyre and Eliot's Middlemarch as \\"best English novel.\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Jane Eyre is as perfect as a book can be. It's the wonderful, multi-layered story of a poor orphan who falls in love with a man of the British upper class.Jane Eyre is a fully-fleshed out character who is, in many ways, more modern than her nineteenth century counterparts. She is definitely a character to &quot;fall in love with&quot; and one that is truly unforgettable.Although some of the events in Jane Eyre are more than a little far-fetched, the plot is so enjoyable we can easily forgive Bronte a few minor faults. The pages simply fly by as we want to learn more about Jane and Mr. Rochester and their ultimate fate, both together and apart.Jane Eyre is a classic in every sense of the word and extraordinarily enjoyable as well."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"but definitely for the more educated. If you don't appreciate literature, I would say...don't read it, you won't like it. I love it...it is my favourite book of all time, hands down, but from what I have read and heard from others, it seems that the a person merely looking for a feministic book, or something easy to read that dosn't take much intellect, would not like it at all. As far as the content.... Charlotte Bronte had such a grasp of the wonderful pathos that love can fill a person with, it's incredible. The characters are well-portrayed, and you really get to know Jane and Mr. Rochester, which is more I can say than many works of it's day. I would say that Jane Eyre is one of the ultimate triuphs of literature."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"The search for freedom is a common underlying theme that can be found in many novels. Charlotte Bronte really emphasized this theme in Jane Eyre. This novel illustrates the path a strong young woman takes in her search for contentment. As she travels from place to place it becomes obvious that she is seeking a true home. The repetition of bird motifs throughout the novel is a device that accentuates the theme of freedom. In paying close attention to these motifs one can see that Jane is actually equated with a bird. Like a bird Jane Eyre is constantly in flight in search of her dreams. Her \\"spirit followed on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to and ideal Heaven\\" (333). The comparison of Jane to a bird, when understood, is very important to the overall meaning of the novel. At the time Charlotte Bronte wrote the novel her ideas were pretty radical, considering that it was unheard of for a woman to be independent and free willed, which are the key aspects of Jane Eyre's character. The romanticism and feminism of this novel is inspirational. I strongly recommend Jane Eyre to any woman who is not afraid to follow her own dreams."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"As an orphan, Jane has no money and no one to care for her. After enduring hardships with an aunt who doesn't love her and struggling at a strict boarding school, Jane has come to a place where she may be able to find happiness and love. This novel starts out slow, but the action picks up, developing the romance and the mystery in the novel. Charlotte Bronte uses imagery and numerous allusions in the novel. The most notable allusion is the bird allusions. This bird motif suggests freedom or independence, specifically, the independence of Jane. This theme, on a broader scheme, suggests women's independence, a subject that is not uncommon, but unorthodox at this time period. Another common allusion is a biblical allusion. These set a religious tone in the novel. Not only does Bronte allude to the Bible, she also uses religion to play a role in the development of Jane, most notably the religious boarding school and St. John Rivers. These things seem to have a negative effect on Jane, which cause her to sometimes stray a bit from religion. Even though she is negatively effected by those two elements, Jane still has religious morals that are found in the novel. Jane is honest and is not afraid to speak her mind to anyone. One can find many elements that make this book enjoyable and well worth reading. Even though starting out slow, the action intensifies with plot twists and suspense that make one rush to finish this novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Don't let the title of this review deceive you. I really enjoyed this book, very much. It does, however, follow a strikingly familiar formula, as do many of the &quot;strong heroine&quot; novels of the nineteenth century.Jane Eyre is a girl orphaned at a young age. She endures a very Dickensian treatment at the all-girls orphanage she is relegated to by her less than sympathetic relations, after being branded a trouble-maker, and having a bad character, and a deceitful dispostion.She survives the orphanage, only to be enlisted in the employ of a Mr. Rochester, as tutor and nanny to his charge, Adela. She is at once intrigued, if not a bit repelled by his brusque nature, and yet finds herself falling in love with him.Jane is caught up in the mystery of the 'tenant' on the third floor, a dangerous, diabolical person who places Jane's life, as well as Rochester's, in jeopardy, as Jane goes about her duties, all the while growing more and more amorous of Rochester.Eventually the identity of the 'tenant' is revealed, and Jane must chose between love and sense of duty. Being the forthright person that she is, she of course chooses duty, much to the heartbreak of both herself and Rochester, who has grown as enamored of this plain, headstrong creature as she has of him.Jane Eyre plays out in a very formulaic manner, much like many novels of the same ilk, but it is a wonderful read. The characters are engaging and entertaining. The story holds a few twists and turns, and delivers a very well-realized conclusion.For anyone who had this book thrust upon them in their teens, give it another try. For those who did not, it is well worth a first look."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Reviewers may say that as an author, Charlotte Bronte does not quite equal the best classical writers, or that her plot is too contrived, or that her dialogue is too stilted. None of these things matters, because in Jane Eyre, Bronte created a character whom I believe has no equal in fiction.Jane Eyre is a survivor in an age much more merciless than today. Condemned and degraded as a little girl by adults she trusted, she never loses her grip on her self-respect. Although she is reviled by her guardians and boarding school authorities, she retains not only her belief in herself but her innate goodness. Instead of returning harsh treatment with bitterness, she develops a character containing equal parts of toughness and kind benevolence.Her integrity is perceived by an employer whose deepest need is to recapture his own integrity, which he believes lost. Jane's guarded response to him forms much of the book's plot. Jane emerges quietly triumphant in a world in which she encountered hostility and love and ignorance and enlightenment, and met it all head on."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"...and that's saying a lot coming from me. I read about 2 books a week but none has captured me the way &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; has. Many of the reviewers here have said that the vocabulary is difficult but this is what makes Charlotte Bronte such a fabulous writer. She was a poet before a novelist and all of her dialogue is written in prose. I've seen the Orson Welles version of this movie but a movie couldn't possibly do justice to this book. Ms Bronte not only relates us to Jane Eyre but with the prosaic descriptions she allows the reader to feel what Jane Eyre feels. Also, the book is timeless...unrequited love, jealousy, rage, passion..will never go out of style which is why even readers 100 years from now will still be unable to put this book down. I've recommended this book to my daughter as my mother has recommended this book to me and as her mother recommended to her.

Ms. Bronte's writing, while properly structured, lacks any ability to move or inspire a reader. Her character-- for there is only one character, the rest are mere background-- is a selfish brat who eternally whines about the unfairness of the world, except of course when that unfairness works in her favor, when she either glories in other's pain or trying to inflict more upon them. ... Bronte strains one's gullibility often throughout the novel, especially in its conclusion where she apparrently runs out of ideas and starts inserting magic and telepathy into an otherwise reality-based novel for the purpose of bringing the characters back together. She clumsily tries to blugeon the reader into the appropriate emotional state by cutting out any scene which is not miserable (including a goodly eight years in which Jane has friends, a good lifestyle, and a promising career-- the author claims they contain \\"no significant interest\\"), and her lack of subtlety has on numerous occasions given me an actual headache.As to the love story- where is it? The plot of the book consists of two things only: a small child growing up to get revenge on all those who she disliked as a child (everyone), and an adolescent sexual fantasy involving breaking a proud spirit and mutilating it at one's pleasure. (\\"Reader, I married him.\\"--of course HE had nothing to do with it.) Oh, yes, and i forgot: hatred of everything and blindness to all that is good. That's three things, i guess. These bleary tales are obviously the product of a small and vicious person, and I sincerely hope that if another Charlotte Bronte comes into being, she becomes a recluce and leaves us normal, relatively happy people alone. (The original did one, it seems, but not the other.)This book, if it has any value at all, is to show the world the darkness of man's nature. If one wishes such a book, read Macbeth or Lord of the Flies, for at least their authors knew how to tell a story.Do not buy this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Irony, in small doses, isn't too bad. In fact, it is sometimes enjoyable. But this book takes irony to the next level. If Dickens' Tale of Two Cities was ironic, then it's met it's match. Mrs. DeFarge also being Little Girl with Bad Past is nothing compared to this. Honestly, what are the chances of stuff like this REALLY happening? The guy you want to marry just happens to have a crazy lady harbored upstairs, who happens to be his wife? The people who save you from starvation and death just so happen to be the nearest and dearest relations you have? Give me a break. Every new twist and turn of the 'unexpected' plot made me sick. Now, if it just so happened that Mr. Rochester was Jane's father, and his wife was her sister...Now that might have sparked a little more interest."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Alright, this book was god awful. The begining dragged on about how poor and oppressed Jane was it was so cliched that i could've guessed what was going to happen next. Most all of the characters were two demensional and the plot was basic. This was more of a character development novel then a plot based novel.

That perspective is that this book is one of the most boring, bland, lifetime-ish wastes of paper known to (wo)man. To give an example of what I mean, it takes 3 CHAPTERS to lead up to the failed wedding! The author goes into great detail describing every little minute insignificant meaningless thing that happens (such as a chapter for her to say she didn't want Rochester's gifts)-and it takes her 20 frickin pages to say that she's leaving a guy. Somehow, this got to be considered a literary classic about feminine empowerment.

(I didn't read much at all for that matter.) And now as an adult I have the fortune of visiting some of the great works of literature for the first time. Jane Eyre was a challenge for me initially because I believed I wouldn't identify with the character much. The more I allowed myself to become immersed in the story, the more I was impressed by Jane's courage of character, even as a young girl.Jane Eyre has an intellectual confidence, noticeable from a young age, which she draws from in order to challenge those seeking to place unnatural limits on her. Her aunt Reed emotionally abused her as a child, and still Jane had enough perspective to fight for her own justice. When she was sent away to a boarding school (with only slightly better conditions than before), Jane suffered further emotional trauma but also learned to thrive in spite of everything. Her negative experiences informed her towards a life of seeking goodness.When Jane finally crosses paths with Mr. Edward Rochester, she faces choices of both heart and mind that few women of that time would be prepared for."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"When we first see Jane as a child in the opening pages, we see her as one who is orphaned and left to the not so tender mercies of an aunt who for want of a better term is just plain mean. Jane is made to feel like an outcast by the very ones, who because of their consanguinity should have blessed her with love and affection. As she matures, she is at first pictured as one who must balance precariously between being an obnoxious little brat and one who deserves our sympathy for her state. In the school to which she is sent, first as a student then a teacher, Jane is seen in terms of such purely perceived sensibility that we do not doubt for a moment her own reality, even if we doubt the validity of her external reality. It is this successful ability to create a sharply defined subjective heroine that paves the way for us to equally accept the existence and credibility of the wild, moody, and totally Byronic Rochester. We do not see him as what he truly is: a flat character whose only purpose in the novel is to dash about on a horse and hide crazy women in his dank castle. We see him as Jane does; that is as Charlotte Bronte does, as a real life man from her own days of fantasizing about a teacher who was, to Charlotte at least, the very personification of manliness and virility.Charlotte Bronte also included a number of sociological subtexts that probably ring just as much true today as they did in her day. She presents in chilling detail the child abuse that was rampant simply because not enough people took the trouble to take notice and petition the government for redress. She addresses the male patriarchal attitude that did not allow a young woman to make her way alone in the world except in the accepted role of governess. She also exposes the unwanted issue of what to do about the rights of the mentally ill. As we read JANY EYRE today, we notice the melodrama and the sociological subtexts, but we do not pay them much attention, which is probably just as well. Instead, what we take away from JANE EYRE is the ability of Charlotte Bronte to make us feel the pain of a cruel world, even if we, or Jane herself, can do little about it except to remain as human as we can."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"4.5 stars on this one! This is almost a 5 star book for me - the only reason it's not, is because it's so long.I know it's a classic and all that, but it's just SO descriptive...I ::heart:: the Jane Eyre character and Mr. Rochester as well. It blows my mind that the horrible school/orphanageJane gets sent to is based on the boarding school Charlotte Bronte went to as a child. Oh, and that evil aunt wasjust awful, unbelievably horrible to her, so sad.I just loved the love story in this... such an awesome classic and I ::had:: to read it after reading \\"The Eyre Affair\\"(Thursday Next series) from Jasper Ffordes - it was so fun to understand that book better after knowing this story.And, yay to kindle for giving us classics for free, gotta love that! :)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"One of the greatest novels I have ever read. I was just expecting a sort of Gothic romance, but this is so much more. There may be some spoilers in what follows, but I will try to stick to general, thematic terms rather than disclosing specific plot points.Jane Eyre is, above all, a novel about the unity, versus the duality, of mind and body, reason and emotion---or, as Bront puts it, \\"judgment and feeling\\"---particularly as this applies to the Christian religion. Christianity is, of course, committed to dualism, but Bront, though paying lip-service to religion, rejects this, depicting its evil in many of its manifestations. Some of the devout Christian characters she paints as blatant hypocrites, but even those whom Jane respects or even admires, when it comes right down to it, she does not emulate. Jane seeks happiness in this life, here on earth, while even the \\"good\\" Christians are doomed to seek it only in the next, and that by sacrificing it in this one.The basic story idea brilliantly demonstrates Bront's theme: Jane is given the choice of a loveless marriage, or unmarried love. The latter situation may seem a bit contrived to the modern reader, and indeed it seems as though Bront herself feels this on some level, as the passionate appeal of Jane's lover is much more convincing than her reason for refusing him---namely, that the laws forbidding both divorce and adultery must be in place for *some* reason. (That may be generally true, but they clearly don't apply in this case, or make an exception for it.) Even when she is finally able to follow both her heart and her mind, it is only after these Christian principles have resulted in the horrible crippling of her beloved, which damns those principles all the more.In short, Jane Eyre is a book about a woman's struggle to stay true to her whole self---heart and mind---against Christianity's attacks on both fronts. I don't think it was Bront's conscious intention to write a novel condemning Christianity for sundering our hearts from our minds, but only what she viewed as corrupt interpretations of it---yet that is what she did, and it is brilliant. Both her heart and her mind were clearly much more dedicated to this life than the next, as Jane Eyre powerfully demonstrates. This is a novel way ahead of its time, in many, many ways."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"The story Jane Eyre is a classic romance novel. This story was written in in 1847 by Charlotte Bronte. As you can image the story is very influenced by the social norms of that time. But in essence that is what make the story so believable. Jane Eyre is about a young girl who was orphaned and made to stay with her cruel rich aunt. In Jane's younger years she gets verbally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins. One day Jane fights back and is eventually sent to a boarding school for girls. The life style at the school is harsh and dangerous. The girls living their have very little clothing, food, shelter, and people willing to take care of them. Because of these bad circumstances illness strikes. After that occasion the climate in the school changes to one where the girls are provided for. Jane is able to get a wonderful education, and when she graduates she decides to become a governess. She puts an add out in the paper and is contacted by Mrs. Fairfax to become the governess to Adele Varnes. Jane goes to live at Thornfield Manner. She spends many happy months there. Until Mr. Rochester comes to visit. He is Jane's employer and the guardian of Adele. Mr. Rochester confuses Jane in ways that no one every has. Love sparks between the two of them. But this love is tested by secrets from Mr. Rochesters past!I found all of the characters in this story to be believable and realistic. They seemed like people you would meet on the street. Well, minus the fact that they have the mannerism of someone from the 1800s. In particular I love Jane Eyre. She is a strong woman. That any female could relate to. It surprised me when I first read the book that she was so strong, since this book was both written in the 1800s and took place there. Also, the emotions that Jane has are very realistic. While she was at the girls boarding school she lost a friend and it felt really real when it happened. I will admit to shedding a few tears when it happened. I think that the bases for a good book is if the story can touch the reader and for me this book did.I did really like the story. The plot and characters where both interesting and well thought out. At times the book was very slow and my interest was lost. It could get a little boring if you don't have a lot of patience and determination. My favorite part of the book was the ending. The ending was happy and a good solution to both Jane and Mr. Rochester's problems. It left me satisfied and I didn't have anymore questions. My least part of the book was the middle. There wasn't enough change in the story and Jane was too caught up in her own head. There needed to be more action there or even a new character. The middle just didn't do it for me.I would recommend this story to someone else. Probably an adult or a teenager. Like I said before you need a lot of patience and determination to get through the book. So, for anyone under the age of 15 it would be a very difficult read. To really enjoy this book you have to love history and a good romance. To really get this book you have to understand the motivations of people in the mid 1800s. It really wouldn't make to much sense to someone who doesn't have a grasp on history. I would give this book 4.5. The plot and characters in this story are amazing. However the plot sometimes is somewhat slow. Overall I believe that Charlotte Bronte did a wonderful job writing this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Similar in some respects to other Victorian era novels, this one is more exciting than most. Things happen. There is mystery and intreague. Even so, it's difficult at times not to get fed up with the flowery, laborious, self-aware banter that men and women of the day seemed required to engage in. Some of the prose is very clever, and that's always fun to hear. But there are times when you want to just shout: GET TO THE POINT, ALREADY! Nonetheless, there's a few great moments, and it's a fun book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"When our AP English teacher first informed us we were to read Jane Eyre as an over-the-summer assignment, my first thoughts were not very positive. Fortunately, as I started to read I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I connected to the story. Jane begins in this bildunsroman as a insecure and naive young girl. She develops into a strong and independant woman, both physically and psychologically. I enjoyed that her relationship with her love, Mr. Rochester, is realistic and not based on the skewed prince charming image that many women project men to be, even during this time period. Jane Eyre is not a book that grips you from start to finish, but it's a very interesting read and a timeless classic that I am sure to read again."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I cannot say what has not been said by earlier reviewers here. My only contribution is that this character is perhaps one of the early examples of a feminist, a working woman (think Eleanor Roosevelt) despite Jane's eventual wealth. Her choices, her voice, her thoughts were well ahead of her time and context. I was really impressed with this story. The writing, shockingly, has held up through the many that have passed since this book was first published."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I enjoyed this book.

All-in-all, if you're a fan of any of the books in this series, I would highly recommend them for you or a loved one as they do make great gifts."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"The notes and supplemental materials in this edition are truly helpful.

I am always short on time, with novels assigned for other classes, so this was the perfect way to capitalize on my 30 minute commute to school. The Penguin Classic differs slightly from the Norton Edition (which was assigned), so I found myself looking in the text for further detail, but it is the same story. The Norton simply gives footnotes to explain certain things, such as translating some of the French phrases. Great if you have a commute and need to read this, or just want to. Jane Eyre is a classic, beautifully written and narrated well in this audiobook."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Jane Eyre is a Classic of epic proportions, it is a story which is timeless.

My only qualm...the pages are bright white, and I wish they had gone with a more \\"vintage-y\\" look on the inside to match the outside. But I guess they will get that with age ;)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I found this book shoved under my bed last week...it's been there since I was in high school (apparently it never got returned to the school...)I remember starting to read it 6 years ago and only got about five pages in before I lost interest and tossed it aside. However, I started it again a few days ago and completely fell in love. I love the prose, the plot, everything. I just can't keep myself away from it. Bronte's writing style is so poetic and beautiful that the story itself could be absolute trash and I would still love this book.Thankfully, though, the novel is not a load of tosh and the story itself is engaging beyond belief. Jane is left with her uncle's wife when he forces her to care for her when he dies. She's cared for about like Harry is at the Dursleys and escapes to school. Unfortunately for Jane, Hogwarts does not await her, but a rather dreary school. She remains here for 8 years, first as a pupil, then a teacher. She later gains employment for a gentleman who pays her twice her wages at Lowood and there she meets the love of her life. Unfortunate events prevent them from marrying and she continues to seek a happy place and make her way. I won't give away more.If you like Austen you will love this book. It's got the characterization and insight of Austen's books with the adventure of a more modern novel. The average young male probably won't appreciate this particular book, but I advise women at least 16 and older to read it. It is absolutely fascinating and much better than the current pop-literature pumped out today."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Jane Eyre was long, wordy and old. It was a recipe for instant dislike. While I didn't love the book, I certainly enjoyed it. The character of Jane Eyre was upstanding and brave. She showcased many qualities women strive for and find hard to reach even today. Mr. Rochester was both off-putting and strangely likable at times. The mixture of drama, romance and a bit of mystery was engaging. While I often put the book down, I never once thought of not finishing it. A deserved classic."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"It's incredible to think or imagine that, of the two most intense, passionate heroines of 19th century literature, both would be written by sisters of the same family. But this is, indeed, the case. With Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, you are drawn into a personal narrative that from the start is compelling and becomes more disturbing and troubling. Many things have been written about Jane Eyre as a character, but to me there is no doubt that her intense character compels you to understand very specific and certain imperatives (nowadays described as feminist - then, Bronte was alone in imaginging it).The 19th century was a deeply moralistic society, at least on the surface, but one within and beneath which women as such had no identity or power beyond certain circumscribed roles (governess, wife, spinster, etc.). With Jane, you have a particular set of codes of behaviour that are radically established and are uncompromising about the male-dominated status quo: to cope with all circumstances without significant protest; not to give in to compromise that will drag your own personality down to nothingness; to speak up in situations involving the most appalling difficulties, when it matters; don't give in to compromise that will drag your own personality down to nothingness; ultimately, remain true to yourself. Such coda are radical not only in 19th century literature, but all literature before.Jane Eyre is a revolution in thinking and morality as far as male and female relationships are concerned. The only other novel that is as passionate, and as determined in thinking of the singular female self as Jane Eyre, is Emily Bronte's novel, Wuthering Heights, and her character, Catherine Earnshaw; yet Jane Eyre remains, through her novel, uncompromised of her own integrity and character, despite her circumstances et al. Catherine, according to Emily's narrative, is never given such a choice, or options of such freedom, i.e. independent female thinking.Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is an astonishing novel: besides Wuthering Heights, by her sister Emily, it is one of the most passionate, intense, uncompromising, painful, and beautifully and intensely emotionally sustained novels of all literature. An astonishing achievement, irrespective of genre, author or century."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I've watched the movie(s) over and over but have never read the book until now.I knew what was going to happen, and still I couldn't put it down.I will be reading it again."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I loved this book so much, I have started everyone I know reading it!!

The dialogue that she would exhibit was far beyond her years, especially when she would go back and forth with Rochester. I was fascinated by just about everything Jane Eyre went through.It takes me a while to read books but it didn't take long for me to read \\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bronte. My daughter read it in grammar school and she enjoyed it, but I think I enjoyed it better because of the period it was set in and the way the story evolved.Whether you are in high school or an adult, if you like classic stories, I don't think you can go wrong with this classic romance novel.Kindle 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 3G Works Globally, Graphite, 6\\" Display with New E Ink Pearl Technology"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Great read!

The book came in wonderful condition (considering its age). Could not be happier with this purchase!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Although classics are largely respected books for their ability to withstand the test of time, in most cases, these classics often seem overly erudite for most students. JANE EYRE seemed to, at first, embody the rather intimidating characteristics of a classic, but I later learned that it was my lack of experience, not my lack of old-English proficiency that hindered my true respect and understanding for the novel.Compared to other classics, such as the novels of Charles Dickinson, JANE EYRE presents itself in a more approachable style of writing. This helps readers of many different English proficiency levels be able to understand Jane Eyre's tragic events and unusual acquaintances.Despite the fact that many can grasp the literal meaning of the story, it takes a lot more experience and wisdom to be able to fully understand the underlying messages. Some themes that were hidden were the limitations of women in society and the conflict that people have to accept themselves.JANE EYRE, quite truthfully, was a rather slow and sometimes dull read for me. Although my first read was disappointing, I'm sure that I will be able to learn more from the novel when reading it in the future when I encountered different events and experiences. This unending learning that can be earned from reading classics is probably what justifies their endurance through continuous changes in culture and language. I highly encourage readers to read JANE EYRE periodically throughout their life because a new side of this book will be revealed every time it is read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"For me, the book was a little slow getting started.

I reread it 4-5 times, and finally read the unabridged version when I got to high school and have reread it about 3 times since. Jane Eyre never ceases to amaze and delight me. Having first read the book at such a young and impressionable age, I think Jane Eyre has always been my inspiration. Her courage and spunk are qualities that as a little girl, I most deeply admired and wanted to emulate. It is a wonderful book for young women to read to for its strong willed heroine who nonetheless exhibits all of the compassion and femininity that women must also possess. So much what we teach young women today is, be masculine and ruthless to get ahead in this world. Women should be proud and not afraid to be feminine. That is a power that we possess that men don't."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"The book is written in an interesting way, but it was also very difficult to read.

Although I am not use to a story that does not go straight to the conflict, I believe this story was on going. There is some excellent imagery, and metaphorical aspects in the story, but only that can not save this narrative. If you are a person that loves a romantic setting with certain twists every now and then, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"While there are wonderful characters and a somewhat clever plot, this book gets very boring! The main thrill of the novel is just a written account of most girls' dream of becoming the wife of a man to whom they are truly in love (OK, so Jane had some hardships along the way too...;-)). Of course, Jane is very independent and has no exceptionally good looks, so the story may be considered an inspiration to the female culture's wish of being respected for what is inside...? I found it an inspiration to go to bed a little sooner."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Just imagine. You're reading along, you come to a place in the bok that captures your attention. You're completely engulfed by the story, you're not reading it, you're living it! The &quot;real&quot; world is gone. You hear neither phone nor voice. You feel neither hunger nor thirst. You feel only what the author's pen tells you to feel. You are eager to read on. Your eyes cannot read the enthralling story fast enough. In your frenzied haste to know more, you grip the book tighter and bend it back, cracking the binding.Years later when you pick the very same book up again, you can tell the scary, happy, or sad parts of the book by the location of the creases. Jane Eyre is such a book. It is one of three or four books who contentend for the multiple-crack champion.I was assigned to read this book for an AP English class. Although I love to read, class-assigned books had a dubious history with me. Most, I felt, were boring or too pessimistic to find favor with me. I had heard many people talk about the book favorably after having read it in middle school. I put my hope in their past experiences and began to read. Although the first pages did not entirely confirm the praises the book had recieved, the book so far surrpassed my expectations that I finished the book in only a few days time! I would have read non-stop if it had been within my means to do so. When I did get the chance to read, I read as much as I could to the exclusion of food and family sometimes!You may be wondering what about this book could make me such a fanatic. Well, I could give you deep literary criticism about the symbolism, the metaphors, or the imagery, but that doesn't really help you enjoy the story more, it only rounds out the meaning. Instead, let me tell you why you want to read this book.This book combines passion and logic. An odd combination that don't often go together. Jane Eyre starts out in life full of passion and emotions, through torture and schooling, she learns to control her feelings and be ruled by logic. As she moves through life she struggles to find a balance between what her emotions tell her and what logic demands. Logic helps her through times when she feels abandoned and emotions guide her back to love when the tables are turned.This book skillfully combines elements from nearly all genre and is sure to please anyone. It has action, romance, comedy, suspence, even the supernatural! This book is sure to put cracks in YOUR binding"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"---In Charlotte Bronte's classic JANE EYRE, the title character is a strong willed woman who undergoes many hardships and trials, but eventually comes out triumphant. This book is a mixed one for me. I appriciate the classic nature of this story, and I like the heroine, but there is just a self righteous tone to the entire book. ---- Jane Eyre was raised by her terrible and cruel aunt who cares not a wick for her. This was possibly her earliest hardship, yet she persevered the tough childhood years, and becomes even stronger when her aunt puts her in a terrible boarding school. Eventually, she takes a position as a nanny in the house of a rich man where she finds what it is to be loved.------ The problem I had with this story was the &quot;love&quot; between the rich man and Jane Eyre. I didn't feel that the Rochester and Jane loved one another at all, but rather had a need to have control over another person, and they provided one another with this powerful position. They both seemed ver"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Jane Eyre is by far one of the best books I've ever read. The plot is interesting and is written in a beautiful fashion. However, if you plan on buying it, don't get the Penguin Classics edition. Towards the middle of the novel, there are strange spelling mistakes: half of Jane's name becomes Janet, which is not even a character in the book. It gets very annoying after a while and doesn't occur any of the other editions. I definitely recommend this book, but just not this edition."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"While I enjoyed this book, I was disappointed. I found it to be verbose, going on and on for long passages where nothing much changed or happened - just repetitious. In addition, it is profoundly and deeply Christian, to the point of preachiness. This last may not be a problem for you if you happen to share the author's views.However, if you can live with its faults, it is otherwise well written. Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester are well drawn characters, interesting and unexpected. The plot has sufficient twists and turns to hold your interest. And the ending is satisfying, a big plus for me.In summary, it is more dated than, say, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (a personal favorite), but it is still worth reading.(This review is of the unabridged audio version of the book.)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"This is surely the best book from the Bronte family. Out of any of the books that they have published, this one is by far the closest to being interesting. A lot of neat stuff happens if you pay close attention.The reason why I give this book a three is that I don't see it a as a great work of literature. The are many other books out there (my favorite: the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo) that deserve a five. I couldn't bring myself to even give this a four.In all I see Jane Eyre as an ok book. However, it does become very dull at times and you won't pick it up and read it again if you make it to the end."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"When I was 12 my aunt gave me a copy of Jane Eyre. It was a favorite of hers as a young girl. It quickly became a favorite of my own. It encouraged me to seek out other books like any one of Jane Austen's great novels, Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. So I am eternally grateful to my aunt who handed me a small paperback that opened my mind to a world I never knew! I hope to give my own niece a copy of Jane Eyre, and hopefully she will love it like I do. So please, read this book it is wonderful."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Charlotte Bronte reveals the story of Jane Eyre in an unhurried and intricately woven way.

I enjoy the older books better than most of the new ones."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Numerous movies have been made of this novel, or based in parts on the novel, and there is a reason why: it is a haunting, coming-of-age story, with a dark mystery and love story embedded within. Jane Eyre, who is shunted around due to her &#34;unladylike&#34; intelligence and strong sense of self, discovers love with her employer-the strange and moody Mr. Rochester. He is hiding a secret though, and it will threaten Jane's chance of happiness. Unlike many &#34;love&#34; stories from past and present however, Jane uses her inner-strength to succeed on her own, and sets the example for future &#34;strong women&#34; stories that have developed since this groundbreaking novel was written.The wordy descriptions and redundancy of some of the writing clearly dates this novel as a &#34;classic&#34; but do not let that scare you from reading. Having read this more than once, I like to skim much of it, including descriptions of her early years at the school Jane is sent to, for standing up for herself at the home she were she grew up. The descriptions DO set the mood for everything, but are still overly-wordy, which was the norm for this period of writing. One exception to this, is the novel &#34;Ivanhoe,&#34; set during the time of Robin Hood and written during the time of Queen Victoria's birth. Otherwise, as with the Bronte's works, you will deal with a lot of seemingly-useless descriptive paragraphs. AGain, it does set the mood though, and the writing itself is beautiful, even if it doesn't always forward the purpose of the story.This story is haunting, much like &#34;Wuthering Heights&#34; but I prefer &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; any day for the sheer strength of the heroine, and the surprisingly moving passion of the star-crossed lovers."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"A good classic.

It never ceases to amaze how great the classics are."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"The book Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte is about a girl who is about ten years old, and she lives with her aunt, cousins because her parents had died when she was young. Her cousin John, who is the master of the house, always harasses her. Jane leaves to go to school, and then she put an ad in the newspaper. A lady named Mrs. Fairfax comes to take her to where she works so Jane can live with them. Jane is a governess who teaches a little girl named Adele. When the master of the house, Mr. Rochester, comes and Jane starts to like him. Jane is eighteen when she went to live at the house in Thornfield.After Jane has been at the Thornfield house for so long she gets a letter saying that her aunt is dying. So Jane goes to her aunts house before her aunt goes and stays for a little bit until she has to get back to work at Thornfield. After that she leaves Thornfield and found a nun who knew her parents. Jane heads back to Thornfield and falls in love and almost marries. But then she finds her self-alone and penniless, then Jane finds that she is rich. The book is good and exciting until the end because of what happens to Jane in the novel.The book has a lot of mystery like when Jane had to put out a fire in Mr. Rochester's bedroom, and romance. In the book in the beginning there is discrimination against woman's rights when master John hurts Jane with his bare hands, this book does have woman's rights in the beginning and in the middle of the book. This book is interesting because it was very expressive of how a teenage life is through this book. The reason why it is so expressive is that the book drags out a teenager life of how problems come and go around. When they explain what is going on in the story with Jane the author explains the weigh she takes the problem in the novel.This book would be really good for people who like love stories and mysteries all in one. This book is a good for maybe teens to high school or even the beginning college students that what a adventure or two with the love and passion in the novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"This is one of my top books to read.

Jane is trying to to become independant, but yet at the same time she is trying to find love. Rocheter tries to control her. Jane once said to him, &quot;I can't stay here to become nothing to you?

It is a beautiful love story and sometimes it is romantic. It is not only a love story it is a thrilling story too. As an orphan she had a very hard beginning in her life. As a reader you must feel with Jane. If Jane is angry with a person you feel angry too. So it is a emotional story. Sometimes the author stays too long with a particular situation.

It was great. I loved the mystery-romance theme it had."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I just finished reading &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; for my grade twelve English class. I borrowed the book from my school library. About four chapters into the book, I returned the novel to the library, and went out that night to get my own copy.I cannot express in words how this novel has touched my heart. The musical nor the movie will never ever return the stirring of emotion that I felt for Jane's character while reading it from the creative and romantic mind of Charlotte Bront? I did cry when Jane witnessed the death of her very best friend, Helen Burns, in Lowood School. I felt bitter and angry when Mr. Rochester did not tell Jane about his first wife, but I also felt relieved when Jane and Mr. Rochester rekindled their love to face a new life together.If there is one novel that will ever touch my heart, look at my life as a woman, and respect the heroics that women of past ages have undergone, this is the novel.Jane Eyre: this will be a novel respected for ages to come."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Humbled Jane Eyre(pronounced air) is turned out of her aunt's house after being accused of throwing a gobblet at her master's 16yr old son, then sent to a boarding school for girls.

You'll cry for Jane and laugh with her. I am only sixteen and I first read this book when I was fourteen. I fell in love with it and since then have read it many times. It is good when you are feeling sad or happy. It is also the kind of book to read on a winter's day while sipping hot cocoa."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"This novel is one of the most expressionistic novels I have ever read. It clearly conveys the love between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester as Jane Eyre emerges into womanhood. It is about life strengthening situations and finding a love that clearly does not look at the physical, but a true love that is deep within the heart. Jane Eyre is a great book by Charlotte Bronte and I will treasuer it where I go, and reread and reread it over and over. It's spectacular."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I will probably read this book again. I borrowed it from a friend and will most likely get my own copy. I liked Jane Eyre as a main character better than Catherine from Wuthering Heights because Jane was more compassionate. I also liked her because of her intriguing personality. From the beginning she sets herself as different from other people, more hardy and thoughtful. Her stay at Lowood is interesting, mainly because of her relationship with Helen and the contrast between the two. Her romance with Mr. Rochester is original. Some of that is due to the fact that Jane falls in love without being made foolish by it. Her stay with the Rivers family was sort of frustrating, because her character was suppressed by St. John. I really didn't like him. The ending was very good except for the last few paragraphs which dwell on St. John. But, that aside, Jane Eyre is a wonderful book, deserving to be read and reread by everyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"As a child of the eighties, when reading recently published books and seeing movies, I've grown accustomed to &quot;love&quot; being graphically depicted sexual attraction that eventually turns into romance. How refreshing it is to read Jane Eyre, where the order is reversed! A portrayal of love like this is hard to come by. In Jane Eyre, everything is pure, and the love is passionate without anything you'd be embarrassed to tell your parents about. The characters are likeable - I found myself rooting for the protagonsits, hoping Jane and Mr. Rochester would wind up togther no matter how many obstacles they may come across. Yeah, there are a lot of descriptions, but surprisingly, there was even a little adventure. I enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I've noticed a trend in those readers who have disliked this novel; they seem to have been forced to read Jane Eyre. I too read this book for school, but began about six months before it was due. I think it is truly one of the most beautiful books I have ever read, with strong messages about human behavior..Jane, despite difficult beginnings in her life, became the strongest, most loving charcter in the book. Who really cares that she fell in love with an &quot;old guy?&quot; Here's a newsflash..he was only in his thirties or forties, and that isn't so old. Jane found love, and that's a bigger accomplishment than a lot of us can claim. Try Jane Eyre again some other time if you're up against a deadline..details are not evil, description is not boring. If the rest of the world says Jane Eyre is a classic, although you are entitled to your own opinion, there's a good chance it is. And one more thing-&quot;renting the movie&quot; and buying &quot;Cliffs Notes&quot; are not alternative options to reading a novel. To think that taking shortcuts in reading for school assignments is an advantage, is to fool yourself. I had a teacher give a pass/fail test in which the true/false questions relied solely upon the differences between a book and the movie made after it. Something to think about."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"It's moving and is the best love story I've ever read. Bronte vividly draws out Jane's independence and love for Rochester. Her love for him was pure and perfect but when she found out his dark secret this perfection was shattered. Jane's independent spirit guided her through the difficult times she had to face. I've read it so many times afterward I practically know the whole book by heart!!! It always makes me so sad in the end when I'm finished, though; it touched my heart..."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"When I first got this book from the library I checked it out because at the time I was going toward old (girl heroine) novels. The beginning was hard to get though and I put it aside until it was almost due. The middle went through nice enough to what seemed a perfect happy ending, until you get to the wedding. After that it starts getting really good! I gave this only four stars because I'm not big on love stories, but other than that disadvantage-and the boring beginning-this is an excellent book! You have to read it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I thought I'd be sucked into another boring nineteenth century novel when I started this book my freshman year. However, I was drawn to the uncoventional love story of Mr. Rochester and Jane. Jane's strong spirit and self-dignity is very unlike the &quot;damsel in distress&quot; portrayed in most of these romantic novels. This is a novel not to be read, but to be experienced."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"A WOMEN'S MASTREPIECE&quot;Dear Reader&quot;- Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre was a milestone for English Literature as we know it. The fact that this captivating novel was written by a 19th century women only enhances it's genius. Charlotte Bronte acted as a trailblazer for all the women authors that would follow her; her unique style of writting and the essence of her characters stimulates the interests of every individual who reads even one line. Jane Eyre is a romantic novel about an innocent girl's voyage through life. The main character,Jane, is a orphan who we are introduced to as she is living in a house full of cruelty. The home belongs to a sour, cold women called Mrs. Reed and her three aggressive children. &quot;He bullied me and punished me ; not two or three times a week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually : every nerve I had feared hom, and every morsel of flesh on my bones shrank when he came near.&quot; Mrs. Reed's son John's treatment of jane caused harsh and long-lasting effects. The family's unjustifiable hatred for Jane results in her being sent to a distant school. Lowood is a cold, and gloomy institution for girls. Its routines are militay, its teachings are restrictive, and its conditions are horrible. She attends this school for eight years during which she excels in her studies as well as in sense. Despite the unsettled environment of Lowood, Jane enjoys her time spent there and more importantly cherishes the friendships made there. This is the place where Jane meets her first true friend Helen Burns. It is through helen's example that jane learns to be patient, diligent and expressive. &quot;Her (Helen) soul sat on her lips and language flowed, from what source I cannot tell.&quot; After eight years, Jane desires to move on in life. jane is now educated, confident and ready for change. After advertising for a teaching position, Jane accepts an offer to be a governess at Thornfield. Thornfield is a grand, old estate surrounded by the lonely moors of England. Her motive for going to Thornfield is to instruct the vibrant, young pupil Adele. The immense events and heart wrenching romance that she encounters there change her intentions quite dramatically. Jane's relationship wiht the dark and tortured owner of Thornfield, Mr. Rochester, forms the foundation of Jane's womanhood. The most unique aspect of this romance is the heroine's response to love. the majority of romance novels present a similar picture of love's hold on womane. they become increasingly more like the men they love and less like themselves. they grow weaker, more compliant and vulnerable. However, this novel's heroine does not conform but rather defies the expected. Jane discovers her love for another through the discovery of the love for herself. &quot;Women feel just as men feel.&quot; It would be pure arrogance and a literary sin if I were to describe what happens within the hidden walls of Thornfield. For this novel's majety lies not only within it's story but in the actual words of Charlotte Bronte. The way she can so vividly depict a scene or how she so clearly desribes love is a wonder. &quot;I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspects, and life in its colour: and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the front of fruition, and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.&quot; Charlotte Bronte had the gift of being able to capture emotion and reflect it on paper; making the image more enticing than the subject. i strongly recommend this book to anyone who has a hunger for passion, a thirst for excitement and a desire for intellect. You are not only given complete enjoyment from this novel, but a life lesson as well. This lesson implies that the only thing that matters is that you are true to yourself and to what you love. This is a lesson that you can carry with you on your own journey through life, as Jane Eyre did."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I was at first really absorbed in reading the parts that had to do with Jane's childhood. I did not miss a word of it. However, I found the parts after she became a governess a bit boring. I had a hard time with her falling head over heels with Mr. Rochester. He is too cold and self absorbed. Not the chivalrous hero of most fairy tales. His personality doesnt change one iota despite all of the things he has been through. I never ever see a resolve where he loves and accepts Adele. I thought that his indifference toward Adele was one of the things that TURNED JANE OFF about him!! Then she goes weak in the knees over him. I just found that really hard to digest. Yes, I know it's just a fiction, but the inconsistency of the woman who *seemed* to be consistent in her character threw me off."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"The story of Jane Eyre is so moving that I hardly put the book down once I started to read. The passion and surprises are well worth your time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I think I like this book for the reasons that make some other people hate it. Jane and Mr. Rochester are not the typical protagonists of this kind of story: Mr. Rochester is not the usual Prince Charming, nor is Jane the usual beautiful princess. He is cold, self-centered and doesn't like children; it is difficult to see at first why she loves him. She is poor, plain and unladylike. A quiet rebel, not a fire-spewing one. She wants Mr. Rochester all right, but under her own terms. All this is narrated with unsurpassed intensity of feeling and beautiful language. The passages in which Jane uses her paintings to reveal her love for Mr. Rochester, are simply exquisite, like when she draws herself as the plain governess that she is, comparing herself with her alleged rival, a gorgeous woman of fashion, or when she draws a portrait of Mr. Rochester in order to have before her &quot;the face of a friend.&quot;A few clumsinesses of the plot can be forgiven considering the times in which the novel was written. For example, Jane receiving a big inheritance coming just from nowhere, or Mrs. Rochester being killed all too timely. At Jane's time, the only way a woman of her condition could be independent was to be independently wealthy, and the only way for her to have that kind of money was to inherit it. Also, if she went back to live with Mr. Rochester (as she clearly intends to do), while his first wife was still alive, most probably the novel would have been considered too scandalous for publication.I have read this lovely book I don't know how many times, and I always find it exhilarating and haunting. Being a fan of Jane Eyre doesn't seem to be considered intellectually glamorous these days, but then, I plead guilty to it. I never get tired of this book, and I don't think I ever will."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Jane Eyre, is my hands-down favorite novel. Breathtaking in scope, Charlotte Bronte wrote a novel that is gothically romantic (given the popular style of the day), a commentary on Victorian England social mores, and of forbidden love...breaking the barrier between class. Jane was a feminist, controlling her fate, her life, despite whatever constraints (other people, social, financial) she encountered.Anyone who believes in the dismantling of the welfare state, should read this novel (and Charles Dickens for that matter) to get a better idea of the reality of a world in which &quot;unfortunates&quot; are dependent upon the random kindness and/or charity of others."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"It's easy to understand and it starts to get fun when Jane falls in love with Mr. Rochester"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Jane had to face a tough decision, and she made the decision she thought was right, that makes me love her character even more.

It contains everything from the gothic house to the scary madwoman in the attic. It is everything from a suspense novel to a romance to an autobiography. The reader instantly likes Jane and empathy remains with her throughout the novel. you feel that it imperative that Jane eventually marries Rochester according to the reader and I found myself willing her not to be swept away by St. John Rivers. You see life through Jane's eyes from the cruelty of Aunt Reed, to the death of Helen Burns to the joy at meeting Rochester again.

I bought this Oxford Classic after reading some very negative comments by Virginia Woolf in her polemic \\"A Room of One's Own.\\" There she thought that Charlotte Bronte had gone overboard mixing fiction with her own conservative views of feminism. So, I was eager to see how bad this book was.This is a great read and I read the book almost non-stop for two days. It is hard to put down. This was Charlotte Bronte's first successful book and it is her best. I am reading her next book written after \\"Jane Eyre\\", \\"Shirley,\\" and it is not as clearly structured. The present book is similar in some ways to that great classic \\"Madame Bovary\\" in that it is compact, concise, and consists of a well formulated plot; and, it has one strong central protagonist. It is a clear and compelling read. By the way, the character is almost the complete opposite of Madame Bovary in terms of morals.One can quibble about parts of the story since it relies to some extent on coincidence and luck. Those parts lack realism.The book was attacked by Christians at the time of publication almost 160 years ago and later by feminists. But that is secondary.This Oxford version has a good analysis. It has a biography of Charlotte Bronte and comments on her sisters. The Oxford introduction by Sally Shuttleworth places the book in histrical context. Also, extra notes are included on the text. I read the comments after reading the book, and the less you know about the plot before reading the book better off you will be.This is simply a great read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Jane Eyre is a brilliant novel!

From the mysterious noise coming from the upstairs room of Thornfield Hall to the growing love between Jane and her employer, Mr. Rochester. Jane Eyre is an enchanting story of a young girl orphaned at a young age and living with 3 horrible little children and their mother. Jane is treated like a outsider and a burden by the eldest son. When Jane is old enough to leave that life behind, and start over,she becomes a governess at Thornfield Hall.

I don't know French (I understand German)and there are parts where French is spoken. This book is well written and the characters are colorful. Jane is a passionate character. She is also quiet, meek (in her own way), but has strong opinions in the book. Mr. Rochester is dark, miserable, and extremly moody. I disliked Adele because she is way too irritating and spoiled. Miss Ingram is just as spoiled as Adele, intolerant, shallow, and insensitive. I don't really understand why Jane did not really investigate the strange laughter and Grace Poole. Well, she did but it was a very light interogation. She took Mrs. Fairfax's word for everything. Some of the things she said would be worth checking out.

The way Charlotte Bronte descibes the characters' emotion is simply captivating. Surprises are around every corner in this book. My overall impression of this piece of work is \\"mind thrilling\\"From a most hated orphan to an educated governess, Jane Eyre does it all. At the beginning of the book we start off with the hardships of her childhood.

The book Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte tells the story of a strong woman named Jane and her growth from a rejected orphan to a strong and independent woman. After living like a servant in her cruel aunt's home, Jane is sent off to receive an education at a poor institute for orphans. After witnessing the death of her best friend and surviving six more years there, Jane becomes a teacher and eventually a governess at the Thornfield Manor under the master, Edward Rochester.Unlike many stories about love, in this one it is Jane's intellect and passion that is what attracts Edward Rochester. They fall deeply in love, but the discovery of Edward's insane wife causes Jane to run away. Charlotte Bronte uses her talent with words to vividly describe Jane's pain.\\"Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent expectant woman---almost a bride---was a cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were desolate. A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes which last blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with untrodden snow...My hopes were all dead---struck with a subtle doom\\" (314).Homeless, penniless, and near death Jane somehow finds work and a place to stay. Her path of self-discovery continues in the finding of her cousins and her inheritance of her uncle's fortune.She finally returns to Edward to find him staying with his servants. The once wealthy businessman had become wifeless, homeless, blind, and crippled from a fire. Jane and Edward's love had not diluted in their time apart but grew stronger. The story ends happily with Jane and Edward's marriage and birth of a son.This book is written with such detail and emotion, you instantly connect with the young woman. The depth and compassion of this book draws the reader in and teaches him/her about determination and self-worth. Her morality and strength, in a time when women were not accepted for their minds, makes Jane stand out from other heroines. When she is at the point of near death from hunger and fatigue, she will not give up.\\"While the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground? I fear I cannot do other wise: for who will receive me? But it will be very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and the sense of desolation-this total prostration of hope...And why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life? Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively. Oh, Providence! Sustain me a little longer!\\" (351).Jane Eyre is a classic book, but the text is quite long and at times can seem to trail off. There are points in the book that don't move and slow down the story. During one conversation between Jane and Edward the story feels like it's dragging on.\\"'Sententious sage! So it is: but I sear by my household god not to abuse it.'\`You are human and fallible.'\`I am: so are you-what then?'\`The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine and perfect alone can be safely entrusted'\\" (144).Over all, the book is excellent. It is captivating and powerful. It is a long read, but worth the time. I would recommend this book to everyone, not only women. Regardless of the gender of the hero, this book shows what one can accomplish no matter what obstacles life throws your way."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I first read \\"Jane Eyre\\" shortly after high school and was completely mesmerized by it. I have read it several times since and I come away with a different view point each time. Jane is the ultimate heroine: she's independant, doesn't bow down to what the \\"ideal woman\\" should be and doesn't let anything (or anyone) compromise her principles, even the man she loves. The book appeals to the reader both emotionally and intellectually. The emotional aspect of the book is what I love about it. When Rochester tells Jane of his feelings for her, I can the passion of the characters. And later, when Jane leaves him, the agony of the characters is palpable.\\"Jane Eyre\\" always seems to fall under \\"Wuthering Heights\\" shadow. \\"Jane Eyre,\\" I believe, is the better novel. It has all the atmosphere of \\"Wuthering Heights\\", but the romance of Rochester and Jane is far more romantic and believable than that of Cathy and Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I read this book when I was 15 for a school English project when a friend recommended it- I'm now 17 and I'm actually in the process of reading the book again.

At last people know king is nude..."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book could have easily been titled \\"What If\\" or even better yet \\"Only If\\" as it describes at world leader level in detail not only intentions that were miss understood, but also entangled with poor timing of superseding events. If you had ever heard disparaging comments on Churchill as the prime instigator, this book helps you visualize that he was indeed a prime mover, surrounded by a cacophony of leaders on the rise and fall, as we were all twisted by a press leading their peoples into war and a peace that has yet to be achieved. Other prime mover instigators are The Mark Sykes the co author of the infamous Sykes - Picot Agreement between England and France to partition the Ottoman Empire. Infamous do to through his naivete, as it turns out. Also to the cast of British arrogance was Lord Kitchener's march towards folly in the Middle Eastern debacle. And finally the granddaddy of them all was the British PM Lloyd George, who pulled the strings of many.This book is clearly from a British perspective as it describes the art of getting the bureaucratic politics right, the chief endeavor of the book. It was clearly akin to the work of Picasso. The chief story plot in the framework of history is the Great Game which was to shield Britain's road to India from the motives of Russia and then France. It was a game where Russia plays a Central Role in the beginning through deception, the middle through folly, and the end through deception. If written by a Russian author it would be only slightly twisted through logical story telling that the British made all their strategic decision from a standpoint of paranoia.As a late comer to World War One an American can say that Wilson, lost in his own theories of sovereign destiny, was duped by all sides in the conflict and the peace process. I mention this to help the American reader appreciate history's cause and effect and learn you must make a paradigm shift to the perspective of WWI to learn a critical lesson pertinent to our involvement in the Middle East. The book provides a worthy plot in a panoramic view worth the time to read you find nascent Modern Middle East politics entwined with the politics of the Great Powers in a time where the paradigm of a Palestinian State was lost, and still is. In the brokering of Palestinian land Syria was granted to the House of Hussein, and not the Palestinians. This huge gap in fate is only the collective total of what is still an enigma today which is peace. Leaders of that time left today's world leaders, still blind to that oversight and now buried in time, trying to divide a small piece of unproductive land in Israel when in fact the fruitful land of Arab Syria is rightfully Palestinian. Even the author of this book, a historian uncovers the folly, but does not recognize what is right before his eyes. A paradigm shift in history is still at large.The first British domino after the Duke Ferdinand was assassinated in Serbia drawing Russia and Germany at odds in a land where Great Britain was beholden as essential to the Great Game. It was only an excuse to go to a pending war to settle brewing international intrigue. Keep in mind this is only 55 years after the Crimean War over the very similar world order. To ward off such a folly; if only the world knew of Churchill's intentions regarding Turkey,...there is much more to this review...please do a keyword search on cigarroomofbooks, peace-to-end-all-peace."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book is very well written about the complexities and connections of a period when important changes happened in the 20th century."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Fabulous!

It does much to explain why \\"Old Europe\\" and the US are regarded with so much suspicion in the Middle East. It should make us aware of the dangers of colonialism and exploitation in the Middle East. It points out that the costs of maintaining a colonial regime far outweigh the benefits.I would suggest reading this book along with Noam Chomsky's \\"Hegemony or Survival.\\" The two books make it clear that we are on a disastrous course in the Middle East and in much of the rest of the world."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"First let me begin by stating that I am not the author of this book. There's not much that I can add to the reviews which have been already written about Mr. Fromkin's book, other than to say that if you want to gain an understanding of the problems which confront that area, this book is a good place to start. Certainly it is a cautionary tale for any country that decides to involve itself in that area of the world. What was surprising to me was how many of the forces which presently plague the Middle East (Islamic fundamentalism for example) were in existence and creating problems back in 1922! We tend to think that this is a recent phenomenon created by Osama bin Laden and his followers. Fromkin points out however that the Wahhabi Sect, the kind of Islam that bin Laden and the Saudi royal family follow, originated in 18th century Arabia. The most important conclusion which I drew from this book, is that the Middle East is no place to intervene in if you are ignorant about the history of the region and its people."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"If you have visited the Middle East or are interested in the region, this book makes sense of the whole affair.

Far from being dry history, it reads as an intriguing story. As well as being entertained by the cast of characters and the storyline, you will acquire a good deal of historical knowledge which will help you to understand the area today."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"If you're interested in knowing how today's Middle East emerged, this is the book to buy. Not only is it for newcomers, but also for those who have some background. The book is about the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire by the Great Powers during the I.World War. The book could be separated into two parts: Before the war and after the war. Before and during the war allied countries share the lands of the empire. There are promises given to each other and given to native people of the Middle East such as Jews and Arabs. Britain, and France are the victors. But now there are betrayals and lies after the war. There are politicians ready to integrate the Middle East into their colonization empire but there are also politicians of the Middle East whom are underestimated by the great powers but in fact better in politics by playing off one power to another. At the end, soldiers like Mustafa Kemal (later to-be Ataturk) and tribe leaders like Feisal become presidents and prime ministers by coming to terms with the Great powers but at the expense of some people such as Palestinians or Syrians or Iraqies. The book is brilliantly written narrative history of the Middle East. You can't stop reading. Fromkin is also very analytic writer and this makes the book more valuable. He doesn't just present the facts. He questions them, make deductions, guesses. If a historian is analytic in his book, then you will find new and interesting new facts, possibilities too. Fromkin thanks to his analytic thinking, tells us about how Enver Pasha duped Germans before entering the war,for instance. He also argues that the pact signed between the Ottoman and German Empires in 1914 does not mean a declaration of war. There are interesting insights about the entry of the Ottoman Empire to the war. There are more interesting ideas, but these are the things I remember now. It is absolutely worth reading."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"A PEACE TO END ALL PEACE: THE FALL OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE AND THE CREATION OF THE MODERN MIDDLE EAST is the third book I've read by David Fromkin. This book illustrates well (exhaustively) how human weaknesses and interpersonal complexities influenced the resolution of WWI in terms of the Middle East. The title comes from a quote from Archibald Wavell (later Field Marshal Earl Wavell), who served under Britain's Allenby in Palestine. His comment, \\"After the 'war to end war' they seem to have been pretty succesful in Paris at making a 'Peace to end Peace.'\\"First I want to write that I was concerned the book would be dated, since it was published in 1989, but I did not find that to be the case at all. Of course, we've invaded Iraq (twice) since then, but the book is foundational, and helped me to understand a lot of what is going on there now, particularly Britain's willingness to be involved in the current conflict.The book chronicles WWI, its beginnings, campaigns and drawn-out treaty process with a focus on the Middle East and Britain's aims there. WWI was still a time of Empire in Europe and The Great Game, the grab for power in new and existing foreign territories done through armed conflict and diplomacy in Europe by Great Britain, France, German, Austro-Hungary and Russia, for the most part. With this cultural bias toward collecting foreign territories and holding them, Great Britain and her peers in the early part of the 20th Century, saw the Ottoman Empire as the dying power of Europe, and they sought to benefit from its break up. Throughout WWI, Britain, France and Russia did a delicate and interesting dance with each other concerning the Ottoman remanants once the war was won. (Interestingly, U.S. President Wilson's focus on self-determination made him a thorn in the side of the United States' European allies, and the United States never declared war on the Porte.)Fromkin covers in 568 pages, which are carefully documented, the dance and the dancers, demonstrating how personality and personal proclivities and beliefs of those in power in England in 1918 have made a mark on the world we live in today. He covers Lord Kitchener's eccentric and short-sighted behaviors as War Minister, Churchill's rise and fall and rise again, Mark Sykes' thorough but misdirected work on the Sykes-Picot agreement between Great Britain and France for areas of influence in the Middle East, how T.E. Lawrence rose in stature and renown for somewhat ineffective and erratic work in Saudi Arabia and Transjordan, the positioning of what is now the Jordanian royal family against the Saudis by European powers, and how fear and insecurity on the parts of many players turned political fortunes from 1914 to 1922.A fascinating subtheme of this book was how the Allies were not monolithic when it came to the issues the end of the Ottoman Empire was presenting to them. They sought to work together, but sparred diplomatically (and Britain and France were even afraid of going to war against each other) and behind the scenes over each power's \\"rights.\\" Also, the fact that the governments and leaders changed in the nations at war had huge effects on its outcome. Goals changed as did the \\"hearts and minds\\" of the people at home as the war continued. However, no matter how much they espoused its demise, the Great Game seemed to be what they were all playing at, all along, even Russia after its revolutions and its condemnation of imperialism by other nations.This long book is very effective in laying a thorough foundation for the last chapters, which really coalesce the history of each region, Afghanistan, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Israel, Saudi Arabia, etc., into a series of chapters that help us understand that part of the world, and why it is the way it is today (as well as our attitudes about it). While the empires of Europe sought to understand these uprisings in the 1920s as intrigues brought about by rival powers in the region because they were willfully blind to the desire for self-governance by the people in the Middle East, Fromkin characterizes them as part of a painful process of regovernmentalization, moving from being dominated by Empire to being independent nation states with rights to exist, to defend, and to agitate for one's own interests. In the final chapter, \\"The Middle Eastern Question\\" Fromkin makes the fascinating point that the transition from the end of the Ottoman Empire in the early part of the 20th century, to a style of government more in line with Europe's is a painful, but natural transition that is likely to take centuries. \\"The Allies proposed a post-Ottoman design for the region in the early 1920s. The continuing question is whether the people of the region will accept it\\" (p. 565).Fromkin makes a valid and valuable case that the treaties of 1922 are the current heart of the ongoing conflicts from Gaza to Kabul, and I believe him. He writes with authority, clarity and focus. I recommend this book!"},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"I read this book as part of preparation to teach a class on the \\"turn of the century\\". I was already somewhat familiar with the events that lead up to the creation of the modern Middle East, but I have never previously found such a concise yet multi-faceted review of the critical thirty years at the begiining of the 20th Century that literally set the stage for many of the traumas that we are currently facing. What I most appreciate about Fromkin's writing is that he largely avoids lumping people and peoples together into homogenous monoblocks, thus, rather than simply talking about \\"the British\\" he acknowledges that there were many sides to British (or French or Arab or Turkish etc.) interests in the mid-east, and that quite often these sides undermined each other, failed to communicate, or simply ignored the \\"facts on the ground\\". The tensions between and differing aims of the Vice-regal government in India and Parliament in London have often been left out of policy discussions, and Fromkin does us a service by reminding us of the somewhat haphazard nature of the British Empire even at its moment of triumph. While this is not the ONLY book one should read on this crucial period in history (I agree with the reviewer who suggests greater attention to Turkish sources) this is a great starting place, and you will find many of the dilemmas that are facing governments in London and Washington in 2002 frighteningly similar to dilemmas facing London, Paris, and Delhi in 1918. Would that one felt that our leaders today were reading books like this. ..."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"David Fromkin's book flows like a river and makes easy reading. It is serious history writing in style. I have no definite objection to his facts and figures. I think they are well argued and pursuesive. I have a reservation as a Turk: He writes not from a platform of objectivity and detachment of a real historian but rather with a sentimentality and subjectivity of as an American and probably English person. Fine as long as he also admitted that he sought the views of no single Turkish historian during his writing.Overall the book should be standard reading for anyone, including professionals, interested in the present not only middle east but Europe as well."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"I literally stumbled upon &quot;A Peace to End All Peace&quot; while reading widely on the First World War and am extremely happy I did. My first reaction was one of surprise that a relatively dense tome on the seemingly arcane topic of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire was able to achieve New York Times Bestseller status. After reading it, however, I'm not at all surprised that author David Fromkin achieved critical and commercial success with this book.Fromkin's work has a number of things going for it: a fascinating and incredibly relevant subject; a glittering cast; a liberal dose of historical irony; and a highly effective format and literary style.Although the narrative is set nearly a century ago and the focus is squarely on British foreign policy, the history is germane to current events. This book makes it clear that American foreign policy today is grappling with the mess made by London in 1914-1922. It is impossible to fully understand and appreciate the ongoing events in Israel, Palestine, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan without a full understanding of the events so lucidly delivered in &quot;A Peace to End All Peace.&quot;The most engrossing works of popular history, I've found, accentuate the roles and inter-relations of fabulous personalities. Academic historians may cringe at this grandstanding, but the effect in undeniable. Fromkin has embraced this model and has benefited greatly from the fact that one the central characters in his story - Winston Churchill - is also one of the most colorful political figures of all time. The author has a pretty strong supporting cast to work with as well, including David Lloyd George, Pasha Enver, Lord Kitchener, Mustapha Kemel (later Ataturk), and T.E. Lawrence, to name just a very few.Irony is a powerful and persuasive tool in story telling, and it is a centerpiece of Fromkin's narrative. The author suggests that nearly everything about the confluence of events that brought about the political settlements of 1922 that gave us the modern Middle East is filled with tragedy and irony. The greatest irony of all, Fromkin argues, is that in the settlements of 1922 the British got exactly what they wanted in 1914, but it was an arrangement that nobody wanted or supported in 1922.Finally, Fromkin is able to make such a sweeping story accessible and engaging because of his neat organization that breaks the story up into easily digestible chunks. The book is 567 pages long (not including notes, bibliography, etc.) split up into 61 chapters, further sub-divided into three or four sections. Thus, each idea or event is covered in two or three succinctly written pages.In short, &quot;A Peace to End All Peace&quot; is the best book I've read in quite some time - and I read a lot. If you are interested in fully educating yourself on the great foreign policy issue of our generation or are simply looking to read a wonderfully written piece of history, do yourself a favor and get this book."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"As someone who has lived in, studied and now works on issues relating to the Middle East, it's difficult finding books which I feel really provide an insight into the region. Fromkin's book is one of the best out there, both as an historical perspective (accuracy, depth, detail) and as a critical tool for understanding the roots of the conflicts and divisions wracking the region today. Fromkin's style and organization are clear, easy to follow and generally superb, and his detailed portrayals of the key participants are rich characterizations. Anyone with an interest in the Middle East, regardless of their past level of exposure to or knowledge of the region, should read this book."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"A &quot;Peace to End All Peace&quot; is the story of the aftermath of the collapse of the Ottoman (Turkish) Empire after its' defeat in WW 1. It traces the geographic origins of the &quot;modern&quot; Middle East. The author skillfully retells the dealings, double-dealings, betrayals, lies and shifting alliances in the key years of 1914-1922. Don't be deceived by the limited time span. It is amazing how much can happen in 8 very short years! The notes and bibliography encompass 51 pages!&quot;PTEAP&quot; is told primarily from a British viewpoint. The reason is logical enough: England and Prime Minister Lloyd George held and dealt most of the cards in the endless game of building or at least maintaining Empires among the European powers; Britain, France, Italy and Greece. The reader can decide just how well or poorly the PM played-or overplayed- his hand. This Irish American reviewer will keep his opinions to himself. The PM was no friend of the Irish cause. Fear of Russia, both before and after that nation's Revolution lurks in the background. Also in the background is an uninvolved and newly isolationist United States. Britain's fear of losing a land link to India is very much in the foreground. Britain's obsession with India is unexplored. Readers learn how countries are created virtually by geographic whim. The modern nations of Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan, Israel and (basically) Iran are born. Puppet pro-British heads of state appear in Arabia, Iraq, Persia/Iran, and Jordan/ Transjordan -with varying degrees of &quot;success&quot;. PTEAP' s time frame allows only for an excellent introduction but no resolution of a homeland for Jews in Palestine. The result is that PTEAP explores the bases for many of today's problems but does not explain or resolve them. This does not detract from the story's importance one bit. The foundations are laid in these pages.PTEAP is highly challenging and highly rewarding. Its sheer length and breadth demands patience on the part of the serious reader, but the patience will be rewarded! There are two caveats: One is that the mere casual reader should skip PTEAP and select a less formidable book. The other involves the absolute requirement (!) for a World Atlas to appreciate the geographical scope of the story. As with most historical/military publications, the maps provided are of near total inadequacy. Why do editors permit this? For those two points, I deducted a star. We graver types can add the 5th star back. I hope this review has done justice and encouraged serious history fans to buy &quot;A Peace to End All Peace&quot;. Just remember the Atlas!"},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"A Peace to End All Peace covers the events leading up to what Fromkin calls the \\"Settlement of 1922,\\" when the political boundaries and institutions that were to predominate in the Middle East for most of the next century took shape. The book details the many factors involved, such as the rise of Zionism, the exaggerated sense of importance to the war effort of both Jews and Arabs that predominated in Europe, and the personal ambitions of the many actors on the stage, from Winston Churchill to Sherif Hussein, that led to these fateful outcomes.Fromkin argues in this book that the modern Middle East was created in large part by the actions of a few European countries during the crucial years of 1914 to 1922. Although the book's account ends in 1922 and Fromkin does not even mention the current problems in the Middle East, the implication is that the establishment of arbitrary boundaries for Arab states, the creation of the state of Israel, and the aggravation of hostile sentiments that resulted from cynical political maneuvers on the part of European states to a great degree precipitated the current crises. Indeed, the book jacket declares that \\"Fromkin shows how the choices narrowed and the Middle East began along a road that led to the endless wars and the escalating acts of terrorism that continue to this day.\\"The main text of A Peace to End All Peace is over 500 pages long, dealing in painstaking detail with the events that led up to the treaties that ended the First World War. It is in some senses a work of journalism, offering a sort of objective play-by-play of events without a great deal of analysis. The benefit of this approach is that the author's biases do not often come through, and the reader is left to draw his or her own conclusions regarding the causes of events. The drawback is that the reader cannot easily draw any general inferences which are necessary for understanding the topic as a whole. In addition, by concentrating so much on details to the exclusion of general trends, Fromkin does not always make it clear whether a certain event was merely the result of a series of accidents, or whether it was bound to occur in any case. Again, this is partly a result of his predilection for a character-driven narrative.The narrative is very well-written, engaging and easy to follow. It is accessible, not assuming a great deal of familiarity of the subject material (the maps at the beginning of the book are invaluable), and logically organized, following events chronologically within a larger thematic structure. Particularly helpful is the way Fromkin will parenthetically re-introduce a person that we have met earlier, rather than expecting the reader to remember the dozens of characters that weave in and out of the narrative. The characters are given depth and motivation, without erring into presumptive amateur psychoanalysis or pseudo-historical \\"reconstructed\\" dialogue.Events are related primarily from the British (and particularly Churchill's) perspective, which is somewhat puzzling given the fact that most of the important events actually occurred in the Middle East, and that the roles in these events of Russia and France were nearly as important as Britain's. The book is well-researched and copiously documented, relying on a balance of primary and secondary sources, but most of the these are British in origin and outlook. As mentioned earlier, the book also relies strongly on accounts of the actions and beliefs of certain key individuals (again, mostly British), as opposed to broader movements.As there is little analysis in the book, there is not much room for controversy. Occasionally Fromkin will mention alternative versions of events, but the variances are generally tangential to the main narrative. He is painstakingly objective for the most part (although one can sense some sympathy in his viewpoint for the objectives of Zionism). I suspect that this book will hold up well over time, in part because Fromkin focuses so closely on the individuals in the story whose experiences resonate universally, rather than adopting a broader outlook that would reveal more of the prejudices of our time.This is overall an excellent book, and certainly invaluable for understanding current events in the Middle East. Upon finishing it, one is left wishing for a broader account of the background of some of the movements and forces that are presented fully formed in Fromkin's narrative, but that is as much an endorsement as a criticism: A 500 page book that leaves one wanting more is a rarity."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"\\"A Peace to End All Peace\\" is David Fromkin's detailed account of political and military events from the turn of the century to 1922 that ultimately created the modern Middle East. While I enjoyed Fromkin's admirable recounting of key players and events, I was disappointed by the book's narrow focus and surprising lack of analysis. A superb historian in many ways, Fromkin evidently believed that the details of this colorful period and location would largely explain themselves. As a result, the reader is left with a wealth of interesting facts about this period in Middle Eastern history, but little analysis.For this kind of perspective, one is probably better off reading books such as Karen Armstrong's \\"The Battle for God\\".Despite such shortcomings, \\"A Peace to End All Peace\\" remains a superb read. Fromkin provides a lucid and colorful portrait of the priniciple players including Churchill, Enver, Attaturk, and others. I was especially fascinated with Fromkin's sympathetic portrait of Turkey's surprising military success throughout most of the First World War. Under provisioned, and technologically behind, Turkey may have set the first modern example of an underdeveloped Eastern nation using politics, ingenuity, and brilliant tactics to fend off a more powerful Western enemy."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This is a first class, detailed analysis of how the Middle East as we know it today was formed.I would highly recommend that this book is read together with Efraim Karsh's \\"Empires Of The Sands; The Struggle For Mastery Of the Mid-East, 1789 - 1923\\", for a thorough grounding in this subject.Recent events have shown that, whether we like it or not, matters pertaining to the region are going to affect us all in one way or another.With this in mind, it is disturbing that most people possess an overwhelming, innocent, ignorance or apathy in relation to the background of the region and the context of ongoing disputes and military struggles. This book provides an excellent public service in bringing essential information to the public's attention.Without books like this, such an ignorance of regional matters such as the Palestinian-Israeli issue and Islamic Fundamentalism can give rise to a distorted understanding of these matters, making the public at large so vulnerable to disinformation and propaganda.The author covers the hatreds, disputes, rivalries, vested self-interests and hidden agendas of those individuals and nations involved and responsible for carving out and mapping the region during the post First World War years. The decision making process is covered in detail with reference to recently opened archives of hitherto official secret documents and private papers.This is essential reading for an accurate comprehension of the region. Some matters will astound you, especially the level of appeasement shown by my own British Government towards the regions' Arabs and how the British, with a swipe of the pen, literally gave away the vast majority of land promised as a new Jewish state, to form the new country of Transjordan. Read on and digest.Once you have read this and the book outlined above by Efraim Karsh, might I respectfully recommend that you then proceed to read Joan Peter's remarkable account of the region entitled, \\"From Time Immemorial; The Origins Of The Arab-Jewish Conflict Over Palestine\\". Thank you."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Some people conceive of history as written from the top down- a history of rulers, and how their decisions affected society. Others see it from the bottom up- a history of the faceless little people whose decisions in aggregate ultimately drive society. Fromkin's book is the first I've seen which sees history as written from the middle, by the bureaucracy.The book suffers from this perspective in two ways. First, the amount of detail presented is overwhelming. Even in the best-organized work this would be tedious stuff, and this work is not very well organized. The consequences of events or character traits are traced individually throughout the time period, leading to jumps in the narrative and retreading information. The second problem is to separate the wheat from the chaff. Many of the details are interesting, but of little consequence in trying to understand major events. Some of the chaff is obvious- Is it really important to know what articles were written in the Arab Bureau's weekly periodical, and who was copied on it? Other chaff is less obvious. Muhammed Sharif al-Faruqi may have played a funny game going between the British and the Arabs, but would British policy ultimately have been any different if he never defected? From reading the book my guess is no. The British employed him based on prior misconceptions he merely confirmed, and if he hadn't someone else would have done so in his place.The two faults combined make for extremely difficult reading. If I were an expert on Middle Eastern history some of the detail might be more interesting, but as a novice the book seems more like an unnecessary chore."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"One of the best historical accounts I've ever read. Every page is chock full of interesting facts presented in uncomplicated format. I recommend this book as a must read in the classroom and anyone interested in European/Middle Eastern history."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"When I was amassing research in connection with writing my Middle East historical work, &quot;Struggle for the Holy Land,&quot; I found Fromkin's book exceptionally helpful in comprehending the crucial period of the First World War, when the curtain was rung down on Turkey's Ottoman Empire.&quot;A Peace to End All Peace&quot; is a highly readable historical account of the era of T.E. Lawrence and his efforts to secure freedom for the Arab warriors with whom he fought side by side. Fromkin takes us from the battlelines into the government offices of the great powers, where the agreements were drawn up and strategies plotted for the post World War One period.Of great current significance is the valuable information about how the Balfour Declaration issued by the British Government declaring support for an eventual Jewish homeland came into being, along with the various interpretations resulting from its publication. The Paris Peace Conference is also covered in absorbing detail, with Fromkin focusing on the important issues involving the Middle East power structure in the post-war world. Discerning readers will note that the major questons debated remain with us today at the advent of a new millennium."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Fromkin's seminal work is now almost 20 years old, and it is still the essential history book on the bungled making of the modern Middle East. Like another reviewer, I would gladly have given this a 6-star rating if it were possible. So much today remains the very same, save for the change from one imperial power to another. Consider from the Introduction: \\"The European powers at that time believed they could change Moslem Asia in the very fundamentals of its political existence, and in their attempt to do so introduced an artificial state system into the Middle East that has made it into a region of countries that have not become nations even today.\\" On page 451 Fromkin quotes the caution of an American missionary to the woman who, by in large, created Iraq, Gertrude Bell: \\"You are flying in the face of four millenniums of history if you try to draw a line around Iraq and call it a political entity..... they have no conception of nationhood yet.\\"From the perspective of a century, in some ways it is difficult to believe that all this was a sideshow, to use William Shawcross's phrase for Cambodia. The \\"real drama\\" was the Western Front, a subsidiary drama the Eastern Front, and the rise of Communism, and this very distant front was much like Burma during the Second War World, few players with meager resources.Fromkin lays much of the blame for the misunderstandings between the West and the Middle East on Kitchener. In a description true of individuals today, he said of Kitchener: \\"The peculiarities of his character, the deficiencies of his understanding of the Moslem world, the misinformation regularly supplied to him by his lieutenants...... and his choice of Arab politicians....\\"His chapter on the Balfour Declaration is strong; balancing the forces and players at work, and making the oft-forgotten point that the vast majority of the world's Jew's were not Zionists. The book is replete with other ironies, such as a footnoted exchange:\\"... on the Arab question, shows Lord Kitchener asking, \\"Wahabism, does that still exist?\\" and Sykes answering, \\"I think it is a dying fire.\\" So much of the West's impression of Saudi Arabia was initially formed by TE Lawrence, in his half-fictional work \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\\" so Fromkin's confirmation that Lawrence himself cautioned his biographer, Graves, that his work is \\"...full of half-truth here.\\" is a valuable reminder to examine the prism and motives of individuals who write about the Middle East.On page 468, again with an easy substitution, plus ca change.... \\"In fact there was an outside force linked to every one of the outbreaks of violence in the Middle East, but it was the one force whose presence remained invisible to British officialdom. It was Britain herself. In a region of the globe whose inhabitants were known especially to dislike foreigners, and in a predominantly Moslem world which could abide being ruled by almost anybody except non-Moslems, a foreign Christian country ought to have expected to encounter hostility when it attempted to impose its own rule.\\"I agree with some of the criticism of this book: that it is a \\"big man's\\" version of history, and neglects describing broader social forces that motivate the \\"little man\\" and that it is weak on describing the thinking and motivation of the non-European regional players.We can only hope that additional parallels with the present situation will occur, from page 561: \\"By the time that the war came to an end (WW I), British society was generally inclined to reject the idealistic case for imperialism (that it would extend the benefits of advanced civilization to a backward region) as quixotic, and the practical case for it (that it would be a benefit to Britain to expand her empire) as untrue. Viewing imperialism as a costly drain on a society that needed to invest all of its remaining resources in rebuilding itself....\\"This book should be mandatory reading for the next American administration."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book is very entertaining to read, spanning a period of eight crucial years for the Middle East but mainly focused on the tug-of-war between the various factions inside the government of the then dominant power, Britain. Readers who thought that the nation who ran the biggest empire the world has ever seen had a plan for its policy regarding the fate of the Ottoman Empire will be in for a surprise.There were in fact several factions within the then government of Britain driven by their respective narrower interests and prejudices and no overall policy at all. Sounding familiar? As a gesture towards an ally in distress Britain then discards its century-old policy of sustaining the Ottoman Empire but soon finds itself quarreling with all allies about their share of the pie.The locals try to get most out of all the players and are not willing to play by anybody else's rules. The new government wants to cut out all the allies to get all for Britain. A lot of amateurs think they are experts and confuse everybody and in the end there is a war after the war with everyone for himself and all against Britain.Now if this book were not written in 1989 I would suspect that the author really wants to make a point about US policy towards Iraq following the wars of 1991 and 2003. Alas and unfortunately it is not a case of prescience either but the sad fact that in the area of the world known as the Middle East things do not change so much in just a century.While the book makes a gripping read it also has several weaknesses. For instance it is very much focused on the people involved, constantly introducing new characters and telling bits and pieces about their biography and then suddenly losing them. Mark Sykes becomes a center of attention, gets lost and then we learn that he died of flu in 1919. With others it is just assumed that the reader knows their biographies anyway. Maybe a warning on the cover \\"Read Churchill first\\" would be called for.Considering that there is quite an emphasis on German policy towards its ally Turkey we never learn anything about this policy. The same could be said for France. The policy of the Young Turks also is just used as a background for actions taken by some British second-rate-officials but never explained.Overall his is a very interesting and entertaining book, but not a really great one."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This is a lengthy, extremely detailed history of the process by which the Allied Powers divided up the remains of the decaying Ottoman Empire after the First World War. That is the short description. In reality, this is 567 densely-packed pages describing the ebb and flow of wartime politics, tactics, alliances, aspirations and -- most importantly -- commitments. The book therefore provides all the information you need to understand the genesis of the Israel-Palestine conflict as created by incompatible promises to European Zionists, (largely ineffective) Hijazi irregulars and Syrian Arabs. It also covers revolt in Afghanistan, power-plays in post-Shah Iran, the debacle at Gallipoli, the roller-coaster career of Enver Pasha, Bolshevik duplicity in Central Asia, Wilsonian diplomacy ... the list goes on and on. The book is barely limited in chronology and geography, and thus covers immense territory. Fromkin also includes some interesting analysis, as with the Ottoman purchase of warships from London.The author generally seems pro-Israel (or at any rate, not anti-Israel). He never pulls any punches against any western politician, party or power, but seems sympathetic to Churchill, and not as much to Lloyd George.I emphasize the level of detail as both a recommendation and a warning. The book should be an excellent reference (although in places the end notes are too sparse), but it is a slow, difficult read. I am an avid consumer of Middle Eastern history, and a fast reader, and it still took a very long time for me to finish. It's not a problem with writing style or clarity of presentation; there's simply too much here to digest. Accordingly, I do not recommend this book to the casual reader. I do recommend it to students and scholars, but with the cautions noted above."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"I agree 100% with all the other reviewers. This is a well written, informative book, that everyone who wants to have an informed opinion about the middle east should read.On chapter 31 (The New World, p.259) there is a quote from a speech given by T. Woodrow Wilson (then president of the US)on the 4th of July 1918, that caught my attention:\\"The settlement of every question, whether of territory or sovereignty, of economic arrangement, or of political relationship, upon the basis of the free acceptance of that settlement by the people immediately concerned, and not upon the basis of the material interest or advantage of any other nation or people which may desire a different settlement for the sake of its own influence or mastery\\"This speech outlined the Four Ends for which the US and its allies were supposedly fighting. These Four Ends outlined the discrepancies between American and European post war goals. The allies were imperialist countries, and the US were not.No wonder John M. Keynes wrote \\"When president Wilson left Washington he enjoyed a prestige and moral influence throughout the world unequaled in history\\" (chapter 41, p.390). Maybe president Wilson was a bit naive, but the US entered the war with lofty ideals.Makes you wonder what happened to those ideals, doesn't it?Excellent book. Don't hesitate, buy it NOW."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"September 11, 1922: The effective date of the League of Nations' Palestine Mandate that established formal British control over the area that today includes Israel and Jordan. The Mandate was part of the process that attempted to cement Allied (i.e., Western) control over areas lost by the Islamic Ottoman Empire. Coincidence? Probably. But when I first heard of this fact, my curiosity stirred. What was the process that created the modern Middle East; what was the role of the Western Powers; who were the players...and how is all this relevant today?Enter \\"A Peace to End All Peace\\". Written with a novelist's sense of pacing and a historian's eye for detail, David Fromkin lucidly relates the twists and turns that led to the creation of the today's Middle East: the countries of Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. It is essentially a chronological narrative, but it bobs and weaves among the various events of 1914-1922. What could have been a dry recitation of facts is enlivened by many individual sagas -- of larger than life players at the peak of their game (Woodrow Wilson, David Lloyd George); up and comers (Churchill, Lenin, Stalin) and the lesser known British and French bureaucrats who set their countries on a collision course with destiny. The tale of the \\"real\\" Laurence of Arabia is included, as is the astonishing story of how a monkey's bite led to the deaths of a quarter million people -- at least in Churchill's opinion.I do think there are two shortcomings that deserve mentioning. First and foremost, there is precious little linkage to today's Middle East. After spending so much time learning about the creation of these new countries and their rulers (many of whom were essentially handpicked by the British), I was disappointed that there was no summary of what had happened in subsequent years. That is not to say that today's relevance of 1914-1922 can not be deduced; only that Fromkin leaves it to the reader to fill in the blanks. A smaller fault is that many of the goings-on at the League of Nations - including the development of the boundaries and the mandates - occur off stage.Bernard Lewis, the famed Middle East scholar at Princeton, has remarked that leaders of Islamic countries (or movements) often use historical allusions with confidence because of the shared long-view of history known to most in the Muslim world. It's safe to say many in the West (I include myself) are not as well versed on the history of the region. \\"A Peace to End All Peace\\" is a rewarding way to catch up."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Fromkin is to be commended for a compilation of historical facts in great detail and thoroughness that I can only envy. This book must have been a great burden to assemble, and the facts that Fromkin has detailed, and put into much better perspective than most of his fellow historians of the period, are very important to understand his title of \\"The Peace to End all Peace\\". Some of the best sections deal with the trade-offs of the various governments after WW I who were exhausted and in financial ruin, or who just abandoned their greater responsibilities, like the USA. The whole issue of the \\"Jewish Conspiracy\\" of the Bolshevik revolution, anti-Semitism, Zionism, is dealt with in a very open and refreshing way.But the problem with most of these books, whether it is Macmillan's \\"1919\\", or Kagan's \\"On the Origins of War\\", and other extraordinarily well researched and wonderful books is that they seem to be writing for an audience of their fellow academics and fail to understand the need for modern day historians to place history into proper perspective. I shouldn't pick on Fromkin because he is no more guilty of this than the hundreds of other authors of similar books, but after reading this wonderful book, I felt the same way I do two hours after a totally filling Chinese meal at my favorite restaurant across the street from my home. I'm hungry again. The essential conundrum that this book details is that the Balfour Declaration has set in place a situation where we have had, and probably will have, perpetual war in the Middle East. This conflict has now expanded all around the world, from the World Trade Center, Bali, Madrid, Kenya, Tanzania, etc and the dilemma for Western society is whether to abandon Israel and the Zionist dream in hopes that the Islamist fanatics will go back into their caves, or whether mankind can advance in an area which Islam has held the power for well over a millennium. Fromkin completely skates around this issue. While I am sure there is some lunchroom or annual convention somewhere where a bunch of academics who live their lives in minutia give points to the author of the book with the most extensive bibliography, they really fail the greater society in producing studies of historical value that places things such as WW I, the fall of the Ottoman Empire (or any other empire) in perspective. While they may argue that such was not the purpose of their book, in fact, much of history is an indictment of human nature to have to relive history over and over again. Historians need to get out of their shell and recognize the forest for the trees. If their works are to have any real value at all, it must be that they are written to advance mankind and not have us read such books and observe how foolish our ancestors were. We know that. What a historian needs to do to be relevant is show us the common threads of the past so that we can avoid that path in the future. The fall of the Ottoman, Hapsburg, and other empires is really no different that that of Rome, the Greeks, the Tatars and the Khans, but seldom do you read a book that shows just how much of a treadmill this is for mankind. Churchill stood alone against the Nazis while the USA slept, and Bush if fighting the same ostriches who think that the Islamist fascists are somehow different, but on one connects the dots. If you want to read a book that shows what an extraordinary scholar Fromkin is, and he is, this is a great book to read, even though it will take a long time to do so. If you want to read something that lifts you past the compilation of facts and details of the past and gives you something to think about how to shape the future so that we don't have to keep going \\"one step forward and two steps back\\", I recommend Harris' \\"Civilization and its Enemies\\" book as a much better use of your time."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This is an absolutely first-rate history book: it covers the complexity without simplification, yet tells a riveting story with a huge cast of larger than life characters (Churchill, Ataturk, Lenin, Lawrence of Arabia, and many others). It is also superlatively written.The book begins with the machinations leading up to the Great War. The Ottoman Empire - in decline for over 300 years, yet a useful \\"buffer\\" for the Western powers against the Russian Empire in the \\"Great Game\\" - is finally coming apart with the rise of the western-minded \\"young Turks.\\" That means that it is finally collapsing and Britain and France must decide whether to continue to prop up its vast territorial holdings or to nakedly seek to carve up its territories for the benefit of their own empires. France coveted Syria and Lebanon, GB the rest. In the end, it is what they got.Once the Great War began, however, the Turks allied themselves with the Germans, for which CHurchill was unjustly blamed (he confiscated two destroyers that Britain's shipyards had just manufactured for the Turks). This led directly to the catastrophically mismanaged invasion of the Dardanelles, in a bid to end the War by pushing a wedge into the Germanic coalition from the South, again Churchill's idea. (Amazingly, the collapse of Bulgaria was what finally ended WWI 4 years later, as the allies entered the gap). As the Turks rallied, the allies turned to making alliances with the Arabs and others under loose Turkish suzerainty.The greatest accomplishment of the book is to dissect the mentality of British policymakers, which by today's standards was almost ghoulishly primitive. First, they had a 19C colonialist bias, which meant that they were by nature destined to rule the \\"brown\\" races, from India to Arabia, for their own good. WHile there was much strategic calculation, such as guarding the Suez canal for freighter traffic, it was principally to maintain the glory of the British Empire as conceived under Queen Victoria. Second, they utterly lacked basic knowledge of not just the Turks, but also the Arabs and Zionists. For example, beyond sensationalist and romantic travel literature, the only available source to understand the Turk was a history written in the 18C! Few of the aristocratic elite spoke any of the languages and most were openly racist and anti-semitic. Third, there were conspiracy theories that would appear absolutely lunatic today (to paraphrase Fromkin). Thus, there were top policymakers who actually believed that Jews controlled not just the young Turks, but also the emerging Bolshievics and even the German Kaiser's inner circle!This ignorance and arrogant disregard for other points of view would be laughable were they not responsible for the decisions that set up the system of shakey nation states we see today in the Middle East. To cultivate the non-existent Jewish cabal, the Brits came up with the Balfour Declaration, which recognized the validity of a zionist state. (Interestingly, like many fundamentalists today, this support gained indispensable credence because a state of Jews in Palestine was a Biblical prerequisite for Armageddon and the assumed ascension of Christians to paradise.) In addition, the Brits designated several families, including the Hashemites - Aristocrats chosen first by the Turks and educated in the Harem of the Sublime Port - as a way to gain control over all Arabs tribes as they believed they would obey the dictates of the highest religious authority. Once the Brits chose these people, they were stuck with them, which was how the new states eventually were established.As the War came to an end, GB and France - now distrustful of eachothers' imperial ambitions to the point that they almost went to war! - were unable to devote attention and resources to nationbuilding, though this did not stop them from setting up what were supposed to become modern states in places that knew neither secular politics nor any sense of national purpose. They just installed people they hoped they could trust (read \\"control\\"), which explains who became leaders of what petty kingdoms at that time. Many, though not all of them are still there and almost completely lack political legitimacy over vast territories that were governed by independent tribes under a loose Turkish confederation. It is no wonder that these artificial constructs are so unstable, mixing peoples with modern weaponry and infrastructure who for centuries were isolated and divided by religion, ethnicity, and power politics. The new leaders and their subjects had little idea how to wield the tools of the modern state, while nascent nationalisms were undermining the western empires.This is the story of the greatest watershed of the 20C: sowing the seeds of the end of western domination as the impulse grew in colonial peoples to govern themselves. Not only did Turkey reinvent itself, but the Soviet Union was born, and the western powers (with the exception of the US) had squandered their human and financial resources catastrophically. Amazingly, what was going on in the Middle East at that time was seen as a backwater sideshow: virtually no one recognized the magnitude of change that was unleashed.If there is any failing of the book, it is its less diligent effort to penetrate the minds of the Arabs and Turks. The author brilliantly delineates the moribund reasoning from within the 19C western empires, but does not explain what the powerful indigenous peoples were thinking and feeling.Warmly recommended. This is one of the best history books I have read in years."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"For me, this was a hard book to read without context. When I first grabbed it 7 years ago, I put it down after 50 pages. When I picked it up last month after having read more on the history of the region, I could not put it down. For anyone with an interest in Middle Eastern History, the book is fascinating and has some truly &quot;truth is stranger than fiction&quot; nuggets. The events surrounding Turkey's entry into the first world war, the story (myth) of T.E. Laurance, and the Dardenelles fiasco all translate into great stories and when viewed in detail serve to reiterate the idea that history is a chain of blunders rather than any kind of coherent conspiracy.The author's clear anti-British bias, not undeserved mind you, does detract a little but only because such tales stand best on their own without sarcasm. One thing that was missing, which I like to see in a book like this, is a better indication of the author's credentials or motivations."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"I would have given this book six stars. A facinating read, leaving me to wonder why we ever thought we could succeed in immediate and radical change? Sadly, I supported GW!"},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"The last 2 chapters were disappointing.In the last one he makes a quick 10 page conclusion of everything, that I thought was just poor;I have a feeling he had a deadline to meet and those last 10 pages he regurgitated the night before it was due.All in all,it was interesting, but very, very dense. I would say university history class level.I would say that I know more now on the history than I did before, but there was such a huge mass of information that you really need to stick to this book and not stop for too long or you'll just forget everything.Despite the poor conclusion, he did say something interesting there:Basically he said that the current system was never meant for Arabia.The Europeans had concurred the world, and the last place to concur was the Middle East.They had concurred America, north and south,Australia, New Zealand, east Asia, Africa...Everything was colonized by them.They believed in this secular nation-state, which worked in Europe, but had never been introduced to the Middle East.First Islam conquered the whole area, andthen the ottomans took over for 700 years.Also, the fact that all the leaders were put in place by the English and French meant that the local people had no faith in their politicians, and didn't understand their borders.For example, the Saudi-Jordanian border is the site of where Ibn Saud tried to invade what is now Jordan,but Jordan had king Abdullah, put in place by the English, so the English sent airplanes and tanks and armored vehicles and massacred Ibn Saud's bedouins.They did this to save face. They could not have their puppet being killed or crushed. It would simply make the Brits look weak.The site of that battle became the border of Jordan and Saudi Arabia:hence the names, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.Basically 2 local dynastic tribal leaders tried to adapt to this European idea of nation-states and took their areas of control and turned them into countries.So basically what I think he was trying to say in his conclusion was that that form of government was never meant for the Middle East and won't last long.He was saying that the Europeans underestimated the only unifying factor in Arabia, which was Islam.They would never have believed that a bunch of wahhabi bedouins could invade the hejaz, or that the muslim brotherhood would be so strong today, or the Afghani mujahedeen, or the shia revolution in Iran...He also said that it was like Europe in the 5th centurythe roman empire crumbled and then Europe spent 1000 years warring against each other trying to find a comfortable solution, and it evolved this idea of secular nation states.Anyway, I came off with the feeling that the English and the French screwed up everything, and have the blood of millions of deaths on their hands, and that the countries that exist today are sad jokes.The whole area was part of GreaterSyria for 2 weeks. All the Arabs there united under 1 government right in between Egypt and Iran.And I think that's how it should end one day.So to summarize:Pros:Good book.DenseWell researchedCons:As one reviewer mentioned, too euro-centric for a book about the Middle-East.The part on Ibn Saud taking the Hejaz and naming himself king, for example, was about 2 pages long!Also, he seems to quickly mention things that were of utmost importance, such as Ibn Saud collecting vast amounts of money from the British. He does not connect the dots here, because what this means is that Ibn Saud would have had little money to pay his troops and to buy weapons if the British had not payed him off as handsomely as they did, and hence, the world would not know a Wahhabi Saudi Kingdom in control of Islam's two holiest cities. And that, is something worth a chapter or two."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"I purchased this book several years ago.

It moves in a chaotic 1-step forward 2 steps back pattern. It is difficult to extract the main themes. The author did not exercise coherent synthesis of the main facts. The author overwhelms with so much details; it is challenging to distinguish trivia from turning points. I read most books in a week. It took me six to read this one. To make sense of it, I wrote 44 pages of notes and did research the main treaties on the Wikipedia website. I recommend this book only to readers with an intense interest and academic knowledge of the subject. Without these assets, finishing and making sense of this book will be most challenging.In few words here is what I got. Britain was the main player regarding the 1914 to 1922 period of ongoing conflicts with the Ottoman Empire. But, during this time it experienced the turnover of three different governments who had radically different views about the break up of the Ottoman Empire. In the first period, 1914 to 1916, Britain's objective was to reign in the advance from Russia that was pressing southward through Afghanistan. Britain's concern was to maintain the safety of its vulnerable trading route through the Middle East to India. To do so, Britain was willing to grant significant territories to France (Sykes - Picot Agreement of 1916), to create a buffer against further Russian expansion. By 1918, a change in government results in a change in foreign policy. Britain's goal now is its hegemony over how much of the Ottoman territory it can claim. This caused Britain to renege on the Sykes - Picot Agreement, and experience continued diplomatic tension with France, especially regarding who will occupy Syria. In the later stage (1920 to 1922), Britain suffered from imperial overstretch. It did not have the resources to hang on to the territories it claimed just a couple of years ago. It becomes clear that the British Mandates over Middle Eastern territories will be a difficult and costly experience. Also, the public and British press are dead set against Britain's Middle Eastern occupation.The British Government supported Zionism for a couple of reasons. First, early in the War the Government believed that the Jews may well support the Central Powers if Germany steps to the plate first in its support of Zionism. Thus, the Brits viewed it as a race to gain the support of the Jewish community both in Europe and the U.S. by offering their political support of the Zionist cause (Balfour Declaration of 1917 is a late stage confirmation of British support). Later, Britain, and more particularly Churchill strongly supported Zionism for another perceived threat. And, that is that Jews would emigrate and join Bolshevik Russia. From Britain's perspective, it was far more advantageous to promote Jewish emigration to Palestine, then watch Jewish emigration swell the Bolshevik ranks. Ironically, Churchill did the most to undermine Zionism, by promoting the cutting off 75% of Palestine territory (Transjordan), which became Jordan, an independent country who rejected Palestinian refugees just as egregiously as the future state of Israel.What is clear is that the restructuring of the Ottoman Empire into the modern Middle East was a chaotic process. During the 1914 - 1922 period, it was dominated by a dozen conflicting treaties between different countries. The most notorious was the Sykes - Picot Agreement between France and Britain, which was signed in 1916 in secret two full years before the end of the War. This Agreement was agreed, and rebutted by Britain so many times; it gets your head spinning. However, it seemed that its terms directionally prevailed when the Middle Eastern Mandates were offered by the League of Nations to France and Britain.This period caused incredible economic stress on many countries. Both Russia and Turkey experienced food shortages and increase in prices of over 1,000% between the beginning and end of the War. Britain experienced a severe economic crisis that caused it to become increasingly dependent on American capital.The Ottoman Empire was in a self-destructing state way before the War. It was also actively split during the War since the Turks joined the Germans, and most of the Arab areas joined Britain (associated with the stories and tales of Lawrence of Arabia).There were no right or wrong ways to create the various countries. Given communities of Sunnis, Shiites, Wahabists, Kurds who do not cohabitate well, either you respected the various groups separate identities. This would engender inter State wars. Or, you would create states with a mix of these different communities. And, that would create civil unrest and wars. The Middle East has experienced its fair share of both types of conflicts.The author interestingly concludes that the ongoing formation of the different Middle Eastern governments is a process that may last over a millennium. He compares the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and the onset of the formation of various Middle Eastern governments to the dissolution of the Roman Empire in the fourth century, and the ultimate crystallization of West European governments after WWII, or over a millennium and a half later."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"While this is a very good start in understanding those 6-8 years that decided the fate of the Middle East, I believe the book fell short in giving me a complete picture. Lots of the details pertain to battles, and while sometimes relevant, it felt too much like a typical military book and not the geopolitical history I was expecting. The most glaring fault, as I see it, is that Fromkin almost entirely relies on British sources of information. That's not to say he's pro-British--he's quite critical of the British. It's just that it would have been nice to hear about, to give just one context, treaty negotiations using memoirs and material from the French, Russian, German, Ottoman and Arab sides. Instead, all we get are the Brits. The book should really be prefaced as a history of Britain and the Middle East and not so all-encompassing that the jacket makes the book out to be. BUT, I think people interested in this part of world history, will still get much out of it."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Very detailed (a bit much for the general reader) but well-written history of the formation of the \\"modern\\" Middle East. Even though this history was written prior to Desert Storm I, it's amazing to see the parallels between what was going on in the early 1900s and what is happening nearly 100 years later."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"With the current crisis in the mid-East, I've been trying to get more of a historical understanding. This book is excellent at providing the foundations of the dispute. Fromkin explains what the Ottoman Empire was and how the countries we now know and accept were, just 100 years ago, little more than descriptive terms for areas on a map. It's also fascinating to be reminded that just 100 years ago the British, French and Russians still lived with the mindset that they should control the areas of the middle east and that any &quot;independence&quot; need not be anything more than nominal. Of course, the book's most illustrative point is that the strategy of almost every player in the Mid-East, from the Brits, to the French, to the Arabs, was based on ignorance and arrogance."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This books uses a wealth of material, including some that is newly discovered, to detail how the western powers divided up the Middle East at the end of WWI.Besides insight into the decisions that created modern disputes over boundaries there is much more. It gives insight into the causes of both WWI and WWII, the Russian revolution, the Ottoman empire, the British Empire, Winston Churchill, Zionism and much more. The area is too complex for a single book to untangle the relationships, but this book is essential to begin the task."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book is actual history. There is little agenda or argument that does not rise directly out of the facts presented. Only the introduction and the conclusion put forth speculation as to cause and effect. Given that, this book is likely too detailed for many, but the personalities of Churchill, Lloyd George, Ener, Talaat, Kitchener, Sykes, T.E. Lawrence are drawn through their documented action, and the history really moves. It's a fascinating story and essential as the details of WWI are not as clearly understood as are those of WWII. However, this book seems to suggest the opposite of its stated case. It turns out that the Middle East lands were largely ignored prior to WWI, and without the knowledge of or appetite for oil, it is easy to understand why.If nationalism caused problems, it is more due to the ability to organize large war machines rather than by the fact that the lines were poorly drawn. It is fascinating the way that racism and biggotry shaped European policy, but it is tough to say that it caused any real ill effects that would not have been caused by an \\"Enlightened\\" 21st century government.I would put forth that a nation's lines cannot be drawn. They are a result of thousands of years of war and culture. There were no real nations in the Middle East before this period, perhaps kingdoms and tribes. We are still in the period of those nations forming, perhaps for centuries. The new element is the oil, but it will probably be gone before the lines become permanent.Oh, great book, gives you an idea of what research can achieve."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book is not for beginners, and I confess I was one when I started reading this book. I was totally unfamiliar with this era of history and this region much less this era in this region, but I ran across the book browsing through Amazon and the title and reputation pulled me in. I'm glad I put in the effort, but it was slow going at times, so many names and conspiracies and machinations, rather amusing at times, hard to believe, if not so true and tragic. It's amazing how much we don't know what we're doing when we're doing it, even with the best? of intentions, and the events described in this book attest to that."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"As a Grade 11 student of history and current affairs, particularly on the Middle East, reading David Fromkin's A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East was fascinating. Despite its 500 pages, the book held my interest throughout. Mr Fromkin manages to transport us into the start of the last century, give color to the politics and personalities, and depict a colorful tapestry of the cross currents of that time.What stands out are the massive implications and resultant upheavals borne out of the sometimes trivial decision making processes and relatively nave decision-makers. The childish internal scuffling and petty politics in the top echelons of the British Government was an eye-opener.Though he remains highly complimentary of Winston Churchill, Fromkin also shatters some of the myths of Winston Churchill's so-called \\"prescience\\". The author also deals in needless detail about al-Faruqi, but does not really address his authenticity. I also found his comments on Kemal Ataturk to be ungrudgingly positive.In addition, I was unable to get a feel of the economic and social backdrop of the time. Despite sometimes missing the forest because of such a detailed view of the trees, I recommend the book."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"World War I was a profound cataclysm for much of the world. In some places, its effects were merely monumental, but in others, its consequences were so great that we are only now beginning to deal with them. World War I may have changed the face of Europe dramatically, but it completely remade the face of the Middle East. And that remaking has had profound aftereffects--virtually every major problem in that region (from the insurgency in Iraq, to the Israli-Palestinian conflict, to the struggle for the soul of Saudi Arabia) has roots in this book's subject, the death of the Ottoman Empire and the birth of the modern Middle East.In this excellent history, which is comprehensive but still compelling, stimulating but still scholarly, David Fromkin tracks that birth, deftly illuminating its causes and hinting at its consequences. His book looks in great detail at the initial phases of the war, showing how British and French diplomats and soldiers dealt with a region that initially appeared to be nothing but a backwater. This history looks behind the \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" myths to show with much greater accuracy how the British and French contributed to the dismantling of the Ottoman Empire. And it illustrates what appears now to have been the true high-water mark of European colonialism--the drawing of Middle Eastern borders and the creation of Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Israel by British and French burecrats.Rare indeed are the opportunities to seize the reins of history and lead it in an altogether new and better direction. The British and French had such an opportunity after World War I, and they bungled it badly, creating nations without regard for ethnic or political distinctions, nations without any real reason for being, except to serve as thrones for the Hashemites who had helped the British and French defeat the Turks but who ended up being driven out of Saudi Arabia by Ibn Saud. Ever wonder why Iraq is such a motley and volatile mix of Shi'ite, Sunni and Kurd? Or why Jordan, Syria and Iraq have borders that don't really follow any geographic or ethnic lines? Read this book, and you'll understand, and weep.It's not a completely perfect study--while Fromkin generally does a good job walking the tightrope between readability and accuracy, at times the book slows down under the weight of all the facts he provides. Also, he understands and conveys the machinations of the British and French burecrats somewhat better than he does with the various Arabs and Turks who played a role in these events. Lastly, Fromkin perhaps doesn't give some events (the Armenian Massacre, for instance) enough play. But don't let those relatively minor flaws stop you--this is as good a work as has ever been written on its subject, and it's unlikely a better and more comprehensive one will ever appear.A history professor once told me that World War I was the most important single event in Middle Eastern history since Mohammed. After reading this book, I understood why."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book is an invaluable guide to the roots of today's trouble in the Middle East. It began with a careless and ignorant imposition of the imperial vision of a European Imperial vision on the Middle East after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. This book explores much the development and implementation of that vision between 1914 and 1922 which was based on much misunderstanding by the British and the French. It goes into the role of T.E. Lawrence(yes the so called &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;), Winston Churchill, and many others. Fromkin demonstrates that the problems in the Middle East have deep historical roots that are not going to yield to quick fixes offered by anyone."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"'A Peace to End All Peace' is history as it should be written - epic in scope, scrupulous in the use of sources, careful in analysis and effortless in prose. It is the story of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, and of the birth of the Modern Middle East from its ashes. It tells of the rise of nationalism, of the clashes of armies, and of the power of ideologies. Mostly, it is the story of how the great statesmen, in ignorance and folly, with motives which professed to be pure but usually weren't, accidentally created the Middle East we know and hate today.With the outbreak of the Great War, the status quo antebellum in the Middle East was shattered. Until the war, British policy was to use the nations of the Middle East (although they didn't know it by that name) as a barrier against expansionist Czarist Russia, which, in the four hundred years leading to the war has expanded in a rate of 50 square miles a day (p. 475). The British main interest was to keep the Ottoman Empire existing. Although situation in the Empire changed a little with the rise of Nationalism, Zionism, and especially the Young Turks movement, the European policy has not quite changed. Indeed, as the war was breaking out, the Ottoman Empire was seen as a state of no importance, and the British continually underestimated it, in a sequence of errors which brought the Empire into the war on the German side, and which culminated in the Gallipoli fiasco.Yet as the war progressed, British officials started to change their view. Great confusion and indecision characterized British decision making, torn between those who saw the East as the key to victory in the war (Lloyd George), those who saw it as a distraction of no importance (Lord Kitchener), and the various bureaucracies who battled for control, power and prestige, while supporting two different and opposing factions in Arabia - King Hussein of Mecca and Wahabbi leader Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud.Increasingly, the British saw the key to the Middle East policy in an upcoming Arab Rebellion, headed by King Hussein. In reality, Hussein held little more power then any other Emir in Arabia, and whatever troops he had were bought with British gold. When his rebellion finally came, it hardly affected the outcome of the war, and whatever aid it did give came primarily because of the Gold and influence of T.E. Lawrence on Hussein's son Feisal.The reality had little effect on British policy makers, and particularly on Mark Sykes, the maverick amateur who negotiated the unworkable agreement with the French on partitioning the Middle East between the two powers. Almost before the ink dried on the Sykes-Pico agreements, however, British officials, both in Cairo and in London, started to undermine the agreement, wishing to give no real independence to the Arabs and make as few concessions as necessary to the French.Things became increasingly complicated as the British became aware of the Zionist claim to Palestine, while Czarist Russia fell and America entered the war on an idealistic but unrealistic platform of independence to the minor nations. As the war came to an end and the negotiations in Paris started, Lloyd George's government wrestled with its conflicting pledges, the situation in the Middle East which it barely understood, and the increasingly anti-Imperialist feeling at Home. The Result was a mess, as the British alienated all of her friends (the Arabs by not granting them real independence, the Turks by supporting Greek occupation of Smyrna, the French by opposing its own colonialist designs in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, and America by continuing the imperialist plan with a new Rhetoric), and had to fight uprisings throughout the Middle East with a dwindling force, due to the lack of support for the imperialist efforts at home.What David Fromkin calls the Settlement of 1922, with the Middle East in boarders more or less as they are today, with new Units such as Palestine (now Israel), Syria, Trans-Jordan and Lebanon in place, was brought more by exhaustion then by the will of the Foreign (Primarily British) statesmen who shaped it. By the end of the War, Fromkin writes \\"British Society was generally inclined to reject the idealistic case for imperialism (that it would extend the benefits of advanced civilization to a backward region) as quixotic, and the practical case for it (that it would benefit Britain to expend her empire) as untrue.\\" (p. 561)... Britain's Empire, though greater than it has ever been, was no longer feasible, and the Imperialist design for the Middle East, planned in the middle of the War and imposed after it, unworkable. \\"British policy-makers imposed a settlement upon the Middle East in 1922 in which, for the most part, they themselves no longer believed\\"(p. 563, italics in the original).The most astonishing theme of the book is the utter ignorance of the decision makers, primarily in London, but also in Cairo, Mecca, Berlin and Washington. \\"Lloyd George, who o kept demanding that Britain should rule Palestine from (in the biblical phrase) Dan to Beersheba, did not know where Dan was. He searched for it in a nineteenth-century Biblical atlas, but it was not until nearly a year after the armistice that General Allenby was able to report to him that Dan has been located and, as it was not where the Prime Minister wanted it to be, Britain asked for a boundary further North.'A Peace to End All Peace' gives a fascinating and disturbing portrait of WW1 decision makers. One can only hope that our leaders today are better informed."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book is extremely detailed and one may need to read it twice before fully understanding and grasping the issues. It is well worth your time. There are only few books that lay out in such details the origins of the Middle east. It also clearly shows that the British outdated foreign policy has proved to be disastrous 50-70 years later."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"David Fromkin gives his readers a sweeping account of the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the birth of the contemporary Middle East, defined as Egypt, Israel, Iran, Turkey, the Arab states of Asia, Central Asia and Afghanistan (pg. 16).Fromkin mainly focuses on the decision-making process of Europeans and Americans who, between 1914 and 1922, determined the fate of the region without any input of its inhabitants (pg. 17, 400). The area that the much-diminished, anachronistic Ottoman Empire occupied in 1914 was one of the few territories that the European empires had not yet shared among themselves (pg. 24, 32). The European powers did not wait for the fall of the Ottomans before arguing about their respective zones of influence in the region after the war. Statesmen such as Lloyd George, Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Kitchener, T.E. Lawrence, Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin played leading roles in re-shaping the region. Winston Churchill - at times unintentionally - had the most enduring impact on its cartography (pg. 19, 25, 73, 385-388, 493-529, 558-567).After losing the patronage of Britain against Russia, the weakened Ottoman Empire, anxious to pursue its modernization while living in fear of Western powers' designs, convinced Germany to become its partner in 1914 (pg. 33-50, 75, 142). Fromkin convincingly demonstrates that Churchill was not to blame for pushing Turkey into the arms of Germany (pg. 54-76). Britain and allied powers believed that the Ottoman war would be a sideshow that could be easily managed (pg. 83, 115, 119-123) but they were repeatedly proven wrong (pg. 200-203, 215, 248, 289, 301).The poorly executed attack on Turkey at the Dardanelles could have considerably shortened the duration of the war (pg. 127, 264). Churchill was the scapegoat for the fiasco and was demoted within the government (pg. 128, 154, 159, 161-162, 233). After resigning and spending a few months in the wilderness, Churchill, who was perceived as dangerous across the board, was brought back to the government at the insistence of Lloyd George, the new British Prime Minister (pg. 166, 234, 265-266).Kitchener and his Lieutenants acting on his behalf in British Cairo imposed their design on government's policy towards the Middle East at the expense of the India Office (pg. 88-95, 106-110). Britain would rule the region indirectly after the fall of the Ottoman Empire (pg. 85). Like the French, Kitchener and his men wrongly assumed that the Moslem Middle East would be glad to be ruled by Christians (pg. 93-94, 102, 106). The British looked at Hussein, the Sherif of Mecca and its Emir, as the ideal candidate for the position of \\"Pope\\" of Islam (pg. 105). The British leadership wrongly believed that Islam was a single entity and that temporal and spiritual authority could be easily split (pg. 96, 104).The Arabs misled the Allies about their true strength to fight the Ottoman Empire. This cost Britain dearly because their core competency was only guerilla warfare against the Turks, until the capture of Jerusalem (pg. 186-187, 219-222, 309, 313, 377-378, 396). Over time, the British became disillusioned with Hussein. However, they supported two of his sons in the fulfillment of their ambitions (pg. 326-329, 506-512).Britain entered into negotiations with France, Russia, and later Italy that ultimately resulted in the cursed Sykes-Picot-Sazanov agreement and other secret treaty understandings to share the spoils of victory in the Middle East (pg. 189-199, 267, 287, 330, 334-335, 342-344, 373-379, 391-402). The Allies had no intention to pay the price Hussein demanded for his support to the allied cause (pg. 186, 227); only lip service was paid in the field to the nominal pro-Arab independence policies of London during and after WWI (pg. 325, 345). The French and Russians showed similar contempt for Arab and Islamic aspirations of independence in the Middle East in the same period (pg. 378, 435-440, 463-490).Much to their dismay, the Americans discovered the existence of all the secret arrangements of the Allies to partition the region after the overthrow of Tsarist Russia in 1917. As Colonel House and Arthur Balfour presciently remarked, these imperialistic arrangements were sowing the seeds of future wars in the region (pg. 257, 400). Similarly, President Wilson predicted that peace would be illusory if its terms were not basically fair to all sides (pg. 399).To the surprise of some 21st century observers, British leaders in London first anticipated no negative reaction against the Balfour Declaration from their Arab Allies. Like some prominent Jews, they believed that there was no essential incompatibility between the Arab and Zionist ideals (pg. 283, 321, 324, 444, 519-520, 527). British leaders had seen France as their only obstacle (pg. 292-293, 297). The local British administration was to some extent supporting Arab violence against Jewish settlements. They sowed doubts about the feasibility of a Jewish homeland cut out of Palestine that was encompassing present Jordan, in the minds of some enthusiastic pro-Zionists (pg. 445-448, 504-505, 513-529). The uncompromising position of Amin-al-Husseini and his successors greatly harmed the Palestinian cause (pg. 517-518).Iraq was another British creation that has not shown much stability since its beginnings in the 1920s. The recently terminated Sunni Arab dominance over the other population groups has cast a long shadow over the inter-ethnic relationships in this fragile country (pg. 449-454, 503-506).Similarly, the French did not fully realize the risks when they carved Lebanon out of Syria and put the Maronite minority in charge of the new country. The marginalization of the predominantly Muslim population eventually led to the civil war in the 1970s and 1980s and later on to the ineffectual \\"syrianization\\" of Lebanon (pg. 17, 439).Fromkin's book remains as relevant as ever to persons committed to the prosperity of the Middle East."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book goes a long way in explaining the difficult situation we have now in the middle east. I am a veteran of Iraqi freedom and wish some of our leaders would have read this book....maybe they will if they read this review. It is really detailed and it took me a few weeks to get through it but it is worth the effort."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book of the late 80's could threaten to be, to the alarmed reader looking the date of its writting, an obsolete piece of scholarship as far as so many things have happened in Middle East since that date, but it is all the contrary. The esential thesis by Fromkin -or better said, conclusion- of being Middle East a zone where religious and sociological particularities makes of it refractary to western kind of state has been, to date, fully reafirmed. The narrative is less theoretical than purely historical, though; it tell us how the specific endeavours compounded of good and bad ideas, administrative and political confusion and/or change in UK elite beetwen 1914-1922 happened and how THAT special mess of artificial countries and very real conflicts was fulfilled, BUT also show clearly that any other path of reconstruction of the zone outside the already fallen Otoman Enpire was equally comdemned to doom. The books also show in the middle of all that the question of arab-jew relationship and somehow permeates us with a sad sense that a conflict was anyway unavaoidable. A great, lucid book."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"The origin's of the Middle East's hostility to the west is often referenced back to the fall of the Ottoman Empire and World War I, this book by Fromkin provides all the details and give you a total appreciation for the global political situation involving all the countries at war and their alliances that crave and carve up the Middle East, creating the countries of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria, Jordan and Palestine (Now Israel). England is the major architect of the post WWI changes in the Middle East and the book is dominated by the Prime Ministers of England notably Lloyd George at the latter end of the war and by Churchill who later tries to reduce England's tremendous military responsibilities that are put to great strains by the end of the war. Of course Turkey is the other great center piece of the book and their own political changes starting with the Young Turks and their virtual eclipse of the Sultan who ruled the empire and the emergence of the military strongman Kemal who after the war is lost, rallies his countrymen against victors who try to claim the spoils of victory notably the British and Greeks. Within all this is the roles of France, who want Lebanon but Syria, Germany', and their alliance with Turkey and later Russia, and Russia whose quitting of the war starts an imbalance between the pre-war alliances. The Bolsheviks accession to power also does not negate Russia's continuous desire to expand and actually becomes more of a challenge as they have a secret treaty of support for Germany and expand into weakened countries on their border. In the midst of these activities is England's leading role in taking over responsibilities for countries in the Middle East by supporting kings such as the Hussiens and the Sauds to hopefully become client states or members of the Commonwealth. Also, incorporated in these complexities is the Balfour Declaration that provides a homeland for Zionist Jews. There are notable splits between Jews in Palestine (Israel) that initially support Turkey and then those that support the Western Alliance such as the Jewish legion. Later, after the war, two of the Jewish leaders in Israel split over what the borders of Israel should be and today that is still in dispute from the seeds of this split over 80 years ago. Other that is complicating these issues are George's under the table manipulation to have greater control at the expense of his allies notably France, his failed support of Greece against Turkey and the desire of the Arab countries to become independent and England's failed attempt to manipulate Muslim leaders for political purposes. Every major character in the Middle East is covered in the book from Lawrence of Arabia to the leaders of the Arab countries, France, Turkey, Russia, Germany, Italy and England in great detail. From reading this book you can see how the victor attempted to carve up the world around them that has its parallel in the aftermath of WWII. And of course oil is already an economic and political entity almost 100 years ago. The only thing I would add to this book is a glossary for all the major characters as a reference for this readable book of 567 pages. After reading this book, you will have a greater understanding of how the Middle East resents the west and any occupation no matter temporary as well as the fact that to conquer a country does not mean its easy to occupy."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"The previous reviewer is, alas, the one spouting the nonesense! Israel only exists because of the decisions of Lloyd George and Churchill in 1918-1921: the creation of Israel in 1948 was the cumulation of a process that began with the British capture of Jerusalem from the Ottoman Empire in 1917, as Fromkin's book brilliantly and conclusively shows.

The soon-to-be victorious European powers were already well down the road to carving up the remains of the fallen Ottoman Empire.Without exaggeration, it is impossible to understand 'the modern Middle East' without at least a cursory knowledge of how that region was named and claimed in the first two decades of the twentieth century.George W. Bush's America and Tony Blair's Britain are not the first to find themselves enmeshed in complex strategies for taming, reigning, or owning in the Levant and on the shores of the Tigris and Euphrates. It is a colonial and imperial habit, an observation I make with some sympathy for those who excercise the burden of power in a world where power is welcomed only selectively.Fromkin is at his best on the Balfour Declaration and its genesis of expectations and facts on the ground that were inherently irreconcilable, to the grief of too many Arabs - not all of them Palestinians - and Israelis to this day.A Peace to End All Peace would make good reading beside T.E. Lawrence's (Lawrence of Arabia's) The Seven Pillars of Wisdom and - for the more daring reader, E. Said's Orientalism.It's also savory and nutritious on its own."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"It's a bit spooky to read this account of events in the Middle East during the decade that bracketed World War, while the occupation and rebuilding of post-Saddam Iraq is unfolding. The parallels (both good and not-so-good) are fascinating, almost to the point where one could substitute current names like Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz and Condoleeza Rice for Lord Kitchener, Lord Asquith and Sir Mark Sykes.More than one scholar has suggested that this work from David Fromkin is a must-read for anyone wanting to understand the roots of the politics and current animosities of the Middle East. I'm no scholar, but I can't imagine another source that could provide a better accounts of the events and personalities from 90 years ago that have shaped (and often misshaped) the most problematic region of the world. The movie &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; may have been cinema at it's best; but it was also history at it's most trivial. This is the real history, laced with context and the full implications of each development.Fromkin relates in fascinating detail the various acts of hubris, misdirection, treachery, imperialism, nation building, cowardice and more that shaped the arbitrary borders and ruling classes of today's Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Iran and Israel. From the Young Turks of the Ottoman Empire to the early leaders of Zionism, each player in this vast geopolitical game comes under the author's critical eye. And Fromkin is impartial with both his praise and his criticism. While his portrait of Winston Churchill tosses body blow or two to Sir Winston's image, it also establishes a firm foundation for those that regard Churchill as one of the most dominate and influential leaders of the twentieth century.Knowledge of mistakes in the past is no guarantee that future mistakes will not occur, but it does help to avoid a repeat of past errors. This book should be required reading for any American concerned with the Middle East, particularly our current leadership!"},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This is a well researched, comprehensive narrative on how the middle east was formed, centered on the British side of events, where the most important decisions were taken. Reading these pages, I can only think of the mess that the middle east was in those days, mostly because the major constituents of this region, that is to say Mesopotamia, Arabia and Palestine, had more than one internal player interested in holding part of the dismembered Ottoman Empire, and with the major external players at war trying also to get a piece of the cake and install or retain its influence on this important region, strategically important for its oil resources and geographic location. Added to this scenario was the zionist question, Turkey and its confilcts in central Asia and the internal problems faced by Britain, politically and economically.Those were very complex times indeed, where the best of British diplomacy was deployed in order to forge peace and stabilize the region according to the situation in those years. Sadly, the settlement of 1922 didn't consider the Kurdish people and the Palestinian Arabs. In spite of all these problems, the book also allowed me to know more about the Arab people and part of its history and religion, its tribes and sects. I cannot say this book is the best in this subject, but certainly a must reading."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"David Fromkin's book is generally regarded as the definitive and standard account of the creation of the modern Middle East. Fromkin's thesis is that European policy toward the Middle East between 1914 and 1922 created the basis for the chaos that exists there today. As Fromkin states on p. 17, \\"It was an era in which Middle Eastern countries and frontiers were fabricated in Europe.\\"Fromkin spent ten years on this dense work, which includes massive documentation. Throughout the book the author consistently argues that the conflicts that plague the region today are mainly due to the decisions made (eighty years ago) by bumbling European politicos and bureaucrats who had scarce knowledge of the region.However Fromkin's conclusions are all based on like-minded European sources. As other reviewers have noted there is some doubt about his depth of research into the Middle Eastern aspects of events. Points of view of local Middle Eastern actors during this turbulent period are rarely mentioned. Fromkin expounds the \\"Western Guilt\\" point of view: the rapacious Europeans were out to carve up the fallen Ottoman Empire to expand their empires. And the Middle Easterners just stood by as hapless victims of this Western greed.I gave this book four stars because although I entirely disagree I believe Fromkin has done all that can be done to present the orthodox view of the making of the modern Middle East. He has made a monumental contribution to the liberal culture of \\"Western guilt\\" that entraps so many thinkers today.But Fromkin presented only one side of the debate on this subject. It took ten more years before a revisionist interpretation of the historic period was published in 1999: \\"Empires of the Sand: The Struggle for Mastery in the Middle East 1789-1923\\" by Professors Efraim and Inari Karsh. Drawing on a wide range of original sources, the Karshes (husband and wife) effectively rebut Fromkin's thesis in a scholarly tour-de-force. (The Karshes even describe Fromkin's standard history as a \\"caricature\\" [p. 351]).\\"Empires of the Sand\\" argues that Middle Easterners \\"were not hapless victims of predatory imperial powers but active participants in the restructuring of their region.\\" \\"Twentieth-century Middle Eastern history is essentially the culmination of long-standing indigenous trends, passions, and patterns of behavior rather than an externally imposed dictate. Great-power influences, however potent, have played a secondary role, constituting neither the primary force behind the region's political development nor the main cause of its notorious volatility.\\"I recommend reading Fromkin if you want to know the standard, but wrong-headed version of this debate. But if you want to clear your mind of the \\"Western guilt\\" syndrome and know the whole story, I recommend the Karshes' book."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Fromkin's take on the roots of the current Middle Eastern conflict, aptly described by previous reviewers, is both formidable and sketchy. His approach is to tack a series of essays about individuals and events together in a lose framework that will be tremendously satisfying to the intuitive who likes to draw his or her own conclusions, but will be mildly disorienting to those who like to have perspectives made more directly clear. It is an easy read if one takes it one step at a time, but it leaves one with the difficult task of integrating all of the information that Fromkin provides. Within the essays, Fromkin is somewhat inconsistant in his approach. At times he provides highly satisfying direct reference to original source material and at other times he draws undocumented conclusions about events which could potentially be based on the opinion of some unknown source or perhaps his own. So, while this is a tremendously satisfying book, I am still left with questions regarding the validity of Fromkin's basic thesis -- but his fine treatment of this topic leaves me with a pressing interest in reading more, which is perhaps the highest complement I can pay."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"For those that are interested in the events surrounding WWI and its aftermath, this book is an incredible resource for gaining a wider understanding the events that led to the sometimes coincidental developments that continue to have repurcussions today. Particulary interesting is the developments leading up to the Sykes-Picot agreement that pretty much arbitrarily divided up the Middle East between France and Britain; the Balfour Declaration and the conflicting ideas many leaders at the world stage at that time had about their intentions therein; placement of the different regimes in artificially created states in the Middle East; and the often conflicting views and actions of officials on the ground and politicians back home, most of whom did not have an accurate grasp of the real situation.Particularly interesting is the section on Iraq, where some note the difficulties of forcing together a country of Shiis, Sunnis and Kurds, and to be ruled by a Christian, hasn't anyone in a decision making position today read their history?! I recommend this book to leaders dealing today with the Middle East.Also very impressive is the strength of Mustapha Kemal and the Turks in saving their country from total occupation, an endless array of fights going on for many years, while at the same time fighting internally with the small groups loyal to the corrupt, west-loving sultan. His accomplishment, when viewed within the wider context of how hopeless their situation seemed at the outset, their success in creating a new country out of the remains of a partitioned, ruined, exhausted empire is incredibly impressive, he is a rare leader in world history who has accomplished true greatness, and the Turks are right in revering him so.Overall, though the details can get to be so many that one can lose focus of the main events (they are very interesting nonetheless), this is an excellent source for understanding the interaction between the Allies during a very turbulent period, and many mistaken beliefs that led to wrong policies, repurcussions of which are still held today. It's a fascinating read given the current situation in Iraq, Israel and Palestine today. Fromkin has researched the period thoroughly, refutes commonly held beliefs about the period, and leaves the reader with a sense of awe at the fascinating interactions between the various actors on the stage. I would recommend it to those who have some basic knowledge of the period, this is not a textbook of learning the basics, but an excellent source of enriching one's knowledge that helps to understand similar intricacies in international relations that go on today."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book provides a very in-depth analysis of the British perspective on the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the modern Middle East. It begins in the days leading up to the opening of the First World War and continues through the 1922 treaties with Turkey. It includes a set of black-and-white photographic plates. Sources are cited with end notes, and there is an extensive index.Fromkin's account of British politics concerning the Middle East is exceedingly detailed. He discusses the day-to-day motivations of every actor, minor and major, in the region. I was particularly interested in learning more about the Balfour Declaration, and it is certainly covered in detail here. However, the details are so thick that it's hard to come away from reading this book with any idea of the big picture. Nevertheless, the information contained within the book is certainly necessary to be informed about, lest we are doomed to repeat it....\\"In a leading article on 7 August 1920, The Times demanded to know \`how much longer are valuable lives to be sacrificed in the vain endeavour to impose upon the Arab population an elaborate and expensive administration which they never asked for and do not want?'.\\""},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"David Fromkin's \\"The Peace to End All Peace\\" is an excellent, detailed story about the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the European powers that divided it up. Ultimately, the book is the story of World War I in and around the Mediterranean, focusing on the diplomatic and governmental actions as much as the actual fighting.Fromkin tells the story in an easy-to-follow manner. The chapters are fairly short and usually focused on one issue or incident - they are almost stand-alone chapters. In telling this history, Fromkin focuses heavily on Churchill, as his actions and policies (and his meanderings in and out of government) were key to British policy at the time. However, Fromkin shows how the weakness of the British colonial as the British governments in Egypt and India were often following different, even counterproductive, policies.Ultimately, the breakup of the Ottoman Empire was spurred on by the naked aggression of the British and French at the end of World War I. The clumsy and opportunistic events led to the fragmented Middle East that still is the source of much of the world's strife - and Fromkin tells this complex story in an informative manner."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book had a lot of great and interesting bits of info. At points it was extremely engaging. But these interesting bits are drowned in scores of pages filled with minutia, painful detail of small events. and although these details are very important to the bigger picture, this big picture is hard to see among these details. At times these details coalesce nicely into a coherent thought. And at other times they seem to wander off and drain your attention. For me (and I do at times have a short attention span) there weren't enough big picture portions of the book, or portions that pull details together. I feel like a lot of those small details that comprise the book made me miss some of the details that matter.

Very readable: Historic figures shaping the world are portrayed like characters in a novel; the events unfold and foreshadow new events, from start to finish. This book contributed more to my understanding of World War I than any other I have read. But it also created a new understanding for the makeup of the Middle East, and gave a real insight into America's Middle East policies.The book is told primarily from the perspective of Britain's involvement, which was only fitting, as it was the dominant empire at the outset of the First World War. However, reading from this perspective provided valuable insight for this American reader.From the outset of the First World War, Britain adopted a Middle East policy that disregarded credible, informed information about the region, and followed information based on misinformation, suppositions and prejudices. After the 1918 Armistice, Britain formulated its policies according to its own interests-- gauged from Nineteenth Century notions of empire, and its desire to use the Middle East to link its dominions in Africa and the Subcontinent. Britain executed its policies with reference to its own goals and the goals of other European interests in the region. The interests of the indigenous peoples were not given any real consideration. While involved in the Middle East, and trying increasingly in vain to further its own interests, Britain found itself facing economic crisis and political upheaval at home, and losing its allies abroad.From 1918 to 1922, Britain faced a series of political upheavals in the Middle East, each of which increased the difficulties of pursuing its Middle East policies. Britain did not view the upheavals as being in any way related; it viewed the upheavals as the product of a \\"Jewish conspiracy,\\" (led by German Jews, backed by Germany, and responsible not only for the overthrow of the Ottoman Sultantate, and the post-Armistice upheavals, but for the Bolshevik Revolution as well).But what Britain did not seem to appreciate was that the Middle Eastern uprisings did have a common thread: Resistance to European rule. Specifically, resistance European, Christian domination of the politics and resources of the region; in effect, resistance to British rule. This sentiment the British attributed to the pervasive \\"Jewish conspiracy.\\" As author Fromkin put it, Britain was chasing a shadow throughout the Middle East, and did not realize that the shadow it was chasing was its own policies.By 1922, Britain had reached settlements with its European counterparts, which had divided the Middle East according to their interests-- which were not even necessarily economic or realpolitik interests, being steeped in Nineteenth Century notions of empire. But by 1922, the Middle East had essentially the shape it has today: Nations with boundaries created by maps in European drawing rooms; consisting of peoples that may have been not only unrelated, but adverse and hostile to one another; and raising pervasive questions-- alive still today-- about the right even to exist as a nation.As Fromkin noted, the principles of nationhood and law that the European masters sought to impose were not only foreign to the Middle East, they were inimical to both the tribal social structure, and the pervasive religion, which already governed every aspect of life. But the Twentieth Century in the Middle East began with the struggle to reconcile the values imposed by the European conquerors over the centuries-old values, ways and traditions.Fast forward about a hundred years. The dominant Western empire of the age still seeks to impose its will in the Middle East, primarily, almost exclusively, to assert its imperial right to the region's primary natural resource. The empire persists on this course in the face of economic crisis and political upheaval at home, and despite being abandoned, or only marginally supported, by would-be allies. The empire faces uprisings thoroughout the region. The empire responds to the uprisings as discrete events. The empire does not-- at least not publicly-- at least not through its media-- recognize the uprisings as having any common connection or cause. The empire chases a shadow, which it calls \\"Terrorism\\". The empire does not recognize-- or refuses to acknowledge-- that the shadow it chases is the shadow it casts across the Middle East. The empire does not recognize-- or refuses to acknowledge-- that the uprisings are opposition to the dominance of a Western, Christian nation, and its interests and values.To the leaders of this empire, I would recommend that they read \\"A Peace to End All Peace,\\" and take a cautionary lesson from the now-deceased British Empire."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book should be required reading for all high school students.

David Fromkin tells the story of how the colonial re-adjustments made by England and France during World War I in anticipation of the demise of the Ottoman Empire were ultimately responsible for the continuing mess that is the modern Middle East. It is a story that has been told many times, but seldom with such eloquence and rarely with such a sure eye for the telling detail. Mr. Fromkin has the gift of explication and the ability to really see the big picture. From the fateful voyage of the German warships Goeben and Breslau to the violent death of Enver Pasha in the wilds of Central Asia, and from the fictions of TE Lawrence to the cynical accomodations of Sykes and Picot, the reader is conducted expertly through an incredible but factual story whose ending has yet to be determined. As he shows in other books such as &quot;In the Time of the Americans,&quot; Fromkin is a stern critic of the old colonial powers, and some readers may find his account of French and British politics and policies to be a little one-sided, but what really good book isn't? An amazing work of history - six stars!"},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Of course I know the importance of the Middle East in our present times, but I had little idea that the era of its formation was also a critical time for the formation of the ENTIRE modern world. The same events which created the Modern Middle East also caused both World Wars, and hints at the eternal conflict in Bosnia and Yugoslavia as well. And yet, the world of 1914 is so utterly different from our modern times. The start of this book finds the Ottaman Empire &quot;ruling&quot; over Central Asia, Britian in control of 1/3rd of the globe, and European countries still on an Imperial drive to conquer the world as fast as they can. The US was hardly a superpower during these times, and Civil and Womens' Rights are just a glimmer in History's Eye.The premere draw for this book is the author's use of de-classified materials, which can finally tell us what really happened in the region, and how European powers formed it. Beware, though, as this book is VERY dense with detail; so dense that I often take an hour to read a 5-6 page chapter. It has some flavors of a novel, but the book is certainly not an &quot;easy read.&quot; If you soak in all the knowledge, names, locations, and dates of this volume, you will become a relative expert on the Middle East!And yet, don't expect a complete understanding of the Modern Arab nations and the Islamic groups which reside in them. The Middle Eastern nations of the book's time period, 1914-1922, are about as different from their current condition and conflicts as the Civil War United States is from our modern country. The major wars between Israel and the Arab nations, or the importance of oil in the region, would not come into play for at least another 25 years, and you would need to read yet another book to understand the history of places like Saudi Arabia or Israel. Separate still is the roots of religious conflict in the Middle East and Southeastern Europe, which dates back thousands of years. Still, this book points to the true origins of the region as we know it today, and is critical for understanding modern Israel and its conflict with its neighbors. A recommended read for anyone with the patience to sift through it."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book is of critical importance to any student of Middle East history. Fromkin recounts a great deal that he might have left out of a less complete survey. Its inclusion is but one thing that makes this work priceless.What emerges, before one is even halfway through, is a sweeping portrait of the many tragedies that seeded conflicts still plaguing the Middle East today.One major culprit can only be described as legendary British stumbling throughout World War I. At the core of Britain's Middle Eastern advisers was a group of bigoted, bumbling idiots, who could not see past the end of their noses. Sir Mark Sykes, for example, described many groups whose destiny he influenced with disgusting pejorative. Town Arabs, he described as \\"cowardly,\\" \\"insolent yet dispicable [sic]\\" and \\"vicious as far as their feeble bodies will admit.\\" Bedouin Arabs he called \\"rapacious, greedy...animals.\\"Sykes was also obsessed with fear of Jews, Fromkin writes, \\"whose web of dangerous international intrigue he discerned in many an obscure corner.\\" Not the least of these was the sadly mistaken view that the Young Turks party were governed by Jews, when in fact none were privy to their inner circle. This pathetic distortion of reality was informed by oriental affairs interpreter Gerald FitzMaurice, and shared by Gilbert Clayton, an adviser to Lord Kitchener. Like too many other British misconceptions about the Middle East, it was never investigated or much less corrected.Disasters resulting from the \\"Cairo group's\\" ill-informed advice abounded. Take the bungled attack on Gallipoli--caused horrific 500,000 combined casualties, which could have been sharply reduced, if not eliminated, had the allies acted swiftly. Another was the reliance on the \\"diplomacy\\" of an Arab imposter, Lt. Muhammed Sharif al-Faruqi, who pretended to represent the Emir Hussein, Sharif of Mecca, but whom neither Hussein nor his son Feisel had ever met, much less entrusted with diplomatic powers.But there is plenty of blame to go around. Fromkin also plumbs the weakenesses of the Ottoman lords themselves, as well as those of duplicitous Arab leaders. Emir Hussein's actual emisaries neglected to inform the British that he did not know al-Faruqi--perhaps because he advanced an agenda which suited Hussein in many respects. But it caused problems. Worse, Arabs often negotiated in bad faith, knowing that they could deliver on few if any of the promises they made in pursuit of their goals.David Fromkin's intense scholarship is informed with the grace of a classic novel. Had there ever been any doubt, he proves that fact is stranger than fiction--and often a great deal more tragic.--- Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book is a fascinating journey into roots of the current problems in the middle east. \\"A Peace to End All Peace\\" reads like a fiction novel and is very concise. Fromkin helps to explain in detail the great maneuvering and the politics that resulted in the downfall of the last great Islamic empire, and the breaking up of its territories, the effects of which can be seen to this day: The israeli-palestinian conflict, and the rise of the now corrupt house of saud which led to 9/11 to name a few. Get this book if you wish to get a better understanding of why people are blowing themselves up in the middle east, and also some of the intrigues and conflicts in one of the greatest wars in the history of this planet."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Fromkin's A Peace to End All Peace is a challenging read, but the reader is rewarded with a much clearer understanding of the causes of so many of the regions problems. In a nutshell the inept, myopic and largly ignorant bureaucracy of the Entente Powers (Britian and France specifically) laid the foundation for the issues the Middle East now struggles with.From the Sykes and Balfour proposals in Palestine, to the support given the Saud family in Arabia, to the creation of &quot;Trans-Jordan&quot;, &quot;Iraq&quot; and &quot;Kuwait&quot; (all of which were artifically created entitites desigend to suit the needs of the European powers) we see the rivalries and tensions that persist to the present day emerge, as voices of reason (T.E. Lawrence, for example) are drowned out by bureaucrats. While Fromkin argues that European involvement in the Middle East had been ongoing for nearly a century by 1918, the bulk of the book is concerned with events between 1917 - 1922. The result was a hodge-podge mosaic of European &quot;mandates&quot; (ie. colonies) and locally run fiefdoms (such as Arabia). Little wonder the area is known for its political instability.A Peace to End all Peace is balanced in its approach to the subject and its treatment of key figures (both European, Jew, and Arab). The only criticism I have is its emphasis on politics at the expense of social and economic factors. It seems to me that one of the major flaws in the creation of the modern Middle East was a lack of understanding of local society and economics - a fact that persists to this day, and an obstacle to the establishment of effective communication between West and East. Nonetheless, I recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in a deeper examination of the Middle East."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"While I certainly enjoyed this book, I would suggest that it is mainly for readers with a firm understanding of WWI, European politics of the early 20th Century, and a general understanding of the Ottoman Empire as a whole. Mr. Fromkin does not proceed in a purely chronological fashion, and it can be difficult to place events in order mentally as you read unless you are already fairly familiar with how events of the period unfolded.I found reading this book to be a lot like \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" in the sense that the majority of the writing is given over to the backroom machinations and high level diplomacy that drove events, rather than the events themselves.Finally, I was frustrated that the summation was so brief. Fromkin goes into great detail regarding the events between 1914 and 1921, but then devotes only a short final chapter to the Middle and Near East as it appeared in 1922, even though it was this final arrangement that really led to most of the conflict and misunderstanding we see in the region today."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"A Peace to End All Peace - The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East (New York: Henry Holt and Co. 1989) by David Fromkin is the story of the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire after its defeat at the end of World War I, and the birth of the countries we now know as Iraq, Israel, Jordan and Lebanon. Fromkin, a history professor at Boston University, focuses on the formative years of 1914 to 1922, when even an alliance between Arab nationalism and Zionism seemed possible.The book can be divided into two parts: before WWI and after WWI. Before WWI, the Allied countries shared the lands of the Ottoman Empire. After WWI, the colonial powers of Britain, France, Russia and Greece came to remake the geography and politics of the Modern Middle East. There were deceptions and betrayals, as politicians tried to integrate the Middle East into their colonial empires. There were also politicians of the Middle East who were underestimated by the Great Powers, but in fact were quite adept at playing one Power off another.The book begins with the Ottoman Empire ruling over Central Asia. Britain was in control of a third of the world, and the European countries were competing to colonize the rest. The recurring theme in this portion of the book is that the Allied powers, through a lack of understanding of the political dynamics and capabilities of the weak Ottoman Empire, made a series of mistakes that pushed the Turks into an alliance with the Central Powers. In 1914 British leaders mistakenly thought that Turkey was finished. The Allied powers began planning for the division of the Ottoman Empire. Soon after Czarist Russia requested Constantinople, the czarist system itself crumbled. The colonial powers carved up and divided the Ottoman Empire between themselves. The Arab domains of the old Ottoman Empire were partitioned between Britain and France, while England created Jordan out of desert wilderness.The reader learns that the countries were created virtually by whim. Mark Sykes, representing the English, and Francois Georges Picot, representing the French, essentially drew arbitrary boundaries to form countries for their respective nations. Disparate people were flung together without regard to their different ethnic, social or religious differences, sowing the seeds of future conflicts. According to Fromkin, the colonial powers were playing the \\"Great Game,\\" where nations and people were merely strategic pieces and the Ottoman Empire was the chessboard. The colonial powers set up puppet regimes, drawing boundaries and imposing rulers while ignoring the wishes of the people. The result was Arab hatred and distrust of the West that persists to this d\\\\day.Fromkin believes the West and the Middle East have misunderstood each other for most of the 20th century, for reasons that can be traced back to the initiatives of Lord Kitchener, War Minister, during the early years of WWI. Kitchener mistakenly believed that religion was everything in the Moslem world and that Mohammedanism was a centralized, authoritarian structure.Kitchener and his colleagues believed that Islam could be bought, manipulated, or captured by buying, manipulating, or capturing its religious leadership. They were intrigued by the notion that whoever controlled the person of the Caliph-Mohammed's successor-controlled Islam. At that time, Britain ruled over half of the world's Moslems, and the thought of a revolt by all these Moslems was a recurring nightmare.The book is told primarily from the British viewpoint, which is logical as England held and dealt most of the cards in the endless game of building and maintaining empires among the European powers of Britain, France, Italy and Greece. Always in the foreground was Britain's fear of losing its land link to India.The principal characters in the book are Winston Churchill, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Lord Kitchener of Khartoun, T.E. Lawrence, George Curzon and George Clemeceau. There are also assorted emirs and pashas. Of the three who get the most attention in the book (Churchill, George and Kitchener), Fromkin appears to consider Churchill the central character, but his reasons are not apparent. From the British perspective, it was actually Mark Sykes who was central to the events described in the first half of the book, and Lloyd George in those discussed in the second half. The book accurately describes colonial administrators who were inept and clueless about the countries and the people that were the subjects of their decisions.The book is based primarily on secondary sources and memoirs published in English. Fromkin's forte is an eye for detail and irony, of which much is provided in colorful terms. We learn about T.E. Lawrence, a larger-than-life character dressed in flowing Arab robes who fought alongside the Arabs and whose voice of reason the bureaucrats back in England routinely ignored. We see the duplicity of the Arab leaders. The British placed its reliance on the \\"diplomacy\\" of one Lt. Muhammad Sharif al-Faruqi, who claimed to represent the Emir Hussein, Sharif of Mecca. The book emphasizes politics and politicians.Fromkin's manner of organization results in confusing historical sequencing. Character traits are traced individually throughout the time period, which results in jumps in the narrative and then repetition of information, as Fromkin often has to go backward in order to go forward with the story. For example, the book is very instructive on the turmoil in southern Russia. When the Ottoman Empire was defeated, the victorious Western powers permitted the Soviet Union to reassert control over parts of Central Asia -- a discussion that may be historically fitting, but is only tangentially relevant to the main story.I recommend the book to anyone who has a serious desire to understand Iraq and its neighbors today. But those with only casual interest may find that it takes too much patience to get through."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"The very image of British delegates clustered around outdated maps of Mesopotamia and the Holy Land, muffling curses as they try to pin-point elusive rivers -- with Semitic names they can't even pronounce but which they intend to use as arbitrary borders of the new nations they're delineating -- is just one of the many poignant details Fromkin inserts in this marvelous history of the early 20th century Middle East.The scope of the work is incredible. Fromkin opens with Churchill as First Lord of the Admirality, then follows the course of events that led to the dramatic showdown with the Ottoman Empire that erupted into the disastrous and devastating Eastern campaign of WWI.Kitchener, T.E. Lawrence, Gertrude Belle, Abd al-Azziz, Sykes, Ben-Gurion, Attaturk, Woodrow Wilson, Emir Feisal, Lloyd George -- are all participants in this dynamic history, and are adroitly described at there best and worst moments. The starry-eyed hopes of the Romantic Arabists opposing the Protestant M.P.s who envisioned the revival of Israel &quot;from Dan to Beersheba&quot;; Hashemite potentates installed as the ruling monarchs of predominantly Shi'ite territories; British officials in India questioning the motives of their counterparts in Cairo, who hoped to revive a &quot;Moslem Caliphate&quot; to serve as a &quot;Mohammaden&quot; buffer zone stretching from the Levant to Afghanistan, all as an elaborate chess move in the perpetual Great Game, waged between Her Majesty's Government and the uncertain forces -- &quot;undoubtedly Jewish&quot; -- influencing the Russian Czar.The fall of the House of Osman and the rise of the C.U.P.; the End of Imperial Russia and the ascendancy of Lenin; the Maronite Christians in Lebanon and Reza Khan in Iran; French colonialism and Italian belligerency; the shocking slaughter of the Armenians and the Greek catastrophe in Smyrna, are also discussed in this synoptic overview.David Fromkin helps elucidate the circumstances that led to the bewildering patchwork of cultures, religions and ideologies that constitute the Modern Middle East. Although the book would be easier to follow with a few more detailed maps, it is a beautifully composed and skillfully executed work, and well worth the money."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This is a gripping account of Britain's misadventures in the Middle East from about 1908 to 1922, with a wonderful rogue's gallery of characters--ambitioius, treacherous, arrogant, and frequently clueless. Nearly every chapter chronicles furious backstabbing, squandered opportunities, catastrophic misjudgements. What the book does best is to reveal the rivalries within the British government over its objectives in the Middle East. During the Great Game period, the conflict had essentially been between Tories, who feared Russian encroachment on India, and Liberals, who, however much they despised the Czarist regime, still saw the Russians as champions of the oppressed Christian nations of the Balkans. Then in 1907 Russia abruptly became an ally--thanks to the more pressing threat posed by Germany. When World War I began, Britain had to rethink its relationship w/ its traditional (albeit odious) ally the Ottoman Empire, and then, once the Young Turks committed to Germany, with the subject peoples within the Turkish empire.The basic conflict w/in His Majesty's Govt., as Fromkin tells it, was between the Arabists of Cairo, who hoped to create a pan-Arab state under Sharif Hussein, but run largely by and for Britain, and the Govt. of India, which wanted British control only of southern Mesopotamia (Iraq) and were wary of the grandiose schemes of the Egyptian administrators, proteges of Kitchner. These latter wanted to name Hussein the new Caliph, imagining the office to be similar to that of the Pope. But there was no separation of Church and State in the Isalmic world, and for Hussein, to be Caliph was to be Emperor. Commitments to the Zionists and to the French famously conflicted with each other and with deliberately vague promises that were made to the Arabs, and Fromkin sorts these out in some detail.Among the things the book does well is to demystify the \\"Arab Revolt\\" during WW I, to exculpate Churchill for the Gallipoli fiasco, and to untangle the ambitions and animosties of all the parties negotiating the fate of the Middle East at Versailles and San Remo. (Passions were heated: the U.S. and Italy nearly went to war over Anatolia.) The moral: you generally wind up respecting your enemies but despising your allies. The duplicity of the Turks and Germans toward each other easily matched that of the ex-Allies.This book is based primarily on secondary sources and published memoirs in English. Unfortunately, the references on WW I, Zionism, and some other peripheral subjects don't inspire a lot of confidence; but there are no egregious errors. Fromkin relies heavily on Kedourie and Gilbert in the first half of the book, which is all to the good. He seems to believe Churchill is the central character. It's actually Mark Sykes in the first half, naively trusting one and all and believing all commitments could be reconciled, and the wily Lloyd George in the second half--Little-Englander-turned-Imperialist, pro-Greek, pro-Zionist, and anti-French, and rapidly running out of time and money. Fromkin has a few idee fixes that are not supported by the evidence--i.e., that the British believed that the Young Turks were being run by Jews. But generally this is a fascinating survey and a great read. Some bitter ironies."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Mr. Fromkin takes on a formidable task -- covering an issue of significant complexity, such as the formation of many of the modern nations in the Middle East -- but pulls it off in style. His book achieves a nice blend of factual information (based on a wealth of background research) with fluid prose, making the book as informative as it is easy to read! Having come from that reagion myself, I was nicely suprised to learn new details, yet I was even more excited about Mr. Fromkin's discussion on the British political approach (an ignorance) about the region, which is painted in vivid color through discussions about the major political figures in the landscape. I am hard pressed to find a book on the subject with similar depth and readability, so I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"A Peace to End All Peace is a masterpiece that picks up where Guns of August leaves off. The author threads together the wide-ranging people, places and events that reshaped the Middle East following World War I and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. The book traces the mostly failed attempts by colonialists, primarily British and French, to transform Asian cultures into Western style democracies with seemingly randomly defined national borders without regard to cultural differences separating the people. The primary motives: oil, power and military presence, as they remain today. This book shows that ethnocentric Westerners have learned little about the Middle East since then. This mangled shaping and reshaping of the region continues today, spearheaded by the American colonial foray into Iraq by dint of war that may soon spread overtly to surrounding countries. A Peace to End All Peace demonstrates an old adage: If we cannot learn from our past mistakes, we are bound to repeat them."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"It was not about good guys and bad guys as so many writers have made it out to be. I really appreciated the balanced perspective of this book that showed the failings on all sides of the creation of the modern middle east in the early 20th century."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"I am not a historian to know if there are factual errors in this book, but I can say that I found it absolutely fascinating and very informative. It is incredible how Mr. Fromkin has been able to create such a capturing narrative out of strictly archival information. I happen to have originated from Eastern Turkey. I grew up hearing old people's stories of the war -- enormous brutalities and suffering of Kurds, Armenians, Turks, Arabs... I personally don't remember any book this comprehensive and informative. This book just brings it all together. I don't think Mr. Fromkin could get into details any further (as some reviewers suggest here). It is a guide book for those want to explore and learn more about the formation of the Middle East."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This is a marvelous historical narrative of how we got to where we are in the Middle East quagmire. Beginning a few years before and ending a few years after WWI, Fromkin pieces together the mosaic of the imperialistic strategy of the British, French and Russians to carve up the Ottoman empire at the end of the war. The creation of Palestine, Syria, Lebannon, Iraq, Iran, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia are succinctly explained. Eventhough there is a certain amount of repetition in the narrative, I found it a useful memory aid. My only problem with the book is his belittling the injustice suffered by the native Palestinians as a result of the Balfour Declaration's commitment to a homeland for the Jews on the same lands."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"I read the other reviews pertaining to this book and I was a little surprised at how well this book was received. Overall I felt that the historical sequencing of the events was lacking and the sequencing of the chapters in the book confusing. I would think that it would be very difficult to make sense of the book without having prior knowledge of middle east history. I would not recommend this book for someone who is reading their first book to understand the evolution of middle eastern history. In many instances the historical facts that Fromkin presents in his book are incorrect or incomplete. On the positive side this book might be intriguing for someone who is interested in the history of the British colonial policies and some of the leading British political figures. In regards to understanding the history of the middle east, one of the few positives of this book is the fact that it illustrates the sinister role that the colonial powers have played in shaping the current picture of the middle east. While it is not explicitly discussed or analyzed in the book (a major disappointment), the reader will be able to realize the amount of influence and the hypocritical and racist policies that the colonial powers exercised in shaping the destiny of the peoples of the middle east. It is surprising as much as it is disturbing to realize the amount of freedom that the colonial powers exercised on helpless people to protect so called imperial interests. After reading this book, readers should reach the natural conclusion that the problems in today's middle east is a direct result of poor, racist, self-centered policies of European powers, made by politicians who were ignorant, hypocritical, and knew very little about the region they were ruling."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Its very popular and easy to blame the present mess in Iraq and the Middle East on George Bush and Tony Blair. Not that those two haven't thrown gasoline on a fire but the mess was made long before they took an interest.David Fromkin takes us back to the beginning at the end of World War One when just for a moment all things, including a real peace seemed possible. It wasn't to be however. The system of states as we know it in the Middle East was created by Europeans around 1922 as a way to extend their empires, to carve up the fallen Ottoman Empire and establish dominance as they had done with other countries after previous wars. The process of Middle Eastern statehood is a story involving Britain, France, Russia, Greece, and on the fringes, America. The road is littered with misinformation and lies on all sides; disasterous and stupid assumptions and unwarrented mistakes, egos, and naked imperialism.Given the lack of interest of Turkey in continuing to ride herd of this region, a thankless task but one she carried off pretty well, all things considered,its hard to see how letting the Arabs settled their own affairs by force would not have been preferable to the setting up of the phony nations that make up the middle east today.So who are the bad guys in this story? Well there's plenty to go around but three stand out - Hussein bin Ali, the self proclaimed \\"king of all Arabs\\" an inverterate conniver and liar, the egotistical and greedy French and the lying double dealing and even more greedy British. Of the three the British have the most to answer for yet somehow they have escaped almost any blame in the public consciousness.The war the Americans are fighting now in Iraq, regardless of how you think we got there, is a war to make right what the British, more than any other single party, broke long ago."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"I agree with all the rave reviews--this book is a \\"must-read\\" in order to understand what is going on in the world today. The title refers ironically to the justification that World War I was a war to end all war. The peace that followed the First World War, including the carve-up of the former Ottoman Empire by the Allied powers and encouragement of nationalism by Woodrow Wilson, led to disaster. A good companion for Barbara Tuchman's \\"The March of Folly\\"."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This may not be the best book ever written about this topic but it is a very good introduction to it for the educated reader, one that details how the machinations of the colonial great powers redrew the map of Middle East in the wake of the cataclysm of the Great War that collapsed the centuries old Ottoman Empire and how the native forces of revolution that arose at that time were mostly suppressed or coopted, with the notable exception of Mustafa Kemal's Turkish movement which is given its due. These events truly created the context of the modern Middle East we confront today from Israel/Palestine to Iraq. This book is not, as some have suggested, a sophmoric political screed at all, but a worthy and nuanced work of researched scholarship that merits the accolades it has received, one that illuminates a critical background to events at the heart of world politics today. Those on a hair trigger to denounce \\"liberals\\" should take note of the leading role of Liberal politicians like Asquith and Lloyd-George in the imperial intrigues that are described in this work, to say nothing of Churchill who was a leading member of that party at the time as well."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"David Fromkin's \\"Peace to End All Peace\\" is simultaneously a comprehensive and very flawed work. Many of the reasons for it being one can be found in the other.Fromkin attempts to examine how the modern Middle East (extending as far as Afghanistan and some sections of Central Asia) was created during and after the First World War. Obviously, in order to do this, the fall of the Ottoman Empire in that war must be considered.This is where Fromkin's unusual methodology comes into play. Focusing on the European political machinations to resolve the \\"Eastern Question\\" in their favour, the sorry tale becomes one more of Churchill and TE Lawrence than of the Arabs and Turks who were also involved in the process. Admittedly, it was the Europeans who wielded the whip hand in deciding just where the borders were to be drawn, but reducing key figures such as the CUP Triumvirate in the dying Ottoman Empire (and Kemal Ataturk in Turkey immediately thereafter) to the status of supporting players ultimately skews the focus of the book too much.Never let it be said that this is a simple story to retell. A complex web of national and personal political interests in both Europe and the Middle East combined to make the region what it is today, and any study of all of these will be faced with the need for convoluted explanations. The problem that Fromkin has, however, is that he does not make these very well at all.The story is told in a roughly chronological manner, which means that we jump from place to place and meet a bewildering array of characters. Ultimately, the only real result is confusion on the part of the reader, who is constantly flipping backwards to see who the latest figure to make an appearance actually is.Additionally, Fromkin frequently confuses his readers with references to geographical features which are not well-shown on the maps provided. Indeed, one map (showing Enver Pasha's advance on Baku and his campaigns in Central Asia) is laughable in the extreme. The legend explains that the direction of the arrows is the direction of the various advances - which would be significantly more useful were the arrows in fact arrows, and not equilateral triagles.Where Fromkin does well, however, is in his use of purely European sources. It is perhaps unusual to say this of a book intending to tell the story of the modern Middle East, but I have considerable doubts about the depth of his research into the Middle Eastern aspects of the events in question. In terms of Europe, however, his research seems to cover the major bases of exactly what the key figures believed and did.Ultimately, \\"A Peace to End All Peace\\" is a difficult and not particularly rewarding work. A diplomatic history of Europe during the Great War can be written much better than this, and a history of the development of the Middle East following that conflict already has been (the chapters in Margaret Attwood's \\"The Peacemakers\\" or William Cleveland's \\"Modern Middle East\\" both easily outshine this)."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book has been far too overrated in recent years. Talked up by the likes of Hamza Yusuf and others while this is an interesting read it is not the be all and end all.While it does expose some of the myths of the first world war and the so called 'Arab revolt' which for far too long has been deplicted as almost a struggle against colonial domination (something that has been said as much by many pan-Arabists) from the young Turks (Even though the Sharif of Mecca was a member of the Turkish parliement, had a villa in Istanbul and his was even married to a Turk! Or the equally mythical Arab 'conquest of Damascus' (Which the book points out was carried out by Australian troops who the British asked to withdraw so the Arabs could 'have their day')The book points out some of the outright racism of many of the British diplomats towards the Arabs in spite of seeing them as allies (should come as no supprise considering the comments made by British diplomats towards Inonu when he went to discuss a peace deal at the end of the Turkish war of independence (see the books of Stanford Shaw for details))What the book fails to point out however (and much is the same criticism of Fisks books) Turkeys actuall involvement in the Middle East. Turkey is pushed to the side as though it was only a minor player in the Middle East (rather than what it was which was quite possibly the main player) So you will rarely find in any book for example Khayr ad-Din Pashas heroic defense of Medina though there is some mention of Talat Pashas emotional devestation at having to abandon Damascus to what they must have well known was not some 'Arab kingdom' but rather a colonial administrated puppet state (It is said he turned pale and his hands were shaking when he signed the declaration of retreat).Equally so why Khayr al-Din Pasha the head of the Turkish army in Medina chose to ignore the order to withdraw and he and his troops chose to fight to the death rather than abandon the city of the prophet and Khayr al-Din was a Circassian by the way not a Turk, more proof of the internationalism of the Ottoman Empire or why Kazim Karabekir had so much support in Iraq (notably amongst the Iraqi Shia (so much for Fisks nonsense about oppressed Shia during Turkish rule Shia openly revolted in order to tie up British forces so Turkish troops could regroup on their western and eastern fronts))For the Turks (or far more accurately the Ottomans) the Middle East were not just 'posessions' but land that contained the holy land of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. The homeland of Baghdad and Damascus where the Ummayyad Mosque was and the resting place of many of the Shia Imams and saints such as Abdul Qadir Jilani. To lose the Middle East was to lose the heart and soul of the Ottoman Empire and until this is understood we will alwasy be at a disadvantage in studying Middle Eastern history."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This is an extremely well written history book that will give anyone who cares to learn a good grounding in the political, religious and ethnic divisions in the Middle East.

It is very complex but you don't already have to have a great understanding of the subject to read it. It filled in a lot of the blanks I had with this time period. Also, it is a very interesting book even if your not necessarily interested with the period.

As Fromkin notes, they were warned they were setting the stage for Armageddon.Hitler, in his attempt to destroy the Jews unwittingly provided the moral foundation for the re-creation of the State of Israel.One living in the twenties or thirties might have wondered, What might bring all the nations of the world to do battle in the Megeddo? That question has been answered. It is the matter of oil, the lifeblood of nations.One now wonders, Is there someone presently on the world stage who will play out a further role?

This is a history of miscommunications & miscalculations whose effects are being felt today, & will be felt for years to come.I think it is vital for anyone interested in statecraft in general or Middle Eastern affairs in particular to read & think about this book.The British have a long & illustrious history in diplomacy, intelligence & strategy. Some of their best & brightest, not just of their generation, but of all time, were involved in these events. Nevertheless, they miscalculated their own interests, not to mention the interests of the peoples they dealt with.This was further complicated by rivalries among at least three factions vying to lead their foreign policy, miscommunications of intentions between different individuals in their foreign policy establishment, & the mixed motives inherent in human endeavours. Ah, yes, and a little deception of allies or putative allies, combined with changes in policy as circumstances changed, which can be interpreted as dishonesty in some lights.This is one of the most interesting books I've read in years - and I am an avid reader. If this had been a novel, though, I'd have ripped the novelist for concocting such a complex & unbelievable plot. Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.Even if taking a charitable view of British imperial policies, this account helps one to understand why it is difficult for Middle Easterners to take at face value Western professions of good intentions.It may not be fair to judge statesmen of one generation by standards that evolved after their time, but that doesn't mean we can't learn from their experience, as informed by subsequent experience & observation of similar situations.Edwin Black's \\"Banking on Baghdad\\" also sheds light on some of these issues.

Anyone interested in learning from past events of the Great Game and large wars should read this book.

It traces the geographic origins of the &quot;modern&quot; Middle East. The author skillfully retells the dealings, double-dealings, betrayals, lies and shifting alliances in the key years of 1914-1922. Don't be deceived by the limited time span. It is amazing how much can happen in 8 very short years! The notes and bibliography encompass 51 pages!&quot;PTEAP&quot; is told primarily from a British viewpoint. The reason is logical enough: England and Prime Minister Lloyd George held and dealt most of the cards in the endless game of building or at least maintaining Empires among the European powers; Britain, France, Italy and Greece. The reader can decide just how well or poorly the PM played-or overplayed- his hand. This Irish American reviewer will keep his opinions to himself. The PM was no friend of the Irish cause.And the author appears to be no friend of the PM! Fear of Russia, both before and after that nation's Revolution lurks in the background. Also in the background is an uninvolved and newly isolationist United States. Britain's fear of losing a land link to India is very much in the foreground. Britain's obsession with India is unexplored. Readers learn how countries are created virtually by geographic whim. The modern nations of Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan, Israel and (basically) Iran are born. Puppet pro-British heads of state appear in Arabia, Iraq, Persia/Iran, and Jordan/ Transjordan -with varying degrees of &quot;success&quot;. PTEAP' s time frame allows only for an excellent introduction but no resolution of a homeland for Jews in Palestine. The result is that PTEAP explores the bases for many of today's problems but does not explain or resolve them. This does not detract from the story's importance one bit. The foundations are laid in these pages.PTEAP is highly challenging and highly rewarding. Its sheer length and breadth demands patience on the part of the serious reader, but the patience will be rewarded! There are two caveats: One is that the mere casual reader should skip PTEAP and select a less formidable book. The other involves the absolute requirement (!) for a World Atlas to appreciate the geographical scope of the story. As with most historical/military publications, the maps provided are of near total inadequacy. Why do editors permit this? For those two points, I deducted a star. We graver types can add the 5th star back. I hope this review has done justice and encouraged serious history fans to buy &quot;A Peace to End All Peace&quot;. Just remember the Atlas!"},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Ever wonder about the Armenian genocide by Turkey, or what Winston Churchill did in WWI and after?

If decisions had been made differently and events had taken a different course, maybe my wife's great uncle's descendants could still be living at Lidgate.For example, what if the British Cabinet had acted on Winston Churchill's urging in 1911 to make an alliance with the Turks/Ottomans?And if the 'Great War' had gone on for two years only (the German General Ludendorff believed the entry of the Turks/Ottomans into the war allowed the outnumbered Central powers to fight on for two years longer than they would have been able on their own), my wife's great uncle would not have been killed at Gaza in 1917.And if Winston Churchill's Dardanelles plans had prevailed over those of Lord Kitchener in March, 1915, Constantinople would have fallen, and my wife's great uncle would not have been killed at Gaza in 1917.As it was, it appears that numerous attempts were made to subvert, to attack, and to conquer the Turks/Ottomans, the defeat of whom could - and, maybe, should - have been accomplished in 1915, and my wife's great uncle would not have been killed at Gaza in 1917.This brilliant book - an historical thriller through and through - has provided me with much information and most of the answers and I am so grateful to David Fromkin for researching and writing it and to Amazon for selling it to me.It is quite clear to me now that the alliance between Germany and the Turks/Ottomans was at best an unintended mistake and at worst the secret design of a very few of the Turkish leaders. It could have been done very differently, with Turkey and the Ottoman Empire continuing to maintain their neutrality, to the benefit of the British and of the world.And it also appears from Fromkin's account that the successive collapses of the British, French and Russian Governments were directly attributable to the Dardanelles disaster. In the case of Russia, of course, this meant a fatal finale for the Czar and his family and the rise of Lenin and Bolshevism.There came on the scene in 1917 one Woodrow Wilson, as ignorant regarding Britain, France, Russia and the Turkish/Ottoman Empire as many Americans, but as determined, nevertheless, to do down the British as his later successor, Franklin Roosevelt. Despite having some high-flown thoughts, Mr Wilson helped little.All in all, it is once again amazing to me that two great British statesmen, Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George, should have been so full of foresight and wisdom. It's all too obvious that the others, including Wilson, were political pygmies.I suppose now and with hindsight that I would probably have preferred for the Ottoman Empire to have been maintained, as Churchill often wanted, or, failing that, for the British Empire to have been vastly extended - for good!I spotted one error (on page 299, in a section on the role of Louis D. Brandeis, later the first Jewish member of the United States Supreme Court): 'Only one Jew [Oscar Strauss] had ever been a member of the president's cabinet.' Not true: Judah Philip Benjamin played prominent roles in the cabinet of President Jefferson Davis.(An extremely interesting piece of information gleaned from the book is that Baghdad and Jerusalem, before the War, were home to the largest populations of Jews in the Middle East. 'Jews in large numbers had lived in the Mesopotamian provinces since the time of the Babylonian captivity - about 600 BC - and thus were settled in the country a thousand years before the coming of the Arabs in AD 634.').There has been some criticism that this book is too much about Great Britain and its leaders and people. To answer the criticism I quote the following (from page 385): 'The Prime Minister (Lloyd George) claimed that Britain was entitled to play the dominant role in the Middle East, recalling that at one time or another two and a half million British troops had been sent there, and that a quarter of a million had been killed or wounded; while the French, Gallipoli apart, had suffered practically no casualties in the Middle East, and the Americans had not been there at all.'Thoroughly recommended: I couldn't put it down!A personal post-script:In the Autumn of 1917, following two earlier failed attempts by General Murray in the first half of that year, General Allenby invaded (from Egypt, which was under British protection) Palestine, and my wife's great uncle, Captain Thomas John Catchpole, was killed, during the third battle of Gaza, on the 3rd of November (reportedly fatally injured by a Turk soldier and then shot by a fellow British officer, in the presence of his own younger brother, to put him out of his misery, there being no chance that he would live), and lies buried at the Deir El Belah War Cemetery. And the Middle East is still a problem."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Well written and researched.

Imagine discussing World War Two and Nazi Germany without including a serious discussion of the implications of the Holocaust. Under the cover of World War One the Turks murdered almost two million Christian Armenians - Armenians who had lived peacefully on their ancient homeland for 3000 years. One of Teddy Roosevelt's most famous quotes is that the greatest tragedy of WWI was what happened to the Armenians. The fixing of the Turkish border on the east was highly influenced by the fact that hundreds of thousands of Armenians on the Ararat plateau were murdered and thousands of their productive villages and cities from Trebizond to Kars to Van to Moush were destroyed. The Armenian Genocide is the one thousand pound elephant that Mr. Fromkin stayed away from. There is a story to tell regarding the Ottoman Empire, but Mr. Fromkin didn't tell it. For a more accurate and compelling account of the fall of the Ottoman Empire I recommend The New York Times best seller The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response by Peter Balakian."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"When you title your work as Fromkin does there must be a moral and a villain.This presents a problem for the author because historians who wish to be taken seriously can't wear their prejudices on their sleeves.To solve this problem Fromkin presents his story as a long, confusing trek through the minds of various British bureaucrats and politicians.As the reader's critical facilities are weakened by this ruse and swamped by spates of poorly assimilated details, Fromkin introduces his biases and his significant omissions are not missed.Fromkin affects sympathy for all of the groups involved, be they Turks, Kurds, Russians,Greeks, French, Italians,Muslims or even most of the supposedly muddled British.Nearly all of their excesses and errors are chalked up to factors of existential necessity and historical inevitability.It is only the actions of the British Arab Bureau and their Arab allies whose mistakes are made to seem unnecessary and avoidable.The Armenians are also teated very unfairly by the author.A great deal of unecessary dust is thrown in the air regarding al Faruki's intrigue and presented as if it is a Fromkin scoop.The promises to the Arabs are made to seem extremely complex and byzantine, but significantly, although the documents in question are relatively brief and could have been presented as an appendix, they are not included or even quoted accurately.The Wilsonian/Internationalist aspects of the Peace Conference and the League are largely ignored.The King-Crane Commission is dismissed in one brief paragraph.The timeline of who entered Damascus and when is deliberately confused by a resolutely blinkered and backtracking presentation.The capture of the rest of Syria and beyond by the Arabs is not dealt with at all.The obvious &quot;divide and rule&quot; explanation of why Sir Herbert Samuel and Norman Bentwich chose Hajj Amin al-Husseini as &quot;Grand&quot; Mufti of Jerusalem is ignored, and instead a Kedouri conspiracy theory is repeated which blames a junior British bureaucrat who is derogated as &quot;violently opposed to Zionism&quot;.Far from exposing T E Lawrence's lies, Fromkin simply smooths over the layer of lies about Lawrence left many decades ago by Aldington, Meinertzhagen, the French and the Zionists.There is no doubt that Lawrence lied.He lied to the Arabs on the British behalf and he lied to the British on the Arabs' behalf.He lied out of vainglory and he lied out of modesty.He lied to protect himself, but he did not lie to hurt his enemies.He hurt his enemies with the truth.T E Lawrence is one of the most extensively researched biographical subjects there is.His most recent and authoritative biography by Wilson inludes a great deal of information which was released after Fromkin's work.This information actually confirms some of the stories about Lawrence which even his adherents entertained doubts about, such as his secret expeditions to keep the lid on the Revolt leaders in Syria.At any rate, there are far better sources for exposing the truth about Lawrence and the Arab Revolt than Fromkin.The entire Armenian problem is dealt with in a mere 3 or 4 pages.Their genocide, which was a major focus of Christian concern at the time, is given incredibly short shrift.The Kurdish situation, on the other hand, receives much more attention, yet Kurdish participation in the Turkish ethnic cleansing of Armenia is totally overlooked. This perspective is not only unhistoric, but it reflects a contemporary political bias which, when combined with the anti-Arab slant, is quite clear.The wealth and variety of end notes and the breadth of the bibliography create an impression of the author as a conscientious historian.But whenever you come to a passage which presents the Arab cause in a bad light you will find one the same 3 sources: Bernard Lewis, Elie Kedouri and Howard Sachar.Each of these men have done valuable research, but they share the same mission; to rewrite the history of the Middle East in a way which provides a place and a rationale for Israel.His other favorite source is Martin Gilbert, also an ardent Zionist, but more notably the high priest of the Churchill cult.This book is not a product of original research so much as it is an example of a younger establishment historian critically reexamining the work of his predecessors and mentors.If Fromkin had been more honest about his point of view he could have created a far more original and readable work."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"The book is off mark from it's stated intent, the author wanted to center the book around Winston Churchill, but ended up doing it around Mark Sykes, and therein lies it's problem. Very much of an English account of the history, although exposing the emptiness of the policies and thought behind them from political as well as military men of the empire, the book fails to tell a complete story. Still a readable book, though one will have to read other sources."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Having read this book when it first came out some years ago, I read it from my professional viewpoint, that of a user of finished and raw intelligence,in order to make decisions as to how to proceed with a program. The recurring theme throughout is that the Allied Powers, through a lack of understanding of the political dynamics and capabilities of the weak Ottoman Empire, made a series of major mistakes which pushed the Turks into an alliance with the Central Powers, even though for centuries, the Austro Hungarian Empire and its predecessors had been fighting and quarreling with the Empire in the border zone which covers modern day Bosnia, Macedonia, Serbia, and other Balkan countries. At the time Bulgaria had only been independent since the late 1870s, Greece since the 1820s (remember Lord Byron et all) and the Turks had fought a major war with Russia in the 1870s. The unrest in Armenia which broke out after the Turks entered the war (Armenia straddles the Russo-Turkish area) led to pogroms and ethnic cleansing during the Great War. All of this bloodshed could have been avoided if the &quot;Young Turks&quot; (the reformers) had been left to carry out their programs. After the war when the Allied Powers divvied up the Middle East, the result was frustration of the Arabs' legitimate desires for self-government in Palestine and Syria, and the introduction of the Zionist colonies led to more unrest. Finally, the Greek Turkish War of the early 20s led to a huge migration and the permanent impoverishment of the Greek economy for many years. Add in the brutal King Zog of Albania and an ineffective bunch of other nation's royals and the situation was even more unstable up until 1940s. Then many years of Communist rule imposed stability until the death of Tito and the disintegration of Yougoslavia. The result seventy years on is the current ethnic strife in the Balkans."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"I wish to second Robert Steele's 5-star review of \\"A Peace to End All Peace\\", which was posted yesterday.

This book provides a broad overview of the diplomatic and bureaucratic struggles that produced the settlement, from the British point of view. Unfortunately, it is poorly written, poorly edited, oddly footnoted, and generally disappointing. It almost appears to have been written in bits and pieces that were later stitched together, with little effort made to eliminate redundancy or streamline the writing. A more rigorous editing would have shortened it considerably with no loss of impact. However, the breadth of its coverage, and the importance of the topic, may make it a useful starting point for those interested in this area."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"World War One brought about the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the creation of the modern Middle East. Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine (including a somewhat conditional Jewish Homeland), and the Transjordan were carved out mainly by the British. Turkey established itself as a separate entity including both European (East Thrace) and Asian parts. David Fromkin leads the reader through the changes that occurred between 1914 and 1922 in meticulous detail. Indeed, this reader found the book's main shortcoming to be the welter of specific facts that sometimes obscured the larger picture.Fromkin's book was published in 1989 so that it has an interesting historical perspective. The Iranians had thrown out the Americans and the so-called Afghan Arabs had played their (exaggerated) role in pushing the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan, but 9-11 remained over a decade in the future. Nonetheless, Fromkin detected the strength of Islam as the most important force in the region.Fromkin notes that the Middle East was the final area of the world to fall to Western (mostly British) imperialism. He also observes that this extension of Western power had long been anticipated with the main question being which country would get how much. In the end the British obtained more paper power than they could reasonable have hoped for, but then they found that by 1922 they had neither the will nor the wherewithal to exert that power. The Great War drained them of both. The British, and to a lesser degree the French and Americans, created weak countries and left major issues such as the fate of Kurds, Jews, and Palestinian Arabs unresolved.An even more fundamental challenge remained and remains. In every other area of the globe subjected to Western dominance, Western forms and principles prevailed, but Fromkin notes that \\"at least one of those assumptions, the modern belief in secular civil government, is an alien creed in a region most of whose inhabitants...have avowed faith in a Holy Law that governs all life, including government and politics.\\" Fromkin puts his finger right on the problem that the West has in understanding much of the region.Even more daunting, Fromkin argues that the Middle East still has not sorted itself out after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. He notes discouragingly that it took Western Europe about more than a millennium to \\"resolve its post-Roman crisis of social and political identity\\". The region's politics lack any \\"sense of legitimacy\\" or \\"agreement on the rules of the game - and no belief, universally shared in the region...that the entities that call themselves countries or the men who claim to be rulers are entitled to recognition as such.\\" The last such rulers were the Ottoman sultans.With regard to the current troubles in Iraq, one fervently wishes that someone in Washington had appreciated the penetrating analysis by the British civil commissioner Arnold Wilson in 1920 about the area just then being called Iraq. While he was called upon to administer the provinces of Basra, Baghdad, and Mosul, he did not believe they \\"formed a coherent entity\\". As he saw it the Kurds of Mosul would never accept an Arab leader, while the Shi'ite Moslems would never accept domination by the minority Sunnis, but, to directly quote Wilson, \\"no form of Government has yet been envisaged, which does not involve Sunni domination.\\" And on and on it goes.The book features a number of familiar figures, Winston Churchill most prominent among them. Fromkin's favorable treatment of Churchill strongly suggests that Winston was repeatedly ill-served by subordinates, bad luck, and bad press. By 1922, Churchill was finished as a British politician (or so it seemed). Other major figures include Lord Kitchener, David Lloyd George, T.E. Lawrence (about whom many questions are raised). A plethora of lesser known British and French military and civil leaders abound in the pages of Fromkin's lengthy tome, not to mention the odd Russia and German. Turkish leaders, such as Enver Pasha and Mustapha Kemal often bewilder their Western counterparts.Perhaps the oddest historical artifact reproduced by Fromkin was the belief, generally accepted among British intelligence and high-ranking civil and military leaders, in a conspiracy between Prussian generals and Jewish financiers manipulating Russian Bolsheviks and Turkish nationalists to the detriment of British interests! Moreover, in this conspiratorial view, Islam was controlled by Jewry. At this point, the reader is tempted to quietly murmur that the British should go home where they might understand something of what they are about. (The dangers of drawing too direct lessons from history are great and while the US leadership did not harbor any notions quite this crackpot, it bears notice that the US seem not to have understand Iraq, its history, or its people before sending in troops.)Fromkin produced a fine book, not an easy read, with a wealth of information and an excellent closing summary. It suffered, at times from the size of the subject - the transformation of an entire region during a worldwide war - and the maze of characters and details. A book that bears a second reading and a subject (subjects, really) for further study. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"To state the obvious, there is no small amount of irony in the title of this book. As David Fromkin tells us, when the Middle East settlement, or settlements rather, of 1922 were imposed by European Powers - particularly Britain - there were so many misunderstandings and false assumptions on all sides that the future promised many things, peace not being one of them.The year 1922 was a watershed year for the Middle East. The modern states of Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, and Transjordania (now Jordan) came into being as a result of treaties that were enacted during this fateful year. Calling them modern states is a misnomer, it was as an Eygptian intellectual once said, they were \\"tribes with flags.\\" Fromkin's chronicle is about how European powers partitioned the former Ottoman Empire creating dependent states and puppet regimes while ignoring the peoples of the Middle East.The story begins in 1913 when the Ottoman Turks were looking for an ally due to their military weakness and geographical vulnerability. They had originally sought Britain as an ally but were rebuffed. At the outbreak of World War I, the British mistakenly thought that the Germans had sought an alliance with Turkey. Actually it was the other way around. But it was British paranoia that forced them into each others arms. On the chessboard of the Great Game, the Germans and the Turks were now allies against the British, French, and Russians. And when the Russians perceived to have problems on their German-Turkish front, they - the Russians - implored the British to attack Turkey, which they did.British attacks on the Ottoman Empire were disastrous and turned out to involve them in a long, drawn-out entanglement in the Middle East. At the end of World War I when the Turks lost control of their imperial possesions, the British tried to set up Hussein as a \\"Pope\\" of Islam to control Arabia. But this created more problems than it solved. By 1922, the British installed Hussein's son Feisal in Iraq and his other son Abdullah in Syria. Ibn Saud was given control of Mecca, Medina and the remainder of what is now Saudi Arabia.Fromkin tells his story mostly from a British point of view; other views are duly taken into account but his source materials are primarily in English. He portrays Winston Churchill as a central figure in these events. Indeed, Churchill was in charge of the British Navy when they wrongly attacked Turkey and forced them to the German side. After a series of defeats, the British were forced to retreat in 1915. This fiasco ended Churchill's political career - many thought permanently - as well as the premiership of Herbert Asquith. However, in 1921, Churchill was resurrected as head of Middle Eastern affairs under Prime Minister Lloyd Gearge. During the so-called peace settlements of 1922, Churchill was present at creation and thus greatly responsible for the configuration of the modern Middle East.Churchill's legacy in the Middle East is controversial to say the least. He supported the Balfour Declaration which created a Jewish homeland in Palestine, and at the same time he assured the Palestinian Arabs that Jews in Palestine would be good for the Arabs and good for the world. He was actually serious and optimistic when he was saying this. So much for a peace to end all peace.This is one of the best accounts of the making of the modern Middle East I've ever read."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Hard to read, very detailed, but worth the struggle. I had not really understood how modern day Turkey fit into the first world war and the aftermath. Fascinating to see how the borders of the current countries of the middle east were decided. To me, this is a \\"foundational\\" book in that you will understand the Easts involvement in world war one as well as the formation of the modern middle east when you are done."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"I only just picked it up and started it a second time. This time however, I ploughed right through it. It is tremendous to remind ourselves in this time some of the REAL causes of Middle East conflict. Remind ourselves that much of the current problems were laid between 1914 and 1930. This is a frustrating work because you can see the root of so many problems and you have to bear through the story knowing how it ends, or continues as it were.The root causes of the Middle East conflicts are not ancient, they are fairly recent. Much of them based on the Western systems \\"inflicted\\" on them during the times described here in Fromkin's book.Fromkin has an easy style and his research and study cover an exceptional breadth. Rather than looking at certain isolated instances, he throws up a mosaic of the whole region and how it intertwines with the West and the East.If you never understood what the Ottoman Empire was or why the Middle East seems so complex, pick up this book."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"I read this 10 years ago or so.

I have to say that Fromkin came through as a possibly a Zionist, but he didn't hesitate to portray the Israeli govt negatively if it was called for."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"David Fromkin's \\"A Peace to End All Peace\\" is a wondefully researched and well-written account that covers the political creation of the modern Middle East from the period starting during World War I and the years immediately subsequent to it. Although Fromkin tackles the project in a somewhat predictable, chronological manner, his book is supremely researched and engaging thanks in part to the book's prescient subject matter.Fromkin intertwines the events of World War I as they specifically related to the Ottoman Empire and the rest of the geographic Middle East with a more comprehensive War history. Specifically, the author describes and explains the political machinations and intellectual movtivations on the part of the Allied leaders (specifically the British) who oversaw the prosecution of the War. For example, the book contains a detailed account of how and why the Ottoman Empire ultimately became involved in the War on the side of Germany, thus leading to the Empire's overthrow and the subsequent contrived fracturing of the Middle East. The book does a fantastic job of exposing the truth and debunking myths associated with controversial aspects of the war. In doing so, Fromkin paints a panoramic picture and is equally contemptuous when describing the motivations of all parties involved.Though the book is both intensely well researched and covers a topic concededly enormous, there were certain elements of the topic the book espouses to cover that could and should have garnered more attention. For example, an obvious and extremely important movement related to the modern geo-politics of the region was the birth of Zionism in the late-1800's and its rise during World War I. This topic was casually glossed over by Fromkin. As is well known, British leaders during the period concluded that promoting Palestine as a homeland for the Jews scattered throughout the world, and especially in oppressive regions such as Russia, would generate support for the Allies thus hastening a more rapid conclusion to the War. Furthermore, the British believed that if Palestine could effectively be established as the homeland for the Jews, British influence would form an unbroken chain between Eastern Africa and India. While Fromkin repeatedly discusses this latter thesis, he fails to go into any depth regarding the more subtle motivations for promoting Zionism as espoused by Lloyd George, Winston Churchill, and others who steadfastly supported the cause of the Jews.Overall, David Fromkin has written a fantastic account and has demonstrated both a supreme grasp of the subject and impeccably sharp analysis. As stated above, however, the topic is much too expansive for each aspect of the book's subject to be appropriately covered in only 550+ pages."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Fromkin's book identifies many of the historical causes of the ongoing malaise in middle-east politics -- this makes it important background info for those trying to figure what US policy should be. And it's fun to read.The book focuses largely on British strategy toward the mid-east during and in the aftermath of WWI, ranged against competing interests on the part of France, the US, Germany, Russia, Turkey, Greece, and other countries. Fromkin identifies how the British government (and others) made a series of poor decisions, often in ignorance of the cultures and political institutions of the mid-eastern geographies they sought to carve up into European-like nation states, frequently misjudging the interests of allies or the preferences of their own voters, sometimes falling into delusional conspiracy theories about the actions of enemies, and all-too-often stumbling against the intransigence of the civilian and military bureaucracies charged with implementing unpopular decisions. In the end, \\"British policy-makers imposed a settlement upon the Middle East in 1922 in which, for the most part, they themselves no longer believed.\\" The problems with the settlement reverberate today.The book is a page-turner. The arguments are carefully documented, but the narrative is nonetheless fluid and exciting. Fromkin does an excellent job capturing the pyschology of the political actors, e.g., Sykes as enthusiastic and naieve; Lloyd George as smart, over-reaching, and out of touch; TE Lawrence as an adventurer and opportunist; Churchill as clear-sighted, controversial, and indomitable. The reader feels as if he or she has gotten to know these people and how they thought."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Who will become the Edward Gibbon of the British Empire? How many volumes will be required to chronicle the expansion and decline of the Anglo-Norman people in their globe-girdling endeavour? How many different nations and cultures came under their domination or control? Will that historian see the first signs of the Empire's decline in its dismemberment of a rival empire - the Ottoman? Britain's last imperial thrusts occurred while it was embroiled in a global war - the \\"war to end all war\\". The irony of this title lies in that Britain's expansion into the Middle East resulted in turning an icon of stability into today's cockpit of conflicting interests.Fromkin, while not the BE's \\"Gibbon\\", exquisitely details the last expansionary gasp of Britain's global realm. Opening with the early years of the Twentieth Century, he explains how the outbreak of war in 1914 triggered vast changes in the Middle East. The events on the \\"Western Front\\" fade almost into obscurity behind the intrigues to partition the Ottoman Empire. He carefully examines the international competition over what appeared to be useless desert. Nearly every European power sought control of the trade routes into the Far East. Russia, long in quest of the Dardanelles as a route to the Mediterranean and beyond, naturally clashed with the British Empire. France, although Britain's ally, remained a trade competitor.Although the phrase \\"Balance of Power\\" was often used to typify the international situation prior to WWI, the reality was that Britain dominated the seas. Retaining that situation was fundamental to British policy-making. There had already been clashes in Afghanistan, gateway to India from the north. Russia as an ally in the European conflict was an uneasy liaison since her aim to control the Near East remained clear. In Fromkin's view, the clash between the British Empire and her challengers is \\"the Great Game\\". The \\"Great War\\" was little more than an incident by contrast. None of the Powers foresaw the immense bloodletting World War I would become, nor was the overthrow of the Czarist government by the Bolsheviks a factor in imperial planning.The Ottoman Empire, weakened by internal dissent and breakaway \\"provinces\\" like Greece and Bulgaria, sought protective alliances. Given the enormity of the task and the reshuffling of power such an enterprise entailed, no European nation sought the responsibility. Yet, the breakup of the Ottaman structure remained an undercurrent in many foreign policies. Only Germany, seeking a fresh route to intrude on British global hegemony, found the prospect useful. Bogged down on the Western Front, the use of Turkish troops to embroil the British in another region had strong appeal. Fromkin traces the tangled diplomacy and military adventures resulting from the new alignments. The parade of personalities, their histories and outlooks, is almost staggering in its completeness and complexities. Among the British figures of major importance, Fromkin depicts Sir Mark Sykes as one of the most influential. Sykes, well versed in affairs of the region, noted that there were \\"no Ottomans\\", nor an Ottoman nation providing a core for their \\"Empire\\". Fromkin refers to it as the \\"incoherent Empire\\" - a view Sykes continually kept before the Foreign Office mandarins.When a Turkish faction, known as the Young Turks, formed the Committee of Union and Progress [C.U.P.], it was the herald of a possible new arrangement. Founded on the notion of Turkish nationalism, it struggled to produce a new nation, while dissolving the old Empire. Sykes, knowing that dissolution of the Ottoman Empire threatened the British one, maneuvered policy to strengthen British influence in the Near East. Although the present scramble of nations in the Middle East has many fathers, Sykes may be viewed as among the most influential. In the course of the war and later, he's to be in found such diverse places as St Petersburg and Cairo. He's involved in the formation of various Middle East nations that now command the headlines and news broadcasts. Although there were many compromises and adjustments, it was, according to Fromkin, Sykes' views that were finally implemented in the creation of Iraq, Iran, Syria and the other nations we're now familiar with. They are the offspring of two empires. It is Sykes who is credited with creating the term \\"Middle East\\" in reference to a segment of the British Empire. Yet, for all his influence and maneuvering, he was beset by strange prejudices - not least of which was the notion that the Ottoman government was dominated by Jews.Fromkin's choice of subject is too complex and intense to allow a prose style that is anything more than straightforward and informative. Even so, the behaviour of his cast renders embellishment unnecessary. Each attempt by people such as Churchill, Balfour, Lloyd George, and the multitude of Turkish and Arab plotters, schemers and manipulators to guide events, seems to prove elusive. Fromkin follows their maneuverings and attempts to resolve differences with superiour skill. The book reads almost as a shining example of adventure or spy fiction. Nothing may be skipped, and he keeps the various threads of intrigue and manipulation under tight control. It takes a special talent to make an historical account a \\"page-turner\\", and Fromkin achieves that in this book with deceptive ease. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Fromkin's work draws from a wide variety of sources, approaching the issues from different perspectives. It clearly exhibits the fact that, on the contrary to the ex-post official histories, the policies for greater Middle East had developed almost haphazardly. Much of his comments regarding T.E. Lawrance refers to Desmond Stewart's biography of the latter, thus should be taken with some reservation. An absolute must for individuals interested in comtemporary world politics."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"I enjoyed this book,it covers the period roughly between the late 19th century up to 1922 and is focused on an area much larger than the Middle East of today. It is full of facts and informative and yet fairly easy to read through. At the same time I agree with the reviewer who stated that the historical sequencing of some events is confusing. Fromkin just sticks the emergence of Zionism in at the point when he discusses it's main supporter - LLoyd George. There are other points where he goes back to go forward, which is sore on the brain, and there are some chapters (Afghanistan, Persia, A Greek Tragedy) that seem tangential to his main theme and could probably have been left out.His main theme, as I read it, is that the modern Middle East is the creation of diplomats and military officials of colonial powers playing the 'Great Game' using nations and people as strategic pieces, hoping to checkmate their opponents. The main protagonists were Britain, France, Germany and Russia, and the chessboard was the Ottoman Empire. There are many players mentioned but the three that get the most attention are Winston Churchill, Lord Kitchener and LLoyd George. The author very early on states that 'no man played a more crucial role...in giving birth to the Middle East we live with today than Churchill... there are frontier lines now running across the Middle East that are scar lines from those encounters with him.&quot; Although Churchill is mentioned often, in his many different capacities, ending as Colonial Secretary, it is not always clear how he made such a difference.It is very clear that colonial administrators were clueless about the countries and people that they were making decisions about. At best, decisions were made on incomplete information or based on misunderstandings. At worse, and startling in that it was so prevalent, decisions were made on racist, bigoted and simply ignorant assumptions. There was a degree of anti-semitism in British colonial thinking that allowed them to see international, Jewish, freemasonry conspriracies where there was no such thing, nor has there ever been. It wasn't just the British. The Germans, Russians and French were equally adept at developing and acting on discriminatory, narrow minded and self serving policies. How these competing interests were cynically played out in what is now the Middle East is where the book excells. The picture of the various generals, diplomats, Lords, Prime Ministers and rulers of all types eagerly swaping and trading territories like some game pieces is a very vivid image created after reading this book. I am left with an impression of a gigantic real life game of 'Risk'"},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"A Peace to End All Peace has a well deserved reputation as one of the more important works written on the history of the modern Middle East. David Fromkin's narrative focuses on the years between 1914 and 1922 and follows in often intricate detail the diplomatic maneuvers made by the Allied Powers in regard to the Middle East both during World War I and after the peace.It charts the making and breaking of alliances, agreements, and promises (between the Allied powers themselves and between the Allied powers and various Arab and Turk leaders), as well as the political careers of Churchill, Kitchener, Lloyd George, Enver Pasha, and Mustapha Kemal (among many others), the exploits of T.E. Lawrence and Feisal, the fight between France and Britain in regard to Syria, the defeat of the Greeks by Ataturk and the burning of Smyrna, the conflicts between the Egyptian and Indian factions of the British government, the rise of Zionism and the reaction of the Arabs to Jewish immigration in Palestine, the division of the Ottoman Empire into secular nation states on the Western model, and the constant disconnect between plans made in conference rooms based on faulty or misleading intelligence and real conditions on the ground.This is a very complex history but that is as it should be. Middle Eastern policy was a tangled web of various factions working for different aims, based on often conflicting intelligence, and Fromkin has done an excellent job of making this tangled web intelligible. There is a ton of information packed into this book. Fromkin also provides minor portraits of all of the major players involved in the eventual Middle Eastern settlement which adds a personal and human touch to his complex narrative.It quickly becomes apparent when reading this book that politicians and diplomatists often have a tendency to see what they want to see (WMD's?). Britain was under the constant illusion that the Arabs in the Middle East wanted British rule, or, at least preferred British rule to the rule of France or the Turks. When local populations in the Middle East under their rule began to cause disturbances they immediately came to the conclusion that the disturbances were instigated by a Jewish/German/Bolshevik/Turkish conspiracy (failing to see the degree to which these groups were often at variance with each other) and, therefore, totally misinterpreted the situation. They failed to understand the strength of Islamic religious conviction and the degree to which Muslims resented being ruled by non-Muslims. It does not seem to me that this particular bit of intelligence would have been very difficult to come by if the British had eyes to see. But they preferred to see what they wanted to see.In the last chapter of the book Fromkin draws a parallel between the collapse of the Roman Empire (and the roughly 1500 years it took for Europe to reach a stable division into independent nation states) and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Fromkin writes, \\"The continuing crisis in the Middle East in our time may prove to be nowhere so profound or long-lasting. But its issue is the same: how diverse peoples are to regroup to create new political identities for themselves after the collapse of an ages-old imperial order to which they had grown accustomed....The settlement of 1922, therefore, does not belong entirely or even mostly to the past: it is at the very heart of current wars, conflicts, and politics in the Middle East\\" (pg563). For anyone hoping to get a better understanding of these continuing conflicts in the Middle East David Fromkin's A Peace to End All Peace is an absolutely essential read."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Responsible citizens of the West today cannot afford to ignore the history of the Middle East. As other reviewers here have commented, this book alone will not serve to enlighten you on all that is going on in the Middle East today. However it is a good start, and it illustrates what has worked and what has not worked in the past when the West has dealings with Middle Eastern cultures and countries. It is not an area of the world that can simply be ignored.David Fromkin did the world a favor in writing this book and makes the History of the Middle East come alive. He is thoroughly readable. This is a history book that is hard to put down once you have started. It also does much to chronicle events and battles of WWI that are not readily available in most books concerning that war, yet have perhaps had longer lasting impact on the history following."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Draws on original sources to document the political considerations on the part of power brokers of the pre-WW I world. If you want to understand the Middle East today, you need to understand how the current boundaries were determined and how the decisions made by foreigners in the early part of the 20th century led to the convoluted mess that is Middle Eastern politics today. The hubris of the British, French, and Russians of 1900 is matched only by that of the Americans today."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book explains how the Western powers divided the Middle East in the wake of the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the end of World War One. To understand the Middle East today, to understand the attitude of Arab and other Middle Eastern nations towards America, the UK, and Israel, it is absolutely indispensible to appreciate what happened at that juncture in history and why. The platitudinous and oversimplified slogans and headlines of our mass media routinely underserve the reader of current events in the Middle East, but an in depth study of history is the antidote. The author is healing ignorance with this book, covering the relevant and required topics evenly and interestingly. Its a big task but Fromkin does it, and the result is complicated but necessarily so.The book includes much important information concerning Zionism, the political movement to settle Western Jews in Palestine and establish a Jewish ethnic homeland there, which culminated in 1947 with the founding of the Jewish state of Israel. However, if I could find only one fault with this book, and only one suggestion for improvement in an updated editing, it would be that this material should be expanded. One can understand why it might have been a light touch, considering how hotly feelings run on the topic among those who are familiar with Middle Eastern history and current events. Yet, the author's narrative economizes on space devoted to this topic to the point of omission. A fantastic book this is, but expansion of the treatment on this topic would bring definite improvement. The challenge of course is that the culmination of the Zionist project was after World War Two, but the time frame in this book precedes it. Perhaps a companion volume could be recommended to the author?Historians may recall the Gordian knot-- legend says that he who could untie it would conquer Asia. Alexander the Great cut it, and conquered Asia. To reverse the legend, it seems to me like understanding the Middle East is like understanding how a new Gordian knot was tied in the wake of the fall of the Ottoman Empire. A most difficult task, and this book accomplishes it."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"David Fromkin's 'A Peace to End All Peace' is a brilliant study on the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the formation of the modern Middle East.The work is filled with a series of continual Allied blunders. In nearly every aspect regarding the Middle East the West was utterly ignorant. The few westerners who lived in the region were isolated from the people and didn't understand the culture. The Allies would continually change sides and strategies during the war. They held onto the false belief that global politics would not change because of WW1. It was the perfect recipe for disaster.Fromkin's outlook on the Middle East is not very optimistic. Before WW1 the Middle East had no conception of the nation-state. Even now the concept of being an Iraqi or Egyptian is still fuzzy and second place. It may take a very long time before the concept of the nation-state becomes ingrained into their geist.\\"The settlement of 1922, therefore, does not belong entirely or even mostly to the past; it is at the very heart of current wars, conflicts, and politics in the Middle East, for the questions that Kitchener, Lloyd George, and Churchill opened up are even now being contested by force of arms, year after year, in the ruined streets of Beirut, along the banks of the slow-moving Tigris-Euphrates, and by the waters of the Biblical Jordan.\\" --- David Fromkin"},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book is about British policy and ambitions in the Middle East more than about the Middle East itself. It provides a compelling argument that political and tactical mistakes (and greed) by the Western powers are to blame for some of the problems in the region today. David Fromkin is not a conventional academic historian. He was a lawyer for many years before becoming a professor, hence his natural focus on political negotiations, diplomatic wrangling, behind-the-scenes maneuvering, machinations, power plays, disputes among government factions, etc. He does an excellent job of laying all this out.Fromkin writes in an engaging style and his clear organization makes this long book fairly easy to read. The only part that disappointed me was the discussion of Central Asia, which is vague and incomplete. Fromkin does not identify the ethnicity/nationality of the players involved. He inaccurately and collectively refers to the peoples of this region as \\"Turkish speakers\\"--in fact most (but not all) speak Turkic languages, related but not identical to Turkish. For readers not familiar with Central Asia, it would have been helpful to note the Soviet republics (and now independent nations--Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan) established soon after the episode with Enver Pasha and the Basmachi that Fromkin discusses. A more detailed map could have been included. It would have been interesting to compare Soviet and British policy in the creation of republics or nation-states but this is not touched on. As a location of important oil and gas reserves, Central Asia is once again of strategic interest to regional and world powers (including the U.S.). That Fromkin neglects to provide essential background information on the region is a serious flaw, and looks like a careless oversight. This part of the book could have been better researched. Fromkin is not a Middle East or Central Asia scholar per se, and does not appear to read the languages of the region. There are no Arabic, Turkish (or, also relevant, Russian or German) sources in his bibliography.Fromkin's archival research has been mostly in British diplomacy and Zionism, and this is where his book is most informative. He has obviously combed through an enormous amount of material. Interested readers will need to look elsewhere for the perspective of the Middle Eastern peoples themselves, and may disagree with Fromkin's interpretations of events, but will gain much from the abundant factual material presented here. We learn, sadly, how very much history repeats itself."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"Wonderfully written but I agree it needs to refer to Turkish documents.

Along with Friedman's excellent \\"From Beirut To Jerusalem\\", this is one of the best books I have come across for that purpose. The two books are not the only books you should read, but they are complementary and a good place to start. The only complaint I would make is that I wish there were more and more detailed maps, but that is a small quibble, especially since I ALWAYS want more and more detailed maps no matter what book I am reading. Last year I came across a dilapidated bound copy of the major post-WWI treaties, which was published sometime during the 1920s. It was supposed to include a collection of full color, highly detailed maps showing the areas affected by the treaties. Unfortunately, the maps were contained in a second and separate volume which was not present in the trash box I found the book in.

First, the history is somewhat lacking. I came to reading with a good deal of knowledge about it already, but someone without that prior knowledge might be lost. This is to some degree a reflection of Fromkin's scope, 7 or so years over a wide geographic area. Second, this book just wasn't satisfying. I can't really explain it, but I left this book feeling like I needed to know more, that reading those 600 pages had told an incomplete story.

He details very well the inept and often corrupt dealings of the colonial powers but he stops there. The problems with the clan fighting etc did not start in the early 20th century nor are they solely to blame by the \\"Peace to End All Peace\\".The book is well researched and written better.

Not only did a few Europeans sit down one day and draw lines on a map that they didn't really understand, but they managed to pollute even that level of ignorance with political infighting and diplomatic conspiracy: the British wanted to harm the French, the Soviets (after the 1917 revolution) wanted to strike a blow against British empire, the British wanted to protect their route to India by controlling Afghanistan and Syria, and a hundred other allegiances besides. Only very occasionally did anyone have the vaguest connection with actual Middle Easterners.Among other major mistakes made by the Western powers, a few stand out:1. Treating \`Arabs' or even \`Muslims' as homogeneous groups when in fact there were dozens of sects and families that mutually mistrusted one another. (Imagine installing a Catholic president in the United States and expecting that Lutherans, say, would go along with his rule. See also \\"Popery\\".)2. Deciding to back Hussein and his children, making his son Faisal king of Iraq and Abudllah emir of Transjordan (now Jordan). The British assumed that Hussein had hundreds of thousands of rabid followers, when as it happens he had only a few thousand.3. Assuming that the Syrians would prefer to cast off the French yoke and put on the British one, rather than desiring a nation of their own. When the Western powers encountered resistance to their rule, they seemed confused about why this was happening.4. Bargaining over the destiny of the Middle East without really paying attention to what Middle Easterners wanted. See, in particular, the Sykes-Picot Agreement, whereby the British and French secretly agreed on the fate of Syria. The British, at least, seemed convinced that \`public opinion,' in the Western sense, didn't make any sense in the Middle East, but Fromkin never really explains what they meant.5. Assuming that a Western government -- checks and balances, centralized administration and so forth -- made sense in a region that had long been held together tenuously under Ottoman-style administration. (Fromkin's one- or two-page explanation of the Ottoman background is funny and illuminating. I would have liked more pre-history.)6. Maybe most humorously, if it weren't so tragic and outdated: assuming that Jews were the secret motive force behind everything happening in the world. The Balfour declaration, offering British support for a Jewish homeland in the Middle East, was originally conceived to help the British win World War I: give the all-powerful Jews something, and they'll get on your side and help defeat the Germans (whom the Jews, by supposition, controlled). Somehow this existed cheek by jowl alongside rabid anti-Semitism in official Britain, and alongside knowledge of the pogroms that the Jews were trying to escape in Russia. How the British managed to square this particular circle would be a fascinating book on its own.Charging guns blazing into the Middle East, the British decided to topple the Ottoman Empire rather than prop it up as a block against the Russians -- as they had been doing for at least a century. (Interesting Statistics Department: Fromkin reports that the Russian Empire had been growing at a rate of 50 square miles per day for 400 years.) With World War I plodding along, and the combatants realizing early on that they would gain no territory within Europe, they decided that they had to expand their empires elsewhere. So they set about on the purely bureaucratic job of carving up the Middle East without understanding what they were getting into. So they created a power vacuum, which the locals very quickly filled with their own brand of rule that matched up not at all with what the West had in mind.Analogies to the present day are, of course, illusory."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"This book was a required reading for a class I took on the modern Middle East.

However, have no doubt it is a tough read, but it is well worth the work. Absolutely essential for anyone who want to understand what, who and why the Middle East is what it is."},{"Title":"A Peace to End all Peace","review":"&quot;A Peace to End All Peace&quot; is a book to end all books on the middle east.The book studies the formation of the modern middle east-and the crumbling of the former Ottoman Empire-from the period 1914-1922. At the onset of this time, Britain ruled the world, the Czar ran Russia, and the US was just an up and comer. At the end of this period, Britain's imperial ambitions were waning, Russia was now the Soviet Union, and the US had demonstrated its power through its presence in WW I.Through the careful research and well thought-out text, the reader can see how the modern day nations of Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan, and Turkey were formed. You can see also see how their modern day troubles were created. It's all here: the beginning of Jewish-Arab troubles in Palestine, the shaky start to Iraq, the careless partioning of Lebanon and so on.Many thing impressed me about this book but perhaps none more than the role that bad intelligence played in the formation of Britain's foreign policy. I know: it's unbelievably relevant in the world of 2004 also! However, Britain made a number of decisions throughout World WAr I and after based on information and analyses that were simply untrue. While much has changed since then in terms of the transmitting of information, still the problems of the gathering of critical intelligence one-to-one remains.I would recommend this book to just about anyone who cares (or who should care) about Middle East politics.

He breaks major sections into compact packages that are easy to read and keep the players in focus. Short chapters of history are interspersed with micro-history/background material. These provide enough information for understanding without getting bogged down. This is especially valuable for those who don't know a Hohenzollern from a holy roller but need to in order to comprehend the world being undone.2) Having maps and photos - just enough to help visualize people and events.3) The \\"who's who\\" reference list was a great idea that helps keep important but unfamiliar players straight.4) It inspired vigorous discussion in our family and made us want to do more research. I appreciated his extensive bibliography.5) Readability! It's a masterwork that is a welcome relief from academic pedantry. Mr. Meyer makes even complex subjects easy to understand and a pleasure to read.It's amazing how much he packs into 700 pages. You will have a vastly greater understanding of what the world was that became \\"undone\\" by this war, how it fell apart and implications for future generations. In the end you're faced with the inevitable reality of what a few can do to screw it up for everyone. Leadership should be taken seriously. Both what people do and what they refrain from doing matter. When history is well done it's also a great character study, and this book does not disappoint. Highly recommended.I heartily agree with the reviewer who recommended bookending this work with The Guns of August and Paris 1919: Six Months that changed the World.

Initially, I wanted to read this book to learn about the history of the Ottoman Empire, but I learned how Allied forces reshaped the geographical as well as the political landscape of this ancient area of the world. This book provides a detailed history of the so-called \\"development\\" of the Middle East beginning in 1914. By 1922 France and Russia as well as Britain had drawn dividing lines separating frontiers, established states and appointed leaders of their own choosing to govern. Today the Middle East is still conflicted from this inherited time.By 1914 a quarter of the globe was under the British Empire's (King George V) control while a sixth was held under the Russian Empire (Tsar Nicholas II). The western hemisphere fell to the United States (President Wilson). After the European nations had divided the continent of Africa, it was looking for a new frontier to conquer and the only one remaining (other than Asia) fell to the Ottoman Empire. In the mists of World War I the Ottoman Empire led by a Sultan and the Young Turks Party aligned itself with the German Empire against the Allied Forces of Britain, Russia, France, Italy and eventually the United States. Ultimate defeat of the Germans led to the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire by the Allied Forces with Britain imposing its imperialist designs over all.Britain especially believed that the people of this area not only wanted, but needed to be governed by them. They would become Protectorates of Britain. Their occupation had destroyed the indigenous political structure. Instead Britain proposed a leadership under European design such as the use of Kings. However, the annexation of the Middle East brought forth a foe that European leaders could not foresee or comprehended. Islam.

The only thing that made me confused each time I read the same thing was that Fromkin is calling the Ottoman Empire before 1920-23 (both are important to make distinction)-even not allways- as &quot;Turkey&quot;. Depending on the historical facts, &quot;Turkey&quot; was established as &quot;Turkish Republic&quot; in 1923. Its parliament was established in 1920. Therefore, I do not think calling the authority of Ottoman Sultan (Empire) before 1923 as &quot;Turkey&quot; is proper.

However, if you are an old hat at the UNIX/Linux environment, then you may want to shy away from this book. I bought it due to the fact that it was a Slackware bases networking book. I'm not new to Linux and found the information to be very informative if I were new to this OS. Even though I have used Linux, I did find value in this book.Moral: Beginner with Linux and you want to get into networking, then buy this book.

It is full value for money in my configuration, but I can not give it full marks because of the somewhat dated kernel, and incompatibility with more popular distributions, but what the heck, I learned the essentials and my dedicated modemserver for a small network works very well using the CDROM, though dated it was not wasted. Found it very usefull."},{"Title":"The LINUX Network","review":"In the preface there is a line that reads, &quot;We have tested and re-tested the descriptions in this book to ensure their accuracy; however, despite our best efforts, this book may still contain errors.&quot;In fact, this line really should have read, &quot;We have not tested the descriptions in this book to ensure their accuracy; this book will contain many errors.&quot;Notice: the book is full of mistakes and is dangerously misleading in more than a few areas. I would have given it 5 stars had I reviewed it early on, but as I delved deeper into the reading, relying on it heavily as a reference, it became evident that many of the explanations were misleading, ill-referenced, erroneous, and/or downright incorrect.Even great authors are not exempt from the responsibility of proofreading their work. It seems this book missed that phase altogether. In some sections, you cannot read a single page without finding an error. (Ex: DNS). Many of the errors, unfortunately, are not trivial:- The definition of Input in the IP masquerading section is wrong. &quot;Input&quot; in and of itself does not specify direction. Input can be from the Internet as well as from the Intranet. Ironically, the back-to-back definition for Output IS correct--small example of many such inconsistencies throughout the book.- The explanation on setting up two ethernet cards, aside from being inconsistent, fails to mention something very important. Passing arguments to the kernel through lilo.conf only works if the NIC's driver is compiled directly into the kernel. If the NIC is being loaded as a module, then parameters need to be passed through conf.modules NOT lilo.conf. In chapter 3 the user is instructed to compile the Ethernet driver directly into the kernel, granted, but not a single thing is said about the option and ramifications of compiling Ethernet drivers as modules instead, a very common and efficient practice for many Linux users.- Where descriptions are brief, the author points the reader to the end of the chapter for &quot;additional reference.&quot; When the reader flips to the end of the chapter, what do you know? There are no references there.- The part on Configuring Masquerading (p.343) claims that &quot;if you compiled IP masquerading directly into the kernel, you do not have to do anything to configure it.&quot; (...referring to whether or not you have to load any IP Masquerading modules). This is clearly untrue as the ftp module, for example, still needs to be loaded as a module regardless of whether IP Masquerading was compiled directly into the kernel or not.- The author says &quot;you cannot use ping to test masquerading, because the ICMP...protocol doesn't have a source-port field.&quot; (p.346) Theoretically, true. Realistically, you can ping through IP masquerading till your heart's content. The fix has been around for some time now and is a standard feature of ipfwadm.The problem with such mistakes is that they appear not a few times throughout the book, but many times. These are but a few examples.Overall, the book proves to be a mere (albeit good) compliment to man pages, newsgroup postings, and howto's, not only because many of its explanations are incomplete and/or ambiguous, but because the reader suspects the need to confirm the validity of some of the information given. Moreover, and to the point of aggravation, the author repeatedly points the user to the man pages to get a complete understanding of how things work.My recommendation: buy the book. It is extremely helpful and I recommend it. But beware. The recklessness with which things are laid out and the glaring mistakes resulting from this, warrant that the reader approach this book with a very cautious study.--Daniel"},{"Title":"The LINUX Network","review":"I found this book very useful, coming from a Windows environment with some UNIX shell experience. BUT if you use Red Hat 5.2, it is almost completely useless (this is Red Hat's fault, not the book!) It took me 1 weekend to read the book and setup a slackware linux server on the Internet. The instructions were amazingly clear and very aware of &quot;newbie/intermediate&quot; readers who might not know all the ins and outs of Linux. It took me another whole week to figure what Red Hat called the same network files and in what directories they put them in, before I got Red Hat 5.2 up and running correctly. Two examples, just try to find rc.inet1 and rc.inet2 in RH 5.2. And then go and try to get the kernel source code off the CDROM and install it on the machine and you'll see what I mean. By the way I only gave it 4 stars since I wish it had included the Red Hat material. Despite that, it is my Linux networking bible, period."},{"Title":"The LINUX Network","review":"I originally purchased this book to see if I could finally get some concise information on allowing my Windows machines to work with linux(Samba).

It covers in pretty good detail several aspects of Linux Networking to include Mail, DNS, SAMBA, Security, Setting up Intranets, connecting your intranet to the internet and much more. Although it is geared towards the slackware distribution, I did not find it to difficult to translate.Becuase of what I learned in this book I am now getting full usage of my linux box. I am now routing all mail and internet access thru my linux DNS server.

Things have changed a bit since then (my book deals with kernel 2.0.35), and for the better (easier card configuration/detection, more intuitive GUI tools.. ), but for the hardcore LINUX/UNIX command liners, this is still an invaluable resource. And it comes bundled with Slackware, one of the best older distributions for power users that want to tweak to the death their systems. (Sorry I can't say the same about the 2.2 kernel Slackware's :( )"},{"Title":"The LINUX Network","review":"Well, this book is a very good book, BUT, for beginners in networking AND - it is unfortunately outdated (it regards the 2.0 kernel rather than the *significantly* different 2.2 kernel). Also, if we're here, why not make this book compilant with RedHat which has 50% of the market share of Linux dist's ? (rather than really asking here, I mean more: pay attention to the fact that RedHat current version (6) is quite different in networking configuration details from the book's Slackware version). IN DETAIL: It is written well from the basics of protocols throughout almost everything you'll need to know about networking, which is a HUGE subject, so dont be surprise that it's security section, for example, is only 20 pages long. All in all it does a very good job in explaining the background and walking you through the details of configuration, so beginners will benefit a lot (but I mean here only real newbies to networking). CONCLUSION: Trying to cover networking details of a UNIX ditro' in one book (!)is probably mission impossible, so we're doomd to start with something that must cut corners somewhere - KEEP THAT IN MIND... . If you're a newbie with a hacker's soul - this book is for you (you can benefit alot). Otherwise - it might not be the best book for you."},{"Title":"The LINUX Network","review":"Overall, The Linux Network includes some good information on setting up networking in general on Linux/Unix machines. However, the spelling mistakes and other errors are really annoying at times. If the mistakes were only small ones, I wouldn't be so picky, but there were errors like sonfusing &quot;DSP&quot; for &quot;DNS&quot; and mixing up the name of a newly created kernel. Also, the author spends too much time noting that a certain topic is &quot;beyond the scope of this book&quot;. Although it is impossible to cover everything, it would make sense to just go on to the next topic. Finally, he spends more time introducing/ending the next chapter/section than actually writing the chapter. But, I'll recommend this book to anyone interested in Linux networking, as long as he doesn't mind the errors and somewhat flawed organization of the book."},{"Title":"The LINUX Network","review":"GOOD!

One thing that happens to straight friends and relatives at someone's coming-out is that the gay person is out and the family or friends go into the closet. This book explores how family and friends deal with gayness and how they come out of their closets, too. There is a briefest of brief introductions that summarizes the stories to follow, and there is a fairly extensive resource guide in the back full of addresses and organizations of every kind for information, support, and advice. If you are a straight friend or family member of a gay person, this is a great resource--although I think you might also profit from books such as:Coming Out of Shame--written for gay and lesbian people but for a straight reader an important and valuable insight into gay and lesbian people's feelings and emotional difficulties coming outStranger at the Gate--if you have conflicted religious views, this autobiography is invaluableIn the end, however, this is a great first step to coming to understand and support the gay or lesbian person in your life.

Noyed is part of the &quot;Alphabet Friends&quot; series, which devotes one 24-page volume to each letter of the alphabet. The idea is of these volumes is to give beginning readers a fun way of mastering letter recognition by telling an entertaining story highlighting a single letter. In &quot;Imagination and the Letter I&quot; young readers meet a young boy named Ivan who likes to likes to imagine things, especially if they are things that begin with the letter &quot;i&quot; like island, igloo and iguana. Words that begin with the letter &quot;i&quot; are highlighted on each page with rebus drawings of Ivan, his island, and the rest. Each page of simple text appears on the left hand side of the page while the right has a color photograph. Beginning readers will notice that not all of the words beginning with an &quot;i&quot; are highlighted, so they will be able to discover some on their own, which will just help them want to learn to read this book on their own just that much faster.The idea here is for young children to eventually be able to read them books for themselves, and with the simple, solid approach used by Klingel and Noyed this should be quite possible. Beginning readers are introduced to not only the difference between the capital &quot;I&quot; and the lowercase &quot;i&quot; but the difference between the long sound in words like &quot;island&quot; and the short sound in words like &quot;inning.&quot; There is also the distinction drawn between words where the letter &quot;i&quot; begins (&quot;igloo&quot;), comes in the middle (&quot;cabin&quot;) or ends a word (&quot;macaroni&quot;). In the back of the book there are three columns of words representing those three possibilities (but &quot;macaroni&quot; is the only one in the final column; probably because all you are going to come up with are types of pasta and that is way too much starch for young kids). For that matter the Fun Facts in this volume are reduced to just two, igloo and iguana, along with suggestions on a couple of age appropriate books on each for kids to check out next."},{"Title":"What Makes Me, Me?","review":"This is truly an amazing book. It is very nicely illustrated and the text is clear and to the point. The first half of the book, on the structure of the body, the organs etc. is very good, but really nothing that cannot be found in many other \\"Human Body\\" books for young readers. Where Winston stands out and gives his best, is in the second half of the book. \\"The brain is the organ that creates the real you\\" says Winston as he introduces wonderfully simple and yet informative and thought provoking chapters in which he touches on \\"Thoughts\\", \\"Daydreaming\\", \\"Right or left handed\\", \\"Memory\\", \\"Can I change my brain\\", \\"Personality: introvert, extrovert\\", \\"Dreams\\", \\"Emotions\\", \\"Body language\\" and more.

In short, this is the best book for a reader who wants a real view of how geographical profiling and investigative psychology can be utilized in investigations.It is this reader's recommendation to stick to books written by Dr. David Canter, Dr. Laurence Alison and academic journals if you are involved on hands on work in the field of Investigative / Forensic Psychology."},{"Title":"Criminal Shadows, Inner Narratives of Evil","review":"Having a strong interest in true crime, with an emphasis on the psychology behind the criminal mind, I found this book imformative and entertaining. Unlike many books in this gendre it does not explore extensive graphic crime detail, but sufficient to provide an example of a point being made. The book wonderfully details a very scientific approach to understanding the criminal mind and profiling. It is interesting how a strong emphasis is placed on geographic profiling, the book explains the reasons for this.Clearly anyone who has studied some basic psychology and the works of well known 'theorists' will enjoy some sections more than those who haven't. If you haven't don't worry there are many sections anyone interested in the subjuct matter will find facinating. You may well discover a little about yourself.Overall if you are interested in psychological profiling and how it works get a copy and have a read."},{"Title":"Criminal Shadows, Inner Narratives of Evil","review":"Dr. Canter's book is the best book I have read on the subject of criminal profiling.

It's far more than just the best plays, it's virtually every play.Of course it covers Broadway. But it also covers OFF Broadway, and OFF OFF Broadway. And it covers the major regional theaters around the country.Yes, it does have a section on what they consider to be the best plays of the season. But this section is only about a hundred pages and is really a description of these 'best' plays. I almost never agree with their selection of these as the really best plays, but I expect that their internal discussions must get pretty 'spirited.'Basically this is the book of what happened in theater from June 2003 to May 2004. Some of the things they cover: cast changes in ongoing Broadway plays, new plays published, long running plays, an In Memoriam, awards -- and the list could go on. It's what happened in theater."},{"Title":"Getting Older, Growing Wiser","review":"I couldn't resist this book as I am getting older - it has precious words of wisdom to help me with myspiritual growth at this time of my life."},{"Title":"Spoken Finnish","review":"I purchased this book because I was impressed by other books in the series. However, don't be fooled into thinking that all books in the same series are going to be of the same quality. Although the basis of these books is the material taken from US forces instruction manuals not all authors follow the guidelines so closely. Some will include phonetic transcription of the dialogues some won't. Also, not all courses come with adequate audio material. Some of the courses I have used have had really bad audio material come with them, so much so that it renders the pronunciation practice and listening exercises impossible. Some of them, as this does, only come with a limited number of cassettes. Most courses come with six cassettes which is enough to cover the first twelve units of each course sufficiently. This course had only three cassettes which I assumed meant there were relatively few listening exercises and only a small chapter for pronunciation. Unfortunately I was dead wrong. The course contains the same number of exercises as the others but does not have the audio to cover it rendering it pointless. If I had known this I would not have bothered buying only three cassettes. I would return this to be honest except for the fact it would cost more money to return it from England. In all the book would be quite useful if a native speaker were to hand throughout the course as the instruction book suggests. However, for most people buying this (like myself) I doubt there will be any native speakers for miles around."},{"Title":"Uncommon Cures for Everyday Ailments, from the editors of Bottom Line/Health","review":"I don't know about the other items, but I found it an excellent guide to lower my high cholesterol.

And other chapters are hard-hitting investigative journalism--into the lives of girls cut off from education by budget cuts in their counties or their families, or women left to run the farms as the agricultural workforce turns mainly female, or migrant women working in the maquiladora factories of Guangdong. There's fascinating little glimpses into history, like a piece on female roles in the old Peking Opera, or on an exclusively women's writing system developed long ago in a region of Hunan.All told, the book gives a feel for the rapidly shifting challenges and tactics of China's women's movement.--author of A Galaxy of Immortal Women: The Yin Side of Chinese Civilization"},{"Title":"Strengthening Marital Intimacy: Elements in the Process","review":"This book is tremendous on communication, companionship, and commitment, especially in todays uncertain world.

Hawkins, \\"Strengthening Marital Intimacy\\" was a concise and interesting look at God's design for marriage and what intimacy in marriage - according to God - is. In the opening chapter the author says, \\"God created male and female to function as a team and share the joys of God's creation. Satan drove a wedge between them, and over the centuries males and females have been locked in a tragic power struggle.\\"How true it is that discovering intimacy in marriage is an often sought after and seldom discovered reality in the lives of believers and non believers alike. We are all victims of the fall of humanity into sin and self indulgence. The author goes on to point out that it is in fact God's desire for couples to operate at the level of spiritual unity and intimacy. The biggest trouble though is that people have been conditioned to misunderstand what intimacy really is.There are many people who live under the mistaken impression that intimacy is primarily or even solely a physical reality but this is simply not the case. God has intended for couples to live in a condition of spiritual intimacy, intimacy of the soul or intellect, as well as physical intimacy. A primary barrier to intimacy that is pointed out by the author is anger which gets in the way of an intimate relationship. People do not respond in close and loving ways to others who explode at them in anger or rage.Commitment is the base upon which solid marriages are built. Particularly in a biblical sense, commitment is something far greater than merely an emotional response to feeling dedicated to another individual. A Marriage is a contractual obligation that each partner enters into with the other partner. This commitment is an active commitment which entails numerous activities and responsibilities on a continual basis. The marriage does not happen at the moment of the saying of vows and the giving and receiving of rings! That is merely the stepping off point in a new adventure together.In order to build and sustain a life long lasting committed and intimate relationship a couple must be firmly grounded in the wisdom that God has revealed in order to enable couples to make good choices and wise decisions as they travel the journey of this life together. God has given the ultimate revelation of this wisdom in His Son, Jesus Christ. A couple that looks to Christ as the source of all wisdom for marriage and for godly living will find the strength, wisdom, and encouragement necessary to create intimacy within the home. A couple that looks to their wisdom apart from Christ is not likely to find success in these areas.In order to create a marriage which is satisfying and nurturing, each couple must have an outward and obvious commitment to companioning. If each partner in a marriage is going in a different direction in life then true intimacy can never be achieved and will never be maintained. Couples who have committed first and foremost to being one another's companion in relevant and obvious ways are most likely to enjoy all that God intended their marriages to be!I am inclined to agree very much with the author in what he has spoken in this work. Marriage is a process of continual commitment to one another and intimacy can not be achieved through a one weekend seminary in and of itself - it is a process of continual growth and commitment to Christ and to one another. In the home where this commitment is clear and obvious and in the home where Christ is free to reign in the hearts and lives of couples, then He will be glorified in a healthy and intimate marriage, Where the Scriptures and their author are excluded the opposite will most likely be the case.I found particularly helpful the section of the book where the author reminds us of the important aspect of understanding the other person in the marriage. It is all too easy to fall into the trap of forgetting that the other person is not an extension of your hopes and desires but is a person with hopes and desires him or herself. \\"It takes a conscious effort to understand your spouse. You must appreciate the physical, intellectual, emotional, volitional, and spiritual dimensions of his or her personality.\\"In reading this work I was reminded of the importance of having a daily commitment to knowing and loving my spouse. This was not a life changing experience for me but it was a helpful reminder and a bolstering of already held convictions. In that way, it was a very positive experience and a helpful addition to my knowledge and commitment to strengthening the intimacy within my marriage and in my work as a local church Pastor.I recommend this book strongly to pastors, lay counselors, and professional Christian counselors alike."},{"Title":"Strengthening Marital Intimacy: Elements in the Process","review":"\\".....

The attempts to explain the main characteristics of the Renaissance through vignettes of various archetypical symbols of the Renaissance, from the Prince and the Condottiere to the Artist and the Explorer. Each vignette is written by a different contributor.In general, this work is a fairly well-done example of the multi-authored collection common in historical studies. The quality of scholarship and eloquence is variable. Peter Burke's article on the Courtier is both well-written and was a mechanism for expressing the power of the state through courtly pageantry and display. Alberto Tenenti very ably demonstrates that the Renaissance merchant's pension for precision, order, and practicality had a significant (and essentially salutary) impact on Europe's cultural life, inspiring the rising scientist for a passion for exactitude, for instance. On the other hand, several essays suffer from presenting simplistic and sometimes poorly argued theses, of the \\"traditional scholarship has it all wrong\\" variety.The essays lack any annoying preoccupation with technical jargon or obsession with dubious theoretical analyses. Nevertheless, the failure of the translator to render into English some quotations from Latin or the Romance languages can serve no purpose but to cloud the understanding of readers who cannot profess a mastery of the European family of languages.The most severe problems with this work tend to be endemic with such collections of essays. There is virtually no attempt at any holistic unifying theme: the articles seem simply to have been collected together and published, without any attempt to inter-relate the Renaissance archetypes, or explain their importance for our understanding of the Renaissance, much less define what we really mean by the term \\"the Renaissance.\\"In addition, to reduce the Renaissance (both Italian and Northern) to 273 pages of text necessitates a cursory examination of the subject. For example, the almost breathless examination of the life of women in the Renaissance, by Margaret King, leaves the reader hungry for some flesh to be added to the mere skeletal outline she provides of her subject.In conclusion, for those interested in a short work on the Renaissance which is nevertheless beyond the introductory level, I would recommend this work, with the limitations discussed above."},{"Title":"Walk of Fame","review":"To buy or not to buy? -- or to borrow from the library? Buy this one. Hilarious and poignant, it's one of the best reads I've ever had. Ever.Average-guy, history buff, overweight financial writer Tom Webster, who bills himself as Tom The Okay (as compared to his heroes Alexander the Great and William the Conqueror) is about to get a taste of celebrity. \\"The Vulture,\\" a pop-culture magazine, assigns him to concoct a scheme -- any scheme -- so fabulous that it will gain him instant fame. His mission: keep the scam a secret from everyone and keenly observe the ways his new-found celebrity status changes the way he's treated by everyone from his best friend to his doorman and all the hangers-on in between.Tom does put together a fantastic scheme. He becomes obscenely famous. The reactions of those around him are positively delicious. Especially satisfying are the stunned responses of his ex-wife and of his best friend (who also happens to be the ex-wife's new squeeze). Krum is a wonderful suck-you-in writer and the reader shares Tom's marvelous adventure in full. Krum also has a magnificent sense of humor and the pages positively rollick. Warning: don't pick it up on a night you hope to get to sleep early.Tom doesn't escape fame's hell -- the Tabloid ambushes in the men's room, the sordid rumors of wrongdoing, the foisting of designer clothing freebies that make him look like \\"the love child of Keith Richards and Queen Victoria.\\" Despite the fantastic happenings, the book always rings true. A most satisfying read that leaves you with astute observations of a culture gone celebrity mad. I can't wait for Krum's next book."},{"Title":"Walk of Fame","review":"Think you can handle the media pressure following your single appearance on \\"Survivor?\\" Their names in the gossip columns, reporters digging through their trash, rumors and innuendo flying about. Your personal life will constantly be examined, reexamined, and every facet of your life will be painfully detailed. This is not an easy task as shown by Debb Eaton during the finale. For her, the scrutiny she faced was not worth the three days she spent in the Outback. In her book, \\"Walk of Fame,\\" Sharon Krum takes a deft jab at the world of manufactured celebrities and the media that feeds into them. It's a handbook for all budding superstars who want reality TV to be their next step to stardom.Tom Webster is an unassuming writer for a financial magazine whose love of history has left him wondering if he shot a president if anyone would know who he was. His wife left him a year ago for his best friend and his weekly 800-word column hasn't won him fame or fortune but all of that is about to change. For $100,000, Webster must make himself into an overnight celebrity and then write an article detailing his meteoric rise to stardom - exposing himself as a fraud while simultaneously exposing the dark underbelly of the media machine. Aligning himself with Hollywood bombshell Alexandra West (who feels she is in need a makeover in order to be taken seriously by the Hollywood machine), the duo become the topic of conversation in gossip columns all over the country. In turn, his mother worries, his friend (yes, the one who stole his wife) fumes, his wife seethes, and the public hungers. The offers of book and television deals come fast and furious as well as the comely smiles and winks from women that wouldn't have given him a second look prior to Alexandra West.Sharon Krum deftly writes through the voice of a man. So well, in fact, you forget that it's a woman writing the novel. There are several laugh out loud moments when the utterly unexpected happens and several moments when you actually feel for Tom. Has he gotten himself in over his head? \\"Walk of Fame\\" is a wonderful expose on the power of the media to take an ordinary man and make him into a star. Not only does the fame affect the person, but their friends and family as well. The pressure that all quarters feel is overwhelming as the media clamors for more information about the lowly financial columnist who is now the talk of the nation. The cynicism with the search for fame and the problems it brings shows the barebones reality of being a celebrity. This book truly answers the question, \\"At what cost fame?\\"So, before you send in that application to be a contestant on the next reality show, check out \\"Walk of Fame,\\" currently available in bookstores and on Amazon.com. Know what you are in for before it actually happens."},{"Title":"Walk of Fame","review":"Once I got started, I found I was reading and reading and reading. Something very rare for me!! I haven't gone through a book so quickly since reading James Clavell many years ago with something as funny as Tom Sharpe!!! I wish I could be Tom Webster!Although written by a woman, it is not apparent in the reading. She seems to get into the male psyche very well. Like any book you enjoy, you just don't want it to end. What happens next???It's just a lot of fun to read, what more can I say!!"},{"Title":"Walk of Fame","review":"The first three chapters of this book delve into the personality and psyche of the main character. I had to push to make it through these pages, because everything could easily have been summed up in a few pages. The guy is dull and boring, he went to Yale (which comes up far too often throughout the book...we got it the first time), and his wife left him for his best friend. Seriously, by the end of Chapter 3, with all his whining, I could see why she left him.That being said, once you get into Chapters 4 and 5, the book definitely gets better. The plot is interesting and you keep guessing how it is going to end, you just have to really force yourself to get to those chapters.So, overall, it wasn't terrible but it didn't warrant more than a mediocre rating. The author's other book, The Thing About Jane Spring, is better."},{"Title":"Walk of Fame","review":"If Bridget Jones could only meet Tom Webster, the main character of WALK OF FAME, she'd be writing Bridget Jones Webster's Diary! Tom Webster is the man Bridget and every other single woman is looking for. And he is looking for you! His search ultimately takes him on the rollercoaster ride of his life to fame and riches. This first novel is a hilarious, delicious, roman a clef that is destined to be the Beach Read of 2001! Some might think I'm a bit biased being Ms. Krum's literary agent but after the book was a bestseller when first published in Australia last year and a critical hit in the UK this year, with foreign editions coming out all over the world and Harold Ramis producing the film version with Tony Goldwyn (A WALK ON THE MOON, SOMEONE LIKE YOU) directing the picture for Twentieth Century Fox, production to start next Fall, I think the verdict is in -- WALK OF FAME is absolutley fabulous! Sharom Krum writes so convincingly in a man's voice that many publishers and filmmakers thought she was a man when I first presented the book. Only after I showed her beautiful photograph did people believe that this young talented woman could capture so authentically the voice of Tom Webster. WALK OF FAME is a witty and wise cautionary tale about what happens to a nobody who becomes a somebody overnight. With a sharp eye and keen sense of our contemporary , zany, preposterous obsession with fame, Krum creates a character who we can root for and adore. Plus it's really fun to read from a true expert (Krum is a celebrity journalist)what goes on behind the scenes. WALK OF FAME is a how-to book about getting famous. If you loved BRIDGET JONES DIARY, HIGH FIDELITY, PRIMARY COLORS -- then you'll love WALK OF FAME."},{"Title":"Walk of Fame","review":"This is a decent book -- strictly decent -- sheds little in the way of light onto the cult of celebrity that keeps popping up in first fiction. Specifically, a novel a few years ago called Fake Liar Cheat by Tod Goldberg handled the subject of unwitting fame in a funny, dark way that this novel does not yet quite approach. The sense is that the author likes the scene and aches for the acceptance herself. No one wants to read a book that seems counterintuitive to the author's true goals. The book does serve as a decent beach read but fails to strike new ground. If you want the primers, get Fake Liar Cheat, or Day of the Locust or even Why Sammy Ran."},{"Title":"Data Analysis and Graphics Using R: An Example-based Approach (Cambridge Series in Statistical and Probabilistic Mathematics)","review":"This is a good introductory book to R, covering basics of the language, statistical models, inference, regression (linear and logistic), experimental design, time series, classification, multivariate analysis, etc.The book uses liberally examples and in most cases has the code for the output or graphics as footnotes at the bottom of the page. The book also tries to teach the statistics to a degree, which one can see as an annoyance (just teach me R!) or helpful if you are shaky on your stats. The book also lists a fair number of references to other books on S-plus and R to help point you in the direction towards achieving a higher level of adeptness and other references to learn more about the topics covered in the book.The book also has exercises at the end of each chapter to get you into R and using the system. The answers to the exercises are not in the book, but are available in pdf format on the books corresponding website."},{"Title":"Data Analysis and Graphics Using R: An Example-based Approach (Cambridge Series in Statistical and Probabilistic Mathematics)","review":"The authors have written a very good and somewhat unique book on statistical data analysis. The emphasis is on linear models. graphics and diagnostics for identifying violations of modeling assumprions. They build up from the basics starting with simple one variable linear regression and correlation and then moving to multiple regression. Special cases of linear models suchas polynomial regression are presened. They then move on to various generalizations. When the residuals are correlated they consider time series models for the correlation structure of the residuals. Other specialized and important problems such as repeated measures for longitudinal data are covered.Logistic regression is also introduced and shown to be a member of a larger class of models called generalized linear models which differ from linear models in that the dependent variable is a transformation of the basic dependent variable. The transformation is called the link function. For logistic regression the transformation is called the logit function. Hierarchical (or multi-level)models are also considered.There is also a chapter on classification and regression trees. The final methods chapter covers multvariate analysis including classifcation, principal components,and propensity scores. These are topics not commonly seen in a first course on regression or data analysis.What makes the book unique is a thorough introduction to the R programming language and the presntation of every technique with examples in R that both motivate the need for the technique and the details of the implementation in R. There is a lot of R code given and references to a variety of sources for R that can be found on the internet. The book can serve both as an introduction to data analysis and a tutorial on the R programming language. This can be useful as a text for undergraduate and graduate students. It is also an excellent reference for researchers who want to use R and its application to practical problems. The book also has an appendix that shows the relationship between R and S and SPlus, highlighting the differences. The first chapter is a careful introduction to R and the last chapter covers advanced applications in R.The graphics used throughout the book are excellently presented and there are even a few color graphs.

However, as a defense of theism in general and Christianity in particular, it falls flat.In this volume, Chesterton tells why he chose to believe in Christianity. He explains with eloquence and wit why he considers that religion beneficial to individuals and societies. However, the book is clearly also meant as an argument for the objective truth of Christianity, and on that count it will only convince people who already agree with him or who desperately wish to believe.He argues that there must be a god because, among other reasons, it is an appealing, comforting idea that lets him view the world as both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. He also says that Christianity is an excellent source of personal and creative energy and moral/social stability, and it therefore must be true.This is not a convincing argument. In fact, it's no argument at all. Ideas are not true just because someone finds them pretty or functional. They are true or untrue on their own, whether pretty or not.Chesterton trots out all sorts of easily refuted reasoning. For instance, he harps on the idea that rational thought leads to evil. After all, he says, if there is no external Divine measure of things, one can justify all manner of mayhem. The obvious counter-argument is that if one believes absolutely in the doctrines and dogmas of a religion, one can also justify all manner of mayhem, and people do so regularly. Both theists and atheists can be either kind or cruel, so the argument falls of its own weight.The book is filled with generalizations whose falseness must have been obvious even at the time. Take, for instance, his sweeping claim that people who work in \\"rational\\" professions such as math and science are prone to go mad, but poets and artists are not and that faith is a balm against mental insanity.The author is also fond of circular reasoning: he plugs in his conclusions as assumptions and tries to use them to prove themselves. He does this, for example, in his infuriatingly callous rant on the subject of suicide.In addition, he insinuates that one must either believe in a deity (preferably his favorite one) or else believe in nothing and be awed by nothing. This is perhaps the most absurd generalization in the book. Are the wonders of an infinite universe \\"nothing\\"? Is fascination with and study of a world that can surprise us at every turn \\"nothing\\"? Is reality so devoid of interest that we need to make things up? Obviously there are things in the universe we do not understand. However, one of the wisest things I was taught as a child is that when you don't know the answer to a question, the appropriate response is \\"I don't know.\\"As a personal narrative this book is fine. The author's perennial wit and his way with words suffuse the text. But as an attempt at persuasion, it's like watching a kid play a video game: Chesterton sets up and knocks down one straw-man argument after another, smashing each one with false dichotomies, dubious generalizations or subjective assertions before moving on to the next level of the game."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"My daughter - in college - thinks this book is quite useful.

Orthodoxy, however, represents an odd challenge, which Chesterson doesn't seem to be bothered by at all: approaching the serious matters of true religion with wit, the greatest of the Aristotilian virtues.

He produced thousands of pages of finely written material during his lifetime. Perhaps none other of his writings has had the impact of Orthodoxy, Chesterton's explanation of how he came to believe in the teachings of Roman Catholicism and the truth of Christianity.Chesterton believed in the magic of every day life, of Faerie in other words, and he saw the ultimate source of that creative energy as stemming from God through the Church. It's not surprising that he had an enormous influence on two later Christian writers, C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.Orthodoxy is less than 200 pages, but it is packed with splendidly written and argued reasonings for the truth of the Christian faith. First published in 1908, it remains fresh and enjoyable to read.I picked up Orthodoxy again for the first time since my college days because I had been feeling downcast by the increasing anti-education and anti-intellectual biases that are coming to dominate so many Christian churches today. Chesterton's masterwork is a needed reminder that faith and intellectual not only can co-exist, but that they must."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"An all-time classic for a reason, Orthodoxy has the wit and thoughtfulness that only Chesterton can provide.

Instead he examines the paradoxes and everyday experiences of life and claims that Christianity better explains life than alternate worldviews. His ideas are more a collections of life's observations rather than a carefully crafted polemic. Chesterton does have a flair for language and uses many analogies to illustrate his points. If you are looking for a book to quote there are many good quotable points in this book.

Like all his works, his logic and insight are unassailable. To argue with Gilbert Keith Chesterton--is to lose."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Gilbert Keith Chesterton (1874-1936) was an English writer, who ultimately converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism. Two of his more famous works areHereticsandThe Everlasting Man. He indicated in the Preface that \\"This book is meant to be a companion to 'Heretics,' and to put the positive side in addition to the negative... It is the purpose of the writer to attempt an explanation, not of whether the Christian Faith can be believed, but of how he personally has come to believe it.\\"He suggests that \\"We have found all the questions that can be found. It is time we gave up looking for questions and began looking for answers.\\" (Ch. III) He later confides, \\"This was my first conviction... I had always believed that the world involved magic: now I thought that perhaps it involved a magician.\\" (Ch. IV)He argues that \\"Christianity is a sword which separates and sets free. No other philosophy makes God actually rejoice in the separation of the universe into living souls. But according to orthodox Christianity this separation between God and man is sacred, because this is eternal.\\" (Ch. VIII)He summarizes, \\"I have dealt with such typical triads of doubt in order to convey the main contention---that my own case for Christianity is rational; but it is not simple.\\" (Ch. IX) He concludes with the thought, \\"Joy, which was the small publicity of the pagan, is the gigantic secret of the Christian.\\" (Ch. IX)Chesterton's more languid, \\"literary\\" style may bore some modern readers; but he is one of those Christian writers whose work will still be revered when all of the latest \\"Christian bestsellers\\" have been forgotten."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"I did find this book helpful, however, I found his writing style a little hard to follow. I found he rambles a little. That isn't to say his writings are not intelligent. He was an extremely erudite man who was well up on the philosophies and thought fads of his day. In his late 40's he converted to Catholicism and here gives some defense of religion in general. Mainly I find his point is top say that rationalism and logic doesn't answer all of man's questions. This is exactly what I had wanted to hear, and was looking for some reading that addressed that topic though I didn't know where to look. I do believe I was led by our Lord to this book. And through this book I have begun to think differently about things. That life itself and not just religion holds both logical and illogical standpoints. This paradox is what is found in religion, and religious people should not be afraid to admit. Even the most staunch atheist must admit that ultimately he cannot even absolutely prove his own existence, never mind the existence of the universe! We live in a world of faith and probability, and I believe that probability is strongly on my side when it comes to the existence of God, the Resurrection of Christ and the Church which He established.Another book I would recommend though Protestant in nature isNEW EVIDENCE THAT DEMANDS A VERDICT: Fully Updated to Answer the Questions Challenging Christians Today. I do not agree with it all, and as with everything you must read it with an open mind. But this book has been a great help to me of recent times just as it was when I first committed my life to Christ.If you read this review, please pray for me that I may remain faithful to our Lord until the end of my life, that I may stand confident in His presence on that day.

My views have changed slightly for the better and I am intrigued to read more."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Chesterton always makes my brain stretch. Not in a bad way, but rather he always seems to take a unique approach to a topic, forcing me to consider an idea from an entirely different perspective. In Orthodoxy he discusses the idea of objective truth. Not the relative truth of \\"what's true for you is not necessarily true for me\\" kind of thing. But real, uncompromising, in-your-face truth (of the 2+2=4 ilk). The book is full of lovely Chesterton nuggets (Thinking in isolation and pride ends with being an idiot). If you want some out-of-the-box thinking you'll love this."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"One reviewer stated that G.K. Chesterton \\"sneaks up on you.\\" This is an apt discription of ORTHODOXY. G.K. Chesterton wrote this book for his critics and perhaps for himself. Chesterton's written expression is charming, engaging, humorous, and effective. Those who are skeptical of Cathilocism would benefit from this book if only to gain some insight into the Catholic Faith. Even though they may disagree, they would learn something from good prose writing.Chesterton begins his study by giving some of his intellectual background and early skepticism toward religion and especially Catholicism. Readers should know that Chesterton was an agnostic and perhaps an athiest at an early age only to change his mind. Chesterton is clear that he did not read Catholic Apologetics and that his sympathy for Catholicism did not originate from Catholic literature. His intellectual journey came from the skeptics' literature. He states in his ORTHODOXY the contradictions of the skeptics criticisms of Catholicism led him to the Faith. He realized that Catholicism could not be two or three contradictions at the same time.Chesterton also cites some of the saints, heroes, and heroines in Catholic history. One good example is Joan of Arc. Chesterton compares her to Nietzche and Tolstoy. To paraphrase Chesterton, Joan of Arc was more violent than Nietzche who supposedly preached violence, and Joan of Arc was more sympathetic to peasants than Tolstoy if only because she was a peasant.Chesterton deals with the supposed restrictions imposed by Catholic authorities over the millennia. Chesterton is too simplistic in his remarks regarding this issue, but he does make sense. The Catholic authorities imposed certain restrictions only to keep the Europeans from reverting into violent paganism and social chaos.Chesterton also shows an appreciation for the cultural and intellectual contributions of Catholicism over the millennia. He is very clear that the Catholic monks and teachers saved Western Civilization when barbarianism threatened to deluge Europeans without any hope of recovery. It was the Catholic Church who literally saved Western Civilization and significantly improved it. One must remember that it was the Catholic monks who literally hand copied books, wrote intellectual discourse, hand copied the Bible, etc. The Catholic monks and nuns were the only teachers during the \\"Dark Ages\\" in Europe until the gradual rise of the Medieval Catholic universities beginning in the 11th century.One should note that Chesterton did not engage in ad hominem attacks in answering his critics. He refuted his critics by effectively engaging their ideas and offered thoughtful responses. This reviewer is not Catholic and to some may appear to be a skeptic. However, this reviewer recognizes reasoned thinking and good writing. Whether one is Catholic or not, this book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Chesterton's Orthodoxy is a book that all thinking Christians should read. If you are like me, you may have begun a foray into rational Christianity that took you deep into the academic fray. You find that you CAN defend your faith logically, that Christians need not be afraid of the syllogism. But if you dive deep into the works of Plantinga, Moreland, Willard and such, you find yourself needing to come up for air. This is the book that will be like an oxygen tank; it will allow you to breathe in the depths.The truth is that rational thought is a gift of God. But when we live life, our rationale at times ceases to provide explanation for every event. We discover that our vocabulary is not able to stretch far enough to describe the most precious moments of our lives. Chesterton encapsulates this truth better than any writer I've run across yet. He gives us permission to enjoy the tumultuous sea that the rationalist seeks to map, dissect and explain.I find the comments of one of the previous reviewers to be specifically illustrative. He states, \\"Much like a gorgeous flower it is best to view it than ingest it.\\" This reveals to us that he didn't really get the point of Chesterton's writing. What kind of person wants to eat a gorgeous flower rather than look at it? Modern and post-modern thinkers have lost their love for the mysterious. They have drifted so far away that gorgeous flowers cease to be nourishment for the soul and are thought only of as food for the stomach. This is the bankruptcy of which Chesterton writes. I discuss this fact in my podcast, Christian With A Brain. This book was one of my primary sources for a study called, The Limits of Logic.For those thinkers that love to dissect, remember that in order to properly dissect something, you must first kill it."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"A great book. Very quotable and full of refreshing perspectives on just about everything you could imagine pertaining to relevant thought. My only criticism of it is that, if you approach it as a defense of Christianity, it's not very logically coherent. I sometimes found the logic of his conclusions would get unintelligably tangled in his extraordinary wit as he attempted to express how he arrived at his belief. It approaches it from a witty, emotional and intelligent perspective; but, if your looking for something logically sound, I actually prefer C.S. Lewis or Ravi Zachariah, both of which were significantly influenced by Chesterton. But over all, it was a very enjoyable and profitable read that really helps expand the perspective by which you observe the wonder and majesty of the world of thought which we often take for granted. All in all, I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Chesterton, not unlike Peter Kreeft, is a Roman Catholic thinker who has gained a noticeable readership among the ranks of evangelicals. This particular book is regularly referred to and relied upon in evangelical works on all sorts of subjects. As such, it is a book that evangelicals should read and take notice of. And clearly, it is a book that many Roman Catholics will empathize with due to its clear advancement of the Roman Catholic church as the purest and most correct source of religion.As has been pointed out by others, in advancing Christian orthodoxy, Chesterton takes a decidedly unorthodox approach. Instead of advancing objective evidences or elaborate philosophical arguments, he chooses instead an approach that is actually quite funny in a way - an approach that at its core, resembles Calvinistic presuppositionalism. This is funny since Chesterton, on more than one occasion in this book, flippantly rejects all things Calvinistic, yet I found his entire book to be rooted in an apologetic approach that is in many ways similar to Van Til. He asserts, consistently with Van Tillianism, that those who offer objections to Christianity fundamentally lack an epistemic basis to do so since their objections presuppose and rely upon Christian values, the origin of which they later argue against. This is brought out very clearly in his 'Paradoxes of Christianity' chapter where he critiques the hopeless inconsistency of Christianity's critics. This was a real treat to read.In the end, Chesterton advances the view that wonder, happiness, joy, and a proper balance between optimism and pessimism can only be found in Christianity. This conclusion is based upon his own experience, and bolstered by many hypothetical and theoretical examples meant to further the point.I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 for reasons that others might deem unfair. While there were many sections of this book that were very insightful and on point, there were also sections where Chesterton seemed to be rambling toward no particular end. This might be an unfair criticism because the book was not meant to be a systematic apologetic for Christianity, but instead a semi-autobiographical account that charts Chesterton's own thought process. As a result, the reader will also notice that Orthodoxy is a work that is nearly devoid of Biblical references, much less exegesis. I found this problematic precisely because one could read this book, conclude that Chesterton was completely right in everything he said, and still be able to reject Christianity completely since the book did not interact at all with Biblical truths.Lastly, I must say having read this book, it is no surprise to me that a guy like Philip Yancey would be bonkers over it (Yancey wrote the introduction to the edition of the book I read). Chesterton was a man who embraced Roman Catholicism in a Protestant environment, and did so defiantly. In many ways, Chesterton writes as if he is an army of one. Not coincidentally, this also tends to be the attitude that Yancey has adopted relative to his views within evangelicalism. As such, Yancey's introduction to this book mindlessly strikes out against other evangelicals who don't see the world the way he does, and it is clear that his inspiration lies at least in part in Chesterton. I couldn't help but get the feeling that both of these individuals, to greater or lesser degrees, came to embrace the idea of being contrary for the sake of being contrary, and then justifying it with language extolling the virtue of being revolutionary, as if this is supposed to be an end in itself. It is admittedly hard for me to have much respect for such views, and maybe I'm misreading both men. But that was certainly the indication I got after reading this book, and it is a position that is not only anti-intellectual, but easily becomes completely self-serving.In the end, the book is a good read which makes many insightful points. Chesterton clearly believed that truth should translate to joy and wonder. This is certainly a message that all believers should pay attention to, and to this end, I think this book succeeds."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Chesterton's text is a great stand for the true rationality and beauty of Orthodoxy. In reflecting up on his own discovery of orthodoxy, he seeks to show the sanity and beauty of Christian thought when compared to contemporary philosophies. It would be difficult to tie down the work in a brief thesis, as it exists as a loose auto-biography of his thought processes coming to orthodox faith. If I could be so bold as to venture to a thesis, it is that orthodoxy is the only guarantor of sanity, beauty, and forward progress in the world. Beyond this, the text speaks for the specifics of these ideas.Chesterton's text is witty and insightful. For this reason, I suggest it most highly. More than once did I laugh heartily at his reflections upon contemporary think. Additionally, I often felt a chill as I thought, \\"This man has his finger on a truly good thought here.\\" I suggest Orthodoxy to all, for it is an accessible, excellent read that will truly affirm a true vision of beauty in the world."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"One of the best books I have read.Chesterton wrote a masterpiece.

That is, G.S. Street was one of many critics to present an opinion about Chesterton's Heretics, and happened to have presented the opinion to which Chesterton responded. When on the first page Chesterton states that it was incautious of Street to provoke an individual that is all too ready to write books, and in the final sentence of the first chapter claims that he would write Street another book if he needed clarification with regard to a topic only touched upon by Chesterton, it quickly becomes clear that Orthodoxy is yet another shining example of Chesterton's mirth applied to frequently solemn subject matter. Orthodoxy, as Chesterton appears to agree, is, however, the appropriate conclusion to the work he began with Heretics. If Heretics presented all that is wrong, Orthodoxy can rightly be seen as presenting the standard by which Chesterton deemed such philosophies heretical. To truly appreciate either of the aforementioned titles, both should be read as if they were a singular work.In Orthodoxy, Chesterton does justify his position maintained throughout Heretics in a manner as uniform as he might have been able to conjure. Throughout the work Chesterton utilizes his own experiences and thoughts to illustrate and, perhaps, demonstrate his seemingly inevitable arrive at truth. At times it almost seems as if Chesterton slips into irrelevant stream of thought tangents but never fails to reconcile his intended point, illuminating the necessity of what might have otherwise seemed entirely unnecessary. In fact, Chesterton masterfully builds what he claimed is not a properly thorough defense of Christianity into what might be one of the most poignant apologetic works ever. He does so in a way that makes Orthodoxy read like a suspense novel in that the entire effort bears its timeless fruit in the last few pages, if not in the last sentence, after supplying almost innumerable pieces of information that appeared just unrelated enough to ensure that the final piece would act as a blazing beacon of a keystone. While Chesterton might have failed to present that tangible evidence, that scientific process by which the claims of Christianity can be undoubtedly proved, he clearly and boldly presented that proof which every Christian exists for; the proof that every Christian can verify, albeit not as gracefully.

The little stories he uses for examples are entertaining and so insightful. And his logic is just nonpareil. Logic is a sorely missed art in these modern days. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I am Catholic myself, but non Catholics or non Christians, anyone could love this book. Even though he talks about some writers I'm not really familiar with, you get the hang of what he's getting at quickly. The way he talks about fairy tales especially caught my attention and really made me think.

Indeed, in his introduction, he describes his own spiritual journey that way: he likens himself to a British explorer setting sail in his yacht who winds up discovering England. He begins by explaining the limitations of reason, pointing out that men go mad not by losing their reason, but by losing everything except their reason. GK says poets seek to get their heads into the heavens, but rationalists seek to get heaven into their heads. This latter process can (not must) lead to madness. Next, GK considers the leading philosophies of his day-pragmatism, determinism, and Nietzche's theory of Will-in light of this excessive rationalism. He sums up neatly: \\"A man was meant to be doubtful about himself, but undoubting about the truth; this has been exactly reversed. Nowadays the part of a man that a man does assert is exactly the part he ought not to assert himself. The part he doubts is exactly the part he ought not to doubt -- the Divine Reason.\\" On the ensuing pages GK shows how Christianity alone provides the key for how one is to live. A few aspects of his arguments struck me as exceptional. His arguments are eminently reasonable, not mystical appeals to faith. His arguments consider the whole of man, from the broadest possible historical, psychological, and political perspectives. His arguments are balanced: he is unafraid to point out the weaknesses of his position and the strengths of another. Finally, his arguments are imbued with a gentility, humility and lightheartedness that are sorely lacking in our public debate. It is a rare thing to be persuasive on questions of religious belief and morality; GK not only manages to pull it off, he provides a few chuckles in the bargain."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"While Chesterton dedicates this book to his mother, he claims that George Slythe Street is the books inspiration and creator.

Probably arguing with someone who can generate just as many questions and can argue your side of the issue better than you can.

Begin here: \\"The sense of the miracle of humanity itself should be always more vivid to us than any marvels of power, intellect, art, or civilization.\\" Any book that looks to refute something must begin with awe in the fact that there is an intellect which makes it even possible to toil in the world of ideas and fact. A great follow up book would beMere Christianity."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Chesterton is one of the most influential writers in Christian history. His works (about 100 books & thousands of articles) are becoming important again to the Christian community. We are finding his world views to be timeless and his insights critical to understand the issues facing us in our world today. I recommend this book to anyone searching for answers about the problems we face today."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"GK is one of the most referenced apologetics in our current literature. I was curious to see first hand why.GK writes with an unusual personal bravado. He doesn't hesitate to call out peers for special ignominious recognition. Political incorrectness is rampant.The book was penned in the 1920's. Several chapters dissect emerging worldview philosophies of the pre-WWII period. You'll recognize some with others seemingly so obscure that they have dropped from common debate since the writing ... vivisection, pro or con divides the nation?Several chapters and snippets are superb. Others, because of the 1920 setting amidst the debates of the time, were not salient or topically interesting. Of the great stuff, a couple of specifics:1. I found GK's discussion of suicide to be brilliant. I never thought of the nasty topic in this way. It is highly effective on many levels for suicidals and life-lovers.2. GK has a killer anti-Darwin argument that's not an argument all. It rises above the debate. I've not seen this position argued before.This is a very interesting precursor text to current Bible based apologetic theology. I thoroughly enjoyed learning the origin of medieval gargoyle's in cathedral architecture too."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"I really liked this book, but to recommend something without discretion is not always wise.I would recommend this book to the person who feels poisoned by the eminent despair and boredom of modern thinking.Secondly, I would recommend it to the thoughtful and sincere agnostic as an aid in his or her efforts in searching for the answer.Lastly, I would recommend it to the thoughtful Christian (and I would like to encourage all fellow Christians to be thoughtful).I feel that I should also note this: Chesterton was not concerned so much with elaborate arguments and defenses of Christian faith when he wrote this book, rather it is a challenge to our basic assumptions upon which the vast majority of our arguments lie."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"This book contains a depth of content that its small size might seem to hide; it is a truly delightful 'autobiography' of an author enamoured with the &quot;romance of Orthodoxy.&quot; Written in response to a challenge offered by an acquaintance, Chesterton proceeds to examine the nature and character of orthodoxy in the modern world. Its personal flavour is refreshing and sincere, and makes for an extremely enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Let me get my more superficial complaint out of the way first. As other reviewers have pointed out, this version of \\"Orthodoxy\\" has horrifically bad formatting--the worst book formatting I've ever seen. The book itself has the physical dimensions of a small magazine--very wide, very tall, and very thin--making it very awkward to read or fit on a bookshelf. The graphics on the back cover are heavily pixelated, the pages inside do not contain the title of the chapter to which they belong, the book contains no editorial introduction or footnotes. In short, it looks like Joe Shmo downloaded the text of the book into a Word document, took it to a self-publishing house, and found clip-art graphics for the front and back. If you must get this book, at least get a different version of it.Now to the meat of my criticism. G.K. Chesteron is, in many ways, the Christian version of Richard Dawkins. His rhetoric is unique and engaging, filled with clever turns-of-phrase, imaginative analogies, and unexpected ways of reframing debates and criticisms. But his reasoning is simply bad. Perhaps I shouldn't fault the book for being entirely unconvincing given that Chesterton says he is merely explaining his own journey to Christianity, not offerring apologetics. But he is offering apologetics; by sharing the reasons that convinced him, he hopes to convince the reader as well.I can imagine skeptics admiring the aesthetics of the version of Christianity Chesterton paints in this book. I can't imagine them concluding, based on Chesterton's arguments, that it is true. The flow of his arguments, unlike those of, say, C.S. Lewis, are not dictated by logic, but by literary flair. He never seems to realize that his conclusions don't follow from his premises.To give an example: He argues against modernists that democracy and Christianity fit very well, since both involve granting authority to what common people believe--whether as represented by their vote or by their consensus throughout Christian history. This is contrasted with aristocracy and secular liberalism, which grant authority to the beliefs of a few--those governing, or those conducting contemporary scholarship. Chesterton reasons: \\"If we attach great importance to the opinion of ordinary men in great unanimity when we are dealing with daily matters, there is no reason why we should disregard it when we are dealing with history or fable.\\"Actually there is. Liberals support democracy, and therefore care about what the mass of common people believe, because democracy is concerned with practical matters of how those people will arrange their lives together. Democracy is not a method for deciding which beliefs are true. Yet that is precisely what contemporary scholarship, and the Christian tradition, ARE concerned with. Both center around truth-claims. There is no inconsistency in thinking the claims most likely to be true are those most carefully supported by the latest evidence (even if only a few people have access to that evidence) and simultaneously thinking that those who are governed should have a say in the policies to which they submit. Following Chesterton's logic, we would conclude that truth is determined by majority vote.Chesterton flippantly dismisses progressive causes like treating women as equal to men and avoiding cruelty to animals. He suggests the proper place for women is in the home teaching children. Yet he then goes on to argue that his version of orthodoxy fits better with the cause of reformation and progressivism than secular ideology. In some cases, his line of argument begins to become convincing, or at least plausible. For example, he argues that secular ideology fits with aristocracy since it sees rulers as morally refined and commoners as socialized into poor value systems (and if that's the case, why should we care about their political beliefs and give them a vote?). Christianity, by contrast, gives us reason to doubt rulers since it sees everyone as corrupted by original sin. His other arguments along this line, however, are less plausible and more in line with the flawed democracy/tradition analogy discussed above.However appealing his rhetoric may be, in the end, Chesterton is wrong. It is secularism, not Christianity, that provides the best ideology for motivating reformation of this world. If there is another world after this one, then reforming our world has less urgency and ultimate significance. If there is a hell, then all progressive causes pale in comparison to the importance of converting individuals so they can see heaven. If beliefs held by the majority throughout history are the best guide to morality, then women will continue to be subordinated to men and slavery will remain in place. If there is a God who had the Israelites slaughter women and children and sent his only son to be killed in his name, then the ends justify the means. If truth is determined by consensus throughout history, then there is little reason to study the world.Chesterton is considered by many Christians to be one of their tradition's greatest apologists. That's unfortunate."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"The paperback had lots of footnotes explaining terms that are not familiar to most readers.

If you have the world all figured out, or believe that the recent discovery of the Higgs Boson Particle means that all of our questions will finally be answered, then this book is not for you.If, however, you get a tingling sensation when you hear about something amazing and unexplainable, if you are willing to listen to the voice in your own heart while you read the story on the page, then you will enjoy Chesterton like a squirrel enjoys an acorn; devouring parts of it immediately, while savings others for a time in your immediate future when you'll need them.Highly recommended for recovering philistines like me."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"This book was recommended by many different speakers at a conference I attended including Donald Miller, the author of Blue Like Jazz.

Oh, what an excellent book! G.K. can do no wrong. Every Christian ought to read this book - 5 times, maybe."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"You cannot read this book in one session and say that you understand it. You need to rethink it all several times, enjoying it as you enjoy a quality picture: after numerous blinks.GK was able to put inside a brief book a colossal work in all dimensions: deepest logic, total truth content and excellent wording, all backed up by everyday-life examples.As with any masterpiece, you recognize it in the fatc that if you borrow or add one word in the entire book and you end up destroying it. Chesterton explains why the world is insane in his ABSOLUTE view (take it or reply it, if you can) by recalling old truths and new concepts; he re-news what makes sense and why that makes sense.One attracting issue about this writer is that he avoids wrestling against anyone who doesn't share his view. He kills the wrong view, elegantly saving the opponent, with humorous prosaic poetry."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"When asked at one point in his life what his favorite book was, Rich Mullens answered, &quot;Orthodoxy by G.K. Chesterton.&quot; I was pleased to buy an old copy from a second-hand shop. I treasure a book in which clear thinking is demonstrated."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"A Catholic friend recommended &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; by way of trying to justify faith. While it is a very elegant and wittily written book, I can't say it meets that mark.&quot;Orthodoxy&quot; is the very personal account of G.K. Chesterton's journey to the Christian faith. But because it is so personal, it doesn't explain faith objectively, but rather only to Chesterton's satisfaction. And having reached the same conclusion as Chesterton, I'm sure it is also to the satisfaction of most believers.It is a little frustrating to read the parts where he sets about destroying straw men, or when he proves a point by changing the argument into a semantic one. On the other hand it's a pleasure to see him pick on the likes of Nietzsche. The ultimate lesson that comes from the book, though, is the tautology that faith can't be proven, which is why many good, honest folks don't have any.To Chesterton, life is more romantic and, indeed, livable if you accept that some things are beyond human understanding, that there is no sense in trying to explain them, and that they might as well be explained by magic. He believed that &quot;something that we have never in any full sense known, is not only better than ourselves, but even more natural to us than ourselves.&quot; This no doubt filled him with comfort because it would give rhyme and reason to lots of chaos in the world. But this attitude can also be interpreted as intellectual laziness, if not cowardice. It is much easier to believe, on faith, in &quot;fairy tales&quot; (as Chesterton proudly called them), than to accept the natural world, as inscrutable as it is, and seek valiantly to understand its mysteries before one's time is up.So, while it is an enjoyable read, this book is likely doubly enjoyed by a believer who is looking for a reaffirmation of his faith. Non-believers will find it interesting, if undeservedly condescending."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Orthodoxy was published in 1908, a hundred years before it became clear to me that I will never be the same as anything. Religion is an intellectual comfort zone for people who like a salvation that has more significance for them than anything the world can do. In 2012 I am discovering pure unpopularity as a reflection of the vile nature of consensus. An individual writer like Chesterton can do amazing things with Christianity. There are so many ideas to play with. The world could be a plaything for a god who wished to put the finishing touches on white supremacy."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"The following quote from &quot;sincre reader&quot; is the most amusing thing I have read in a long time:&quot;His only excuse is that he existed in a time when science was not as advanced as it is today.&quot;What a hoot!

Chesterton's writing style is brilliant even though often his writing is pointless. Like a trial lawyer engaged in circle talk he says a mouthful but at the same time, although eloquent, it is a mouthful of nothing. Much like a gorgeous flower it is best to view it than ingest it. So this book too is better lightly read than seriously studied."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"This book is a hilariously funny read of the rolling on the floor variety! It had me LOL uncontrollably in public when I first discovered it at a local bookstore. And I happen to be a heretic, of the early Christian variety with a little New Age thrown in, that Chesterton so apparently dislikes.Paraphrasing some of my favorite lines (about the editor of the Clarion) &quot;he's one early Christian that should have been eaten by lions&quot; or &quot;there's another word for Agnosticism, it's called Ignorance&quot; or &quot;Jesus tells you to love your neighbor, Annie Bessant says you are your neighbor&quot; and then goes on to complain that the reason you love your neighbor is the same reason you love a woman, because she's different from you.He also has lot of not so Christian things to say about George Bernard Shaw (apparently a compulsive liar, I never knew! hehehe) and Nietzche. Occasionally Chesterton makes a salient point, such as will being limiting. But most of it is the very &quot;light sophism&quot; that he complains his critics accuse him of. Students of logic would love this book because it's fun to pick apart the endless twisted reasoning. He gets away with it (and why I suspect this book has remained popular for so long) because of the unintentional humorous bon mots combined with a childish glee and naivety and, yes, charm. Chesterton doesn't like the &quot;funny&quot; adjective applied to him and complains he never says anything funny that he doesn't deeply believe in first. Poor guy. Nonetheless not a page goes by that doesn't have you chuckling."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"This great book should have a different title (although it is technically accurate). The author makes one think clearly about the basic elements of life and God, while sprinkling it liberally with dry, very clever humor. He shares his odyssey from a young child's curiosity, a young person's cynicism, an agnostic, commonly-shared view of God and religion, to the realization that Christianity is the only \\"system\\" that truly makes sense in a complete fashion.This would be a great little book to share with an intelligent agnostic that would challenge his preconceived notions about religion and God. Well done, Mr. Chesterton."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"I am not sure why I had never read this Chesterton classic until now. I had really missed a gem.It is an autobiographical account of a spiritual journey by a great mind. It is full of important ideas, common sense, and humor. In addition to being a positive defense of Christianity, it also refutes some spiritual/religious fallacies such as the similarities between Christianity and Buddhism.My only disappointment is that I read this with the Kindle application on my IPad. It is one that should be read in a physical book, so that one can easily highlight and review some of the amazing thoughts and quotes. Be assured that I will be buying another version of this, so that I can do just that. It is also one that will be a pleasure to re-read."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"G.K. Chesterton says this in chapter four of Orthodoxy:When the business man rebukes the idealism of his office-boy, it is commonly in some such speech as this: \\"Ah, yes, when one is young, one has these ideals in the abstract and these castles in the air; but in the middle age they all break up like clouds, and one comes down to a belief in practical politics, to using the machinery one has and getting on with the worlds as it is...\\"They say that I should lose my ideals and begin to believe in the methods of practical politicians. Now, I have not lost my ideals in the least; my faith in fundamentals is exactly what it always was. What I have lost is my old childlike faith in practical politics.I can think of no better way to describe the prescription for flight test, for the aerospace industry, for aviation and technical leaders.We must recapture the wonder...the fantasy that we had as children and apply our imaginations to create the future we want rather than the tedious labor of the current machinery. This is the image from my past that focuses the vision for our future."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Definitely a book with British language and locations. Chesterton grants us a look at his journey from atheism to believer and has had a significant impact on others of like disbelief in the foundational Christian meaning for both life now and for eternal joy later. While his writing was for the past generation, it lives today in those whos hearts and minds it has impacted."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"In this classic Catholic apologia Chesterton makes a reasoned case for Christian faith. Not from the view of religion but from the view of a man in search of religion. In fact he begins with the story of a yachtsman that sets sail and because of a series of miscalculations unwittingly finds himself back where he began delighted in his accomplishment and amazed at the things he discovers there.Along the way Chesterton dismantles the dominate ideologies of his day, equating those that are unable to believe as nothing more than inmates in the asylum. He also shows how it is the paradoxes of religion that non believers find so troubling that are at the core of truth. Truth summed up in the Apostles Creed.It is not a book for the faint of heart as his rhapsodic and metaphorical style takes more than a few reads to unravel. It was however a challenging but fruitful read and I believe that if catechism class had been as enlightening many a Catholic would not have had to take the same voyage as Chesterton."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"My favorite line from this book (among hundreds): \\"The madman isn't the one who tries to get his head into heaven, he is the one who tries to get heaven into his head.\\" At the same time, that quote doesn't even represent an imp of Chesterton's common sense genius. I only wish he were alive today to bury the likes of small-minded atheist fundamentalists who are clogging the arteries of higher learning. What a tragedy it is that these scientists are teaching our children they are fools to believe in anything other than what their senses can perceive immediately. They are not teaching freedom, they are teaching slavery. Their teachings won't emancipate the human race, they would only enslave it and force the extinction of poetic, dignified humanity as we know it.Thank God there are those like Chesterton who devoted their lives to rebuking the cold, heartless, inhumane body of unbelief. Chesterton makes easy work of them all by sharing truth so powerful and concise it will make the seasoned Christian laugh out loud in familiar approval and absolutely tantalize the new Christian. I should add that it is no coincidence that Chesterton was a devout Catholic. Though his stabs at Calvinism and other breakaway movements are quick, they are deadly precise and overwhelmingly compelling.There is only one God and He is revealed in Jesus Christ and the Magisterium is the teaching office of Jesus Christ. Sure the church has had its problems due to the errors of some of its early leaders, and most recently of a rogue band of pedophile priests, but it's on the mend now and it is still the first and only Christian faith upon which all others are pillared. Chesterton's entire body of knowledge is pillared on the ROCK of Catholicism, and that's why they are simply and beautifully timeless like God and perfectly beyond reproach.This book should be required reading for all those who want to be able to defend their faith logically against illogical forces of today who are bent on abolishing it with smoke, mirrors, cantankerous parody, pompous ridicule, and elitist superiority. There is a reason why atheists hold all their speaking engagements at colleges. Think about it.God bless those who keep GK's books in syndication and on our bookshelves.

It is his story of finding the familiar and unfamiliar in Christianity.

So, when I read in his autobiography the impact that Chesterton had on him, I had to pick up a copy of one of his books. I chose this one, and what an introduction it was. It is a wonderful thing to find a new author that you enjoy so immensely.As the title of my review intimates, Chesterton has all of the intelligence and keenness of mind of Lewis, but with the added bonus of a boundless, cheery sense of humor (not to say, of course, that Lewis does not have a good sense of humor in his own rights). If you read this book without smiling to yourself dozens of times, you are missing something. Chesterton's jabs at his contemporaries, as well as his predecessors, in philosophical thought are at once humorous and severe, all without the slightest hint of mean-spiritedness; a tribute to his sense of paradox.My one complaint about this edition is the endless typographical errors contained in its pages. I find it appalling that a publishing house would send to print something with so many glaring errors. After the first couple, I thought it to be no big deal. But after the first ten I became a bit put off. If you can overlook the typos, then this edition will suit you just fine. And the errors can in no way detract from wealth of prose, candor, analogy, and humor found within this gem of a book."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Those who have read Chesterton realize that he is the sort of man with whom the world is blessed every 100 years or so. A master writer and wry philosopher, Chesterton provides in his book Orthodoxy one of the best summaries available concerning the life in Christ. Even though he found God calling him to the Church of Rome, readers from a wide range of backgrounds - evangelical Protestants of all &quot;flavors&quot;, fundamentalists, Eastern Orthodox, Episcopalians, Baptists, Pentacostalists, Lutherans, and yes, Roman Catholics - will discover new insights into their walk with the Christ.Chesterton has the ability to make us see things anew. In Orthodoxy, he helps us to see the Church in a new way, and he helps us to see afresh the One who founded His Church - Jesus Christ. The book is not an apologetic for Roman Catholicism, but rather one for orthodox Christianity itself.Chesterton is simultaneously a master of the written word and one who knows his Master. To borrow a phrase (applied to something else, but applicable here) of Richard John Neuhaus, Chesterton is a &quot;singular grace note in God's creative purpose&quot;. For those who have not read Chesterton, Orthodoxy is probably the best place to start, followed by The Everlasting Man, followed by the delighful (and insightful) Father Brown stories, followed by ..."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"I think this book is one of the greatest apologies for the Christian faith ever penned; possibly even better than C.S. Lewis' &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;. Rather than attempting to build an airtight logical argument from the ground up in which the reader is forced to accept the premises of Christianity or be logically inconsistent, Chesterton builds his apologetic on the idea of wonder and imagination. He attempts to show that anyone who enjoys an imaginative, romantic, adventure filled life owes it to themself to look into the Christian faith, because this is exactly what it offers. He offers a frank disclaimer at the beginning of the book in which he says that anyone who does not want this kind of life need not read this book because it has nothing to offer them. He constantly attempts to make the reader see the mystery and the glory of normal, everyday things and then argues that Christianity offers the best possible scenario for holding together the mysterious with the mundane. The fact that the book is focused on mystery, romance, and imagination, however, is not to say that Chesterton rejects logic or good critical thinking altogether. To the contrary, he delightfully skewers, slices, and dices the inconsistency and ridiculousness of a great deal of worldly wisdom and the popular thinking of his age, which, as it turns out, does not look all that different from a great deal of the accepted wisdom of our own. Chesterton, however, recognizes that logic has it's limits, and that it cannot fully appeal to or account for all that makes us human. The book is filled with many wonderful passages, and there are parts of the book where it seems like every line you read is a quotable quote. So, with Chesterton's disclaimer in mind, if you are looking for an eminently readable, and unique defense of the Christian faith you owe it to yourself to get this book.On a final note, I feel the need to respond to the reader who accuses Chesterton of being racist and elitist in this book. I'm wondering if the reader read the same book I did, as I found nothing that I can recall that was racist or elitist at all, and anyone who knows anything about Chesterton at all will know that he was neither of these things. Chesterton was one of the greatest spokesmen of all time for the importance of ordinary people and common values and morality, and, especially in his later life, was an outspoken opponent of racist practices and groups like eugenics and the Nazi party."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"CS Lewis is hailed as perhaps the most widely-known Christian apologist. This may be true, but Chesterton is by far the most satisfying apologist from a literary standpoint. In Orthodoxy, he writes in response to a newspaper journalist's attacks on Christianity, and does so in such compelling prose that this is considered not just a Christian classic, but a literary treasure. He delves into parallels and metaphors so perfect that they lend credibility to his arguments and serve to maintain a reader's interest throughout.Do not be deceived, however, into thinking this is an easy read. It most certainly is not. Chesterton's prose is written in the English of his time, which may seem antiquated to some readers, and his style is very dense and requires concentration. Not the concentration required for, say, Ulysses, but neither is it fluff to be read in an afternoon. To the reader willing to devote the time and energy, this is a treasure."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"My initial reaction about halfway through the first chapter was, &quot;This man thinks way too much.&quot;The depth to which Chesterton attacks the most mundane of topics is staggering. Who ever considered the &quot;rightness&quot; of fairy tales, and the &quot;wrongness&quot; of everyday life to such a degree? (in the Ethics of Elfland)This is the perfect precursor to Bloom's &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot;, because Chesterton here exposes for us the philosophical background of the problems of Post-Modern thought which Bloom describes. Another complimentary book would be Ravi Zacharias's &quot;Deliver Us from Evil&quot;."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"&quot;Orthodoxy&quot; is described by Chesterton as &quot;a slovenly autobiography&quot;, a description that's really not too far off the mark. Instead of depending upon rigorous logic, the contents of this work are rather &quot;mental pictures&quot; of a sort, which is what the author states at the outset. This sort of approach is easy to attack by any contrarian skeptic, but I can't criticize Chesterton, as he and I are really cut from the same cloth. Loath to state the obvious, we both prefer to *illustrate* the truth via induction. This is a perfectly valid method of presenting ideas, it's just that it's easy to misunderstand and misrepresent. It's for this reason that this book probably wouldn't change someone's mind-kind of a litmus test for the open-minded, which, it turns out, self-proclaimed \`skeptics' or \`freethinkers' are anything but.Chesterton makes two really good points throughout the book: 1) sanity lies in maintaining seemingly opposed extremes in a kind of dramatic tension. It's not balance, it's both at once. It's not a contradiction, it's a paradox. Christianity fits this like nothing else: singularity/plurality, freedom/servanthood, individuality/assimilation, etc., all are fused together in seeming contradiction of common sense. But don't we always find truth to be stranger than fiction? In contrast, monomania is a kind of insanity, like total belief in oneself, or the belief that one unfalsifiable human construct, like evolution, completely illuminates everything. 2) The importance of maintaining a kind of humble childlike wonder about the world, the universe, about existence itself. What if you saw a four-inch-long fully-functional helicopter hovering about? Wouldn't that be delightfully incredible? Not too long ago, after reading this book, it dawned on me, upon observing a dragonfly, that that was precisely what I was looking at. I'm not even talking about creationism, irreducible complexity, any of that. It is in fact, neither here nor there. Just the fact that such a marvelous thing should exist, by any means, is truly stupendous. It should inspire deeper thought about fundamental issues. The modern-day \`scientific' priesthood is perpetually at pains to systematically dismantle the ability to see things this way even as they proclaim it superficially.The funny thing about Chesterton's writing is that he gets so wrapped up in his ideas that rather strange-sounding, apparent non-sequiturs come up every so often. A sample Chestertonism: &quot;As a fact, anthropophagy [cannibalism] is certainly a decadent thing, not a primitive one. It is much more likely that modern men will eat human flesh out of affectation, than that primitive man ate it out of ignorance.&quot; Well, duh!? As in his Father Brown mysteries, Chesterton loves to toss off sweeping statements, and is a bit too shy of explicating his ideas with the utmost clarity sometimes; chalk it up to slovenliness, I guess.But for the most part his ideas are sound and his writing thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"In this book, one of the great writers of the last century, writes his defense of the philosophy of Historical Christianity. He goes to great lengths to debate the views of his contemporaries (H.G. Wells, Robert Bernard Shaw) and the influences on his contemporaries (specifically Nietzsche). Chesterton can seem to go off topic at times (it is said he never wrote rough drafts - what we read is his thought process un-edited), but his insights and are purely astounding and worth going down those rabbit trails. I won't dare go into his arguments, as I'm sure other reviews have done that sufficiently, plus I'm not smart enough or have have enough time to do them justice. Read the book for yourself. Chesterton is an absolute delight to read. It's a shame that a man like G.K. Chesterton has been forgotten, while the men whom he often debated have so heavily influenced our culture. We would do well to bring the clarity of thought and ideas of Chesterton back into the public forum. For a Christian who wishes to intellectually defend his faith (as opposed to the blind faith we are often accused of), this book is indispensible."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"In this book Chesterton has given us enough material upon which to meditate for a lifetime.

Although this book can be difficult to follow at times due to the wordiness of Chesterton, he always clarifies himself and his points regardless of the fact that is often takes him a whole chapter. The real value of this piece is realized not after the first reading, but after the fifth tenth and unknown readings. If your mind is sharp, you will find yourself frequently laughing out-loud at Chesterton's clever and concealed way of refuting the foolishness of our current thought with the foolishness of God. Chesterton says that his philosophy that he reveals in this book is not of his own creation, for he did not make it, God made it and it made him... I tend to agree."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"I'll be honest and say that a lot of Christian books I have read have been dull or void of passion. This book is neither. I have read a few G.K. Chesterton books and in my opinion this is my favorite of his. This book displays the wonder and mystical side of Christianity through Chesterton's eyes and can get very deep philosophically and also very witty. It has some big words yet most audiences will be able to comprehend what he is saying without getting lost. Its hard for me to clealy explain the whole synopsis but this is very good book and considering the price, you won't lose out by taking a chance and picking up a copy of your own."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Orthodoxy is not the book I thought it would be. I really expected a rigorous, systematic defence of orthodox doctrine. Instead, I read a rousing autobiography, which left me in continued awe of the author, but rather bemused about Chesterton's mental habits.First off, Chesterton in relation to various heresies (in particular secularism), is a bit like a drunken man with a sledgehammer in a china shop. Not an angry drunk, but a happy, wild-eyed, well-practiced drunk. Chesterton's intellect so thoroughly overpowers the counterarguments that he sometimes seems at a loss as to which direction to swing the hammer. So he muddles cheerfully along, smashing a bit of Nietzchism here, crushing a Socialist argument there. And through it all he seems painfully aware of the oncoming post-modern society, in which the ultimate secular virtue of tolerance would leave us oblivious to rational argument.Orthodoxy is replete with classic Chesterton. He makes his points with precise metaphors that waste no words. A particular favorite of mine is his argument against the relativist effort to remove value from physical or abstract objects. Chesterton cites the title of a work called &quot;the Love of Triangles&quot; and points out that if Triangles are loved for anything, they are loved for being triangular.As with The Everlasting Man, Chesterton provides his readers with a neat intellectual trick that can be used for self-analysis. In Orthodoxy, the trick is the reduction of conversation to monosyllabic sentences. Chesterton has found another key characteristic of the modern world here - the tendency of people to adopt a complex language for the express intent of not saying anything at all. Anyone familiar with the sciences will understand the necessity of precision in language, combined with the maddening inability of the words themselves to convey the desired meaning. As an example, I refer to isotactic, syndiotactic, and atactic polymers. These terms refer to the pattern of orientation in polymer chains. Is it possible to infer that from the terminology? Our language is full of adopted &quot;scientific&quot; nomenclature that contains meaning of which we are unaware. One of these days, I'm going to state a hyperthesis and wait for someone to point out my spelling error.But I digress. Chesterton's recognition is that the more complex our language, and the more specialized its application, the less meaning the language itself conveys. Witness the confusion over the terms &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;progressive,&quot; cited by Chesterton as examples. Anyone familiar with the modern (American&quot; connotations of these words will recognize that &quot;liberal&quot; is someone who wants to limit free speech, have government control over the economy, mandate the membership of the Boy Scouts, and dictate how many gallons of water can be contained in your toilet tank. Progressive is simply someone who wants to progress back to the 60's. The meanings of the words are a far cry from the definition of the words.Chesterton supplies the antidote - one syllable words only. While this is obviously of limited utility, it's a nice exercise (like trying to cook breakfast using only your left hand, if you're right handed). His point is well taken - the one-syllable words are pretty hard to confuse or confute, and they're remarkably handy. They're also anathema to wordy people like me.I cannot, of course, help compare Chesterton's autobiographical Orthodoxy with Augustine's Confessions. I shudder to think that it is the different audiences that define the difference in these books, but in any case here is a contrast between a brilliant ancient writer and a brilliant modern writer, both explaining how they came to accept Christ and His Church. Where Augustine is expansive, structured, precise and deeply interested in addressing each of the many ways we might consider the phenomenon of &quot;memory,&quot; Chesterton is rambling, concise, and chaotic in his visualization of madness and genius.Finally (yes! Finally!) I have to admit that I remain unconvinced of Chesterton's hyperthesis of sanity. Where Chesterton sees sanity as the result of a tension between two extremes (in fact, two poles), I suspect that it is such tension that generally &quot;cracks&quot; people's heads (in most cases the tension between perceived reality and reality-by-policy).Chesterton, however, will get the better of me with such arguments as: &quot;To accept everything is an exercise, to understand everything is a strain. The poet only desires exaltation and expansion, a world to stretch himself in. The poet only asks to get his head into the heavens. It is the logician who seeks to get the heavens into his head. And it is his head that splits.&quot;Magnificent!"},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"G. K. Chesterton's book &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; argues forcefully that democratic reforms and revolutions must be founded on a fixed ideal, that the false concept of &quot;progress&quot; impedes real progress, that a doctrine of &quot;Original Sin&quot; is the only real basis for political equality, and many other things much worth thinking about. I highly recommend his chapters &quot;The Suicide of Thought&quot; and &quot;The Ethics of Elfland&quot; for a wonderful critique of modern philosophy. His style is superlative. Reading Chesterton is a joy."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Now here's a book you don't read every day. In fact I doubt anyone could get away with writing it today and getting it published! Waay too many lawsuits! Chesterton barely after the turn of the 19th century takes a philosophical and theological look around and systematically gives a heroic and epic earth scorching win for Christianity with great humor and sympathy. He gets away with naming names, constantly poking fun and almost exuberant bluntness.I only got this book because I enjoyed Chesterton's biography - - otherwise I think I would have been intimidated by the title and even the solemn cover picture. After reading the book I wonder if the author wouldn't rather want an outdoor full color cover with a clear blue sky and dancing figures . . .This book will have an affect on me for a while. I was really surprised at how (except for the obvious local references to England) despite the startlingly confrontational approach, the philosophies and reasons for not believing in Christianity are very much the same as today, over 100 years later. The discussion of \\"liberal\\" vs. \\"conservative\\" also seems especially timely because no one seems to dare talk about these words honestly these days without turning political and taking sides.All this plus the knowledge that Chesterton was actually personal friends with some of those he \\"calls out\\" for their atheism (such as George Bernard Shaw) seems to me extraordinary.About this edition - it was very clear with nicely spaced type, and absolutely no extra print or commentary, which I didn't mind. Oh yeah - - two things I looked up . . . Hanwell is an insane asylum and mirth means gladness and merriment."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Difficult reading by a great man. I was recommended this book and I have to really concentrate to understand it."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"This was my first G.K. Chesterton work. It most assuredly won't be my last. I loved it, from cover to cover. While I can understand some criticisms such as his use of logical fallacies, I do not think these chinks make a sufficient hole in the armor of his thesis.For instance, I can see where critics would say that the beginning of Chapter 8 seems to be circular reasoning: that there's a lot of bustle but in actuality society is the most lazy than at any other time in history. Why? Because everyone's riding around in vehicles and cabs. The accusation of the straw man could be thrown at Chapter 9 where Chesterton assumes the questions posed by an agnostic regarding the conclusions drawn from the prior chapters of this book. However, while I don't know if these questions were asked by agnostics in Chesterton's days, they are indeed asked today. Whole books have been written on these premeses. I see examples that could be pulled elsewhere in the text as well, but as a whole his arguments are solid, although I'm not so sure how convincing the book would be to the atheists and agnostics of today.There are many highlights and quotables from this book:Ch. 2: \\"The sick man is not strong enough to be idle.\\"Chapter 3 is essentially a meditation on James 1:8.\\"Every man who will not have softening of the heart must at last have softening of the brain\\" - in reference to Nietzsche. Chesterton taunts Nietzsche and Tolstoy with an illustration of Joan of Arc, who personified, lived, and was the essence all that was \\"true\\" and \\"tolerable\\" within these great minds.Ch. 4: \\"The legend is generally made by the majority of people in the village, who are sane. The book is generally written by the one man in the village who is mad.\\" This chapter serves as an apology of Tradition especially as it relates to Democracy.Ch. 5: \\"Go back to the darkest roots of civilization and you will find them knotted round some sacred stone or encircling some sacred well. People first paid honor to a spot and afterwards gained glory for it. Men did not love Rome because she was great. She was great because they had loved her.\\"\\"They gained their morality by guarding their religion.\\"Chesterton posits that Christian optimism is based on the realization that man doesn't fit in the world - everything is unnatural in the face of the supernatural. Christianity provides a balance between Nietzsche's Superman and Tolstoy's monks. He describes the difficulty within which the Church wades, as it's easy to fall but hard to stand erect because there in only one angle to do so.G.K. gives praise to Marx, Aristotle and Calvin as the hard, fearless men of thought especially in comparison to Nietzsche, whom he says was not bold or strong but rather timid. He gives an excellent exposition on mental slavery: the menial worker may change his vision or philosophy, he will always be enslaved because then it's the mind that changes while the environment does not because the motivation is lost.Such praise of wonder and the fantastic is rarely found in books like these. Chesterton claims the fairy tale prince must be humble enough to marvel, and haughty enough to defy. The bird is strong because it is light and lithe, while it's gravity and seriousness that pull down the aristocracy.I loved the differences he discusses in various religious icons. Christian saints are pictured extremely thin with eyes wide open. Buddhist saints are sleepy-eyed and harmonious in body. This is a perfect illustration of the differences between these two beliefs. In the end, Chesterton describes how humanism is a mimicry of theosis in that it seeks human divinity apart from God and Jesus Christ. Indeed, satan is the ape of God (h/t Michael Hoffman).Ch. 9: \\"Christianity is the only frame for pagan freedom.\\"The words brilliant and genius are tossed around all too frequently. However, they certainly apply to Chesterton's \\"Orthodoxy.\\" It's definitely worth a re-read or two."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"It is always amazing to read something that was written over a hundred years ago and find it to be as relevant as ever, if not more so than it might originally have been. \\"Orthodoxy\\" by G.K. Chesterton is just such a book, made the more extraordinary because it is his explanation of what led him from agnosticism to faith in Christianity. Like C.S. Lewis, Chesterton's conversion was made through reason and philosophy and he allows readers to follow him on this intimate journey.It seems as if there is no topic untouched or question left unanswered. Indeed, Chesterton found all the answers he needed in a place he never thought he would ever find them. He examines the state of mankind and the world that we have created for ourselves, calling into question our practice of making truths without facts and changing our philosophical answers to meet our current needs. In doing so, we are not making any change or impact or building anything better, merely running away from the truth and creating more confusion. Chesterton debunks many of the stigmas that critics push onto the Christian church and popular beliefs (even for many today) that there is commonality among many religions, especially Christianity and Buddhism.It is almost too difficult to sum up what Chesterton had to say, for he covers much ground in a manner that is honest and straightforward but always intelligent, witty, and at times, very, very funny. It is amazing to think he was only thirty-four years old when he wrote this, for his wisdom seems to belong to a much older man. \\"Orthodoxy\\" is amazingly relevant for today's world, perhaps the best argument that indeed Chesterton had found and was able to explain that the answer he had found was the correct one."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"I had to discover G. K. Chesterton all by myself, when I was a teenager --- in the school library. He had written so many books, on so many interesting topics! I borrowed four or five and was enthralled by his humor, his clear insight, and his brilliant writing style.Take this book \\"Orthodoxy.\\" Could there be a more boring title? Yet, if you dare to open to the first page, you're off on a wild, non-stop ride where Chesterton makes a number of points that seem to me beyond dispute.After all, you would not really expect Chapter One of such a presumably \\"dull\\" book to be about maniacs, but it is. And Chesterton makes one point over and over again: the people who become insane typically reason too much. A paranoid psychotic is full of reasons and logical arguments which all seem to make perfect sense, but the lunatic remains, unfortunately, a lunatic. If I may draw a parallel to today, the people who believe in UFO's (or the Truthers) are all full of logical arguments which they will gladly repeat, and repeat endlessly, forever travelling around the circumference of the tiny circle which imprisons them.On the other hand, men of great imagination seem to be marvellously sane. Chesterton mentions Shakespeare; a more modern writer might mention Tolkien. They were both men of stupendous imagination, and they did NOT live within the tiny \\"logical\\" world of their own madness.As chance would have it, I am investigating Kant right now, and everything I have read up to this point tells me that Kant ringingly \\"proved\\" that the outside world exists pretty much as we observe it.This may be a really important point for philosophers, but it is not something which needs argument with the huge majority of people. You see your girl-friend kissing another guy, and you don't go to Kant for the answer to the question \\"What do I do NOW?\\" Kant is not precisely an expert on the jealous heart, although he would be sure to remind you that both your girl-friend and the other guy must be treated as \\"ends in themselves.\\"No. Mankind has always gone to religion to answer the really tough questions about being human, and the orthodox Christian will run right up against the commandment \\"Thou shalt not kill.\\"What Chesterton does, is to put such issues into bold relief. If you go to an atheist materialist such as I believe Dawkins to be, he may well be a determinist to boot, and feel that it is a waste of time to even speak with you, since *FATE* is the master of all, and there is no *FREE WILL*. Oddly enough, the man who denies these ideas is quite likely to be a Catholic priest. And he'll bring up the commandment \\"Thou shalt not kill\\" without apology or even much explanation.Most of this book is a ringing and funny defense of \\"common sense\\" --- and the sense of wonder which existence often brings to us. After all, even Immanuel Kant had on his tombstone:\\"Two things fill the heart with ever renewed and increasing awe and reverence, the more often and the more steadily we meditate upon them: *the starry firmament above* and *the moral sense within.* \\"You might consider reading this book along withThe Devil's Delusion: Atheism and its Scientific Pretensions. They are both excellent, funny, and stimulating!A Chesterton quote from \\"Orthodoxy\\" to ponder: \\"It is true that a man (a silly man) might make change itself his obect or ideal. But as an ideal, change itself becomes unchangeable. If the change-worshiper wishes to estimate his own progress, he must be sternly loyal to the ideal of change; he must not begin to flirt gaily with the ideal of monotony. Progress itself cannot progress.\\"To sum up: \\"Orthodoxy\\" is simply a classic."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"This book, which Chesterton, an English journalist, novelist and all around early twentieth century public intellectual, is described by him as a \\"slovenly autobiography.\\" While he engages much with competing views of the world prominent in Western culture of his time (and still ours), he is not writing apologetics per se though he is arguing for the truth of Christianity. Religion, like politics, is something deeply personal and intuitive. I enjoy rational argument, but I also enjoy his deeply personal touch which keeps it real.Chesterton is more of a mystic than a rationalist. He observes that insanity is often induced from seeing too much causality in everything. A determinist, who sees only material causation has a worldview that doesn't really encompass our world. It can give the impression of explaining everything, but on second thought it also seems to miss everything. A man who thinks that only material causes exist is like the man who believes that everyone is conspiring against him. The facts gathered from the senses are interpreted to support this narrow conclusion. Every one who glances at him is secretly plotting his demise, everyone who accidentally touches him are planting tracking devices, etc. While both the determinist and this insane man both have explanations that coherently explain everything around them, both also leave out so much. Such minds need to see more possibilities, to have the windows and fans in their minds opened and turned on. They need fresh air.After this rejection of materialism/determinism, Chesterton moves to the reasons why he gravitated towards Christianity. He states that he made these observations before he even considered Christian theology. It is fascinating that he connects Christianity with democracy and practical politics so extensively. The Christian's respect for tradition is very democratic at heart because it extends the principle that we should listen to all people no matter where they are in life by accident of birth, to the notion that we should listen to all people despite the accident of death. \\"It is the democracy of the dead,\\" Chesterton said. The unpopular doctrine of original is also democratic at heart. Evil is not caused primarily by men's environment, nor is it an illusion or hopelessly triumphant. Evil is in the heart of humanity, something that is in each one of us. The one who sees a good God in heaven is philosophically free to turn and see a bad president in Washington. In contrast, most other philosophies are either unconsciously or explicitly complacent in the fact of oppression. It is difficult to justify a rebellion if you are a monist Hindu living out the life of an \`untouchable' due to sins you've committed in previous lives. The giant monuments to the ancient states of Egypt and Babylon show us that when these various deeply pessimistic philosophies and religions are dominant, state power over the individual becomes absolute.Another flaw of materialism is that it rests on a false assumption. If the universe was really personal wouldn't we see more variation in terms of biological laws and physical laws? Isn't that more theistic? Reminding me of Hume, Chesterton notes that really these observations are probabilistic, there is nothing really law-like about them. Three and two must always make five but it is not the same with the color of grass or the rising of the sun. We know that monotony is something that only the young can truly enjoy. The child often says: \\"Do it again,\\" to the adult. Maybe because we have sinned and grown old, our Father is younger than we are. Maybe he says to the sun: \\"Do it again,\\" every morning. Chesterton is wise to point out all of this and more.This book is a gold mine of wisdom and insight that hits home much more than any apologetic text ever has for me. Like Chesterton, I believe in Christianity on the basis of evidence, though I also agree with him that all of life can be mentioned as evidence. As C.S. Lewis said, \\"I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.\\" Christianity is an answer to a riddle. Like every answer though, one has to first discover what the riddle is. Just as in our day, far too many have forgotten the riddle. In short, this riddle is, how are we to live in a sinful world?Chesterton's answer to this won't convince everyone but to those who see the same things in the world as he does and wants the same things in his heart, will agree with him or at least empathize with him. To give a full description and defense of his answer would take too long and be a complete rehashing of this entire book which is beyond the scope of this review. In closing, I will affirm though that Chesterton's answer is also my answer."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Chesterton is a thinker who hits the nail on the head and leaves you excited to say, \\"that is what I've often thought!\\"Orthodoxy addresses foremost one main problem: How can we contrive to be at once astonished at the world and yet at home in it?He says, \\"I wish to set forth my faith as particularly answering this double spiritual need, the need for that mixture of the familiar and the unfamiliar which Christendom has rightly named romance.\\"Concerning orthodox Christianity Chesterton likens it to a man who set out in a boat from England and was quite excited to land on an island only to soon discover he had in fact, landed on England. \\"I am the man who with the utmost daring discovered what had been discovered before.\\"\\"I fancied that I stood alone I was really in the ridiculous position of being backed up by all Christendom.\\"This is G K Chesterton's autobiography.

Although I've been meaning to read these both for over a decade, I decided to do it now and together as I had conceived a project to read them together with Julius Evola's Revolt Against the Modern World as three views of anti-modernism: MacIntyre as a reformed modernist, Evola as a radical reactionary, and Chesterton as a defender of the status quo of the old order. This project didn't quite work out as MacIntyre and Chesterton turned out not to be quite what I thought. Although it's true that MacIntyre made the trip from Marxism to classicism and Catholicism, After Virtue is less an attempt to disabuse us of Marxism than an attempt to re-ground a form of corporatism in a pre-modern mode that would not be subject to the devastating critiques presented by advocates of modern liberal capitalism. And although it's also true that Chesterton defends orthodox Roman Catholicism, he makes no attempt to defend the status quo per se and, in fact, embraces Catholicisim as a stable ground from which he can ask for the dissolution of the traditional social structure. As against these two, Evola is quite another type as he has no interest in ethics' relationship to the distribution of goods; his is an otherworldly and inegalitarian philosophy.In a most general way, MacIntyre argues that reason has been shown incapable of providing a basis for ethics since reasoning requires some starting point outside itself. For MacIntyre, this starting point is our mutual social life and experience of society.Interestingly, Chesterton goes part way toward some of the same analyses as MacIntyre. Both After Virtue and Orthodoxy start from the assumption of the failure of pure reason. For MacIntyre, this is due to a lack of ends, while for Chesterton it is due to a lack of mysticism (Chesterton's word for unexamined assumptions about reality). Reasoning without pre-conditions is shown to be (a) incomplete and incoherent and (b) unhealthy and counterproductive. Chesterton then goes on to examine a number of ethical systems that all fail in one way or another for a lack standards. He brings in the classical-Catholic view of virtues here and argues that some modes of ethics fail for lacking the proportionality of the virtues. Nietzsche fails for being unable to distinguish between willing the good of being a prince and that of a pauper. If these arguments seem unreasonable and based in socially constructed standards, it must be remembered that Chesterton has already dismissed pure reason without a ground of assumptions.Having dismissed modern rationalist theories, Chesterton goes on to explain the assumptions from which he reasons, that is, his own personal mysticism so to speak. Chesterton's mysticism is a conglomeration of principles such as the assumption of design in beauty, a bias in favor of optimism against pessism, and a desire for social reform. He is quite straightforward in admitting that he developed these assumptions in childhood and makes no attempt to defend them. He is, at least, an introspective thinker who has probably more honesty about himself than most thinkers. Chesterton's argument for Christian orthodoxy, then, is essentially that orthodoxy is the philosophy most at home in Chesterton's world of assumptions. This is not a good argument for why you should be orthodox, but it is a perfectly acceptable account for why Chesterton is, and this is all he claimed to be doing in his book.Is it a good or relevant book for us? I think Chesterton assumes that his assumptions are very similar to our own, although I'm not sure that's true in our time and place. Beyond this, although I have sketched a very broad outline of Chesterton's theme or point, his book is filled with a multidude of tiny arguments upon which his theme relies, and I'm not sure they are all good. For example, in discussing Carlyle, he confuses Christianity's attitude toward the state of the soul with a doctrinal assumption that he who least wants to rule ought to be chosen as the ruler. This may be a good guide for choosing a Pope, but it is simply an empirical question whether it is a good guide for choosing a king or a member of parliament. On this point, orthodoxy does not support his levelling political instinct. This is one example, but the book is filled with questionable assumptions and questionable conclusions. Chesterton even at times argues against himself, taking two opposite views at different places in order to score rhetorical points.Orthodoxy is not in any way an argument for orthodoxy in the way we have come to expect arguments. However, Chesterton is not an unreasonable or unpleasant person, and it's possible that one could find the totality of his worldview overwhelming even while rejecting its specifics. His writing is inconsistent and trends from being poetic and insightful to being boorish and repetitive. Whether or not you get much out it depends on what you bring to it, I think.This edition/printing of the book is cheap and looks okay on the outside, but the font and page layout make it difficult to read.

If you're willing to muddle through it may take a couple of reads to really get what he's saying, but then again, anything of worth is worth working for."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"The genius of Chesterton lies not in the specific things that he says (many of the ideas he speaks of are already dead and vanished), but in the way he teaches his listeners to dissect problems and viewpoints from the inside-out, turning them on their heads until we see them differently than everyone else sees them. It's very difficult to put into words exactly what I mean, but this book is a great example, as is his essay collection &#34;All Things Considered.&#34;"},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"In fact, I've read this book probably 5-6 times. The elfland chapter and the maniac and the paradoxes I've read and referred to even many more times than that.GK Chesterton has a great writing style, it's kind of dream-like, like what I'd imagine the inner-dialogue of poets to be, with twists and turns that are not so much like a whirl-wind or racing thoughts, but rather breezy from one thought to the next, and strangely poetic.Chesterton has a reputation for both spotting and employing paradox, which I think plays a large part not only in his wit, but also in articulating Christian thought and perception that is generally difficult for the average Christian to articulate. Chesterton also has a knack for irony, so if you like paradox and irony, you'll at the very least appreciate the mind of GK Chesterton.The only hard things about Chesterton have to do with his day and age in contrast to our own, particularly in areas of language/grammatical differences that 100 years can make and the references he makes to people and events of his time that are relatively obscure to our day and age. Regardless, his ideas still get across and are comprehensible and thought-provoking, and are only briefly interrupted by some obscure reference or idiom, or disjointing grammar.Chesterton is idealistic, and has a naivety that seems deliberate, like he chooses what one might call a 'naive idealism' simply because it's better or more beautiful, and not because he's just some naive simpleton. He definitely not naive, he went down the other road, and my guess is that his love for art and beauty and goodness is what is responsible for him not staying on that road out of repulsion. He's not a fuddy-duddy, he's just someone that had discovered the folly of the anti-Christian world to the point where he could barely even take them seriously anymore and keep a straight face.Chesterton has many relevant things to say to our day and age, the 3 chapters I cited earlier are in my estimation probably the most relevant, since I go back to them repeatedly.I've read just about all of Chesterton's books, but this is the book I've read multiple times and will likely read multiple times more. And there are few books by any author that I can say the same thing about. Every Christian should read this, and...in fact, everyone should read it. I personally think this book is far superior to Mere Christianity (a book I've read once, and enjoyed, but never touched again)"},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Chesterton, using only powerful logic and pleasant prose (not the \\"it's written in such corner of the Bible\\" kind of argument or appealing to emotion through images such as \\"the blood Christ was spilled because of your sins\\") makes Christianity intellectually defensible even in our days. This book is a must-read for anyone interested enough to be reading this review."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"I picked up this book about a week ago because it was recommended to me by a friend. I am so glad he told me to buy it! This book is perhaps the best book I have ever read!Chesterton completely caught me off guard 100 times during this short book. His main hypothesis is to describe what Orthodoxy really is, and I thought I knew what I was going to find. I was absolutely wrong. Chesterton makes it quite clear that his purpose in writing is to warn us to avoid things like \\"modernism,\\" or the falsely called \\"rationalism,\\" so that we can really be free (which is what Orthodox Christianity is all about). He also describes what it is like to be free, along with why Christianity is such a beautiful thing.The book is outlined as such:I. Introduction in Defense of Everything ElseII. The Maniac (hands down the biggest bomb to every hit my personal thought life was in the pages of this chapter)III. The Suicide of ThoughtIV. The Ethics of ElflandV. The Flag of the WorldVI. The Paradoxes of ChristianityVII. The Eternal RevolutionVIII. The Romance of OrthodoxyIX. Authority and the AdventurerI'm not sure whether or not to label this a philosophy book, but it certainly feels as such.

Chesterton to embrace the Christian faith."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"I am not the most well-read man in the world. I would not claim such a title. I think one reason is that I love a great book, and while I don't have a ton of time to read on my own anymore, as a father, full-time philosophy teacher and husband, I seem to spend it re-reading great works. This is most certainly one of them. Even if you are not religious, it is a great read. Now with the Kindle version, I can easily track my favorite quotes and highlights. I have seen no wit like Chesterton. He is accessible to all mature readers. I absolutely adore his humor and charm as a writer. He says what he means and it often shows the keen intellect behind this opus. Read this book! It is a great introspect into how to be both a religious person and logical."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"When one opens G.K. Chesterton's book Orthodoxy, beware - you might just feel like you have been run over by a speeding semi-truck, that is how hard, fast, and powerful this particular book will hit home. Each page overflows with a river of masterful brilliance that can almost overwhelm you as you take in the abundance of truth and impeccably good sense that Chesterton has fattened up his masterpiece book with. If you are unfamiliar with G.K. Chesterton and have never read any of his works before, be forewarned, he is far from being the easiest author to read. That being said, I highly recommend anyone and everyone to check out this masterpiece. I assure you that you will find yourself feeling as if your eyes have been opened for the very first time, and you will be wishing that there were contemporary writers of today that were more like him in their brilliance, personality, and ability - simply put, his genius is unparalleled. Although he has been dead since the 1930's, his work is just as relevant now as it was back then - when compared to popular authors of today, he stands as an intellectual juggernaut towering over everyone else. Simply put, Orthodoxy by G.K. Chesterton serves as one of the all time greatest works of Christian apologetics, and Chesterton himself remains to this very day, arguably the greatest Christian apologist of all time (yes, even ahead of C.S. Lewis). I would also recommend reading his book 'Heretics' which was published before Orthodoxy is its companion. Another book I would recommend is his far more famous work 'The Everlasting Man' which is arguably the greatest work ever in Christian apologetics."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"What more can be said? Chesterton's writing style is glorious, and his subject matter here is profoundly important. I say this in an age that vastly prefers easier answers...in other words, an age that is no different from any other age. Chesterton's sentences ring like silver coins throughout this book. His theological ideas are grounded in human insight that, I daresay, is very hard to argue with. You may or may not become a Christian after reading this book; you may or may not return to a traditional Christianity either. But you will meet a great, sincere mind in these pages, and--I hope--be troubled in the best possible way by what you read."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"The logic that Chesterton brings to the analysis of ideas is amazing. This brings clarity of understanding to even modern ideas and topics. Orthodoxy is a wonderful resource."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Chesterton's slant on an idea is interesting since he said in his time people were not believing in sin so let's call it something else and look at it from that angle. I'm enchanted with his look at the history of the time even through it was very much written for the time and place, for instance it took me a few paragraphs to determine the meaning of \\"Hanwell\\". Does well for the mystery and delving deeper. Haven't completed the book as yet so I'll have to leave it at that."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Like C.S. Lewis, G.K. Chesterton is one of the greatest apologists of all time. &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; is a masterpiece of Christian literature, my favourite part being the chapter on paradoxes.Only the most ingrained skeptics won't find intelligent and useful insights in this book, but that's because they refuse to find anything insightful in any Christian's work.G.K. Chesterton has a great sense of humour, a wonderful style of prose, and is clearly a most amazing thinker and a uniquely brilliant Christian. I highly recommend it to all honest seekers &amp; thinkers."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"I think perhaps the best way to describe G. K. Chesterton is the way he described the character Sunday in his book &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot;: &quot;He's such a bounder.&quot; Truly, Chesterton, like Sunday, had a huge personality, but his hugeness was the hugeness of a balloon. There is nothing stuffy or monolithic about Chesterton's works. They are never dull or heavy. They seem to breathe with vigor and vitality. Chesterton was indeed a great man. He has a greatness of spirit like few other authors I have read; sometimes I think if he took on the whole of the modern world it would be the world that got the beating."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Chesterton is difficult to read because he makes references to things and places that I do not know about but his work is still good reading.If you don't get his point just keep reading and you soon will because he gives so many examples that sooner or later you will understand one and it becomes clear."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Chesterton was a gleefully confessed madman and a genius with language, but he's also very &quot;Johnsonian&quot; in his own way--and by that I mean that much like dear Dr. Johnson he says everything so well ... that sometimes you're so delighted by the prosity that you don't consider the message. I'm less blinded by the textual pyrotechnics than I once was, and I'm less wholeheartedly dazzled by the philosophy than I once found myself ... but it's still an interesting read and it still makes some remarkable so-obvious-you-never-noticed-it observations about life, the universe and everything.The best thing you can say about Chesterton is that you don't have to agree with him to enjoy reading him."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Few new books rival old ones! G.K. Chesterton's Orthodoxy (Image Books edition, 1959) was first published in 1924 and deserves repeated re-readings. In it he seeks \\"to state the philosophy in which I have come to believe. I will not call it my philosophy; for I did not make it. God and humanity made it; and it made me\\" (p. 9). After, trying, as a young man, to be avant garde and daringly original, the mature Chesterton simply \\"discovered what had been discovered before\\" (p. 11), orthodox Christianity, the tenets of the Apostles' Creed. Had Tom Oden read, as a youngster, and heeded, Chesterton's message, he might have avoided some lamented dead-end pathways.As a young man, an agnostic by the age of 16, Chesterton cheerfully embraced the reigning notions of modernity. He had no grounding in Christian philosophy; he naively accepted what educators and publicists said concerning \\"certainties\\" such as Darwinism. His journey to orthodoxy came when he read the alleged authorities (Huxley, Spencer, et al.) and found them advocating learned nonsense.For all their intellectual sophistication, Chesterton found \\"moderns\\" in his day befuddled by \\"the suicide of thought.\\" Thinkers doubted there's truth to be found, though they never doubted the truth of their personal thoughts. Espousing materialism, they insisted everything (thought included) flows from rigidly determined sources, making free will and personal decision meaningless. Yet, of course, they passionately argued their views and insisted you change your mind and accept their mechanistic interpretation of events!One thing struck me, noting the intellectual heavyweights Chesterton debated: most of them today are utterly passe. The most advanced thinkers fifty years ago have largely slipped into the wastebaskets of intellectual history! More current champions now dominate the academy and the media, though their ideas, differently dressed, haven't changed much. Yet the orthodoxy championed (if not Chesterton himself) remains continually contemporary.For example, Christian dogma gives one reason to believe in both the dignity and depravity of man: created in the image of God we have a right to assert human dignity, but fallen in Adam we find it necessary to seek forgiveness and grace. At the heart of Chesterton's message is an abiding awareness of the necessary truth of original sin, \\"the only part of Christian Theology which can really be proved\\" (p. 15). Modern thinkers, then and now, prefer to evade this truth, but accepting it enables one to make sense of oneself and one's world.In addition, Chesterton found himself amazed that anti-Christian polemics seemed so contradictory. (One critic would complain that Christianity was too complex, the next would accuse it of being too simple.) So Chesterton turned to Christian sources to discover for himself exactly what was being attacked. There he found the key which reclaimed for him the world he'd hungered for since infancy, the \\"romance of orthodoxy.\\"Like C.S. Lewis's Mere Christianity, Chesterton's Orthodoxy is one of those slim treatises we may rightly deem a \\"classic.\\" It helps bring us back, with delightful style, to the substance of historic Christianity.# # #"},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"There are very few writers I can remember who have a wit and a mastery of words equal to Chesterton's (Annie Dillard is just about the only one I can think of). For that reason alone, Orthodoxy is worth reading for just about any lover of words, believer of not. He has the most extraordinary way of saying the most absurd things that are also perfectly logical. He says those obvious things that had never struck you before, and it's utter sublimity when you happen upon those moments in this text. Of course, Chesterton's whole goal in writing this book is to provide that sort of insight. Perhaps the most adventuresome, the most true way of looking at the world and of living in this world is the very old way that's been sitting right in front of us all the time, orthodox Christianity. It may sound crazy. Certainly, \\"mystery\\" and \\"adventure\\" aren't words that always spring to mind when one thinks of Christianity, but they should be. Chesterton's the sort of writer that can make Christianity seem like something new. This isn't a perfect book, but it's close. And it should be a must-read for everyone."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Some books are timeless classics. In the world of Christian classics Orthodoxy is one of them. It is G. K. Chesterton's account of his search for authentic Christianity in the midst of the conflicting voices of the modern world. So it is both deeply theological and also personal, even quirky, in its critical review of the various other, opposing approaches to life.Chesterton was a contemporary of Leo Tolstoy, H. G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw. Much of what he writes is \\"in answer\\" to them and their divergent views of the meaning of life.Chesterton came to a deeply held Christian faith that took its outward expression in his 1922 conversion to Roman Catholicism. Today, Chesterton is best remembered as the creator of the \\"Father Brown\\" detective stories, but he was a prolific writer, penning studies of Robert Browning (1903) and Charles Dickens (1906), novels including The Napoleon of Notting Hill (1904) and The Man Who Was Thursday (1908), poems, collected in 1927 and essays, collected in Tremendous Trifles (1909) and Come to Think of It (1930).In the opening chapter of Orthodoxy, Chesterton \\"eliminates the competition\\" by skewering competing world-view theories, showing their warts and all. He then describes flawed approaches to life that will lead to despair, in the second chapter, \\"The Suicide of Thought.\\" Having put erroneous views to rest, for the remainder of the book he describes the central truths of Christianity as the only correct way of understanding creation and human life.Chesterton portrays himself as one who has traveled all around the world, only to have arrived at home again as if it were some new and strange land. \\"Home\\" being the traditions of Christian faith. Such a journey may seem unnecessary, but you will agree that same paradox appears in everything from Dorothy's journey in the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" to T. S. Eliot in \\"Little Gidding.\\" It is the way of human kind, according to Chesterton, to seek and to find-even if what is found was \\"there all along.\\" (A fact echoed in Chesterton's dedication of the book \\"To My Mother\\").Those who read Orthodoxy will travel with Chesterton as guide-which may be the best way to go, because he is an amusing intellectual companion who has trod that way before.Philip Yancey wrote the foreword to this edition and claims this book transformed his Christian understanding. If that is not enough to tempt you to read it, perhaps this quotation will: \\"The orthodox church never took the tame course or accepted the conventions; the orthodox church was never respectable... It is easy to be a madman; it is easy to be a heretic. It is always easy to let the age have its head; the difficult thing is to keep one's own.\\" (page 149).Chesterton has been called been called \\"the prince of paradox\\" because his theology is often robed in a light, energetic, rapid-paced and whimsical style. This was brought about to no small degree by his custom of dictating all of his writings. (A custom, we might note, shared by none other than the Apostle Paul).If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"In a lucid exposition, G. K. Chesterton calls it the way he sees it. Consider the fallacy of the inner light, i.e., one's own internal inspiration. He says such people who worship the god within worship themselves. He is not talking about the Spirit within in this case, he's talking about self-worship.On health matters. He says there is something unhealthy in the mere pursuit of health. Consider his observation about courage, &quot;Courage is almost a contradiction in terms. It means a strong desire to live taking the form of a readiness to die.&quot;On things unseen he writes about miracles and people who believe in them. &quot;For some extraordinary reason, there is a fixed notion that it is more liberal to disbelieve in miracles than to believe in them. Why, I cannot imagine, nor can anybody tell me.&quot;He adds that those who believe in miracles do so because they have evidence, whereas those who disbelieve do so because they have doctrine that teaches them so."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"I feel sort of silly trying to review a book by Chesterton so I'll just say this: I have read this book twice. The first time I read it I was so disappointed in it that I became angry for having wasted my time. To my eventual benefit I wrote scathing remarks in the margins of each page.A decade later I picked it up again and that's when things got weird. As I read it a second time I got the distinct impression that I was reading a vastly different book. Had the contents magically changed? My scathing margin notes remained the same, however, and I could vaguely discern which passages from Chesterton they were allegedly referring to. I could even, with the help of my notes, reconstruct what I had once thought Chesterton was &quot;hopelessly trying to say.&quot; Since my second reading I have come to regard it as one of my favorite writings.

There was some one thing that was too great for God to show us when He walked upon our earth...His mirth.&quot; (Orthodoxy)Beautiful, isn't it! Chesterton is the Ring Master of thoughts, able to take our fragmented ideas and tame them with a perfect balance of eloquence, poetry, and logic. He is also like a skilled combatant. How is a non-believer, or a non-catholic, able joust with this man's mind? His ideas are razor sharp, liberating for those who seek the truth but deadly for those who would dare wield their clumsy philosophy. And his delivery is nothing less than a masterful marksman--right at the heart of the matter."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Indeed there is no one like G.K. in our generation though not a few have been nourished by his poetic brilliance and second naivete. His sentences are packed full of witty logic that teases our minds to active thought. If one simply reads it like a text book trying to reproduce the arguments later, it will not do the text justice. It is the sort of book that provokes you to think rather than does the thinking for you.The book has many memorable quotes and they jump out at you every now and then when one engages other books that deal with similar subjects as explored here - creeds, apologetics, orthodoxy, rationality, myths, etc. Recently there has been a rehash of some old charges at Christianity for being too meek on the one hand (as in 'turn the other cheek') and too violent on the other (the Crusades, witch hunt, etc), I'm once again reminded of Chesterton's poignant remark that the critics are often shooting from both sides of the mouth and end up totally incoherent. 'What if the reason why we find the man in question (ie. Jesus) either too thin or fat is because he is of the right shape, and we are the odd ones?' quips GK. The point is that the Christian faith is so richly textured and paradoxed that it could not have been invented by mere logic. It is so intricately shaped as the key to the world's many faceted-questions and mysteries. G.K. makes the Christian creeds come alive as a rich and life-changing narrative that renders all heresies thin, fluffy and dull by comparison indeed!"},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"This classic collection of essays by the writer of The Father Brown Mysteries is filled with revelations. Of particular interest is the piece titled \\"The Ethics of Elfland.\\" That essay changed my life.I have to say that, for a modernist such as myself, reading Chesterton's works is a great challenge. His use of language is tedious at times - that is, until you get to know him. Then, his logic and his humor become pure, exaltive revelation. There is no one quite like Chesterton in our time.Many reviewers approach his writings purely from a Christian view point. But, that is really not essential. These essays are for everyone, religious or not. They are all about common sense and logic.Getting back to the Ethics of Elfland mentioned above: Read just that essay - with patience and an open mind, and you will become a child again -at heart."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"ORTHODOXYOrthodoxyIf you enjoy mental gymnastics along with your Christian education, you will love this book.

A definite \\"must\\" for anyone who wishes to deal with the issues of modernity and faith."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"It's a whirlwind of provocative thought. Clever beyond what most any other writer can pull off. A defense of his faith that could almost convince the faithless, and if not, at least it will entertain them.I agree with the previous reviewer that it isn't to be studied. Chesterton mouths off with a flurry of defenses that may not always hold up under scrutiny, but that's part of why he's so enjoyable. He argues his point so passionately and furiously that it becomes fascinating and funny. And sometimes his defenses hold up so well under scrutiny that they change your view - he's gifted at pointing out the emptiness of popular arguments against the strength of the old ones.Read the chapter on THE PARADOXES OF CHRISTIANITY and decide yourself."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"In this masterpiece Chesterton spells out in strong literary beauty the apparent contradictions in Christianity that baffle non-Christians. He draws the distinction between the 'balance' that many people search for and the paradox in Christianity. The Christian is not searching for a balance, but wants both seeming opposites in their fullest degree. Chesterton lays the truth of Christianity on the line in this book showing his conversion and by doing so assists others in their own conversions."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"This book is oft' given the quite unfair burden of being compared to CS Lewis' Mere Christianity. They are however very dissimilar.In so far as developing a practicum understanding of the Christian worldview, Lewis should probably be recommended. In so far as dealing with overtly intellectual issues (the collapse of idealism, the belittlement of epistemology, and other modern notions), GK Chesterton should be recommend. Chesterton was confronting the Modernist movement head on. His interest lie with the modernist tendency to think of truth as unknowable or as merely personal preference. It's a stunningly apt response to such trains of thought. If you are in an intellectually driven sphere, GK has a lot to offer. His work is well able to drive people deeper into their intellectual constructed worlds, but I think the sane individual will opt instead to use it as an opportunity to understand the greatness, the vastness, and the utter reality of the world."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"A great book even for its literary excellence alone.

I would recommend the book, but only to those with some background in reading and studying historical and theological writing."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"They say the truth has a certain ring to it. This book clangs loudly.

This book should be required reading in all Theology classes. Don't buy this for your library buy it to read it."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Over the course of the modern era, whether fairly or not, orthodoxy has come to be associated with glumness and austerity. Thus, those coming across Orthodoxy by G.K. Chesterton might assume they are in for a dull and obtuse recitation of doctrine and dogma. They will, however, be delightfully surprised by Chesterton's wit, feistiness, and zest for life.It is Chesterton's contention that, rather than stifling the individual, it is through orthodoxy that man is liberated to both accept and embrace the contradictions of this life for what they really are in all their wonder and horror. It is the heretic that is unable to rise to a level that would give him a perspective that would enable him to appreciate things as they actually are since the heretic is ultimately beholden unto these very forces of life. Chesterton muses, \\"Thoroughly worldly people never understand even the world; they rely altogether on a few cynical maxims which are not true (22).\\"Often, believers are accused of being close minded. However, Chesterton contends that Christians are no more close minded than the adherents of any other outlook. Chesterton writes, \\"For we must remember that the materialist philosophy...is certainly much more limiting than any religion...The Christian is quite free to believe that there is a considerable amount of settled order and inevitable development in the universe. But the materialist is not allowed to admit into his spotless machine the slightest speck of spiritualism or miracle (41).\\"As a result, the heterodox mind must increasingly withdrawal from a world that declares the glory of God in order to maintain the consistency of the fiction it has constructed. For example, in illustrating views regarding the existence of sin, Chesterton offers the following humorous illustration, \\"If it be true...that a man can feel exquisite happiness in skinning a cat, then the religious philosopher can only draw one of two deductions. He must either deny the existence of God, as all atheists do; or he must deny the present union between God and man, as all Christians do. The new theologians seem to think it a highly rationalistic solution to deny the cat (24).\\"Those adverse to traditional religious notions have constructed elaborate epistemological systems in an attempt to justify their unbelief. However, Chesterton assures, such intellects (though formidable by human standards in terms of the facts such minds have accumulated) actually bear a startling resemblance to the insane.Like the insane, rationalists view themselves as the source of all meaning. In the struggle and strain to understand everything, Chesterton notes, the consistent rationalist is actually driven mad as they end up losing everything but their reason. Chesterton observes, \\"The man who begins to think without the proper first principles goes mad; he begins to think at the wrong end...But we may ask in conclusion, if this be what drives men mad, what is it that keeps them sane (48)?\\"The answer provided by Chesterton is none other than the mystical imagination found in religious orthodoxy. The thing about the cosmos human beings occupy is that is both physically and epistemologically too complex for the finite mind to fully comprehend. The only thing we can do is appreciate what we can and to accept that there is a power beyond us. Chesterton notes, \\"The real trouble with this world of ours is not that it is an unreasonable world, nor even that it is a reasonable one. The commonest kind of trouble is that it is nearly reasonable but not quite (148).\\"Chesterton further likens the spiritual realm to two wild horses threatening to bolt off into the extremities of either direction with only the church adhering to orthodoxy capable of reining in these powerful tendencies that are good and pure when kept together as a team but result in heartache and ruin if not kept working together in tandem. Ironically, Chesterton claims, though often depicted as scatterbrained the best poets (actually quite sensible and businesslike) are often the ones embodying the spirit necessary for handling this awesome responsibility. For what the average person desires above all else is a life of practical romance defined by Chesterton as \\"the combination of something that is strange with something that is secure (16).\\" And what is any more mysterious and secure at the same time than God Himself?Written in the early years of the twentieth century, some of the authors mentioned by Chesterton might seem obscure to readers not that familiar with general literary history. However, the fact that they have been forgotten while Chesterton is still embraced as a foremost defender of the faith is a positive testament to the relevance of Chesterton's ruminations that, though written nearly a century ago, ring with a truth that sounds as if they just rolled off the presses.by Frederick Meekins"},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"After reading the first paragraph, I thought, \\"I wish I had written this book.\\"Chesterton has the gift of thought and the gift of expression, a rare commodity in the age of chatter and blather.

Americans see God through the squint of Puritanism, so we see Him as merely a syllogism or a cosmic party pooper. We forget that our God was once accused of being a glutton and wine-bibber.

Chesterton takes a look at things to which we seldom pay serious attention - or better yet, his way to look at those things is wholly unique. Seemingly illogical arguments are developed so ingeniously that when Chesterton reaches his conclusions, the trapped reader can do nothing but gasp in awe and amazement. Every piece of the puzzle *does* fall in its place... &quot;Orthdoxy&quot; also stuns with its mere writing style. Its language soares on another level which is playful, scathingly beautiful and expressive at the same time.

A definite oxymoron!"},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Recognizing that Chesterson's Orthodoxy appeared in numerous lists of \\"books to read\\", and granting the premise that it is therefore a worthwhile book to obtain, I decided to get a copy and give it a try. Immediately, the question became - which version to purchase? I quickly found that on Amazon there are no less than 45 paperback editions available (some are almost certainly duplicates, but still), and 12 hardcover versions. There are even 6 different Kindle versions!Such is the quandary for books in the public domain; every print-on-demand operation can offer it up, and how do you know which ones are good quality and which are not? I have read enough Amazon reviews complaining of poor quality books, some that seem to be scanned and not proof-read and thus contain numerous spelling and other errors, others missing entire pages, that I was very very hesitant to try anything other than an edition from Penguin or Oxford Classics or other comparable reliable publishers.When I discovered this \\"Centennial Edition\\" (good marketing, that), and did some checking, I was satisfied that it was worth trying out. I have not been disappointed. I have the book in front of me as I type this review, and I can report that it is a very good quality book, well produced, and to me it is indistinguishable from a book printed by a \\"traditional\\" publisher. This is not a bare-bones, simple printing of the book. It is perfectly typeset, well designed and attractive, and with a very nice style to the production. It is in all respects completely satisfactory.If you are looking for an edition of Orthodoxy, that is a reasonably priced and high quality paperback, I can recommend without hesitation that you purchase this edition.(The publisher, Sam Torode Book Arts, is not shown by Amazon as the publisher; rather \\"CreateSpace\\" is listed, as they are the print-on-demand publisher utilized by Torode. There are several other books by Chesterton available on Amazon that are produced by this same designer/publisher. I have no association with that company, I can only say that I would expect that the quality of those books would be the equivalent to this printing, and they would be equally worthy of recommendation. See alsoThe Man Who Was Thursday,The Innocence of Father Brown,The Ball and the Cross,Saint Francis of Assisi,Saint Thomas Aquinas, andHeretics)."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"I bought the book for my husband who REALLY likes Chesterton.

But other than simple amusement at his turns of phrase, there is little that is intellectually bearable in this book. His logic is like a sieve full of self-defeating holes. Appalled and exasperated, I could not bring myself to read past the first half of the book. An agnostic, maybe I shouldn't have hoped to be impressed by what was clearly meant ONLY for people of strong Christian faith. However, I do have respect for Chesterton's passion for his faith. I can now begin to understand what having a romance with one's faith means. This is a valiant attempt to be persuasive in an area where religious faith has no business in, is inescapably incompatible with, and hence should stay clear of--the logical, intellectual realm. No matter how much passion Chesterton has or how formidable his strength of conviction is, he cannot perform miracles in a fact-bound world; blind religious faith simply cannot be reconciled with factual scientific logic. His only excuse is that he existed in a time when science was not as advanced as it is today."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Having come recently to the Orthodox faith, I eagerly cracked the covers of G.K. Chresterton's ORTHODOXY, The Romance of Faith. What I found was a carmudgeon's rantings, which for the most part consisted of points that had faulty underpinnings. More disturbing still was the underlying racism and elitism woven throughout the fabric of this so-called testimonal on faith. Fortunatley for me, this book isn't even actually about Orthodoxy, but about Roman Catholicism, and Anglicanism, so my burgeoning faith is still safe from the likes of Chesterton."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Portly, fun loving, witty G.K. Chesterton decided to write this book as a companion volume to his book HERETICS. Since HERETICS had criticised contemporary philosophies, ORTHODOXY was written to present an alternative viewpoint, and is therefore both affirmative in tone and autobiographical in many places. A sampling of his chapter titles gives some idea of Chesterton's sense of fun as well as his unusual approach to the matter of Christianity. Chapter one is &quot;In Defense of Everything Else&quot; (one pictures Chesterton with a whimsical, impish smile on his face as he wrote this). There are also chapters on &quot;The Suicide of Thought&quot;, &quot;The Ethics of Elfland&quot; (a really superb chapter), &quot;The Maniac&quot;, and &quot;The Paradoxes of Christianity&quot;. In this easily readable book (only 160 pages in the small paperback edition), Chesterton shows that theological reflections and philosophical ruminations need be neither boring nor incomprehensible. This was jolly good fun to read, being both funny and intellectually stimulating. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"This book is Chesterton's defence of orthodox Christianity. It is partly autobiographical, in the sense that Chesterton describes various insights into the nature of reality, and various puzzles about reality, and then shows how (to his astonishment) the Christian faith accounts for the insights and answers the puzzles.The following quote expresses this idea:&quot;This, therefore, is, in conclusion, my reason for accepting the religion and not merely the scattered and secular truths out of the religion. I do it because the thing has not merely told this truth or that truth, but has revealed itself as a truth-telling thing. All other philosophies say the things that plainly seem to be true; only this philosophy has again and again said the thing that does not seem to be true, but is true. Alone of all creeds it is convincing where it is not attractive; it turns out to be right, like my father in the garden.&quot;But don't just take my word for it! You can read it online from the G.K.Chesterton web page and then buy the book!"},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Orthodoxy is written for the poet and the child in each of us (The latter being that part of us Jesus said can inherit the Kingdom). Orthodoxy is, at the same time, one of the wisest, and funniest, books I have ever read; almost up to the level of Everlasting Man. It seems to me he does give a logically challenging, if rather whimsical, argument for the Christian faith here. And having read many of the most famous skeptics of our time, his argument remains no less timely, powerful, and suggestive.How do I explain the reaction of the reader below, then, who appears intelligent, but finds &quot;Little that is intellectually bearable&quot; in this book, and could not even read it through once without throwing it down in disgust? For one thing, Chesterton's approach is not scientific, but psychological. For those to whom science is the only god, a little prior reading might be worthwhile -- John Polkinghome or Hugh Ross on evidences for the Creator in modern cosmology, for example. Let Scott Peck's People of The Lie search your heart. Or even try my book, Jesus and the Religions of Man, which offers empirical evidence of a more historical nature for the truth of the Christian claims. Let the facts presented in these books take the edge of your arrogance.Then, maybe, go for a walk through Mt. Rainier National Park when the huckleberries are reddening in the fall, or skin dive in Hawaii. Or walk through a dark forest on a clear night when the stars are out. Observe and wonder. Become a child again. Laugh at your certainties and prejudices a little. Then try reading this book again.&quot;(Skepticism) discredits supernatural stories that have some foundation, simply by telling natural stories that have no foundation.&quot; &quot;The only fun of being a Christian was that a man was not left alone with the Inner Light, but definitely recognized an outer Light, fair as the sun. . .&quot;&quot;To be allowed to make love to the moon and then to complain that Jupiter kept his own moons in a harem seemed to me a vulgar anti-climax.&quot; You still don't see the relevence or wisdom of such teachings? Oh, well. Chesterton did warn, &quot;If a man would make his world large, he must be always making himself small. . . It is impossible without humility to enjoy anything -- even pride.&quot; This book, I guess, is no exception."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Chesterton's \\"Orthodoxy\\" and Lewis' \\"Mere Christianity\\" are classics of contemporary Christian apologetics. Both write to a similar audience, namely, secular academics. Lewis' appeal was broader, however, for he was reaching out to those people influenced or educated by these academics. Consequently, these books are full of reason and logic but are devoid of Bible quotes. This might dismay some fundamentalists, but this type of apologetic is absolutely necessary. Just as a Muslim will not convince a Christian regarding Islam by quoting the Qu'ran, so, in most cases, a Christian will not convert a secular academic by quoting the Bible. The appeal must be made on common ground, in this case, reason and logic. In this regard, Chesterton succeeds.That being said, I give the book only 3 stars because of his rambling, time-sensitive style. It is easy for an American reading in the 21st century to become completely lost in Chesterton's quips and references to late-modernity intellectuals.Lewis' broader appeal makes him more accessible to Chesterton, so I recommend \\"Mere Christianity\\" over \\"Orthodoxy\\" to the average 21st century American, whereas I recommend \\"Orthodoxy\\" to those who are educated in late 19th and early 20th-century intellectualism.Both books are useful for Christians in developing apologetic skills and for non-Christians, especially seculars, in understanding a traditional, intellectual, and non-fundamentalist brand of Christianity."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Love this book. Chesterton is sort of the Mark Twain of apologetics. Reading it I found that I was laughing one minute and seriously blown away the next. I am not a Christian, but this book gave me hope that maybe there is a place for a logic and faith based Christianity which is both orthodox and stronger than a fearful fundamentalism. I like the fact that Chesterton opposes his critics while for the most part honestly respecting them as intelligent people. It's the sign of a man secure in his ideas.I would recommend this book to any other failed pagans out there. Would also be a good read for any agnostic interested in the role of imagination in simple, thoughtful living."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Not since The Great Divorce by CS Lewis have I read a book this surprising. Like Lewis, Chesterton employs what is seemingly whimsical to chart a course of logic. The reader, politely enduring what is plainly fanciful, soon finds that Chesterton has stolen the lead. Doubling back, he then takes the solidity of accrued wisdom to playfully poke the materialist in the eye.Good natured, jovial, yet deeply perceptive, Orthodoxy not only defends the Christian worldview, but seeks, in the Catholic tradition, to establish ecclesiastical authority. To the extent that it does so is up to the reader. I never found Chesterton less than provocative and often entirely persuasive. His reasoning is frequently unexpected, but always (and supremely) pertinent. Though I am no longer Catholic and may, rightly or wrongly, suspect the institution (see papal infallibility), I consider Orthodoxy highly ecumenical and a welcome girder for my faith. 5 stars."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Chesterton is a classic, who deserves the best in terms of publication and commentary, including footnotes and a proper introduction. The Moody Classics printing has no footnotes, and the editors have chosen to use an introduction by Charles Colson, which does not do justice to Chesterton's prose or to his intellect and originality. The book is probably essential, certainly as much as any book can be said to be essential, especially for readers who want to consider and reconsider Christian faith and Christian culture, from the point of view of a brilliant, wonderously informed, careful and passionate Christian writer, whose love of God and men and women, and good writing, and decency and reason, and life and creation, is palpable on every page."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Once I had the good fortune to be in a discussion group for this book. Like most book reading groups, most of the members didn't read the book, skimming or glancing at it, barely cracking the cover. However, this book was different. It exercised a spell even on those who didn't read it. Why? Because Chesterton is so given to aphorisms that even if you don't follow his logic (or illogic some might contend) or don't agree with his arguments (or random trains of thought in another view), you still might be caught by some pithy epigram or turn of phrase.I heartily throw in my lot with all those who think this is GKC's best non-fiction book, but I'd rather tackle the opposite concern of the problems it poses for the casual reader. One reason is that Chesterton often resorts to metonymy as a kind of shorthand, which means he uses a piece to represent a whole. In a bad writer, this amounts to stereotyping (of which Chesterton has been accused). In a good writer it nevertheless anchors the work to a time and locality.In Chesterton, it means you need to either be an anglophile or have a good grip of things British. You don't know that gaol is a jail or Pimlico slang for prison. Bedlam represents a madhouse. Taking this idea to extremes, he often uses a hot button word to represent an idea (and nearly always an idea opposite to that commonly held). Anybody else would accompany such passing thoughts with reams of footnotes and disclaimers, but Chesterton eschewed both, and instead goes for the naked effect.The example that comes to mind is that he seems to be arguing in favor of the Inquisition, when in fact he's making some other point altogether. For most readers that conjures the horrors of Torquemada as lampooned in Mel Brook's movie History of the World Part One. GKC however, is referring not to the Spanish excesses, but to the gentler, kinder version on the continent which at its inception not only had no truck with torture but in fact forbade it.As most readers are aware, Chesterton was Anglican (Church of England) when he wrote this book, although his thinking is arguably Anglo-Catholic. It's also largely a book of thinking out loud rather than a settled, finished statement. Some chapters therefore read easier than others, The Ethics of Elfland and The Flag of the World being the premier examples.So many readers are so happy to discover Chesterton that he is quoted everywhere from Rolling Stone to Looney Tunes (In a Chuck Jones Foghorn Leghorn cartoon the chickenhawk's pop is named G.K.Chickenhawk). I think that's a good thing because these days many people are not readers, preferring video games or some other entertainment, and of those who are, many don't \\"get\\" Chesterton. While this may prevent a full scale Chesterton revival, it opens doors for those who, like Phillip Yancey and Dale Ahlquist bring him up every chance they get, and gives those of us taken by his ideas or at least a few epigrams a chance to scatter the largesse."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Before his series of Father Brown mysteries, G.K. Chesterton wrote &quot;Orthodoxy,&quot; an autobiographical 'detective' story of how he came to believe the Christian faith. Drawing from &quot;the truth of some stray legend or from the falsehood of some dominant philosophy...an anarchist club or a Babylonian temple what I might have found in the nearest parish church,&quot; Mr. Chesterton playfully and inductively reasons his way toward the one worldview that best explains and preserves the phenomena in the world he found around himself.The world around Mr. Chesterton was rife with Modernism in the early twentieth century. Based on philosophies of the late nineteenth century, religious and political traditions were being questioned. Anarchism, communism, and socialism were the parlor topics of the day; the merely symbolic importance of religion was being settled upon. These are the roots of our post-modern society today in which the meaning of nearly everything (even words, according to literary deconstructionists) is now in doubt. At one point in the chapter entitled &quot;The Suicide of Thought,&quot; Mr. Chesterton quips, &quot;We are on the road to producing a race of men too mentally modest to believe in the multiplication table.&quot; An exaggeration even today, undoubtedly. Still, we have traveled quite a distance philosophically since the era before the World Wars, and &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; is an excellent snapshot of where we've come from.But be warned: This snapshot captures a lot of active thought. It took me a couple of reads over as many years to get a handle on the structure of the book, and now the rest of it has been becoming clearer to me. Part of the problem is Mr. Chesterton's writing style. There is much playfulness in his language, and a reader could mistakenly conclude that the author's reasoning relies heavily upon wordplay, the turn of a phrase to turn the tables on his opponents. It can become frustrating if one isn't careful. Mr. Chesterton himself acknowledges this impression, &quot;Mere light sophistry is the thing that I happen to despise the most of all things, and it is perhaps a wholesome fact that this is the thing of which I am generally accused.&quot; But don't miss the meat for the gravy (or the salad for the dressing, as your case may be). The potency of his arguments doesn't rely on his clever semantics but on his connections between observed facts and the ancient, corresponding orthodoxy of Christianity. Mr. Chesterton has fun with words because he can, not because he needs to.This mixture of cleverness and careful thinking ultimately leads Mr. Chesterton to this conclusion: Christian faith is well-reasoned trust in Christ. And the desire for well-reasoned trust is a &quot;practical romance,&quot; as Mr. Chesterton calls it--a need in the ordinary person for &quot;the combination of something that is strange with something that is secure...an idea of wonder and an idea of welcome.&quot; A way to accept the knowable while looking beyond it toward what is yet to be known.Mr. Chesterton wrote &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; for people looking for that kind of romance. &quot;If anyone is entertained by learning how the flowers of the field or the phrases in an omnibus, the accidents of politics or the pains of youth came together in a certain order to produce a certain conviction of Christian orthodoxy, he may possibly read this book.&quot; However, this book isn't for everyone. &quot;If a man says that extinction is better than existence or blank existence better than variety and adventure, then he is not one of the ordinary people to whom I am talking. If a man prefers nothing I can give him nothing.&quot; The inconvincible cannot be convinced. Yet the skeptical (such as Mr. Chesterton once was) can be because they are the doubters who're still looking around. I myself come from a skeptic's background and regard &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; as a plausible, if sometimes difficult to comprehend, and wonderful way someone can come to trust the claims of Christianity."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"In ORTHODOXY, Chesterton provides somewhat of a spiritual autobiography for the reader, weaving together his eloquent writing style with his brilliant Christian apologetics. This book challenges the mind, while arousing a sense of wonder that truly captures the deep spirituality of G.K. Chesterton's own pilgrimage. He explores the realm of mystery in the Orthodox view, while engaging the tradition that it encompasses, transforming it from a safe haven of believe to a rich &quot;romance&quot; of faith and uncertainty. The attentive reader will have difficulty putting this book down."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"The Romance Of Faith. Like any real romance, this book about faith can be peeled back in each reading to reveal a deeper and richer truth.

To truly believe leads us to truly live. For years this has been my favorite book -- and one which shows the richness and jolly goodness of faith.One caveat -- must smoke a pipe while reading in order to fully appreciate book."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"G. K. Chesterton's \\"Orthodoxy\\" is a timeless text defending the orthodoxy of orthodoxy. Using his personal journey from intellectual atheist to intellectual Christian (no, that's not an oxymoron) as a roadmap, Chesterton brilliantly traces the rhyme and reason for belief in the historic, orthodox doctrines of Christianity.Amazingly, his descriptions of the intellectual climate of his times reads like a weatherman's prognostications for today's weather conditions. Writing fifty years before the supposed advent of post-modernity, Chesterton's defense of Christianity as the one true meta-narrative addresses post-modernism powerfully, relevantly, and effectively.Combine this with the poetry of his prose and his experiential honesty, and you have a book without peer in addressing the crying need of our day. I highly recommend \\"Orthodoxy\\" not only for the thinking (and perhaps doubting) Christian, but also for the seeking agnostic.Reviewer: Dr. Robert W.

I found he rambles a little. That isn't to say his writings are not intelligent. He was an extremely erudite man who was well up on the philosophies and thought fads of his day. In his late 40's he converted to Catholicism and here gives some defense of religion in general. Mainly I find his point is top say that rationalism and logic doesn't answer all of man's questions. This is exactly what I had wanted to hear, and was looking for some reading that addressed that topic though I didn't know where to look. I do believe I was led by our Lord to this book. And through this book I have begun to think differently about things. That life itself and not just religion holds both logical and illogical standpoints. This paradox is what is found in religion, and religious people should not be afraid to admit. Even the most staunch atheist must admit that ultimately he cannot even absolutely prove his own existence, never mind the existence of the universe! We live in a world of faith and probability, and I believe that probability is strongly on my side when it comes to the existence of God, the Resurrection of Christ and the Church which He established.Another book I would recommend though Protestant in nature isNEW EVIDENCE THAT DEMANDS A VERDICT: Fully Updated to Answer the Questions Challenging Christians Today. I do not agree with it all, and as with everything you must read it with an open mind. But this book has been a great help to me of recent times just as it was when I first committed my life to Christ.If you read this review, please pray for me that I may remain faithful to our Lord until the end of my life, that I may stand confident in His presence on that day. And I will pray for you also, for all who pray for me."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"I've enjoyed CS Lewis for years and only recently became convinced that I should get some exposure to Chesterton. Like Lewis, CHesterton's writing is very British, and something of a struggle getting through some of it, but he has an excellent manner in putting thoughts forward in a well supported way, and very worthwhile if you are open to understanding his message. It is easy to see why he is so often pointed to by so many. Chesterton wrote for his time and takes to task many of the leading \\"enlightened\\" thinkers. His personal honesty in his writing style is very apparent, and his explanations are very clear and well developed. I found the brief auto-biographical background he provided in the book is to be particularly helpful.

My copy is littered with underlined sentences and highlighted sections. Many of his insights are keen and life-changing. However, Orthodoxy is not an easy read in my opinion. As brilliant of a man Mr. Chesterton was, his lines of thought are sometimes difficult to trace. Throughout the book I found myself repeatedly asking, \\"Now what was he talking about...how did we arrive here...where is he going with this;\\" the overall journey is a wild ride. A rather large percentage of his references and illustrations are far too localized and restricted to GK's time and town - even though his lessons are timeless. I felt myself wishing I was reading his newspaper and conversing with his contemporaries in their cafes. This is evidenced by the amount of footnotes strung throughout in an attempt to clue in the reader. Overall, this book is a treasure."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"There seems to be a meaty paradox in almost every two or three sentences.

If you read his introductory comments on why he wrote the book, you should be able to see that the whole work focuses on how he stumbled unintentionally into seeing the beauty and reason of orthodoxy through the accumulation of a thousand little things that all pointed in the same direction: God. The book purposely models this, and frankly I find the joy of the book is how he expresses faith this way.I admittedly found it very confusing my first read, but each time I read it again more and more of it starts to connect. Give the book a second chance if you stumble at first Soon you'll start to see the pattern of thought in his \\"rambling\\" observations, an intentional metatphor for the divine pattern and purpose that escapes us in our everyday \\"rambling\\" lives."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"I read this book for my honors class as an alternative option for those of us who had already read Mere Christianity.

I strongly reccomend this book to anyone exploring the ideas of Christianity from within a Christian background."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"G.K. Chesterton came to his belief in Christianity through the &quot;back door&quot;, so to speak. He found the existing philosophies of the time illogical, formulated his own, and then found that what his own philosophy resembled most of all was Christianity. Christianity, to Chesterton, gives one much more freedom than liberalism.While this is an often entertaining read, it takes an alert mind to grasp all that Chesterton is saying in this book. This is one of those texts, like Lewis' &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;, that stands the test of time, and is worth having on one's shelf to peruse again and again for nuggets of wisdom."},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"G. K. Chesterton is quoted by many including C. S. Lewis and Ravi Zacharias. This is the book that is the source of many of the quotes. It provides the thinking of G.K. Chesterton as he transitioned from being an agnostic (or even atheist)to embracing christian orthodoxy. He got to that point from reading the atheist writers and their objections to christianity. He uses logic to prove that logic alone cannot solve many theological issues! If you were placed in an asylum for being crazy, how could you prove that you were sane?"},{"Title":"Orthodoxy,","review":"Not so much a step-by-step handbook, more of a progressive recounting of the intellectual road to Truth, G. K. Chestertons 'Orthodoxy' is a classic for those who love to hear the Truth in fleshed out terms. In short, I simply loved it and could see from the first few pages why this work is a classic must read.Much like C. S. Lewis (of whom I greatly admire), Chesterton is a wordsmith painting pictures, giving examples, drawing out the facts in real life form.From 'The Suicide of Thought\\"...It is idle to talk always of the alternative of reason and faith. Reason is itself a matter of faith. It is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all.From \\"The Flag of the World\\"...An imbecile habit has arisen in modern controversy of saying that such and such a creed can be held in one age but cannot be held in another. Some dogma, we are told, was credible in the twelfth century, but is not credible in the twentieth. You might as well say that a certain philosophy can be believed on Mondays, but cannot be believed on Tuesdays. You might as well say of a view of the cosmos that it was suitable to half-past three, but not suitable to half-past four. What a man can believe depends upon his philosophy, not upon the clock or the century.From \\"The Paradoxes of Christianity\\"...This is the thrilling romance of Orthodoxy. People have fallen into a foolish habit of speaking of orthodoxy as something heavy, humdrum, and safe. There never was anything so perilous or so exciting as orthodoxy. It was sanity: and to be sane is more dramatic than to be mad.I must limit the sections of this book that were my favorite otherwise I would include the entire book.What a reasoning thinker Chesterton was? What was my take this great book? In a sentence I would have to say, his point that the dreamer who looks at the paradoxes in life and accepts them attributing all as gifts of God is far greater than the intellectual who would have this grand creation categorized, sequenced and number before accepting the Truth.This is one book every christian should read.

It is essentially autobiographical and offers a set of thoughts and experiences that point toward Chesterton's realization that there is a God, that miracles do happen and that Jesus was God on earth. It is not a rigorous Apology based solely on logic and argumentation but rather, a collection of ideas that point toward Christianity and away from alternate views of reality.I found this particular printing of this book somewhat difficult to read possibly due to the the typeface or the line spacing.

Find it. Hoffman wasn't kidding, \\"The Poetry of Survival\\" is a truly amazing compilation of some of the greatest poets of the century (Celan, Herbert, Rozewicz) and many other fantastic Eastern/Central European and German poets who remain relatively unknown in the West (Vasko Popa, Ingeborg Bachmann, Anna Swir). This anthology concentrates mostly on Eastern Europe - several Polish poets especially - and also includes some German poets (Bachmann, Brecht) and Isrealis (Amichai). The theme is basically, \\"How have these poets chosen to respond to Adorno's declaration that to write poetry after the Holocaust is barbaric?\\" and the results are truly striking. Although necessarily dark, this is poetry at its most meaningful, a testament to the continuing importance of poetry as an art. The translations are first-rate (Felstiner's astounding translation of Celan's \\"Death Fugue\\" is included) and the selections used to represent each poet are particularly well-chosen (\\"Death Fugue,\\" Amichai's \\"Tourists\\" and Rozewicz's \\"She Looked at the Sun\\" are a few of the most exemplary poems that come to mind). There are 28 poets represented in this anthology; none are slackers and most, if not all, are world-class. This is a truly exciting book - for anyone interested in poetry let me repeat: find it. At all costs. \\"The Poetry of Survival\\" truly puts in perspective much of the frivolous nonsense that passes for poetry in the West today."},{"Title":"Black Identity and Black Protest in the Antebellum North","review":"This is strictly a structural review for the Kindle edition.

Pre-history and antiquity])","review":"Use Edward Thomas' History Of Buddhist Thought as a primer of scholarly information on the history and development of Buddhist teachings and thoughts: this originally appeared in 1951 but its thorough background on how Buddhist thinking evolved keeps it relevant to new audiences."},{"Title":"The history of Buddhist thought, ([The History of civilization. Pre-history and antiquity])","review":"This is my second review of an Edward J. Thomas (1869-1958) book, and I'll say again a few things about the man's background. The author of a number of Indological works, Thomas was a British librarian living in India chiefly remembered today for the present work and his biography of the Buddha. As will be apparent to anyone reading these books, Thomas was a brilliant and erudite man, widely read, with a formidable command of the source texts and languages (Pali certainly and, I believe, Sanksrit as well). That these two books are still cited in discussions of Buddhist intellectual history is a tribute to their having been, at least at the time of their authorship, cutting edge scholarship, not to mention still capable of yielding nuggets of insight and a wealth of information.HISTORY follows the standard format for surveys of Buddhist philosophy in India. Chapters one, two, six and seven sketch a lot of the pre-Buddhist material--Brahmanism, the Upanishads, yoga, etc. One interesting point Thomas makes, and which is confirmed by my other reading, is that \\"The original centre of brahmin culture was far from the cradle of Buddhism. ...[T]here are indications to show that the East, and Magadha especially, were long considered unfit for the habitation of brahmins.\\" In other words, the Buddha taught in a backwater, and this fact, coupled with other passages (87, 90-1), indicates pretty decisively that the central thesis of the Upanishads (the atman-Brahman equivalence) was unknown to the Buddha. This is important as it is often implied by Hindus that the Buddha was a Hindu and that he falls in line with the Upanishadic tradition (cf. Eknath Easwaran's Dhammapada translation, 26) --a hard theory to sustain if what Thomas is saying is true. (I believe it is.)Thomas is quite effective when discussing the history of ideas and when speculating about what may (or may not) be different strata of teaching (\\"primitive\\" vs. later, e.g.). Clearly, his knowledge of the sources was thorough and he had a discriminating intellect. However, one should not look to him for doctrinal or philosophical insights, as he tends to run into problems when discussing some of the more challenging teachings of early Buddhism.These are principally covered in chapters four, five, eight, nine and ten--\\"Early Doctrine,\\" \\"Causation,\\" \\"The Soul,\\" \\"Karma,\\" \\"Release and Nirvana.\\" Thomas' definition of atta (93) is really quite good, though he does not reflect much on what anatta means. (Though he does offer a good rebuttal to those who try to insert the notion of soul into Buddhist thought--101.) When tackling Dependent Arising and nirvana, he wades full into the scholarly debates of the day, and these sections can be quite interesting and vexing, all at the same time. Interesting because we are made privy to the early Western, academic speculations regarding this exotic animal called \\"Buddhist thought,\\" and vexing because so often the scholars sound like the proverbial blind men with the elephant. Consider on pages 77ff where Thomas reviews scholarly theorizing concerning dependent arising. Not only are many of the conclusions little better than shots in the dark (the chain is a \\"cosmic emanation,\\" the product of Sankhya influence, etc), we once again can see that book knowledge, decoupled from actual practice, is of little use in this arena. The discussion of nirvana (123ff and 130ff) is predictably sterile, sounding like a conference of food pundits sitting around a table with menus in hand, arguing about what the foods taste like, while never bothering to actually order a dish and find out. I inevitably have to scratch my head when reading this kind of material.Chapter eleven presents a solid discussion of the Buddha as he is viewed in the early texts, and is followed by a more strictly chronological discussion of developments in Abhidhamma (ch. 12), the conception of the Buddha (&agrave; la the early Mahayana--ch. 13), an in depth examination of the Lotus Sutra (ch. 14), the idea of the bodhisattva (chs. 15 & 16), and the Madhyamika and Yogacara schools (chs. 17 & 18). The last chapter, \\"Buddhism and Modern Thought,\\" is a less helpful piece tacked on almost as an afterthought that begins with a startlingly dubious assertion:\\"The spread of Buddhism into other countries does not properly form a part of the history of Buddhist thought, except in so far as the mingling of cultures may have produced new schools. Theoretically there was no development\\" (249).With this one statement the whole history of Ch'an (Zen), not to mention the Tantric schools of India and especially Tibet (the so-called Vajrayana) are dismissed, the specific reasons in the latter case made clear: \\"Tibetan Buddhism, except for some historical and grammatical works, has been little but a development of the less worthy elements introduced from India along with superstitions of its own\\" (249-50). The early scholarly contempt for all things Tantric is strongly in evidence, to say the least!Lastly, the scholarly state of affairs at the time of the book's writing is made abundantly clear when Thomas writes\\"Mahayana has never made any impression on the West either as religion or philosophy. Presented by the early investigators as a tissue of absurdities or niaiseries, it is still commonly looked upon as nihilism or subjectivism. Now it is beginning to be recognized as more than this, but a full exposition of its metaphysical theories still awaits the complete publication of its authoritative texts and commentaries\\" (256).My, how far we've come in sixty years!I hope these last tidbits won't scare off potential readers. Clearly, the book has its failings, but it can be a worthy addition to the reading list of those trying to shore up their history of Buddhism. Just be sure its not your only read in this category. Try to supplement it with others, such as Kalupahana's BUDDHIST PHILOSOPHY: AN HISTORICAL ANALYSIS, Paul Williams' BUDDHIST THOUGHT, and Warder's INDIAN BUDDHISM."},{"Title":"The history of Buddhist thought, ([The History of civilization.

It has a candid analysis of the political scene and the dominence by President Arap Moi's party. Corruption is discussed with Arnold pointing out that multinationals often pay such tribute to government officials to maintain the status quo to their advantage. Certainly, with the book being printed in London and Arnold not residing in Kenya, we get a more forthright viewpoint than one from a Nairobi newspaper or book.The economic analysis show Kenya to be fairly well off for a developed country, with good export-driven markets, especially for horticulture sold to Europe.Needless to say, the foreign policy was dominated by the Cold War, and with the Soviet Union angling for advantage with respect to Kenya and other non-aligned nations.

Outside the glass are deep green high reeds and a wide-open breath of bright yellow and passionate crimson flowers, which explode from the nest of bulging leaves and a tussle of gnarled branches below. They bend in a graceful way with the gentle valley breeze. The backdrop of mountains, rigid and distant, cast a flush of puissant comfort, as if a great blanket of protection spreads over the passive dale. It is a little past six o'clock in the evening; the day of tranquil scorching air has given way to cooler temperatures and a softer burn from the sun.

Beautiful illustrations"},{"Title":"Herodotus, (Bohn's classical library)","review":"This is a review of Michael A. Flower's and John Marincola's commentary on Book IX of Herodotus's Histories for the Cambridge green and yellow series. Book IX is the final book of Herodotus's Histories and contains, among other things, Herodotus's accounts of the Battles of Plataea and Mycale, the immediate aftermath of the Persians' defeat in and withdrawal from mainland Greece, and the Siege of Sestos. F&M; are particularly interested in showing how Book IX achieves closure for the Histories as a whole and how it prefigures the political-cultural landscape of the mid-late fifth century BC, when Herodotus was writing, so a reader interested in Herodotus's aspirations/agenda as a historian and author and how Herodotus's narrative anticipates later (particularly Athenian) historical developments will find this commentary particularly enlightening.This edition consists of a 50 page introduction, 50 pages of Greek text, about 215 pages of commentary, four brief appendices occupying 11 pages, a very comprehensive bibliography of almost 20 pages (current through 2002), and two indexes (one for Greek terms, and one for general topics). The authors provide enough grammatical and lexical help that a student in his or her third or fourth year of studying Greek should be able to read Book IX with little difficulty using the commentary, and the majority of the notes in fact are primarily designed to help with translation. However, the discussions of literary and historical issues are fairly complex and clearly pitched to an advanced audience, so this edition is probably not suitable for a student reading Greek prose for the first time (Amy Barbour's textbook \\"Selections from Herodotus\\" is a better option in this respect). Unlike many modern commentaries on the works of ancient historians, the treatment of historiographic problems is balanced quite well with discussions of the literary qualities of Herodotus's text. Delineating Herodotus's appropriation of Homeric language and ideology, for example, is accorded just as much importance as evaluating the historical accuracy of Herodotus's narrative. Readers who are interested in Herodotus from either a literary critical angle or from a historical angle will therefore both find useful material in this commentary.There are number of other features of this edition that are worthy of note. The introduction - in addition to containing the usual accounts of Herodotus's life and times, an overview of his style and techniques as an author/historian, a very brief reckoning of the manuscripts, and an analysis of the major themes, characters, and events of Book IX - also includes a concise guide to Herodotus's Ionic dialect, giving readers who are only familiar with Attic prose a handy aid for identifying and understanding Ionic forms. The four appendices provide Greek texts of and commentary on primary sources that complement the narrative of Book IX (i.e. Simonides' poem on Plataea, the putative dedication of the seer Teisamenus, and the so-called 'Oath of Plataea') as well as a list of the troops composing the Greek and Persian battle lines at Plataea.It is not possible in a short review to enumerate all the different questions and issues F&M; cover in their notes, but I will say that their commentary is one of the most wide-ranging, erudite, and thought-provoking that I have encountered in this or any other series of commentaries on ancient texts. It is one of the few commentaries on the market that attempts to address ALL aspects of a text in detail while still prioritizing providing grammatical help to the student-reader, and on the whole it succeeds remarkably well in doing so. Moreover, the commentary is composed in a very straight-forward and engaging style and is often quite entertaining. For example, as part of a note on Herodotus's account of the seer Hegesistratus, who had to escape a Spartan prison by mutilating his foot so that he could wrest it free from the chain that bound it, F&M; remark (pg.177) with perfect aplomb: \\"Two physicians have confirmed for us that Hegesistratus could have survived and not bled to death before reaching Tegea\\".In short, then, this commentary combines magisterial learning with judicious organization and presentation, and should definitely be read by anyone with a few years of Greek and a serious interest in Herodotus and Greek History."},{"Title":"Fire Engines","review":"It is probably not the fault of the author, as he has done good research into the topic. The problem came with the &quot;sidebars&quot; that were scattered throughout the book. If they were put at the end of chapters, rather than in the middle of text, it would be much smoother reading."},{"Title":"Fire Engines","review":"I think this is an attractive and colorful introduction to a fascinating field. There are detailed photos of early models (both period photos and restored vehicles) and modern engines. All the major manufacturers are covered, some are shown working at the scene of fires, others are at the fire station cleaned, polished and ready. I liked the basic layout of the book, the sidebars didn't really bother me."},{"Title":"General John Sedgwick, the story of a Union corps commander","review":"Mr. Winslow's scholarship in this diary of General John Sedgwick's day to day thoughts, words, and actions during the Civil War is second to none. As he points out, there is very little in print about this soldier, who was second in the hierarchy of command for Union forces, and who several times during the war was their acting commander. He was a West Pointer, extremely capable, and remarkably non-political in a time of enormous political intrigue. He was born and raised in Cornwall, Connecticut, one of the most attractive landscapes on Earth, and was on the verge of retiring there when the war broke out. No one would have criticized him for retiring, as he had distinguished himself in the Mexican Wars and had long planned a retirement. Much of what Mr. Winslow presents is derived from original documents, including war dispatches and General Sedgwick's letters to his sister. The dialog is very credible, and the descriptions of the action are both clear and thorough. Not surprisingly, since this is an accurate view of war, the descriptions of the inaction are thoroughly detailed, too. The boredom, discomforts and snafus are interwoven, just as they are in life. Mr. Winslow's editors were remiss, however, in the omission of maps, diagrams, and photos. As good as the descriptions are, there is no way the reader can visualize the action when we don't know where we are or why the terrain was material factor. And why only one photo, when only three or four more would give the reader a sense of the principal characters? This is an excellent book for Civil War buffs who are missing the thread provided by General Sedgwick's Sixth Corps, which was involved in most of the war's major engagements. I also recommend it to former students of Sedgwick Middle School, in West Hartford, CT, who might wonder for whom our school was named. No review would be complete without mentioning Sedgwick's last words before being shot dead at Spotsylvania, \\"They couldn't hit an elephant at this distance.\\""},{"Title":"General John Sedgwick, the story of a Union corps commander","review":"I see after reading this book why the troops called him \\"Uncle John\\".He seemed to have that charisma that would promote an intimacy between himself and his troops.Sedgwick had a long New England pedigree and when the Civil War broke out he was 49 and ready for retirement.But there was never a thought of a pension when the war broke out,Sedgwick right in the front of the volunteers.His reason for defense of the Union-a deep tradition of loyalty to the present government at the time and his family connections.Alot of New Englanders already had family and deep business investments in the south.Trying to separate at this point(1861) seemed an absurdity and rebellion.Sedgwick was short,stocky,rugged,highly competent, and he was noted for taking unnecessary risks in regard to his person by riding his horse too close to the front lines.This behavior would cost him his life at Spotsylvania and it was nothing short of a miracle that it didn't happen sooner.But \\"Uncle John\\" wouldn't have had it any other way.The phrase that describes him best is,\\"He would never ask a man to do something that he would be afraid to do himself\\",possibly carried to extreme.By the way Sedgwick kept to his business,\\"soldiering\\" and kept clear of politics but would speak out if he believed an issue needed adressed.The Union 6th Corps,which Sedgwick rose to the command of,was often used to plug holes in the Union lines during \\"hot contests\\". Sedwick was very flexible and accomodated this use of his troops,rather than protesting and stalling as other commanders would do in the same situation.The book focuses primarily on Sedgwicks' Civil War career and almost none on his early adventures out west before the war.There is a good chapter about the controversy between Sedgwick and Hooker at Chancellorsville where Hooker blamed Sedgwick for a lack of speed.All of Sedgwicks Civil War battles and his roles on them are covered in a scholarly yet interesting way.This is about the only bio you can presently get on \\"Uncle John\\"."},{"Title":"No End in Sight: My Life as a Blind Iditarod Racer","review":"I don't know much about dog racing, but this story had me mildly interested all the way through, and I learned a lot, not only about the sport, but about blind people and how one girl's courage catapulted her into a 500 mile, grueling endurance race across the wildest parts of a wild countryside. Rachel speaks candidly about how, when she was young, she wanted to be part of the clique of \\"popular girls\\" who ruled the roost at school, and how these uncaring girls mocked her and humiliated her for even trying.She didn't like being treated as some sort of second class and in a way, you can see the whole of her subsequent career as a sort of insolent salute to the girls who made her life hell. Her family was supportive, up to a point. But the challenge of the Iditarod Trail frightens even the most dedicated guides. And some unimaginative, if concerned, fellow sledders told her she was crazy, being blind to attempt such a physical feat. For even strong men with both eyes sometimes went mad along the trail. The ITC wasn't helpful, and she had to appeal to them in person. What would she do if she had to go to the bathroom, for example? Rachel answers these questions with the frank good humor for which she has been known all over the world of sled racing. One indication of the deeper pain involved is that, usually, Rachel cries sometime during a race. But finally she's at a point where she's having fun and it shows not only in her work, but in the pages of this delightful book. My brother who gave me NO END IN SIGHT knows of my love for the books of David Sedaris, and he thought that Rachel might be some relation! Well, there's no direct blood connection (and her name is \\"Sedoris\\") but she is like David Sedaris in being able to find the humanity and humor even in the most awful of straits.Yes, it's \\"heavy sledding\\" at times, especially if like me you're a newbie with next to no knowledge of anything she's talking about and anything she's been through. But, there's a helpful glossary at the back of the book so all you non-mushers can decipher the somewhat specialized lingo. You'll be crying out \\"Haw!\\" and \\"Hike!\\" like seasoned trailhounds. Ever wonder what kind of personality you would have as a canine? Are you the wheel dog type or the swing dog, a team dog or a lead? Check out NO END IN SIGHT."},{"Title":"No End in Sight: My Life as a Blind Iditarod Racer","review":"Rachel Scdoris was my spark to become a fan of the Iditarod sled dog race.

It could be inspirational to young people and a motivator for those with some sort of impairment.

The Installation chapter walks the user through the installation process, It tells the user what to do to insure a great installation without losing anything. The rest of the book explains in detail the features of this new operating system. How to use them without the stress which seems to accompany any upgrade.

Why? Unlike similar books, Rubin and Brasco don't claim that following their protocols will cure you. They're somewhat humble and admit that what works for one person may not work for another. Their claims are often backed up by research. They don't speak in absolutes. And, they make sense and provide what seems to be rational, well reasoned, and measured advice.I read this book to help cure an ulcer and gastritis (as well as address unrelated IBD) that not even antibiotics and acid blockers seemed to help. I didn't follow the protocol they suggested, but I did eat nothing but Brasco broth for 11 days and the endoscopy that followed showed that the ulcer had healed and remaining inflammation was mild at worst.Aside from protocols to address various digestive ailments, this book also provides excellent and specific information on foods, diets, and supplements. I've read it twice and continue to use it as a reference when considering a new food or supplement.My only gripe is that, in my opinion, they recommend taking too many supplements at once. For someone with inflammation or compromised digestion, taking a gazillion pills of concentrated anything is going to be hard on the system. I think it's best to systematically add supplements to your regimen so you can gauge the impact of each. The problem is...If you take a bunch of different supplements at once and it causes some type of flare, you won't know which supplement caused the problem. You'll have to stop them all then beg for a refund. Conversely, if the protocol helps, you won't know if all the supplements are helping synergistically or whether some are useless to you and a waste of money. So my suggestion is... start on a low dosage of one key supplement and add new ones one-by-one.Regardless, I believe the information contained in this book can help anyone with digestive problems (if the recommendations are utilized in a Slow, Systematic, and RESPONSIBLE way). I recommend it to anyone who wants alternatives to the not so effective / side effect inducing drugs prescribed for IBD."},{"Title":"Restoring Your Digestive Health: How the Guts and Glory Program Can Transfom Your Life","review":"My 10 yr son was diagnosed with Crohn's disease last year and was very sick.

However there is some wonderful information on suppliments/daily diet for healthy people as well.I do not accept the excuse that these items are too difficult to find, therefore it is not useful information. The Standard American Diet (SAD) is absolutely terrible and it is not surprising that our supermarkets carry mostly nutrient-poor foods. Obviously you are not going to find some of these healthful suppliments next to the Twinkies, so this puts the owness on the consumer to look around and hunt down these items for the sake of your own good health. Prices are not high if you are smart about your purchases and frankly no cost is too high for good health. Do your homework and reap the benefits. You'll be surprised how many suppliers you will find in your area, no matter how small the city.There is a bit of subjective data in this book. For example a description of the Vegetarian diet as consisting of only starches and carbs and completely lacking in B12 and other \\"meat only\\" vitamins is just not true and has been shown as such in many studies as recent as January 2004. That being said, there is enough good data here to really educate someone not familiar with nutrition. If you take each section with a grain of salt, and accept that some suppliments or dietary changes may not work for you, I think you can really gain a lot from this book."},{"Title":"Restoring Your Digestive Health: How the Guts and Glory Program Can Transfom Your Life","review":"I have struggled with diarrhea from Ulcerative Colitis for the past year or so.

But, I thought of Rubin's diet as more of a makeover of the Gottschall's Specific Carbohydrate Diet.Rubin, who suffered with Crohn's disease, tells his personal story of overcoming his illness through diet. The author, at one point, was communicating with Elaine Gottschall (who wrote \\"Breaking the Vicious Cycle\\" - - the SCD bible). Rubin achieved some success on the diet, but says that it ultimately didn't work for him. He then bashes Gottschall's diet.Hypocritically, Rubin and his co-author later endorse the SCD on page 151 in the chapter \\"A Plethora of Problematic Programs\\".\\"We endorse the SCD,\\" he says. \\"It has helped thousands. Elaine Gottschall was one of the first to popularize the concept that the modern diet with its preponderance of nonfermented grains, dairy products, and sugar has shifted the balance of the native human microflora. the shift of bacterial population in susceptible individuals may be the root cause of minor and serious intestinal disorders.\\"He continues, \\"The coauthors of this book have achieved personal and clinical success with the SCD. Nevertheless the diet has weak points that can be improved upon.\\" Rubin says that the diet has too many carbohydrates, is high in fat intake and not enough organic foods and/or supplements. He substitutes the original SCD Chicken soup recipe listed in BTVC with his own recipe. Instead of two to seven days(for the initial diet)..he calls for two weeks, fortified with supplements, some which contain disaccharides and polysaccharides (complex sugars) which are SCD-illegal (which calls for monosaccharides like honey if your intestines are damaged).Rubin's initial diet also uses antifungals, supplements and structured water. Goats milk is used instead of cow's milk for the yogurt.Although Rubin has valid criticisms of Gottschall's diet, but it's probably best for newbies to read Gottschall's BTVC book before diving into Rubin's book, to get the science behind the SCD diet. Highly recommends Gottschall's book first, then read Rubin to get some perspective on both diets."},{"Title":"Restoring Your Digestive Health: How the Guts and Glory Program Can Transfom Your Life","review":"I've suffered from chronic fatigue for 10 years. I've had some treatments along the way that have helped, but lately I've been deteriorating and feeling hopeless as it gets worse and worse and life was becoming unmanageable. Although this book doesn't specifically speak to healing chronic fatigue, there are some references to food intolerances & allergies, which have seemed to be one of the core issues causing my fatigue. I'm less than 2 months into the program, but I've seen significant and consistent improvement already. I'm so optimistic that I've finally found the overall solution that will completely restore me to health. Traditional medicine has had nothing for me (every blood test known to science says I'm the picture of health for a 49 yr old male), and some alternative treatments have provided some temporary help at times, but nothing long-term. Although it may be several months before I know for sure if this is my long-term solution, I wanted to recommend this book before I forget. The program is not hard to follow, especially if you cheat a little like I did and hire a relative to cook the amazing soup that is at the core of the nutritional program."},{"Title":"Restoring Your Digestive Health: How the Guts and Glory Program Can Transfom Your Life","review":"What an amazing book.

The doctors gave us very little information about diet when we left the hospital so we are doing our own investigating. Although we are not using only diet to reach remission, this book is extremely helpful in finding foods that will help heal the stomach and intestines. We don't do everything the book is suggesting but are trying as much as we can afford and are comfortable with. I like that the book is broken down by intestinal problems with specific recommendations for each. At the end of the book is a list of numbers and addresses where you can find the items that are recommended. I have found most of the foods in my area, but did have to do a lot of looking around. Found a polish deli for the unpasturized kefir! There are only a few recipes in the book but there is a website given to get more recipes.

I've been battling it for 10 years and right now I'm in a tougher time with it. I got this book, and though I haven't tried the full program, though I am implementing some things.As I said, some things required in your healing are $$, but I think I can find ways around some of that. If you want to spend your money at the doctor for a pill, you would, so I suppose spending it on healing foods is just as relevant.Restoring Your Digestive Health takes you on a journey in which you learn a lot about the workings - or not workings - of your digestive tract. There are lots of \\"fun facts to know and tell\\", for instance, did you know the average adult stomach can hold up to a gallon of food? WOW.There are some things in the Guts and Glory Program that seem a little weird - like drinking clay. This can be found in pill form. There's a really good recipe for Brasco Broth, a very good for you, SLOW cooked chicken soup. That has been very healing for me in itself.If you have a problem with your digestion, and you're at your wit's end, or don't want to get there, I would pick up this book and at the very least read it.

Like Patient Heal Thyself, it has detailed protocols for each health issue--colitis, crohn's, etc. But his explanation on the three phases of the diet are much clearer and in more detail. His retelling of his own story is in more detail as well, though much of the information is crossover from book to book. The recipes are the same as PHT, so they are not plentiful, but helpful for making the broth. He gives a detailed list of his products as well as other products that you can use. He also spends much time discussing the reason behind his protocols, as well as which supplements/healing aids he does not feel are healthy or beneficial. There are a few extra products he mentions here that were not in PHT. One of those is liquid bentonite clay--really important in my opinion. Reading it is not as friendly to the eye as the PTH book, so I often use the \\"good\\" \\"not-so bad\\" \\"neutral\\" and \\"ugly\\" food list in PTH because they are in a more graphic form, and much easier to quickly read and reference. This book, though more thorough, was on much cheaper paper, smaller font, and does not have as good of headings so I can't readily find what I'm looking for. If I could only have one of the books, however, then this would be my choice. I still wish Rubin/Brasco had been a bit less nebulous with his/their terms. For instance, \\"if you're feeling significantly better, than move on. . .\\" Well, when you have just come out of the hospital after losing 50 pounds, that has a truly different meaning than someone who has been having a tummy ache a bit. We have seen good improvement following his protocols exactly, but we were about at the same spot J.Rubin was at his worst, so we have a long way to go, so I can't speak to the healing aspect completely. After follwoing the program for 1 1/2 months we have chosen also to adopt some recipes from the SCD diet which allows a little more variety."},{"Title":"Restoring Your Digestive Health: How the Guts and Glory Program Can Transfom Your Life","review":"Like Jordan Rubin, I had severe ulcerative colitis. When my symptoms stopped responding to medication, I began my own year-long search for a surgery-free cure which included eating nothing but Brasco Broth and supplements, as required in this book, for 2 weeks straight. (Use Amazon's \\"Look Inside\\" to see the recipe for the soup on p.328.) Sadly, the colitis stayed, and I continued to lose weight. Finally, after losing 35 pounds and getting to the point where blood loss had me perilously close to heart attack, I gladly opted for a colectomy. Best. Decision. Ever.So why only 2 stars?* Too much advice. Following the instructions in this book is maddening and tiring and, if one purchases the supplements, expensive. That goes double for folks who are extremely ill. The authors would have done well to leave out items that don't have highly proven efficacy.* Too little evidence. Though studies are offered as piecemeal evidence for parts of the authors' suggestions, only anecdotes are given as proof that the suggestions are curative.* Too much self-interest. Jordan Rubin's authority as a health expert is highly suspect, and there is a serious conflict of interest in this (and his other books) because of the claim that the diets proposed will not be as effective without purchasing products from the company Rubin founded. Of course, ad hominem attacks on the book aren't sufficient to claim that it's bad information, but they do put the reader in the uncomfortable position of having to re-research all of the claims made in Rubin's name."},{"Title":"Restoring Your Digestive Health: How the Guts and Glory Program Can Transfom Your Life","review":"This is a good book if you have digestive issues.

I'm disappointed there isn't more about Joseph Brasco's experience as a GI doc looking at people's colons--surely that gives one a powerful view of what is happening. The fact that the authors own a supplement company called Garden of Life do create real problems, not only for the credibility, but subtle contridictory advice.

If you think soy is the new health food, think again. Soy is does not only contain a lot of phytic acid which is not beneficial to you but most of the soy products out there are now genetically modified! The government has subsidized so much soy I think that is why they are pimping it so badly in all the food markets. They have to make that money you know.Genetically modified soy (Which is where we are getting most of our soy) is made up of soy and that they modified the DNA of and crossed it with the genes of bacteria and viruses to make it more resistant to bugs! If the bugs won't even eat it, why should humans consume it? I'm just telling you the facts about soy. So a little bit of Miso probably wouldn't hurt you but for the most part eat a healthy diet and avoid soy products.I for instance have a life-threatening food allergy to soy and as I read more about what they are doing to make this fragile soy plant more resistant and \\"strong\\" I start to get scared because it is almost like eating a mutated monster that scientists concocted. No wonder soy is in the top five food allergens now according to my allergist's office.We all need to start eating the way God intended for us to eat like in the Bible!

It started after taking large amounts of antibiotics to heal from pneumonia.Feeling very bad as most IBS sufferers, I tried several diets, went to a lot of GI doctors and even tried acupuncture, reflexology, ... you name it.I took antidepressants for a while to help me with my mood since I felt so bad in times that I didn't even want to work or even get out of home. I lost 40 pounds so far.Since January 2005, I read these books (I put a personal rating to each one, related to how much it helped me with my IBS, in parenthesis from 1 to 5, being 5 the best score):Breaking the Vicious Cycle - Elaine Gotschall (3)Eating Right for a bad Gut - James Scala (2)Total health Program - Joseph Mercola (3)Metabolic Type Dieting - William Linz Wolcott, Trish Fahey (1)I recently read \\"Restoring Your Digestive Health\\" (5)To the point:Besides the fact that many, if not everyone, of the people who write this kind of books look for some sort of monetary earnings (and many do that just for the money), there always stays the fact about whether the material presented has a real value or not. In other words, do the programs and recommendations in this book really work?For me they did. In fact it is my personal opinion that this book encloses many of the concepts that I've been studying for the past year. It gives you a brief explanation about many of them. In that respect at least, I wished I had bought this book before the other ones, since in the end it is like a little reference of them. Bad luck.Of course I don't agree with many things, for instance the \\"structured water\\" suplement, since based on other sources I read, it is very controversial an in many aspects without scientific background, although the authors may recommend it based on their clinical experience rather than anything else. More probably I think, they are trying to encourage people to buy their supplements (who can blame them).So back to the main point here, maybe the authors are willing that the readers go out and buy some of their supplements, but the issue here is whether the Guts and Glory program works. It will be fair to mention that the authors never tell you not to have any conventional drugs nor they force you to have any supplements. They even give you a \\"Low Budget\\" alternative where you'll never even buy a supplement, although they argue it will take you longer to heal. I think the authors are more objective than the more radical approaches of the other books I read.And of course, MOST importantly, I've been in the Guts and Glory program for 4 weeks and I feel BETTER than years!!!!. I know it's only my word, but I'm being honest here. I'm talking the Brasco Broth everyday, and I'm not even talking any extra supplement beside Chlorella, which I've been taking for 5 months now.If it's worth something, this is the only review I've written so far about any book that I read. This is because I'm encouraging you to at least give it a try. If you are an IBS slave like I've been the last years, it could help you a lot.So I don't care if the idea was to make me buy more supplements, in the end I'm not buying them anyway, but I DO feel better. I make my own goat yogurt (very cheap) and my own Sauerkraut (even cheaper). Maybe the only supplements I take, besides Chlorella, are the digestive enzymes, but I've been taking them for over a year now.Conclusion: Even if a partial intention of the book is to make you buy more supplements (which I think it is so) in the end I think that the program works simply because it is the only thing in years which has made me feel better.If anyone wishes to contact me (for legitimate reasons) you can freely do it at gaspar2428@yahoo.es"},{"Title":"Restoring Your Digestive Health: How the Guts and Glory Program Can Transfom Your Life","review":"In 1991, at age 33, I was diagnosed by a Board-Certified Gastroenterologist as having severe Crohns/Colitis, which affected my entire large intestine and the beginning of my small intestine. At 5'9\\" I weighed 103 lbs. Without going into great detail, upon colonoscopy, this same Board-Certified Gastroenterologist said that mine was one of the worst cases he had seen. My diet, which had been extensive throughout my entire lifetime, was now reduced to four foods. Not four food GROUPS, but four actual foods. Anything else that I ate made me hemorrhage. Unfortunately, I was put on a myriad of pharmaceuticals, including Prednisone, which I stayed on for 13 continual years. My disease was hardly managed in this way, but I still lived as best as I was allowed by my affliction. This \\"life\\" included absolute necessity of staying home because of my need for the continual use of a restroom. In that 13 year timeframe, I unsuccessfully consulted and visited with multiple MD's, and alternative care practitioners from several countries. I tried a multitude of ways to stop my illness, all to no avail, and some actually made me worse.In 2004, I heard about Jordin Rubin, read his literature, and almost passed up on my opportunity to try his program because I was so discouraged that I thought that this, too, would not work for my situation, as nothing up until that time had. I read both _Patient Heal Thyself_ and then went on to read _Restoring Your Digestive Health_. I then made the decision to try his method of healing. As any critically ill patient would do, I followed his regimen to the utmost degree, taking pains to make absolutely certain that I followed absolutely every step he issued in the healing process.Amazingly and miraculously, within three weeks time, my body started to heal. Only someone who has been through the devastation of this disease can even begin to understand what an epiphany transpired for me as I was now able to eat foods once again that I had not been able to eat in the previous 13 years. Also, the constant day-to-day pain and 30+ painful daily bowel movements I had suffered from for 13 consecutive years had now ceased. My body was healing and has continued to do so to the point where I now suffer absolutely NO symptoms of the severe Crohns/Colitis I was diagnosed as having for the 13 years I lost in my life.I literally owe my life to Jordin Rubin. I heartfully encourage ANYONE who suffers from Crohns/Colitis or any of the lesser digestive ills to please, obtain a copy of this book because it will not only change your life and heal your body, but it will give you back your very existence.KarenBuffalo, NY"},{"Title":"Restoring Your Digestive Health: How the Guts and Glory Program Can Transfom Your Life","review":"I had visited my parents during a snow storm and had to eat what they ate, so it was a much simpler diet than the usual coca cola and garbage I usually ate.

In a very detailed and fairly simple, easy-to-understand style, the authors, a naturopathic doctor who was an ex-patient and a Board-Certified Gastroenterologist, explain the reasons for poor digestion and the resultant problems.The book deals with a variety of GI problems such as IBS, Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Dyspepsia, Candidiasis etc., and the role of intestinal flora in optimal maintenance of health. The authors offer a number of useful suggestions and very specific dietary protocols for each problem.The experience of Jordan S. Rubin who was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease - a very serious 'incurable' disease and who tried a number of doctors and treatments adds credibility to the book. The critical role played by various foods in maintenace of intestinal flora, i.e. the various bacteria which help in optimal food digestion and absorption is brought out well. The authors explain how HSOs (Homeostatic Soil Organsims) play a major role in improving and nurturing the intestinal environment. The treatment regimen given in the book is based mostly on what worked for Rubin, modified over years by the combined wisdom of Rubin and Brasco who claim to have helped thousands of sufferers over the past few years.The book is specifically aimed at the US and Canadian readers, but the general principles are applicable to all. Thus for understanding the types and causes of various stomach ailments, this book will be found useful for all English speaking readers. I found it very interesting and useful to understand the general principles of good GI health.The book would have better value if suitable illustrations accompanied the detailed explanations about the role of various organs in Alimentary Canal or GI tract as it is called. The dietary program given will not be appropriate to people with different religious beliefs. Thus all non-vegetarians will not be able to accept pork or beef etc. And the program is certainly not suitable for vegetarians, though some of the insights will help lacto-vegetarians too.The opinions expressed by the authors about the other testing and treatment options may not be acceptable to all readers, esp. those who benefited from them in earlier instances. The opinions do come across as rather subjective and self-serving at places. In my opinion, that chapter could have been written better by the authors.The book would also have benefited from better editing and proof-reading. Chapter 10, 'Protocols' could have been shorter since mostly same matter is repeated under each condition. Alternatively, that chapter could have been bound in tear-off sheet style, so that sufferers can tear out specific sections for day-to-day reference or may be paste to their refrigerator / kitchen cabinet. Typographic errors and style errors are present, which however, do not prevent our understanding and appreciation of the subject.These minor shortcomings not withstanding, I strongly recommend this book to those who need to better understand the Digestive Disorders in themselves or their relatives and friends etc. A good buy."},{"Title":"Restoring Your Digestive Health: How the Guts and Glory Program Can Transfom Your Life","review":"Great book on digestiv health. The book does an excellent job of explainng &quot;what to do&quot; to improve your digestive health, and even explains &quot;why&quot;. The book claims that this alone will &quot;transform you life&quot;. The best that can be hoped for here is short-lived temporary change. What's required to really make the excellent information contained in this book work for you is to make the changes that are required for real life change, permanent, automatic habits. Changing habits is the key to changing your lifestyle. Otherwis, the knowledge gained in this book is short-lived and will not cause &quot;life change&quot; as the books claims. A clinical dietitian friend of mine gave me an amazing book called The Power of Habit by Jack D. Hodge which explains why so called life changes are short lived unless habits are changed. Utilizing the power of habit can help make healthy eating, permanent and automatic habits. With this &quot;guts and glory program&quot; and the book The Power of Habit, you will have the &quot;What to do&quot; along with &quot;How to consistently do it&quot; - All the tools needed to create real life change. I recommend both books."},{"Title":"Restoring Your Digestive Health: How the Guts and Glory Program Can Transfom Your Life","review":"I suffered with Crohns disease for several years and went from weighing 130lbs down to 97lbs and looking like a concentration camp survivor. Then I had surgery (1/3 of my intestines removed) and got better for about a year and then it came back. So I suffered for another few years.Eventually, I discovered just about the same thing Jordan Rubin did and I have been almost perfect for the last 15 years with only an occasional twinge. If I wrote a book on Crohnes it would sound almost exactly like this one. The only difference would be that I took Flagyl to kill off the bad bacteria living in my gut before taking the probiotics. Once I reestablished the healthy flora things were 1000% better. So I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"Restoring Your Digestive Health: How the Guts and Glory Program Can Transfom Your Life","review":"I have noted that several reviewers had issues with the author but didn't actually review the book. My wife has IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and other gastrointestinal problems. She developed the problems after going through gastric bypass surgery several years ago. She has seen several doctors, but it wasn't until my daughter (who works at a health food store - The Vitamin Shoppe) suggested that we read this book and follow the guidelines set in it, that is when things changed.The book outlines quite well how the digestive system works and sets out to give you a really good example of someone with serious intestinal problems (the author) went about dealing with them.I think that the author goes a bit overboard with a lot of his claims. Let me try to explain it this way. You have a headache and you decide to take an aspirin with a glass of water. The headache goes away, so you assume that the aspirin made the headache go away. But did it? A lot of headaches are caused by dehydration, so maybe the glass of water is what made it go away. A lot of other headaches are caused by stress. So maybe the THOUGHT that you did something about it and that the drug would help you is what made you relax and that cured your headache.This book points out what any common sense book on health would tell you. Stay away from sugar like the plague, exercise, etc. He makes other suggestions that in our experience we simply have not needed. My wife has not had to resort to the broth or soil probiotics mentioned in the book. She stays away from ALL bread (even the sourdough) suggested in the book. We no longer eat pasta and/or refined sugar. We still eat rice (just long grain or wild rice). These changes (and the inclusion of lots of yogurt) have \\"cured\\" my wife. Almost all of her symptoms are gone and she feels better than she has in years.I mentioned some of the things he states as outlandish. For instance, I am an engineer by trade and I know how microwaves work. Microwaves DO NOT break down water as he claims. He might know quite a bit about food, but he knows little about microwaves. The same goes with the electromagnetic stuff he is talking about. I think that is a bunch of nonsense.However, what I cannot deny is that after reading this book and changing our diets; my wife, son, and I feel so much better. That accounts for something. Is it the water, the aspirin, or the idea that it works the underlying factor? Frankly I don't care - the fact that it works is good enough for me. We use common sense. As I mentioned my wife still cannot eat bread or any milk (even goat's milk). So we don't keep trying, we just learn to keep that stuff away from her and make sure she gets her vitamins and other nutrients from other foods.To make things easier on all of us I bought a large white board that you can mark up with markers. We put on there the foods that were good to eat, those to completely stay away from, and those that we could have in a limited way. It is displayed in the dining room and THAT has helped tremendously with keeping focused on what we eat.I do recommend the book and hope it helps you like it has helped us."},{"Title":"Restoring Your Digestive Health: How the Guts and Glory Program Can Transfom Your Life","review":"After many tests, my husband and I were both diagnosed with IBS. We tried many treatments, both traditional and holistic, and several diets. For over 2 years we barely \\"managed\\" our symptoms with IBS-friendly cookbooks. I didn't want to manage IBS--I wanted to be free from it. Then, I read this book by Rubin and Brasco and alsoBreaking the Vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health Through Diet, by Elaine Gottschall. Some reviewers have mentioned the quack reports on the web about Rubin. I read them also, but only after I had picked up this book at the local health food store. I don't really care about where Rubin got his degree if his plan works. I can tell you this: the doctor who co-authored the book with him helped us more than all of the many other internists, gastroenterologists, and infectious disease doctors we saw over the months and years of our illness.One of the criticisms on Amazon reviews is that the book pushes Garden of Life products. The products are indeed listed in the book, but the authors give many alternatives from other companies and even say that you don't have to necessarily use supplements. I had already used Garden of Life products in the past and liked them very much, so this wasn't an issue for me. We did not use all of the recommended supplements as it can get really expensive. We took the enzymes and the probiotics and found them very helpful. We followed the diet portion of the plan faithfully for 4-6 months. It was not easy, and you can't cheat. We got so tired of eating the same thing for days. But, we were very ill and could not even go to work some days. We could not eat out in restaurants and travel was difficult. For us, it was worth the effort. Now we can eat what we want. My \\"wants\\" have changed as a result of this illness, though. I am more aware of the effects of food on the body and happily maintain a very healthy diet with occasional splurges.I recommendHealing Foods: Cooking for Celiacs, Colitis, Crohn's and IBSand Prasad'sRecipes for the Specific Carbohydrate Diet: The Grain-Free, Lactose-Free, Sugar-Free Solution to IBD, Celiac Disease, Autism, Cystic Fibrosis, and Other Health Conditions (Healthy Living Cookbooks)for supporting recipes which follow the plan. I made the 30 hour yogurt from raw milk purchased at a local goat farm with this yogurt maker:Tribest Yolife Yogurt Maker - YL-210The diet calls for a lot of this yogurt with extra fermentation to help restore the proper balance in your gut. (Grocery store yogurt is only fermented a few hours.) With this product, you can make yogurt in quart jars rather than tiny cups.I highly recommend this book to people who are willing to do whatever it takes to get well. If you are the type of person looking for a pill or a shot to make it all go away, this might not work for you. But if you have willpower and believe that diet really can make a big difference in healing your digestive system, give this a try for at least 4 months. I'm glad we did!"},{"Title":"Restoring Your Digestive Health: How the Guts and Glory Program Can Transfom Your Life","review":"I originally read this book a few years ago and I felt it did a great job in educating the reader about appropriate ways to restore and maintain optimal digestive health.

The writer, a Master Gardener based in Seattle, sets out to help her readers to \\"find space where you think there is none and help you decide what to do with it\\".The book has seven chapters. The first is a general introduction to the topic, looking at issues such as soil, watering, air quality and gardening on a slope (this was really useful for me). The other six each look at one area of the garden, such as the side garden, the front garden, and balconies. At the back of the book there are lists of trees, shrubs, perennials etc that should do well in most small Northwest gardens. The book is nicely illustrated with photographs by Jacqueline Koch.I had the feeling that the writer has truly experienced the pleasures and problems of a small garden in the Pacific Northwest. She is knowledgeable, articulate and enthusiastic about the topic, giving fairly comprehensive information in a limited space. She doesn't shy away from awkward topics such as what to do about gaps in hedges.This is a good, honest, value-for-money book for the Northwest gardener."},{"Title":"Big Ideas for Northwest Small Gardens","review":"Love the book!

This cookbook reveals the mystery behind these lovely memories. Some area grocery stores still make these goodies and sell them under the Roselyn name, but you can make these in your own kitchen with this book. They even show illustrations to make the pastries look like you just took them out of the familar pink Roselyn box. Even though it was $30, it was money well spent if you like the goodies and enjoy old pictures of times gone by. Try ebay if you want to get a hold of these hard-to-find cookbooks."},{"Title":"Roselyn Cookbook","review":"Oh, if only I could give a negative stars review of this cookbook.I have to wonder if the two reviewers who gave this cookbook five stars actually tried to make anything using the recipes. They never mention that important fact in their reviews, so I assume the answer is no. There's a huge difference between the concept of this cookbook and the execution. The concept is a terrific one - Roselyn Bakery was THE Indianapolis-area bakery for more than 50 years. Since they closed in 1999, I'm sure many Hoosiers would love to be able to duplicate their favorite recipes at home.But the execution of this terrific idea is abysmal. I tried to make two recipes in this book, and the results of both efforts were complete disasters. I am a very competent cook and have literally never had problems like these with any other recipes or cookbooks. Clearly, there is something very, very wrong with the recipes in this cookbook.The first recipe I tried was for rum cake. The recipe called for 16 egg yolks. That's right...16 egg yolks for ONE rum cake. That seemed like a lot to me, but I did know that rum cake was dense and heavy and used more than the usual number of eggs. So I made the cake, following the recipe meticulously. Result: disaster. It wasn't a cake, it was a pudding that never quite set. I had to throw it out.Okay, fine. I wasn't going to let one setback stop me, though I was a bit deflated and annoyed. So this morning I made another cake: orange coconut. First, there wasn't NEARLY enough batter for two 8-inch layers. When I filled the pans, the batter barely covered the bottoms of both pans. With a sinking feeling, I put the pans in the oven. The cakes did not rise. Not even a little bit. Additionally, the tops of the cakes look strange, mottled and...well, unlike any cake I've ever baked before.There is not a thing wrong with my ingredients, which I have used and am using to make other dishes without problems. I am not making mistakes in reading the recipes. This cookbook is 0 for 2 in terms of my being able to make a recognizable food item following its recipes. I won't be trying a third time.Take my advice and RUN, don't walk, AWAY from this cookbook...especially now that it's so ridiculously overpriced due to its being out of print. What's the point of a cookbook with recipes that are unworkable?"},{"Title":"Roselyn Cookbook","review":"My adult son and I share this cookbook. We both have had great success with the recipes we have tried. A regular we make is the public favorites Sweetheart Coffee Cake and Alligator Coffee Cake. They turn out beautiful and tasty every time. And the Mexican Wedding Cakes are to die for. I made the rum cake for Christmas when I first got the cookbook years ago, and it turned out fine. I wonder if Lulu forgot to turn on her oven. I am searching for another cookbook because my son lives out on his own, and neither one of us want to give up custody of 'The Book' to the other when one of us needs it.

The introduction and first two chapters provide an incredibly lucid and concise introduction to Indian music theory for Western audiences. Most other descriptions of Indian classical music that I have read that were written by Indians are virtually undecipherable for non-Indian readers. Most other texts overwhelm the reader with statements like \\"Ragam is the outcome of factors of the avohana and avarohana.\\" Swami Rama actually makes these terms clear, and presents them in a way that makes perfect sense. Reading these chapters has filled in many gaps in my own knowledge of Indian music theory that have persisted despite 3 years of formal study. I wish I had begun my studies with this book- -then I wouldn't have spent so much time lost in confusion.The remainder of the book consists of 30 alankars (exercises), followed by 10 classical raags and 12 classical taals (rhythms) in musical notation. The musical notation is presented \\"bilingually\\", that is, first in sa-ri-ga-ma notation in Western script, and then in Hindi script. The raags and taals are all from the Northern Indian tradition, but much of the theory itself and terminology applies to Carnatic music as well. The book also includes a glossary to help the user get a handle on the many terms that are used to describe facets of Indian music theory. A fresh beginner would probably need to work closely with a teacher in order to put the theory contained in this book into practice; indeed, this is what Swami Rama recommends. But a student who already knows the basics of Indian music may be able to progress independently with this book."},{"Title":"The Missionary Position: The First Delphi, South Dakota Mystery","review":"If you simply want to read all of the Tory Bauer mysteries and are not a serious collector, read the readily available \\"Funeral Food\\" which is the same story, renamed and published for mass market by Avon."},{"Title":"The Missionary Position: The First Delphi, South Dakota Mystery","review":"The Missionary Position is smarter and funnier then Funeral Food.

The two books complement each other well.The book was very good and organized well. The problem was the editing. I found typos and he has a tendency to repeat short phrases. However, these are minor flaws and the topics he covers helped explain how the KJV Bible fit into its cultural milieu. McGrath shows how the translators goals in translation and how they choose to translate Hebrew idioms introduced commons saying in our own language. McGrath pointed out the language of the KJV was archaic even in its own day and Mcgrath explains why. McGrath also indicated how the KJV influenced American English. Another interesting point, I heard it before, but McGrath emphasizes it, the translators read the translation aloud before they gave it final approval. The KJV was always meant to be read aloud from the pulpit. I think it really shows. Other translations are far more accurate and reads more easily, but no translation surpasses the beauty of the KJV read aloud. The book was almost too short. I wanted McGrath to delve more into the different topics."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"Alister McGrath's \\"In the Beginning\\" is a magisterial account of the King James Bible's fascinating story. In it, a wealth of background information will be found which ultimately and thoroughly lays the foundation for his treatment of the Bible's formation, completion, and rise to triumph. But this work is certainly not a one-sided approach, merely telling the story of a bible. McGrath's detailed coverage of the religious, political, and economical factors, from Gutenberg's press to the Colonization of America, sheds enormous light upon how the King James Bible actually \\"changed a nation, a language, and a culture.\\" The reader will find, on top of this, an artful and detailed analysis of the King James Bible as a literary text. And in dissecting the text, the author blends impartial criticism with will well grounded praise and gives the reader all the ups and downs of the text as a translation and as English prose. Overall, it may be said that McGrath presents his information in an equitable fashion and charms the reader with his well-researched narrative and flowing prose. The only argument contrary to the point addressed above is that he failed to rise above religious bigotry; he denies the fact that the Douay Rheims version of the Bible had any influence upon the KJV; he has nothing good to say about St Jerome's Latin Vulgate; and he reduces St Thomas More to nothing more than a foul-mouthed heretic hunter. With that said, it must be noted that McGrath's work is most likely the best study of its kind. Also included in this work is a bevy of illustrations, helpful charts, and an appendix, which provides a comparison of all the historical English translations. This work is a definite recommendation."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"McGrath is fascinating and reliable investigator of whatever he probes into. This book on the KJV is surely in that vein that we have come to expect out of this profound author.Beginning with the Reformation and Luther's desire to provide the Scriptures into the people's hands and language (actually inheritance of John Hus), McGrath historically paints the movement of the Bible into English via Wycliffe, Tyndale, Coverdale, and Grafton. Fascinating stuff to be sure.Matthews' Bible to The Great Bible to the Geneva Bible, the transitions and history thereof make fascinating reading, and McGrath's writing aids and keeps the reader's interest.To get to KJV one becomes embroiled in politics, here the politics of the monarachy. This explains this translations beginning, and likely is a major contributor to its success to this day. As McGrath documents, even the goals of the translators were political in nature, not to deviate from previous translations unless they had to. Interesting that they really wanted to \\"update\\" the language, especially away from \\"Thee and Thou's\\", but couldn't because they were bound to the translation rules handed down to them.When many today speak of the need to maintain such language as \\"holy\\" wording more reverent than other pronouns, McGrath shows that this was not the case for the very translators themselves: \\"By the sixteenth century, the use of the singular form to address a single individual had virtually ceased in English, except in the specific case of family and inferiors. To address another as \\"thou\\" was thus to claim social superiority over him or her.\\" \\"A careful study of the court records of the northern English city of Durham suggests that \\"you\\" had replaced \\"thou\\" as the normal form of address in spoken English by about 1575.\\" \\"As is well known, the King James Bible retains the use of \\"thou\\" to refer to God, a human being, or even the devil.\\"For modern Christians to insist that \\"Thou\\" and \\"thee\\" are more respectful titles for God, McGrath rejects on two points: (1) same forms used indiscrimately in early 16thC England; (2) usage if anything is derogatory.McGrath shows convincingly that even the translators believed that it was \\"a translation\\" and not the final translation; that the Greek manuscripts were not the oldest nor best; that the Hebrew needed much improvement; that the meanings changed so drastically that at many points, the average reader today, let alone fifty years ago, has no clue sometimes what is being meant, e.g. as McGrath illustrates with KJV 1 Th.4:15 \\"For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.\\"To be sure, this work details the enhancement to the English language development contributed by KJV and Shakespeare, and its spread in American Christianity.This well written, fairly balanced work, presents the history of this remarkable translation with clarity and style."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"This book,(&quot;the Story of the King James Bible and how it Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture&quot;) should have been much better than it is. Benson Bobrick's &quot;How Wide the Waters&quot; covers the same topic (strange coincidence?), but I chose McGrath's version because it is shorter, cheaper, and, Anglophile snob that I am, I assumed a Brit must be a better writer than an American. Although I haven't yet read Bobrick, I was almost certainly dead wrong. McGrath is a heavy, didactic writer. He can't make a point without making it two or three times in succession. Since this is not a long book, his repetitiveness means he must, perforce, leave some things out. One inexcusable omission is the relationship of the King James Version to the Book of Common Prayer, written half a century earlier and also destined to survive well into the 20th Century. (E.g., &quot;for better for worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part&quot;). Both works are essential to the Anglican/Episcopal tradition. Incredibly, neither the BCP nor its primary author, Thomas Cranmer, appears in the index, and I found only one or two references to the BCP in the text.Incomplete as it is, the story this book tells is worth telling, and I learned much from reading it. That much can be said for many a humdrum textbook."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"Alistair McGrath is an incredible writer. This narrative of the history of the King James Bible is a magnificent work of history. Whatever your feelings are about the King James Bible, one cannot deny its prominent place in shaping the language and culture of the Western World.I'm a writer, so it fascinates me to learn how the invention of the printing press led to the revolution of publishing--something we often take for granted when we step into a bookstore and pour over the latest titles. A printed book was such a commodity, such a treasure for the common man, whose education and mind had been held captive by the arrogance and dictatorship of the terrible church-state alliances that plagued the centuries before the Enlightenment and the Reformation.In the Beginning is a fascinating tale of church history, politics, and literature. If you love literature, you'll love this wonderful history."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"Alister McGrath's \\"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible\\" is a refreshing voice in the history of English Bibles. It brings a surprising and interesting witness to the most famous English Bible translation. Many, particularly in modern times, have found the KJV to be stodgy, antiquated, and even dull. McGrath aptly demonstrates with this valuable narrative history that the KJV continues to compliment and under gird many of today's spiritual environs. This book brings the KJV alive from the fascinating and remarkable history of English Bibles.With inspired determination and without apology McGrath tells the chronological and social history of the KJV is only 310 (paperback) pages. His story begins with a brief review of the earliest printed Bibles: Gutenberg's 1456 (2 volume) edition, Mentelin's German edition of 1466, and Wycliffe's supposed English Bible translation from the 1380s (if Wycliffe did translate Scripture it was only piece meal, hand written, and never widely distributed). From this basis McGrath briefly tells the various stories of the rise of the English language, the Reformation's theological honing of God's Word, and the power of the printed word in 17th century European society.With academic honesty and a captivating novelistic writing style McGrath explains the rise and fall of Tyndale (the first to translate the Bible into English), the reworking of Tyndale's Bible by Coverdale (possibly through Queen Anne Boleyn's patronage), and the royal appointments to make the first-ever official English Version of Scripture (The Great Bible of 1539).Other English translations followed until each English Christian community had its own favorite version. By 1610, mass confusion (and total politics) reigned over Scripture textual warrant. McGrath explains that the \\"Authorized Version\\" (ordered by King James of England in 1611) brought some unity to the realm's Bible users. This is a fascinating and informative story well worth reading.The book speaks to Archbishop Bancroft's translation rules (ordering previous English Bible translations to be diligently considered), about the six companies of KJV translators (47 to 51 translators were appointed), of the academic jealousies among the scholars (the age-old Oxford vs. Cambridge rivalry), and to the KJV printing woes (the massive undertaking- two columned, with black letter type and no page numbers- which took almost a year to complete at astronomical costs). McGrath points out that there were many printing mistakes in this first edition, i.e. Exodus 20:14's omitting \\"not\\" to say \\"Thou shalt commit adultery\\". (Certainly, one of English Christianity's special memories.)McGrath has included almost 30 photos (mainly of the principal players), a helpful 3-page time line, an interesting 3-page \\"comparison of historical translations for the 23rd Psalm\\", and a useable 12-page bibliography for further reading. His non-technical writing style makes this an absorbing story for specialty reader and general reader alike.McGrath's \\"In the Beginning\\" is very recommendable to all who want to know more about English Bible history, the KJV in specific, or who are simply looking for an interesting read. It is a great gift candidate."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"Alister McGrath has provided a very readable and informative treatment of the origin of the King James Bible and its influence upon England, America, and the English language. The author provides more background than most other authors concerning the complex social, political, and technical developments which all contributed to the development of the KJV. His treatment of the tension which existed between King James and his belief in the \\"divine right of kings\\" vs. the desire of Puritan elements for reform helps one to understand why the KJV translation was undertaken at a time when a much more popular English translation was already available (the Geneva Bible).The author describes the hostile reception which the KJV translation initially met and helps the reader to understand after such an inauspicious beginning how the KJV managed to ultimately eclipse the Geneva Bible as the \\"translation of the people.\\"The author treats some aspects of the development of the KJV in greater detail than other books on the subject. For example, his discussion of the technical challenges involved in typesetting, printing, and binding were quite illuminating.The author writes almost like a novelist-the book is difficult to put down because it is so readable. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the origin and influence of the King James Version of the Bible and especially to those who are not fond of overly technical or historically detailed treatments."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"McGrath provides a broad overview of how the King James Bible came to exist and how it affected language and culture. He spends a lot of time setting the scene - the King James translation doesn't really make an appearance until halfway through the book. McGrath starts at the beginning with the printing press and the legitimization of the English language and then works his way through the first vernacular translations and the religious/political tumult of the Reformation.McGrath expertly shows how religion and politics intertwined to spawn the King James translation. He also clearly lays out the challenges faced by the translation team. But I thought his efforts to show how the KJV impacted culture and nations were less effective. He does have some good examples of how the careful translation of Hebrew phrases led to many idioms becoming adopted into common use in English - such as \\"sour grapes\\", \\"from time to time\\", and \\"to fall flat on his face.\\" I also found it fascinating that the language of the KJV was considered a bit archaic from the start, and that it was not really accepted as the definitive translation until much, much later.It's amazing to me that the emphasis on an accurate translation in many cases led to beautifully poetic passages with a minimum of awkward phrasing. While it is clear that the author appreciates the KJV, he also explains quite nicely how new translations will always be needed because of our constantly evolving language.This is a clearly written, engaging history - the tone is more conversational than academic. He is a bit repetitive, and uses \\"but we'll talk about that later\\" transitions a few too many times, but these are minor quibbles. The author brings history to life and makes it easy to understand why events played out the way they did. The broad strokes of IN THE BEGINNING should appeal to the casual reader who would like to see a big-picture history of the times that led to a string of printed Bibles cumulating in the King James Version. It is definitely more readable than the more tightly focused yet rambling GOD'S SECRETARIES by Adam Nicolson, which deals more closely with the personalities directly involved in the project."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"The King James Bible has had a central place in my life and I am delighted to know so much more about its religious and political, historical, and etymological contexts. Alister McGrath, a Professor of Historical Theology at Oxford University, has done us a wonderful service in providing us with this lively and informative book.The book first provides a history starting with the medieval Church and the issues that led to the Reformation and the issues of providing the Bible in the languages of the people rather than preserving the Bible to the Priests in Latin. The history of getting portions of the Bible in English and the connection of all subsequent translations to the Wycliffe efforts are fascinating. Before reading this book I did not know about the Geneva Bible and its connection to the Puritans and why its marginal notes made it unacceptable to the Crown. It was also interesting to read about the origins of printing and the huge technical feat it was to print the Bible and the deep implications mechanical printing had for society.Mr. McGrath also demonstrates that the King James Bible was not immediately accepted and what the language issues were that caused some of the resistance. Its triumph wasn't complete until the Restoration during the reign of Charles II. However, it was only in the 19th century that the KJV became \\"The Bible\\" without rival or peer. Of course, by then the language was antiquated and it wasn't long until the movement arose for a modernized version of the KJV and this led to the idea of completely new English translations. Today, there are so many English translations you could fill shelves of your library with them.I was also fascinated to read the discussion of the language used in the King James Bible and why it would have seemed strange and a touch archaic to the readers in 1611. And I did not know that the Apocrypha was included in the original version and left out subsequently due to cost and the rejection of those books by certain branches of Protestantism.The book has a fascinating section that provides Psalm 23 in various English translations. There is also a quick reference timeline and a helpful reading list and index.If you have any interest in the King James Bible I believe you will find this book fascinating. It is not a difficult read and is printed in a handsome style."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"The thing I most appreeciated about the book is that the author seems completely removed from the KJV-Only controversy. Just relevant history and ubiased research. Those wanting a concise yet informative account of the making of the King James Version will enjoy it as I did!"},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said the book is sloppily edited and strewn with typos and mistakes.My suggestion: get Bobrick's &quot;Wide as the Waters&quot; instead. Covers basically the same ground, but does so in much better fashion, in my opinion. The two books were released at about the same time, in the summer of 2001, which naturally invites comparison.If you get a chance to read them both (say, from your local library), I think you too will agree that Bobrick's effort is superior to McGrath's."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"It was a pleasure reading this book with such a wealth of info; can't believe that for generations the English people were ashamed of their own tongue, preferring instead to speak in Latin, and then French.Every Jamaican (those at home and in the diaspora) should read this book (for Miss Lou's sake at least), especially those who distance themselves from the Jamaican Language (now taught in Birmingham,UK),and believe that it is not fit enough as a vehicle for the translation of God's holy word. In the days before the KJV, it was Church officials and the Oxon and Contab academicians who opposed the very thought of an English Bible. Not so in Jamaica. It more the middle and upperclass, and successive goverments lacking the political will to promote such a project.McGrath is by no means an armchair theologian; he knows how to communicate well on the popular level, like the Master Teacher of old--even if he has to do so with American spelling. Only one typo I have seen: p.256, last paragraph, 8th line; where the author appears to 'stammer'for the first time ('It Italy') .Otherwise his prose flows with consummate ease, and his sense of humour (sorry, humor) is refreshing."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"The creation of the King James Bible must rank as one of the most influential actions affecting not only the English language but Western culture in general. The author has a clear, able style yet the book was plagued with repetition and unrelated ennui. The fast majority of the book is either a Prologue describing the events leading to the KJV or an Epiogue describing its rise to supremacy.The reason becomes abundantly clear: There is scant documentation for the process of translation - the arguments, decisions and prejudices of the various \\"translators\\". It is hard for us to realize how an authoritarian ruler (King James I) could be so terrified of a bible with margin notes but the rise of the Puritans confirmed his worst suspicions. When few could read and those that could had an extremely limited source, the power of Scripture was magnified.Its influence is overwhelming. Even the title, \\"In the Beginning\\", evokes immediate thoughts of Genesis (or John). So many of the Hebrew sayings have become synonomous with English - skin of my teeth, sour grapes, to lick the dust - but more importantly it bequeathed to our language a tendency to incorporate other tongues - something that has accounted for the richness of English. My Grade - B"},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"I am not a super religious person, but this book is very well written and has a lot of great historical information. Very informative."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"Alister Mcrath's hisorical review of the origin of the King James Bible is a good account of this important book. I learned much from this reading. I had no idea of the extensive process and evolution this translation went through. Also, I was not aware of the extreme controversy surrounding it throughout Europe. My only complaint concerning this work would be that Mcgrath repeated himself quite often. Many of his points seemed to saying the same thing. Mcgrath did extensive research to be able to write this book, but I do believe he was trying to fill space in several places throughout the book. All in all, the book was very informative and opened my eyes to what really occured in bringing this influential book to life."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"It can be argued that the King James Bible has had as large an effect on our language today as the work of Shakespeare. 'In The Beginning' has at its core the story of biblical translation, a topic you may think anything but fascinating. McGrath has done a good job in making this a compelling book.He starts, as one may expect, with the story of Gutenberg and his first printed bibles. Before arriving at the King James he covers Martin Luther, the rise of Protestantism in Europe, Henry the Eighth, more than one hanging, and several other bible translations and translators. Along the way he manages to dispel a few myths I had held about biblical translation and the King James in particular. I always thought that it was the King James version that introduced the idea of the main body in roman type and words inserted to clarify meaning in italics, but it was actually an earlier English translation known as the Geneva Bible that first implemented this idea. After explaining the technology, theology, politics and linguistics nuances that led King James to permit (but not fund) a new translation, McGrath tells us how the translation was accomplished organizationally before examining some of the nuances of the translation itself. Some of the language in the King James was archaic even when it was published; translators had been instructed to lift from previous translations all the way back to the partial translation of William Tyndale published 90 years earlier, and this at a time when the English language was going through the huge changes of the Elizabethan era. McGrath examines this aspect, pointing out such things as changes in verb endings and personal pronouns.I found the book patchy. McGrath does a much better job covering the story up until the translation. It is harder to get a feel for how the translation was accomplished and how the various teams worked, and when he comes to examine some of the nuances of the translation, the text makes much harder going. If this had not been a part of the topic that interested me a great deal, I may have lost interest."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"I give this book 4 stars for taking on the topic but agree with other reviewers who find it disappointing ... perhaps because one gets one's hopes up to read a title like this, &quot;the story of the King James Bible&quot;. McGrath has done some thorough research (it is his profession) and introduces some interesting data from the past but he is unable to weave his story together in a way that conveys with power, passion and enthusiasm what was one of the most stunning events in Anglo/American history. I think this book suffers in great part from lack of good editorship. I give it 4 stars for subject matter and being a unique attempt to explore and present in laymen's terms information about this spectacular creation, second only to Shakespeare for those of us who love the English language! -- but I give it a 2-1/2 for the rest."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"I am a Catholic, with a graduate theology degree. I am not finished reading this book, and while I find it very very interesting; McGrath's protestant bias IS evident in the text. For example, whenever speaking of Luther, Zwingli, whoever, their &quot;beliefs&quot; are always stated as fact. &quot;Luther knew that ....&quot; Whenever a Catholic's position is mentioned, it is always framed as an opinion/belief. &quot;Because he believed the Pope to be the head of the church.&quot; Etc. It's inevitable I suppose. I hope I can get around the bias, but already just 1/3 of the way through, it is begining to wear on me."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"This book was recommended to me by a member of my church.

I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"The lofty sub-title of this book: The Story of the King James Bible and How it Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture, leads one to believe there will be more substance here than there actually is. It is a slender book that skims the surface of each sub-heading before moving along to the next. (There is lots of blank space, headings, and pictures on just over 300 pages.)Amidst the skimming are some interesting bits of information, e.g., an explanation of how upper and lower case recieved their names, the English translations that preceded the King James version (did you even realize there were any?)and its debt to them, the politics behind the translation and translator selection, and a section on Hebrew idioms that entered the English language through the King James translation. This last is quite an eye-opener.Overall, the book reads like a series of lectures that, in a university setting, would accompany an in-depth reading list. It offers a good introductory summary, but leaves gaps to be filled. Fortunately, there is a detailed bibliography with ample sources for anyone who would like to pursue the subjects covered here further.An interesting topic, but the book left me feeling unsatiated."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"This was exactly what I expected, the background history of events leading to the current uncopyrighted version of the Bible, the political forces influencing it, the factors leading to its popularity, and a brief explanation of its linguistic anomalies. The story flows well and is pleasantly concise while containing enough repetition to aid memory. The only bias I could detect is a hint of fawning praise for the \\"elegant\\" language of the translation, which is probably considered elegant only because the book is so well known and automatically revered by many of its readers.Translation from Latin into English was originally prohibited to preserve the wealth and power of the ruling class, of course. There is also the little matter of sex and violence. Ostensibly it was to ensure that the Word of God was properly conveyed unto the masses by direct translation from the True Bible by His most educated representatives. Of course the Latin versions were translations riddled with both translation and copying errors from earlier versions, and the clerics often had a weak grasp of Latin.The KJV was necessitated by the popularity of the Geneva Bible, which contained dangerous explanations. One of those denied that kings ruled by divine right. The translators were therefore instructed to alter the words of the official Bible only when absolutely necessary to eliminate earlier errors. Thus we have the anomolous \\"thou\\" and \\"thee\\" and the \\"eth\\" ending on plurals, forms that were already going out of style by 1611.Copyright protection, political pluralism, and sectarianism should protect the KJV from adoption of another standard, so this book will be relevant until at least the invention of warp drive."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"This scholarly book, based on sources only recently made available, is written from a deep appreciation for the King James translation and the impact it has had on English speaking people all over the world.

I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"McGrath's book provides a wonderful in depth study of the origins and impact of the King James Bible. For such in-depth subject matter, the reading is fairly easy. McGrath does not assume that the reader is a Bible scholar, and thus provides needed information about the text to bring a novice up to speed. However, McGrath also caters to the scholar's needs by continuing to the next step and providing the minute analysis expected in such a work. In fact, it almost seems he carries his analysis too far on a few occasions, which might bore the average reader and is possibly his book's only flaw. Despite this, McGrath's book pooves to be interesting and a worthwhile read for someone interested in the Bible's history."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"Very well written, extremely informative and interesting.

I recently bought copies to give to my closest friends and my sons. Yes, I am a Christian, but still the history is super interesting. The book unfolds the details of the King James bible and the history of christians spreading around the world via the printed word. It was a unique time in the history of the world, printing presses, a middle class that could read, and exploration and trade all around europe and asia. The History of Civilization, by Will Durrant is maybe a better set of books but it is 13 volumes and requires a serious effort to read.

It showed how various events throughout history aided in carving the path for the King James Version of the Bible. I was extremely surprised at how many details and events were major factors in the shaping of the KJV. I give this book a five star rating because McGrath made a potentially boring timeline of historical jumble, into an exciting way to see the way one of the world's most influential books was written."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"A very complete historical analysis of the New King James Bible's impact on society, McGrath's work traces the path of the scriptures from their Latin and Greek origins through numerous translations, revealing its historical struggles and triumphs.

Alister McGrath, Professor of Historical Theology at Oxford, explores and explains the religious, political, financial, and human factors that went into creating what we in the US call the &quot;King James Bible&quot; (or &quot;Version&quot;).The story of the KJV is fascinating, and McGrath does it justice, so that to read this book is to appreciate both the historical conditioning of KJV (i.e., the questions that it was created to answer), to appreciate why it became so popular, and to realize that its eventual hegemony was not inevitable.A great strength of this book is McGrath's grasp of myriad cultural and historical details. Another is his ability to anticipate readers' questions, so that sections typically end with a natural segue to the next (e.g., &quot;We now turn to consider ...&quot;).An extensive bibliography points any interested reader to sources for further reading.As in any work of this scope, some of the discussions are slightly facile (e.g., the nature of Hebrew (230-235)), but the overall quality is quite high. A better editor might have helped eliminate some of the unnecessary (and slightly irritating) repetition and a few factual errors (e.g., it is the &quot;Byzantine&quot; text, not the &quot;Byzantium&quot;).These do not detract from the value of this work, however--it is both enjoyable and informative.

The jacket blurb promised a &quot;fascinating&quot; treatise on a &quot;tulmultuous time.&quot; Instead, McGrath has written a pedantic, almost outline treatment. He merely skims over a huge amount of material, and in no way fulfills the promise on the front cover--&quot;The Story of the King James Bible and How it Changed a Nation, a language, and a Culture.&quot; As someone interested in ancient languages, I had hoped for more information on the translation itself. The book kept infering that this was forthcoming, but when it arrived (late in the book), it was cursory and very incomplete. After reading this book, one would wonder what was all the fuss about the King James Version. In no way does this author convey the truly majestic language of this translation, and instead, one is left with the feeling that the politics of the translation were what was important. Perhaps the problem is just the misleading title and promise of the book.

The historical record is unimpeachable that King James authorized the writing in 1604 and assigned the task to a group of clerics and scholars from Oxford and Cambridge. However, after that, the trail goes cold.With such a large group working on the project, one would imagine that there would be notes, papers, correspondences and records of meetings, but there is nothing. Simply nothing. How such a number could have worked without leaving a trace is difficult to fathom. Conventional scholars avoid the problem by using weasel words such as \\"it must be the case,\\" \\"it is assumed,\\" and \\"it is undoubtedly so.\\" Thus is conjured up the history of the writing of the KJV.The second problem with the KJV is that it is written with one supreme literary hand. This would not be possible if a number of scholars were contributing a various sections to the KJV.This leads to the hidden, genius, unknown author theory. No one has been selected from the clergy and scholars because none is known to have had any literary talent, whatsoever. The similarity between the KJV and Shakespeare has also been acknowledged, but since Shakespeare is believed by traditionalists to be the man from Stratford, this possibility is ignored. There are no known historical connections between the man from Stratford and the KJV.Now. Let us rewrite English history with an integrated literary and historical account of the Elizabethan period.Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, was born on July 21, 1548. He was the son of Princess Elizabeth and her stepfather, Thomas Seymour. The bastard child was raised as the foster child of the 16th Earl of Oxford. The Queen went on to have five more children, the last being the young, dashing Earl of Southampton.Oxford was Shakespeare.In 1604, Oxford disappeared from court. Oxfordians (those arguing Oxford was Shakespeare) argue that he disappeared. But there was no funeral, no elegies, no anything. No firm record of his death.After 1604, where Oxford went is subject to dispute, (most likely the isle of Mersea on the English coast), but what he wrote is beyond dispute: the Tempest, Shake-speares Sonnets and the KJV. Oxford died in 1609, and the publication of the Sonnets marks his demise, the ever-living poet.Even without the Shakespeare works acknowledged, Oxford was well equipped as a poet and knowledgeable about the Bible. A copy of his Geneva Bible sits in the Folger-Shakespeare Library, with its many annotations. These annotations have been shown to have correspondence to the works of Shakespeare.Oxford created the King James Bible by editing previous versions of the English Bibles. He worked primarily from the Geneva Bible, an earlier version printed in Geneva by Protestant dissidents and does not seem to have been familiar with the more literary Cloverdale version, where many of the more poetic expressions of the Bibles originated, such as, \\"Walk in the valley of the Shadow of Death.\\" Therefore, while the KJV is far superior as a literary work to previous versions, some particular phrases from the Cloverdale seem superior as poetry.Basically, the entire history of the Elizabethan history is a historical myth created by the Tudors and William Cecil. \\"Virgin Queen\\" and all that rubbish. As part of the mythical historical narrative of England, subsequent historians have labored to strengthen the myth and ignored contradictory and conflicting evidence. However, the evidence is clear that Oxford was both the son of the Queen, the author of the works under the pen name of Shakespeare, author of many works attributed to others such as Romeus and Juliet and creator of the King James Bible.Paul StreitzAuthorOxford: Son of Queen Elizabeth"},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"This book on the origin of the Authorised Version or &quot;King James&quot; Bible contrasts well with another recent book on the same subject, Benson Bobrick's -Wide as the Waters-.The Bobrick book focuses on history and personalities, and since it must cover a lot of ground, covering virtually the whole period of the English Reformation from the standpoint of its effects on Bible translations, any given sketch must necessarily be superficial. Bobrick's brief chapter on the period of the English Civil War and its resonance through later English and American history is particularly sketchy, though it would be informative to the too many people who may be exposed to this bit of history for the first time.McGrath, by contrast, is a professional theologian. His book focuses only slightly on personalities, but he digs into the texts. Particularly enlightening is his discussion of the text and annotations of the Geneva Bible; he explains exactly why some of these inoffensive seeming notes actually gave annoyance to high churchmen and royal absolutists. He also extensively discusses the conservatism of the King James Bible in both language and translation, and contrasts even its grammar with that used by contemporary writers like Shakespeare.Those who are unfamiliar with the English Reformation may find the Bobrick book more enlightening. People who have some familiarity with the period, and are interested in the doctrines and language of these Bibles will find McGrath more interesting."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"&quot;In the Beginning&quot; starts out slowly, giving a potted history of the beginnings of the Reformation. It picks up quickly however once the author gains his familiar territory of the Bible in English. The narrative then clips along at an interesting rate as it describes the history of the Bible both before the King James Version, the great work on the KJV translation itself, and the global impact of the KJV to this day.Fascinating bits of detail are scattered throughout the text. Eight sheets of Tyndale's original 1525 Cologne printing were discovered in 1834 and show Tyndale's heavy dependence on Luther's German Bible in his first translation attempts. &quot;In the Beginning&quot; does an outstanding job of exploring the creation and influence of the Geneva Bible - the market leader that the King James Version had to overtake. Ever wonder why the Apocrypha was dropped from most Protestant English Bibles? &quot;In the Beginning&quot; explains this post-KJV phenomenon in terms both religious and economic.A minor annoyance in the book is its tendency to repeat turns of phrase. A statement or quote in one paragraph can be immediately followed by the same statement or quote in a following paragraph. The text could stand a good scrubbing to rationalize these redundant references. Also missing were any biographies on the lesser known contributors to the KJV translation teams. The paucity of our historic knowledge about these translators may explain this omission.The best part of &quot;In the Beginning&quot; is its exploration of the KJV's impact on our language. Tyndale &amp; the KJV translators did much to preserve the Hebrew phraseology and linguistic cadence of the Old Testament. The work delves into how English took both translated Hebrew phrases but also methods of sentence structure as its own. It explains why the KJV translators adhered to forms of English which were already archaic to them in 1611. The subsequent history of the King James Version's elevation to its consideration as one of the defining works of all English literature is told with both awe and humor. Much is made of the receiving generations' assumption that the KJV was THE Bible rather than a mere translation.This is an outstanding and very readable work of popular history. You will never hear or read the English language the same way after reading &quot;In the Beginning&quot;."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"Although it's the most widely-read and best-selling book in history, surprisingly little is known about the King James Version of the bible by most of those who read it on a daily basis. As it turns out, millions of people who consider it to be the very word of God don't even realize that it's a translation rather than an original.Many of those who are familiar with its origins, and who heap praise on it as a peerless literary gem, are not aware that the original bible was written in the everyday language of the common working man, and that the elegance of the prose in the KJV was essentially a fortuitous accident rather than the intent of its translators. The translation was carried out at a crucial turning point in the English language, and the committees established by James I struggled continuously with which words they should use: those of the current day, even though they knew those words would soon be pass&eacute; and possibly unintelligible to future generations, or the newer usages, which they couldn't be sure would last? As an example, the early 17th century word for the neuter possessive we know as &quot;its&quot; was &quot;his.&quot; This has led not only to a number of puzzling passages but also to many that are tortured attempts to get around the problem: Rather than &quot;Its height was twenty cubits,&quot; we get &quot;The height was twenty cubits thereof,&quot; which we may think is elegant but not when that awkward construction appears three times in a single sentence describing the proper construction of an ark.IN THE BEGINNING, a splendidly readable account of how the KJV came to be, is filled with such fascinating tidbits, as well as more substantive and disturbing ones. Church authorities were bound and determined that bibles only be available in Latin, feeling (correctly) that their power arose at least to some extent from the inability of their congregations to understand the Book without assistance from clergy. But the Reformation that was sweeping Europe at the time was based in part on the belief that the bible should be available to all the people, in their own language (hence the term &quot;vernacular bible&quot;), just as the original was. (The Old Testament was in the Hebrew and Aramaic of farmers and laborers; same for the Greek of the New Testament.) This was no scholarly debate, either; William Tyndale was publicly strangled for writing an English version of the bible.One of the strengths of IN THE BEGINNING is how well it acquaints us with the power of the ruthless Middle Ages church and its inseparability from government. The role of politics in the structure of the KJV is explored, too, such as in the decision-making that led to the inclusion of the Gospel of John and the Apocrypha, neither of which was universally viewed as the word of God as were the other sections. Despite a good deal of maddening repetition that often makes the book sound like a committee report (&quot;Tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them&quot;), it's a compelling and intriguing read, its scholarship exemplary and its conclusions well-grounded. Especially revealing are the comparisons among several translations of well-known passages, which demonstrate the extraordinary degree to which all-too-human, seemingly arbitrary decisions (the Greek word ekklesia was translated as &quot;church&quot; but was more closely akin to &quot;congregation&quot;) crept into a work which, more than any other, shaped our language and culture. Because of that undeniable influence, IN THE BEGINNING is a must-read for anybody who thinks, even if they're non-Christians or non-believers altogether."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"This is an engrossing history of the King James Bible (Authorized Version) and its impact on the English language and culture. The author details the movement towards an English Bible and connects it to the wider story of the Protestant Reformation. It turns out that the King James Bible was authorized out of political necessity. The King was new on the throne and in the country and wanted to do something to solidify his support. He also wanted to weaken the growing power of the Puritans, whose preferred translation, called the Geneva Bible, contained notes which were too anti-monarchy for the King's comfort.There's a lot of fascinating information about the way the King James Bible reflected its own times (it was deliberately produced in language which was slightly old fashioned even in the 1600s) and the varying ways in which it has been received over the centuries. Its an excellent book whether you are interested in theology, language, or both."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"As a latecomer to Christianity, I always hated the KJV. I would get enormously frustrated with people who said it was the \\"only acceptable translation\\" (Why the English 1611 translation? Why not the Italian 1730 translation, or the Ugandan 1978 translation?) Those who say the language in the King James is special and more respectful seem to be ignorant of the fact that \\"thou\\" is the familiar form of the pronoun \\"you\\". In other words, if you call God \\"thou\\" you can't call your dog \\"you\\". Passages such as \\"we fetched a compass\\" (Acts 28:13), which has nothing to do with finding a navigational tool but means the subjects walked from place to place in a circle, throw everyone off.So as you can imagine, I was surprised to be educated and entertained by \\"In the Beginning\\". McGrath doesn't write a humdrum chronology of how the book came to be. He engages us in an enlivened discussion of the times in which King James and the Tudors reigned. His book does a great job of mining some of the natural irony inherent in not only government and religion, but religion and religion, butting heads.James VI/I (he became I of England while VI of Scotland) was handed a rough job. He knew that avoiding a vernacular text was impossible. But if he sided with the Anglican church and endorsed the currently used Bishop's Bible, the Puritans, who were gaining strength and who preferred Jean Calvin's Geneva Bible, would refuse it, putting James in a precarious position. What would be the punishment for someone who read the \\"wrong\\" Bible, unapproved by the King's church? Should they be hanged, as translaters who failed to abide by the monarch's wishes had in the past? On the other hand, how could he allow a translation (the Geneva) whose footnotes were highly politicized, advocating revolution and abolishment of the monarchy?Thus James' decision to establish a new committee to produce a new English version from available Hebrew and Greek texts was a shrewd political move. Although it apparently was not good enough to satisfy the Puritans, who packed up all their Geneva Bibles and took them to America a few years later, the new Bible soon became known as the preferrable contemporary version.\\"In the Beginning\\" highlights much more. How the invention of the printing press impacted Bible translation. Luther's mass produced German bible. How Calvin came to write the Geneva Bible in the first place. James' personality, including his ambiguous sexuality.I came away with a definite appreciation for the KJV, as well as for the man who authorized it, who turned the embers of civil war into an opportunity for the making of a masterpiece."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"I found this book fascinating. I grew up at a church in Sellersville, Pennsylvania where the ignorant country pastor pounded the pulpit angrily proclaiming, &quot;The King James Version of the Bible is the only translation inspired by God! I think all the other translations are attempts by Satan to confuse the issue&quot; (He was often afraid of being confused). How surprised old Pastor H. would be to discover that the translators would work tirelessly today to translate the Bible into today's English.This book is a great read. It lays all the necessary foundation for understanding the climate of the KJV translation, from events like Martin Luther's shockingly courageous translation of the Bible into laypeople's German, to the English royalty's early desire for religious autonomy, evolving into a desire for easing conflict between religious factions.I expected to read of political taint, but was pleasantly surprised at the intellectual honesty and humility of the translators. (Rather than feeling that their generation held a monopoly on understanding, they often deferred to previous generations' interpretations from centuries past, giving equal weight to the opinions of those long dead. This is unheard of in today's egotistical intellectual and cultural climate."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"What an illuminating history and how clearly penned is this book! McGrath demonstrates how the great social forces that changed the face of Europe and England set the stage upon which the Translation that produced the King James Version of the Bible would be played out. Beginning with the Renaissance, progressing through the Reformation, and showing the impact of even the defeat of the Spanish armada, McGrath paints for the reader a portrait of evolving societies that demanded a Bible that they themselves could read, be their language French, Spanish or English.McGrath shows us how the changing fortunes of the English tongue itself played a preparatory role in the demand for an English language Bible, and how the rise of the English merchant classes brought what had been a second-class language into respectable usage. Ah, but there was great political danger in allowing a Bible to be written in the people's tongue. How could the church fathers maintain control and exert their accustomed influence if the people were no longer forced to depend upon them to read, interpret and explain the Latin scriptures to their flocks? (Their Latin Bibles were, of course, only translations themselves, but doubtless few clerics could have understood the Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek originals!)And that blasted Reformation! Now we had Puritans interpreting the Bible their way-which weakened the concept of the divine right of kings and threatened the future of the monarchy. That certainly had to be opposed! Such political considerations led to bans on publishing Bibles in the English tongue and to the execution of those who would dare do so abroad. Still, by the time that James VI of Scotland and I of England assumed the throne, English translations of the Bible did exist, several versions of them in fact, including one printed in Geneva by English expatriates. This was a particularly dangerous version inasmuch as it was favored by the Puritan movement and was growing in popularity despite opposition from the Anglican bishops. All of this religious rancor, of course, permeated the entire government, for religion and worldly politics were thoroughly intertwined and inseparable.Perhaps, James thought, directing that a new translation be made would mollify the warring political/religious elements of his realm. Although his goal was not immediately realized, the consequences of his decision were more far-reaching and influential than he could have possibly foreseen. Privately published and sold by venture capitalists, largely ignored or rejected upon its publication in 1611, and fraught with printing errors, the King James Version was not precisely a best seller for quite a long while. It was a rather inauspicious start for what would become one of the most influential books in the English language.I read McGrath's book after Adam Nicolson's \\"God's Secretaries: The Making of the King James Bible.\\" The two works are not repetitive, for they approach the same history from different perspectives. While McGrath generally focuses on the broader linguistic, economic and social movements that eventually created a demand for an English language Bible and explains the political necessity for yet another translation under King James, Nicolson focuses largely on the personalities of the king, his advisors, and on what is known of the individual Translators and their six companies. The two books complement each other nicely, and I would recommend reading both, though, if a reader absolutely must limit himself to just one of the two, then perhaps McGrath's book will give the more thorough understanding.Bear in mind, gentle sir or madam, that, unless you are yourself fluent in ancient Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, you, no more than I, have never read and will never be able to read any biblical texts. The best we can manage is to read a translation, itself based on and heavily influenced by even earlier translations, all of which were themselves influenced by the degree of linguistic skill of the translators, by their own beliefs and biases, and by the secular and church politics that controlled them. Both McGrath's and Nicolson's books will be of inestimable help in understanding just what it is that we are reading today when we claim to be reading the Bible. May I also emphasize that one need not be a follower of Jewish or Christian theology to enjoy these histories. Both educate in a most entertaining way, but, best of all, neither preaches."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"Earlier reviewers have described this book well but have all given it five stars. I add this review simply to suggest that they may have gone a bit over the top. This is a fine book but it is more a history of the Bible in English than of the KJV itself. Its discussions of such things as the rise of the Puritan movement, the religious policies of various English monarchs, and the printing industry in England and the Low Countries are interesting and informative for those with a good basic knowledge of the history of the period but may be somewhat heavy going for others. Its comparisons of passages from various different translations demonstrate well how much the KJV depends on earlier versions but beyond that become tedious. Despite its frequent quotations from Biblical texts, several of which are repetitive, it actually mentions relatively few specific examples of the KJV's influences on the language.This is a good book but is more a solid four-star than a five-star, exclamation-pointed experience."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"At a time when Protestant Christians are engaged in a battle over the Bible, specifically which version is the &quot;real one&quot;, a good, conscise history of the one translation that many feel is the only one is an invaluable asset to all Christians. Without marginalizing the King James Version at all, and in fact praising it rather highly in his conclusion, McGrath shows the struggles that resulted in the publication of this great translation made from several good ones.While telling this story, though, McGrath does more. He tells the story of William Tyndale and his ground-breaking Bible. He tells the story of James I's betrayal of the Puritans, who thought they had a friend in this new King. He tells the story of the rise of English as an actual language. He connects the Reformation taking place in Europe. And then he shows how all these events impacted the development of the KJV.This book is a great read, either in search of information or just as a casual, free-reading book. I also recommend Bobrick's Wide As the Waters. Both books cover the same ground, but from different perspectives."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"While McGrath does a very good job of thoroughly covering the events leading up to the publication of the King James Bible, this book leaves quite a bit to be desired.First, over three quarters of the book is not, in fact, about the King James Bible. A great majority of the book is devoted to the events leading up to the initial publication, while the minority is about its actual effects. When one considers the promises made by the title of the book, it is quite a disappointment.Second, I found McGrath's style of writing to be somewhat dull and slow. He is very scholarly, and I am one who usually appreciates such a take on a subject, but McGrath is far too verbose and repetitive for my tastes. And I would hardly call his witticisms hilarious.Third, it seems as if this publishing project didn't have an editor; there are spelling and grammar mistakes, and whole passages of the book that seem to repeat themselves.If you are interested in the religious climate of England in the Medieval period and the events leading up to the publication of the Bible in English vernacular, then this book is for you.

Writing for a general audience, McGrath first lays out the historical and cultural context for the translation. Though general in scope, McGrath takes time along the way to detail some technical matters: Tyndale's apparent dependence on Luther, 16th century printing techniques, some textual critical issues, the contrasting Latin and Anglo-Saxon influences on the KJV, the particular influence of earlier translations on the translation...Throughout, McGrath emphasizes the KJV's particular place within the broader history of the English Bible, \\"The King James translators saw themselves as standing on the shoulders of giants, those who had translated before them and blazed a trail they were proud to follow.\\" In adopting this tact, McGrath emphasizes the origin of the KJV dedicating comparatively little space to the translation's influence on modern English. (I noted with interest that the actual translation of the KJV was not even addressed until the eigth chapter.) Depending on her expectations the reader could find this imbalance less than satisfying.\\"In the Beginning...\\" will be beneficial to a broad cross-section of readers interested in biblical studies, English history and the origin of our language. Writing as an English evangelical, McGrath offers little to those interested in the the KJV's influence in America; he offers still less to those espousing the KJV's authority over and against other translations.

This book helped me better understand the Protestant Reformation and lead me through the historical events of an important time in history.Until I read this book I had not realized that some people in England were actually burned alive merely because they objected to the Catholic Church's power and control and because they wanted to be able to read and own a Bible for themselves- instead of having to rely on what a Priest told them it said.We can be thankful for those early trail-blazers who gave up so much for the liberties we now have. Sadly, today many can't even be bothered to see what the Bible is all about.Thousands of years of carefully preserving, copying, and passing down the original scriptures have evolved into our modern printed Bibles. People need to pick one up and read & learn about God's simple laws written inside the Bible. We need to get away from today's instant-gratification and self-centered mentality and back to a more genteel society that genuinely cares for one another and helps one another through life.Our country - America - was colonized in the early years by courageous Protestants seeking a new beginning. My ancestors were among them -landing their ships in New England in 1633. I now realize better why they left England- and why they were willing to travel under such hardships to start from scratch in a new land. I also now understand why only a few years back people said that a Catholic (John Kennedy) would never get elected President. The U.S. and much of the world has come a long way in accepting others rights to their own religious views and freedoms.

McGrath combines a historical narrative, amusing anecdotes, theological discussions and linguistics to tell the story of how the King James Bible came to be. It is a tale of royal court intrigue, civil strife, religious feudings, strange personalities, and the future of the nation that came to dominate the world with its language. The making of modern English is intimately tied with the famous biblical translation. I was never aware that English royalty spoke Latin and French, and looked down on English as a commoner language which the royalty did not bother to learn! This is also the story of the reformation and the personalities behind it, the royal response to it, and the immense academic enterprise that became the official translation. I never knew how the bible had been used by religious authorities in Europe to maintain power, nor how the translation liberated the people. The roles of Martin Luther, Calvin, Tyndale, and others was also fascinating.An excellent read, whether in a coffee shop, a reading room, or in bed."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"I'm not a Biblical scholar or an authority on the history of the English language although both subjects are of interest to me.

Alister McGrath's contribution stands out among them. \\"In the Beginning\\" is an engaging story of the many theological, political, and technological currents that led to the production of English language's most read book. McGrath's story begins more than a century before, encompassing a far richer description of Gutenberg's advances (which included not only movable type, but also widespread use of rag paper rather than vellum and black ink rather than tannic brown), the theological work of the Reformers, Erasmus's textual and philosophical triumphs, English nationalism and growing dominance, etc. The tensions between Puritans, faithful Anglicans, and Roman Catholics serve as a central theme. McGrath also shares the reasons that the reception of the KJV was tepid for nearly a century, and how it eventually became so revered. The technical aspects of Bible translation tend to be obscure to laypeople, but McGrath uses engaging prose and amusing examples to make these issues accessible and even entertaining. McGrath balances reverence for the KJV with insistence on the necessity of modern versions. In so doing, he reveals his larger message: that the spirit of work of the KJV translators is best embodied by modern translators who make the Bible accessible to readers of their generation by balancing faithfulness to the original text in the best available editions with dynamic expression of the scripture's meaning in modern idiom."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"\\"In the Beginning\\" author, Alister McGrath, is a gifted writer, maybe one of the very best writers I've encountered recently.

Many people would view history of this era and subject matter as dry and uninteresting, Alister McGrath brings it to life and makes it fascinating.I will absolutely buy more titles by Alister McGrath!"},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"Advertised as the story of the influence of the King James Bible on a nation, a culture, and a language, \\"In the Beginning\\" goes beyond even this prodigious job. McGrath begins with his reasons for writing the book, then goes back to the three technologies that changed the world according to Francis Bacon: printing, gunpowder, and the magnet. As McGrath describes the effect of printing on the Bible and religion, the reader begins to see a reflection of our own society in its suspicions of religious thought and fear of capitalism. This book is written for the lay person who enjoys understanding the cycles of history repeated over and over; it illustrates the quotation that those who don't understand history are condemned to repeat it. The final third of the book deals with the King James Bible in particular, ending with its influence in \\"the colonies;\\" by then, the reader has learned much history that is useful for understanding the present situation in the USA. I was surprised and satisfied by this book, for it turned out to be much more than I had bargained for."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"Not only a very informative book about the production and acceptance of the KJV, but an extremely readable one. McGrath looks back to earlier English, and other language, Bibles, and investigates thoroughly, and with a good dose of humour, the machinations behind the prohibition and then acceptance of English Bibles. A fascinating account that is as enjoyable as it is educational."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"I loved this book! So much of our culture and identity is related to the bible, in the west anyway. And while Christianity in itself can be left behind by some the values and stories dominate our identity. How fascinating to read the background of the King James Bible and find that so much more - even our language is inextricably linked to the Bible as well.McGrath, it seems, is a Christian researcher and writer of some note and I would be interested to read more of his books. In terms of language and readability I found he made an excellent job of what might normally have been a dry subject.McGrath starts with a potted history of the reformation and WHY it became so important to have an english Vernacular version. How it was inspired, and why and who was chosen to do it.Much of the interest to me was in the language which was used, who it came from and why. This helps explain much of the interpretations we have the bible now - where the original was translated from, and how nuance makes a huge difference in the meaning of the text.Even as I write this I realise how dry this must sound - yet I found this to be - if not a real page turner - something that I found compelling enough to read over a few nights.For those who like small potted historys of obscure subjects (I am thinking of authors like Simon Winchester, and Giles Milton particularly - or books like Cod, The Code book etc....) I am sure you will really enjoy this book.For those interested in bible, christianity or language in general - I think this is a valuable addition to your library. this book is definitely a keeper and I will be trying some more of his books as well."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"McGrath's work is thorough, interesting, and informational. Anyone with an interest in the development of the English language and of the authenticity and modern deliverance of the bible would (and should!) enjoy this book. However, McGrath's style leaves some things to be desired. He repeats himself, sometimes within a few pages, and relates the same quote verbatim on more than one occasion. And while I find his witisisms a pleasure in such a scholarly book, I could stand for fewer editorializations (most especially concerning the rediscovery and reurgence of false christian doctrine, presumably the Nag Hammadi.)All told, I thoroughly recommend &quot;In the beginning&quot;."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"I personally do not believe that one need write an essay as a review on such an open forum. My reviews tend to be shorter.... I like or don't like and why. I love this book and it is fairly simple why.1) Alister E. McGrath is one of the best theological writers of our time and this book will not dissapoint on that realm.2) this is an honest look at the shaping of the doctrines and theology and the WORD in English.Typical to the style of McGrath, this book is in depth and not hard to grasp and extremely thorough!"},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"I enjoyed this book very much, the author always had a little nugget every few pages that made the book fun to read. Read the other reviews here as well as I agree with what these people said, myself, I am not a great student of this topic so I found it very enlightening. The book is not &quot;religious&quot; but a history of the translated bible, both German and English. I enjoyed the exploration of the motives of the parties that translated the bible at different times in history, their motives were not always pure. A great informative, educational and entertaining read."},{"Title":"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture","review":"While the combination of religion and history may push many away from devoting their time to reading In The Beginning, I highly recommend this book as an educational tool as well as a free-read. Throughout the book, Alister McGrath provides an intriguing and in depth look at the creation of the King James Bible. The book surprisingly reads more like a novel rather than a bland historical book. Such is accomplished as McGrath presents his information in a very interesting and articulate fashion while at the same time not forcing anything at the reader.While McGrath holds the interest of the reader nearly throughout the entire book, there are indeed times in which the average reader without a background in the historical era examined may find himself lost. However this is a rare occurrence and should not deter anyone from picking up this book.Although Christians and non-Christians alike should read Beginning, I believe especially that all believers should read as it is important to know and understand the basis by which one places his faith.All in all, the book is excellent and provides an educational and intriguing look at the creation of the KJ Bible."},{"Title":"Basket Tales of the Grandmothers: American Indian Baskets in Myth and Legend","review":"book was in excellent conditiion and like new. priced the book at an exclusive store and it went for $[...].

The book is not meant to be exhaustive or comprehensive, but offers the right level of detail and a listing of the most useful knots the salty sailor needs to master. A step-by-step approach with clear instructions and photographs makes it easy to learn new knots and other aspects of marlinspike and general seamanship. A must to keep on board."},{"Title":"Nautical Knots Illustrated","review":"both my 11 year old and myself have found this book to be a MUST for several reasons: It's clear, and covers the essential knots either a boater or knot-tying hobbiest could need. although the reader is sometimes subject to rely on what a photograph is indicating, the directions along with the photographs are fairly easy to follow. it's fabulous for a novice or if you need to review some forgotten &quot;moves&quot; - the authors make sure to briefly explain the usefulness and helpfulness of the knot. it's fun to work through this book with my daughter - so i recommend this as a unique parent/child activity we enjoy and can put to practical use. i recommend this if you are rusty on the correct way to tie trustworthy, safe nautical knots (in other words, your boat will still be at the dock in the morning.....)"},{"Title":"Nautical Knots Illustrated","review":"I like this book a lot but will buy it in book form. The Kindle form separates captions from photos (so you can't tell which knot you are looking at). It also retains page number references on the photos -- which is not useful on Kindle.

DISCOVERIES AND CONCLUSIONS OF A VERY ORDINARY BRAIN (SINCE 1866).","review":"I looked up this book initially to sell the copy I have, then upon seeing how many for sale there were coupled with the sales rank, I wondered what would the book be like? H.G. Wells is known to be a great storyteller, although I am not personally fond of his works. And an autobiography? I am not fond of these either; but I felt drawn to open the book.Once there, I was sucked in, compelled to read the next paragraph, and then the next page, flowing into the next chapter. When I cought a breath of air I was through the introduction, and two more chapters in. Wells draws the reader in with his smooth use of the language, and through the ability to relate to everyone around him. Page 7 \\"We all compromise. We all fall short. The life story to be told of any creative worker is therefore by its very nature, by its diversions of purpose and its qualified success, by its grotesque transitions from sublimation to base necessity and its pervasive stress towards flight, a comedy.\\"While telling his life story, he questions and laughs at his mistakes. He includes sketches, photos, letters, & illustrations throughout to show you himself. His use of the language though is so smooth that you forget to notice when you turn the page. Beautiful in its simplicity, talking to you as if it was yesterday, H. G. Wells has managed to turn his life into an entertaining story, rather than a serious withdrawn recolection of life."},{"Title":"EXPERIMENT IN AUTOBIOGRAPHY. DISCOVERIES AND CONCLUSIONS OF A VERY ORDINARY BRAIN (SINCE 1866).","review":"A really painfully slow book, overloaded with detail. It takes about 500 pages before H.G. Wells reaches the 20th century. Quite offensive in parts. He states at one point, \\"I saw the approaching decivilization of Ireland\\". Elsewhere he drones on about his idea of a one-world government. The pro-Soviet propaganda is a bit much to take. Of Joseph Stalin, he enthuses, \\"I have never met a man more candid, fair and honest. No-one is afraid of him and everybody trusts him.\\" The reader is also informed that \\"the new Soviet Russia was the best moral and political investment that had ever been offered to Britain\\". In Stalin's Russia \\"there remained a growing effect of a successful enterprise.\\" Charles Darwin and Thomas Huxley are also venerated as being \\"very great men\\" and \\"mighty intellectual liberators\\". If Wells's vision of centralized world government occurs it seems it may well resemble Stalin's Russia, as Wells ponders at one point that Stalin \\"must be seeing many things much as I am seeing them\\".Instead of wading through this book I would recommend chapters 6 and 7 ofThe Intellectuals and the Masses: Pride and Prejudice Among the Literary Intelligentsia, 1880-1939, titled H.G. Wells Getting Rid of People and H.G. Wells Against H.G.

His life story is fascinating and sad, but he is just down right concieted. Another reason I didn't like the narrator is that he didn't seem very reliable. I couldn't be sure that the information he was presenting was accurate (In other words, it was like the wolf's version of &quot;The Three Little Pigs.&quot;). I could rattle off dozens of reasons why I did not like this character (in the end of the book, the biracial resolved that he would live as a person.

This book is a refreshing reminder that there are shades of gray as well. Johnson's prose is very fluid and, unlike some other reviewrs, I found the story line engaging. Finally, a remark about the last line--whether or not one agrees with Johnson's assessment, it is certainly the type of statement that stays with the reader long after the book has been put down."},{"Title":"Along this way: The autobiography of James Weldon Johnson","review":"For a book which was first published in 1912, this is an amazingly relevant work for today. Johnson's novel (hidden in the form of an autobiography) graphically looks at relations between the races in American. The nameless main character is born in the South to an African-American mother and a white Southern aristocrat. He and his mother move to Connecticut when he is very young, allowing Johnson to show us the benevolent face of pervasive racism of the United States. Johnson avoids the easy &quot;good&quot; vs. &quot;evil&quot; view of the oppressed vs. the oppressors. Instead, the narrator becomes a permanent outcast, returning to the South upon the death of his mother and then to the ragtime era New York City. The style of the novel is clear and extremely readable--and very current. The end of the novel dives deep into the issue of racism, causing both black and white readers to question their long-held assumptions about who they are and who they appear to be to others."},{"Title":"Along this way: The autobiography of James Weldon Johnson","review":"This is a tragic book in a lot of ways. It is a reminder that America has not fullfilled her promise to all of her children. It would be great to read a book like this as an object lesson in the bigotry of the past. We have made some progress but there is still much to be done. James Weldon Johnson produced a wrenching tale. That it is somewhat autobiographical adds to the ambivalent narration. First the narrator feels shame in his heritage but then grows to accept himself and feel pride in who he is. This tells a tale that America is often loathe to hear but it is important nonetheless. The aspect of a mulatto man passing for white is sad. One should be allowed to feel pride in multiethnicity. This is a horrible stain on our culture that so many people had to live in denial of who they really were. This book is a valuable document of America's dark side. I would hope that it experiences a much deserved revival now that evidence of Jefferson's relationship with Sally Hemmings has reopened the discussion on this sad piece of our history. Read this book and weep but most of all read this book and learn."},{"Title":"Along this way: The autobiography of James Weldon Johnson","review":"This story is a very emotional recollection of a man who was both black and white. A fictional account from an autobiographical standpoint of what such a life would look like, James Weldon Johnson takes us on a journey full of sorrow, bad mistakes, a glimpse of happiness, and a life lived around the world. We see the narrator has he grows, as he discovers his heritage, as he loses himself to his desires, and as he finally realizes the course of his life.__________________________________________It was seriously the LAST paragraph that did it for me. Honestly, I had no idea what I really thought of the book until I read the last paragraph. It was crazy, going on a journey like this one and getting so acquainted with the characters, and still being unsure of how I felt. It had amazing writing, great characters, and awesome facts to back up the culture - and still it was missing something. It was just...empty. Despite all the facts and character development, despite all the places the narrator went and all the people he met, I felt that he didn't do anything. He waltzed through life with rich people, as a gambler, as a traveller, always searching for something more, always selfish. Even when he finally decides to do the right thing, he gets distracted. I wanted him so badly to do something worthwhile.Seriously, the LAST paragraph, maybe the last two paragraphs, but really the very last, turned the whole book around and took me by surprise. And while before I wasn't sure if I would recommend it, now I know that I would recommend it highly. It frustrated me, it made me feel, and it surprised me. Great book!Favorite character: the \\"girlfriend\\" or the \\"widow\\". A tie between them.Favorite aspect: Everything. But to name just a bit of it: foreign language, the way the narrator describes different cities and how the people in them live, the talks about mulatto folk in the South and in the North.... I really could go on!One word to sum up this book: Surprising. Really surprising. Please read this book!"},{"Title":"Along this way: The autobiography of James Weldon Johnson","review":"I found this book on the bottom shelf in my college bookcase. From the first chapter, I found myself on an old, winding, rollercoaster. James Weldon lived a life in early to mid-twentieth century more filled with extraordinary adventures than many men today. The matter that he did so 'passing' as Caucasian isn't just a coincidence. Character is what matters. . .as a reader should derive from his story; however, the matter of race devoured Weldon's every chance at completing each sweet piece of life-pie.I cannot say more to those who never understood a Black man than to read...this...book!!

My favorite thing about the book was that when the main character travels around the world. The locations and people have such lively and colorful descriptions they almost seemed real.The book was written in 1912 by James Weldon Johnson who wrote the book as if it was a factual biography.

I use this in conjunction with RACE & MEMBERSHIP (by Facing History & Ourselves- collection of readings related to Eugenics Movement in USA) and with the film, \\"Imitation of Life\\" (the color version, not not the original black and white). Be mindful that it's high-end vocabulary as the author, like many Black writers of the day, sought to not only show that the main character wanted to impress those he came in contact with but that the author himself may have been trying to prove his own intelligence in writing the novel.

He was also one of the first African-American professors at New York University, and was later a professor at Fisk University. He also wrote books such asGod's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse (Penguin Classics),Black Manhattan,Lift Ev'Ry Voice and Sing, etc.This novel was first published anonymously in 1912, and describes the thoughts and experiences of a man whose light skin enabled him to \\"pass\\" as white. It was also the first first-person novel written by an African-American.Here are some quotations from the book:\\"I believe it to be a fact that the coloured people of this country know and understand the white people better than the white people know and understand them.\\" (Pg. 22)\\"I felt relieved, in spite of the size of the lower class. The unkempt appearance, the shambling, slouching gait and loud talk and laughter of these people aroused in me a feeling of almost repulsion.\\" (Pg. 55-56)\\"I have since learned that this ability to laugh heartily is, in part, the salvation of the American Negro; it does much to keep him from going the way of the Indian.\\" (Pg. 56)\\"The newspapers have already told how the practice of intricate cake-walk steps has taken up the time of European royalty and nobility. These are lower forms of art, but they give evidence of a power that will some day be applied to the higher forms.\\" (Pg. 87)\\"Was it more a desire to help those I considered my people, or more a desire to distinguish myself, which was leading me back to the United States? That is a question I have never definitely answered.\\" (Pg. 147)\\"(A)mong Negroes themselves there is the peculiar inconsistency of a colour question. Its existence is rarely admitted and hardly ever mentioned ... yet this influence, though silent, is constant. It is evidenced most plainly in marriage selection; thus the black men generally marry women fairer than themselves... the effect is a tendency toward lighter complexions, especially among the more active elements in the race.\\" (Pg. 154)\\"Can you name a single one of the great fundamental and original intellectual achievements which have raised man in the scale of civilization that may be credited to the Anglo-Saxon? The art of letters, of poetry, of music, of sculpture, of painting, of the drama, of architecture; the science of mathematics, of astronomy, of philosophy, of logic, of physics, of chemistry, the use of the metals, and the principles of mechanics, were all invented or discovered by darker and what we now call inferior races and nations.\\" (Pg. 162)\\"(T)he main difficulty of the race question does not lie so much in the actual condition of the blacks as it does in the mental attitude of the whites; and a mental attitude, especially one not based on truth, can be changed more easily than actual conditions.\\" (Pg. 166)\\"As yet, the Negroes themselves do not fully appreciate these old slave songs... but the day will come when this slave music will be the most treasured heritage of the American Negro.\\" (Pg. 182)"},{"Title":"Along this way: The autobiography of James Weldon Johnson","review":"A sensitive, yet heartwrenching, story which illustrates the ridiculousness of judging a person by his racial ethnicity. Too bad our government still feels compelled to put us all in little boxes whenever we fill out a form. Will we never be rid of the idiocy of it all?"},{"Title":"Along this way: The autobiography of James Weldon Johnson","review":"For a long time I've often wondered why anyone would want to be white (not being one myself). I never had the desire. I know what it feels like to be discriminated against simply because of my ethnicity. These days, there are so many people of mixed blood, and yet a person with one white parent and one black parent is still considered black, always wondered why. This book doesn't explain that but it brings up a lot of things to think about. And it might start a serious, deep discussion about what it actually means to be white, or to be black, etc., why must we categorized our ethnicity? He doesn't make excuses for himself, he doesn't shift the blame to anyone but himself. He takes full responsibility for what happens to himself. Which is refreshing. And you can understand why he chooses what he does in the end (especially given the time period the book was written in). I ended up feeling sad that he has given up half of who he is, half of his own history, half of his ancestry, and that his kids will miss out on that delight too. I still don't understand that mental problem people about one drop of non-white blood excludes you from being considered white, just makes no sense to me. Blood is blood. And these days, if you've ever had a transfusion, you might be getting blood for some other race. Anyway, the book brings up some good things to think about, to talk about, to explore a little further with people not of your own race just to see from their perspective."},{"Title":"Along this way: The autobiography of James Weldon Johnson","review":"A powerful little novel, packs a lot of substantive issues into a tight and thoughtful narrative.There are three main things this work tackles:1] Exploration of racist conditions in early 20th century United States. Quiet but potent, such a scenario inevitably causes us to what's shifted from this account, and then what hasn't. For a portion of the book this issue seemed almost too light, too much a matter of verbal prejudice rather than more fundamental realities--but it came full force near the ending, with a vivid narration of a lynching.2] Debate concerning such racism. Here the work is less succesful, and seems to a greater extent dated and less useful. The larger approach is credible enough but the exploration of racism as a component of southern pride and regional nationalism feels incomplete. The arguments analyzed here are major racist tenets, but they don't get at some of major overlapping motifs behind abhorrence. Even more deficient are the counter arguments against racist definitions of blacks and black culture. The intent is certainly laudable, but the actual speeches given--largely pointing to black music as a self-evident sign of accomplishment rather than degradation--miss a lot and close the book on assessment in a way I doubt was applicable even in the author's time.3] Attempted opting out of this issue. This element is where the book shines, showing the systemically inhumane treatment of blacks, and the ambivalent and muddled human response to this. Faced with long odds and no prospects of racial equality, the protagonist chooses--as the title indicates--to pass as white and give up efforts for a wider struggle. Not an heroic choice, but eminently understandable, and puts a far more tangible face on the many characters real and fictional who did sacrifice deeply in a question for human justice."},{"Title":"Along this way: The autobiography of James Weldon Johnson","review":"This product I received it in a timely matter.

Lovely story."},{"Title":"Along this way: The autobiography of James Weldon Johnson","review":"Perhaps best known for writing the Black National Anthem, Lift Every Voice and Sing , James Weldon Johnson wrote one of the first novels to probe the ambiguities of race, the novel The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man. As a boy, the fictional title character is sent North with his Mother to be raised in Connecticut. He does extremely well in school and is even something of a musical prodigy.But, he is stunned when one day in school a teacher asks the white students to stand, and scolds him when he joins them. He confronts his fair skinned mother and she reveals that she is indeed black and his father is a white Southern gentleman. His father later comes to visit, and even buys him a piano, but the child is unable to approach and deal with him.As a young man, the death of his mother &amp; sale of their house leaves him with a small stake &amp; he determines to attend college. Though qualified, he rules out Harvard for financial reasons &amp; heads back down South to attend Atlanta University. However, his stake is stolen from his boarding house room before he can register &amp; he ends up with a job in a cigar factory.When the factory closes, he heads North again, this time to New York City and discovers Ragtime music and shooting craps, excelling at the one &amp; nearing ruin in the other. A white gentleman who has heard him play enters into an exclusive agreement to have him play at parties &amp; subsequently takes him along on a tour of Europe.Inevitably, he is drawn back to America and to music. He tours the South collecting musical knowledge so that he will be able to compose a uniquely American and Black music. But his idyll is shattered when he sees a white lynch mob burn a black man. In the wake of this experience, he decides to &quot;pass&quot; for white--not due to fear or discouragement, but due to &quot;Shame at being identified with a people that could with impunity be treated worse than animals.&quot;Abandoning his musical ambitions, he takes a job as a clerk, does well investing in real estate &amp; meets a white woman who he wishes to marry. After examining his conscience he decides to tell her that he is black. After taking some time to confront this fact, she consents to marriage.As the novel closes, the &quot;ex-colored man&quot; tells us: &quot;My love for my children makes me glad that I am what I am, and keeps me from desiring to be otherwise; and yet, when I sometimes open a little box in which I still keep my fast yellowing manuscripts, the only tangible remnants of a vanished dream, a dead ambition, a sacrificed talent, I cannot repress the thought, that, after all, I have chosen the lesser part, that I have sold my birthright for a mess of pottage.&quot;And the reader can't help but feel profoundly ashamed of a system of racial oppression that forced a man to make these choices--a wonderful novel.GRADE: B+"},{"Title":"Along this way: The autobiography of James Weldon Johnson","review":"I purchased this book several years back, as part of the research for my second book. I cannot recommend any book more highly. Anyone interested at all in African American life from the 1880s to the 1930s (particularly as it was lived in New York City from about 1899 to the Harlem Renaissance) should buy it. There is not a more fascinating autobiography in print anywhere! And the life of this man! He was the founder of the first high school for African Americans in the state of Florida, located in Jacksonville (the high school my own mother would attend); the first African American to pass the bar exam in the state of Florida; part of the first successful African American Broadway composing team (after he left Jacksonville and moved to New York City); composer of the lyrics to, \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\\" the song long considered the African American national anthem (his brother Rosamond composed the music); a consulate in Nicaragua and Venezuela; the first executive secretary of the NAACP, in which capacity he pioneered anti-lynching legislation (though he was unsuccessful in seeing it pass, the effort is described in the book, and is a fascinating lesson in the machinations of Congressional politics in the 1920s); author of groundbreaking fiction such as, \\"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man\\"; author of the nonfiction classic, \\"Black Manhattan.\\" The list goes on... His accomplishments, his dignity and intelligence were stunning, simply awe inspiring. And it is a real shame, an indication of how troubled our culture is, that Hollywood has never made a movie about his life, and he is barely mentioned as a key figure who shaped American culture (notice I didn't say African American culture, I said AMERICAN CULTURE). To everyone reading this review, BUY THIS BOOK. You are in for an experience so delicious it will shame you if you never before knew it existed. It will make you want to call for the resignation of all college professors who do not have \\"Along This Way\\" as REQUIRED READING for any course designed to examine the history of American culture."},{"Title":"Along this way: The autobiography of James Weldon Johnson","review":"This fictional book is very powerful! Great freebie. And no, this is not the author's \\"tale\\". I am sure some of the struggles faced are based on the author's vast knowledge but this is not James Weldon Johnson's word-for-word life story, though it obviously is based on details from his personal life.from Wikipedia:The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man by James Weldon Johnson is the fictional telling of the story of a young biracial man, referred to only as the \\"Ex-Colored Man\\", living in post Reconstruction era America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The Ex-Colored Man was forced to choose between embracing his black heritage and culture by expressing himself through the African-American musical genre ragtime, or by \\"passing\\" and living obscurely as a mediocre middle-class white man.Though the title suggests otherwise, the book is not an autobiography but a novel. However, the book is based on the lives of people Johnson knew and from events in his own life. Weldon's text is an example of a roman &agrave; clef. (Roman &agrave; clef is a term used for a novel describing real life, behind a faade of fiction)"},{"Title":"Along this way: The autobiography of James Weldon Johnson","review":"Johnson's novel travels through various African-American societies (New England, Jacksonville, New York City, the Black Belt) in a story of a mulatto caught between two opposing racial identities. The novel is an epic journey (emotionally and physically) of this African-American, who is light enough to &quot;pass&quot; into the white American dominating the turn-of-the century. The Ex-Coloured Man's personal struggles to reconcile his true private self with his public self in a divided and prejudiced society makes this novel an emotional and enlightening read. Johnson takes up the issue of WEB DuBois's double-consciousness, and gives it life in the form of this ambivalent protagonist."},{"Title":"Along this way: The autobiography of James Weldon Johnson","review":"Many novels of the African-American experience in the United States use the theme of \\"passing\\". These novels generally involve a light-complexioned African-American who can \\"pass\\" for white. Among other things, novels based on a theme of \\"passing\\" allow the character and the author to comment upon black-white relationships in the United States from both sides -- from the black experience and from the white experience.Both white and black authors have made extensive use of the theme of \\"passing\\". The earliest novel involving \\"passing\\" of which I am aware is by William Dean Howells in his short 1891 book, \\"An Imperative Duty\\" which dealt with an inter-racial marriage. The African-American novelist Nella Larsen wrote a novel titled \\"Passing\\" set in the Harlem Renaissance. More recently, Philip Roth's novel \\"The Human Stain\\" involves the story of Professor Coleman Silk, a distinguished academic and student of the classics who passes for many years as white.Coleman Silk is the successor to the protagonist of James Weldon Johnson's only novel, \\"The Autobiography of an ex-colored Man\\" written in 1912. The unnamed protagonist of the book is an individual, like Roth's character Coleman Silk, with great intellectual and artistic gifts who is torn between the opportunities open to him as an, apparently, white person and his strong sense of black identity. Like Coleman Silk and the characters in most novels involving the theme of \\"passing\\", Johnson's protagonist marries a white woman and lives a life plagued with guilt regarding his abandonment of his heritage as an African-American. Johnson's short novel is, to my mind, the best written on the theme of \\"passing\\", and it is a fine novel indeed. The book initially was published anonymously. The writing is so powerful and believable that many readers took the book for a true autobiography until Johnson acknowledged his authorship in 1914. Many years later, Johnson wrote his own autobiography, titled \\"Along This Way\\" in part to show that the story of his own life was not the story of the protagonist in the \\"Autobiography\\".Johnson's story shows how his protagonist goes back and forth, both internally and in the outward events of life, about whether to make his way in the white or in the black world. He ultimately finds himself successful but unhappy. In addition to the story line of the book, Johnson uses the \\"passing\\" theme to allow many reflective passages by characters in the book on racial relationships in the United States early in the 20th Century. The most famous such scene occurs as the protagonist travels in a \\"smoking car\\" for whites on a train in the segregated South. He participates in a discussion among several white men of varied backgrounds on the \\"race question\\" as it was viewed at the time. There is also a chilling scene in the book involving a lynching, the burning alive of a black person. Johnson worked fervently in the latter years of his life to secure the passage of anti-lynching legislation in Congress.But Johnson's novel includes a great deal more than a consideration of race issues. The book offers an outstanding picture of life in early twentieth Century America -- in the South and in Johnson's beloved New York City. The book is filled with pictures of dives and gambling dens and of the trade of cigar making in both South and North. It is filled with the love of the piano and of classical music. Most strikingly, the book has the spirit and feel of ragtime, which reached the height of its popularity during the years in which the book appeared. Johnson shows great appreciation for this product of American culture.The book also illustrates some universal themes. The protagonist is troubled, specifically, by the conflict between his identity as an African-American and his wish to succeed as a white person. But the broader themes of the book are the consequences of lack of self-knowledge, the role of chance in human life, and the consequences of a certain sense of purposelessness and frustration, which plague many individuals separately from any consideration of race. Johnson develops these themes eloquently and ties them in well with his theme of \\"passing\\".Johnson's novel is an important work of American fiction which deserves to be read."},{"Title":"Along this way: The autobiography of James Weldon Johnson","review":"This is not the type of book that will grab you from the beginning and hold you until the end.

Upon cracking the binding, I was not impressesd. But, as I got deeper into the story, I was captivated. This is the type of work that makes you look at your life and wonder how you would respond in the same situations (and how you had responded in the past). While Johnson didn't give you dramatic build up that writers of today give, he gave an opportuinty for individual soul exploration.

I couldn't put this book down, proved to be one of the finest I have ever read. While not a true autobio, the tale is wonderfully told and it's free....impossible to beat!"},{"Title":"Along this way: The autobiography of James Weldon Johnson","review":"James Weldon Johnson (1871 -1938) was the closest American approximation possible to a Renaissance man. He is best-known for writing the lyrics to \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\", considered the \\"African-American National Anthem.\\" He was a poet, the author of \\"God's Trombones\\" among much else (including the poem \\"Fifty Years\\" still one of the best meditations on Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation) and of the famous novel \\"The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man\\" (1912). But Johnson was much more. He served several tumultuous years in diplomatic service as American counsul to Venezuela and Nicaragua. With his brother, Rosamund, and Bob Cole, he formed part of a famed and highly-successful black songwriting and Vaudeville team in the early years of the Twentieth Century. Johnson founded the first African-American high school in his home town of Jacksonville, Florida and, almost in passing, he became the first African-American admitted to the Florida bar without attending Law School (by reading law and passing a treacherous oral examination.) Johnson was a newspaper editor and a founder of the NAACP where he took an active role in litigating against laws restricting the voting rights of African-Americans, and, in particular, worked tirelessly in support of Federal anti-lynching legislation. In the final decade of his life, Johnson taught creative writing and American literature at several universities and lived, for a time, the life of contemplation and reflection that he said had been his lifelong goal.Johnson lived an inspiring life. And in his autobiography, \\"Along this Way\\" (1933) he allows the reader to share in much of it. The autobiography is a lengthy and detailed work in which Johnson not only tells the story of his life, but he also describes a good deal of African-American history in the South, where he grew up, and in the rest of the United States during the pivotal half-century following reconstruction. We can see in Johnson's story, for example, how segregation and Jim Crow gradually but forcefully came to pervade the Southern States in the late 19th and early 20th century. Johnson also gives vibrant descriptions of life in New York City, of the growth of Harlem, and of African-American singers, actors and entertainers on Broadway -- in which he himself played a prominent role. There are chilling descriptions of lynching and of Johnson's efforts to bring this barbaric practice to an end. One of the more memorable scenes of Johnson's personal life in the book is a description of how he himself was almost lynched when he was observed talking alone to a light-skinned woman in a public park in Jacksonville. (His would-be attackers thought the woman was white.)The book is divided into four main sections, with the first describing Johnson's childhood and education at Atlanta University. Part two presents a picture of New York City and Johnson's efforts as a songwriter. Part three focuses on Johnsons counsular work in Latin America while Part four discusses Johnson's work with the NAACP. But these are only the broadest, bare-bones descriptions of an extraordinary life. Johnson combines his discussion of his public life with insightful comments on most of his writings, including his poetry, novel, his history \\"Black Manhattan\\" and his work as an anthologizer of African-American poetry and of Spirituals.There are moments in the book when I wanted to know more of Johnson's inner life. He tells us, for example, of his courtship of and marriage to Grace Nail but, with the exception of some discussion of her reactions to Johnson's diplomatic posts, we see little of her in the book. Johnson is reticent, in common with most writers of autobiography, in letting us see too deeply beyond the public figure. But at the end of the book, he offers the reader some broad reflections, centering upon his agnosticism and of his hopes and ambitions for humanity.Johnson's life focused upon his efforts to secure the rights of black people in the United States, but his life, work, and writings were universal in theme. In \\"Along this Way\\" he gives us the story of a life both active and reflective. His book is a precious work of American literature."},{"Title":"Along this way: The autobiography of James Weldon Johnson","review":"One of the superb American autobiographies, and one of the great autobiographies of any period. After reading an example of this calibre it does not surprise me that I am rarely able to read biographies... second hand views, with some exceptions (Philip Horton's biography of Hart Crane, Frank Harris' of Oscar Wilde) are simply not sufficient....those exceptions being almost invariably written by men or women contemporaries who lived and loved in the same circle as their subject.James Weldon Johnson was a great American, not just a great African American, and a master stylist. This book is a pleasure to read both for its countless wonderful episodes and for the inspiring way of its prosody. He is one of those writers who makes you feel that his wonderful style is an organic product of a graceful upbringing, it is classic and yet unmannered...or rather the manner, being the grace, is the man, all inseparable. There is an additional poignancy in the narrative, especially in the childhood portion, deriving from our knowledge that the nobility of his home education is a thing entirely vanished from the American scene. He went to school, but was also in every sense home schooled. See the autobiography of Kenneth Rexroth for a similar example...\\"The years as they pass keep revealing how the impressions made upon me as a child by my parents are constantly strengthening controls over my forms of habit, behavior, and conduct as a man.\\" (Along the Way, p. 19, Penguin ed.)This is certainly one of the best examples of Childhood Autobiography in the World Literature of any age.

Weldon Johnson was not light enough to pass for white (see writer Charles Chesnutt's works--who was light enough to pass--but lived as a Black man.). Many reviews give a synopsis of the book, so I won't repeat it here. Also, this book needs to be followed up with educated analysis because some of the reviews here are way off base in their interpretation.I highly recommend this book for junior-senior high school students, college students, and those interested in early 20th century African American/American literature.

Purportedly an \\"autobiography\\", it is the story of an intelligent young man who \\"ignores the best in himself.\\" He gets his money stolen and doesn't go to college, though he's extremely talented musically. The book tells of his life, from the craps tables of New York, to high society in Europe with his \\"millionaire\\" friend. I picked this one up on a whim, and really liked it.Though extremely short, the edition I read had small font, and it is a bit difficult to get through. However, it offers some interesting insights. I particularly liked the earlier sections of the book. The narrator (who, as far as I could tell, is unnamed) is really the only main character. The other people in the story come and go; no one sticks around for very long. The narrator describes things with intelligent language and acute perception. The writing style is dense, yes, but also rewarding. The \\"race question\\" is discussed a lot; I particularly liked the scene on the train where the Texan and the Yankee soldier are debating. I can really see both sides of the argument (even the Texan's, a little bit). But, obviously, the book is not just about race.When I say it's set in the 1900s, I think it is, because the book itself makes no mention of the time period specifically, except that it's after the Civil War. The book, however, was published in 1912.There are some interesting character studies in this book too. The millionaire friend, the porter, his mother, \\"Red\\", \\"Shiny\\", etc, are all well drawn and developed.I'd never heard of this book before, and I'm glad that I read it.

I cannot wait to read more by Kathy Love.By the way, this was the very first time I have ever written a review. For many years, I have read many romance novels and have never been motivated to write a review. However, I had to share how much I really enjoyed this romance novel.Thank you Kathy Love!"},{"Title":"Getting What You Want (Stepp Sisters, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed every page in this book, I couldnt put it down. The characters were so well written that I feel like I know them. Kathy handled Chase's secret very well, I was impressed (he is quite the hottie, by the way). I am happy that we can continue with these characters in at least two more books!Way to go Kathy! You rock!"},{"Title":"Getting What You Want (Stepp Sisters, Book 1)","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend as being an &#8220;endearing romance novel with no lack of passion\\". And she was right. The book had a good progression to it and I thoroughly enjoyed the way it was written to allow the thoughts of each character to respectively shine through every given situation. I did find the lack of vocabulary to be off setting, as it felt that there was a lot of repetition and redundancy of actions and descriptive terms (pebbles, that's all I'm saying). I loved the characterization of each character, but would have been thrilled to have some more input on Willy's end, as he was a big factor for other.... factors. Otherwise, I did really like this novel and would recommend it to hopeless romantics that enjoy pursuing odd loves."},{"Title":"Getting What You Want (Stepp Sisters, Book 1)","review":"I love the whole series.... It was a good book on how High School Bullying can harm you even when you are grown. I love this book."},{"Title":"Getting What You Want (Stepp Sisters, Book 1)","review":"Plot: Abby was the smart nerd in high school and she and her sisters were teased mercilessly by the other students. Chase was the bad boy in high school, and Abby's crush. Abby comes back to town, bringing her highschool insecurities with her. Chase has insecurities of his own.The chemistry between the two characters is very high, both in the friendship aspect and the sexual tension aspect. The characters are flawed people who are just trying to live their lives. The dialogue between all the characters is not too cutesy and there is very little content that seems extraneous.Fun, fast read with enough angst and happy ever after for everyone."},{"Title":"Getting What You Want (Stepp Sisters, Book 1)","review":"I loved this book--for once the Male character isnt a jerk...but a genuinely nice guy and does alot to make his girl feel special. I also liked that he stood up for her...didnt let rumors and stupid things stand in the way. He was proud and very aggressive with his feelings which was nice for a change. I liked Abby too...she was real."},{"Title":"Getting What You Want (Stepp Sisters, Book 1)","review":"I really enjoyed this first installment of the Stepp Sisters trilogy. Each book focuses on each of the three Ugly Stepp Sisters, who were teased horrificly growing up in Millbrook, Maine for their looks, clothes, height, weight, and any other attribute. Although never experiencing anything to this extreme, I could easily relate to the awkwardness and humiliation of being teased in high school, never fitting in, and fantasizing about the most popular boy in school. This story focuses in on what can happen 15 years later, when you're confronted with those same tormentors of your childhood, except this time around, you're grown up, attractive and successful. It really made me think about how I would react in those scenarios and have to say it would probably be similar.Bookworm Abby Stepp graduated valedictorian from high school, went off to Boston University, got her doctorate degree and never looked back. 15 years later, she's offered a temporary research position near her hometown and decides to take it to visit her sister and to take a break from a stagnant romantic relationship from her boyfriend of 12 years. When she comes to town, she turns alot of heads including the most popular bad boy from high school, Chase Jordan. Abby had a secret crush on Chase as a young girl, but he and his friends were the primary culprits who relentlessly teased her, called her ugly and played cruel jokes on her. When Chase sees Abby again, he's completely smitten, but when he approaches her, he essentially gets the kiss off and assumes she's the same aloof and snobby teenager. Living next door to one another, they eventually grow a friendship and Chase realizes his perceptions of Abby were completely wrong and he can't help but pursue her even though he thinks he doesn't deserve her. Abby on the other hand, realizes a part of her is still living in the past and after 15 years, needs to leave the past behind her.This was a very entertaining and engaging romance. The relationship was built at a nice pace, and the supporting characters really add to how people change over time. Abby and Chase have a steamy chemistry and their obstacles, although slightly over the top, were not overly distracting. The story was blessedly free of long running misunderstandings and simply laid out a dreamy second chance at a missed opportunity.One word of caution, although I didn't let it affect my rating, there were so many typos in this kindle edition that it eventually did become distracting. Most of it was something that could actually be picked up in a simple spell check so I'm not sure how it got so bad. If you can get beyond that, it's a great read."},{"Title":"Getting What You Want (Stepp Sisters, Book 1)","review":"Just discovered this author - I loved this book. Really can't understand the one star review. Downloaded the second book as soon as I finished the first and looking forward already to part 3."},{"Title":"Getting What You Want (Stepp Sisters, Book 1)","review":"This book was a light, fun, quick read. I liked how the author showed Abby and Chase getting to know one another, enjoying each other's company and actually giving them a foundation for falling in love beyond the surface attraction they have for one another. (Which she doesn't really do in book 2.)I particularly liked that Chase was far from perfect. It made him more real. And I liked how the author showcased how Abby's adult life was affected (and still is) by her experiences in high school and how she learns to finally overcome her insecurities.Overall this was a very enjoyable book.Note on Kindle version: I was disappointed by the number of typos and misspellings in the kindle edition. The publisher could definitely have done a much better job. There were sometimes a \\"l\\" at the end of words where it didn't belong (for example, Steppl instead of Stepp, hippol instead of hippo) and other typos that were annoying. That said, they didn't impede on my reading or comprehension. It more astounded me than anything, that something with that many stupid typing errors would get out to the public."},{"Title":"Getting What You Want (Stepp Sisters, Book 1)","review":"Thanks to years of taunting, Abigail Stepp has garnered a disposition of being serious, reserved, and always thinking with her brain. The classic beauty has gone back to her hometown to regale in an opportunity the brilliant scientist was given. The least she ever expected was to see Chase Jordan and see his attraction to spend time with her. Chase was once the bad boy in town with the pack of smokes and air of trouble around him, who stood by while the Stepp sisters got ridiculed. Now he's reformed yet still just as beautiful as ever with his dark hair and ice blue eyes; Still is magnetic with an easygoing charm, kindness, and gentleman-like manners when near Abby.When Chase sees Abby, he wonders why he ever missed such a chance to know her back in school. Not too soon, they embark on a friendship. Neither were too surprised when they felt like teenagers again with sweaty palms, oxygen deprivation, and raging hormones to be as close as possible. Neither were too surprised when the the more they got from the other, they more they wanted and the more their hearts soared :) Yet, both think they could never fully keep the other interested forever since they are so far out of the other's league. Despite their insecurities, it doesn't stop them from finding absolute happiness together and growing up.This is my absolute favorite Love book!! (I've read two others and this one blows them out of the water.) As always, Kathy Love places HEAVY focus and emphasis on the romance (how lovely, right?) The secondary characters mold the romance, whether it has a good or negative affect (in this story it's the sweet Ellie and the manipulative Summer-Ann). The pacing is gorgeous and lovingly leisure. The atmosphere was ridiculously crazy; it felt SO realistic as did every aspect of the book. Especially the humble yet sweet life of small town Millbrook, Maine is written fantastically!The pairing of Chase and Abby was very convincing because their want for the other was so real, so palpable, and fiercely beautiful. It's scary how endearing Love penned the relationship to be. Theirs this profound connection that links the two vividly :) Their dialogue, their conflict with insecurities, and their love. (btw, the love scenes were written with SUCH detail.) There were such lovely intricacies to this book (like when Abby took her time admiring Chase's beauty or when Chase twirled a curl of hair from Abby's nape). THOSE little details made me real with happiness.This book made me jump with joy. I laughed and cried. I said \\"Aww\\" out loud. It made me want to find a charming, handsome man like Chase who has callous hands and has a deep secret. I felt like Love's heart was in this more, and I know your's will be as well. It's a wonderful read about claiming what you never had, what you COULD have had, and finally \\"Getting What You Want.\\" It's never truly too late.Happy Reading!!"},{"Title":"Getting What You Want (Stepp Sisters, Book 1)","review":"I was surprised to find that I really enjoyed this book.

Her writing captivated me from the first page to the last! Abby and Chase, the main characters, are so well developed that I felt like they could have been former classmates of my own.

Kathy Love's secondary characters are nearly as engaging as the main two, and I really look forward to reading Ellie's story in the second installment of this Stepp sister trilogy.

I could not put it down. This book keeps your attention from beginning to end. Kathy Love is a great author and knows how to keep you entertained. Way to go Kathy"},{"Title":"Getting What You Want (Stepp Sisters, Book 1)","review":"Getting What You want by Kathy LoveOctober 11, 2004Courtesy of WWW.LOVEROMANCES.COMGETTING WHAT YOU WANT by Kathy Love is part of a trilogy of books centering on the Stepp sisters. In this novel, Abby is the main character, returning home to Millbrook, Maine, for a temporary job assignment with Rand Corporation. Her sister, Ellie, the local librarian, still lives in Millbrook in the home that belonged to their grandmother, the woman who raised the three sisters, while Abby left town years ago and had been working in Boston as a scientist.Abby has dreaded coming home. She has bitter memories of their childhood and the classmates who constantly made fun of the three sisters. Abby left home never expecting to return, and now she is about to face her hometown once more for the sake of a job. It is only for a few months, and she loves her career so much that it was worth returning home.Barely back in town, Abby and Ellie are about to order a meal at the Afternoon Delight when someone from the past recognizes Abby. It's Chase Jordan, whom Abby had such a crush on back in high school, but being the class nerd, no one had paid any attention to her back then, except to taunt and tease. She didn't think Chase would even remember her.When Chase sees Abby, he is astounded at how beautiful she has become. But he still views her as the stuck up girl he remembers from high school. Abby, on the other hand, is so choked up she can barely speak. She still has feelings for Chase, but thinks he would never feel the same way for her. She still sees herself as the insecure girl from the past. Besides, she has a boyfriend back home, Nelson, who she feels is her perfect life partner. She will not betray Nelson and decides that she can never act upon this crush she has for Chase.Later that week, Abby attends a party at her boss's home, and finds that many of her old classmates are there as well. It's not a very comfortable situation for her, thinking they will ridicule her as they did when they were kids. While her former classmates welcome her back to town, Abby finds it difficult to feel the same friendly feelings towards them. Chase again notices her rude behavior, and gets the impression that she feels she's better than the rest of them.After an embarrassing altercation with one of her former classmates, Abby cannot wait to leave the party, and as she finds her way to her car, she hears Chase trying to start up his old truck. Abby seeks him out. This chance encounter allows Chase to see a different side of Abby, and he wants to get to know her better. He asks her out on a date, but Abby tells him she has a significant other, and says she can only be a friend to Chase, nothing more.As the two get to know each other as \\"friends\\", both have a hard time holding back their feelings. Abby questions whether she should be loyal to Nelson, or move on with Chase. And Chase finds that the more he gets to know Abby, the more he likes her as a person.This reviewer was pleasantly surprised with GETTING WHAT YOU WANT. It was more than just a romance, and while a lot of romances only touch on the \\"relationship\\" aspect and \\"getting there\\", this novel went into the dynamics of the relationship, comparing Abby's feelings of isolation and loneliness as a child, to Chase's feelings of insecurity as a man. Many romances often only explore the here and now, but in GETTING WHAT YOU WANT, the romance novel becomes a little bit more complex. It was interesting how the author worked this part of the story into the romance, and it worked out quite well. Along those same lines, it's the characters that make a romance work, not necessarily the situation, and the author did a good job developing not only the protagonist and the leading man, but also the minor characters were developed into three dimensional people that \\"felt real\\". GETTING WHAT YOU WANT comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Getting What You Want (Stepp Sisters, Book 1)","review":"Most romance novel heroes have a bit of everything....looks, charm, bad boy tendencies, and a bit of reformation in store for them. Chase Jordan has all that and more. He is the best hero that I've read for sometime. I kinda have a crush on him (a fictional character no less!)This is one of those books that everyone who's ever been to high school can relate to. High school is such a difficult time. Clicks, out of place teens, popular students, geeks, athletes, labels...yuck. This book dives right into these tough memories as the smart, geeky, valedectorian Abby Stepp returns to Millbrook, Maine to do some research and is living next to her high school crush (the popular badboy)!Abby has a lot of forgiving to do. She was poorly treated in high school and has many hard and hurt feelings surrounding her treatment. Chase also has difficult memories and regrets his behavior from high school. The question is \\"can he get Abby to forgive and forget\\".I loved this book. It was deeply sensual but emotional as well. Both Abby and Chase have work to do...accepting themselves for who they are and learning how to love each other and themselves. I found myself devouring this book with a silly grin on my face the whole time. Chase is such a gentleman and a GENTLE MAN. He is the stuff dreams are made of, and when Abby's dream comes true, I for one was cheering on the sidelines.Read this one!"},{"Title":"Getting What You Want (Stepp Sisters, Book 1)","review":"This is the book for you. But this book is just an all around great book. I couldn't put it down. Read it in two days. I loved Abby. She was a nice woman who could not get over the hurt in the her past. Chase was a dream guy. He was willing to stay with Abby and help her open up to him and the other people in town. I really can't wait to read Kathy Love's next book in this series. This is a first for me because I usually read one or two books from a series, but I want to read all of them. All of the sisters are people I can relate to. More books should be like this. I am so sick of reading books where the heroine and hero are perfect or one of the main characters are. Nobody is perfect and that should always be reflected in books,esp. romance novels."},{"Title":"Getting What You Want (Stepp Sisters, Book 1)","review":"Kathy Love's debut novel is a warm, witty, funny, sexy read that had me turning pages late into the night. I loved Abby, a woman who's tried to escape her unhappy past by retreating into a world of intellectual certainties. She's deluding herself, of course, but that makes her even more likeable.Chase is just about the sexiest thing ever--not only because he's criminally good-looking, but because he's kind and talented and vulnerable.Love has an effortless way of creating character--the hero and heroine are convincingly drawn but she can evoke secondary characters' personality in just a line or two. The book is full of laugh-out-loud one-liners, but never at the expense of emotion or warmth. And as a Maine native, I loved the way she managed to capture the charm and the stresses of life in small-town New England.I'm looking forward to the rest of the Stepp sisters' stories!"},{"Title":"Getting What You Want (Stepp Sisters, Book 1)","review":"I first read Kathy Love's vampire books, 'Fangs for the Memories' and 'Fangs but no Fangs'.

The romance was sweet and unfolded very smoothly. I love that this story was about ordinary people overcoming every day problems and finding love. I can't wait to read about the other two Stepp sisters."},{"Title":"Getting What You Want (Stepp Sisters, Book 1)","review":"I finished reading all of Kathy Love's vampire series books and was happy to have found her Stepp sister's trilogy. I have purchased, but have not yet read the last two books, but I'm sure I will not be disappointed as I really enjoyed this book.

Fun, easy read and I highly recommend her other books."},{"Title":"Getting What You Want (Stepp Sisters, Book 1)","review":"High school can either be one of the greatest of your life or it can be Hell on Earth...for Abby Stepp it was complete Hell. Born poor and incredibly intelligent she was constantly ridiculed for her intelligence. The subject of many cruel names and jokes,she believes that she'll never have the one person she truly wants: Bad boy Chase Jordan. So imagine her surprise when she returns to Millbrook to find she's the object of his affections.Chase Jordan was Millbrook High's classic bad boy. Good looking with a huge chip on his shoulder,getting any girl he wants. Never did he think he would find Abby Stepp the attractive woman she today. After each meeting,he's consumed with thoughts of her...Can the bad boy of Millbrook keep a huge secret from the intelligent woman he's growing to love?I loved this book so much.

Contributors include Senator David Norris, Emma Donoghue, Father Bernard Lynch and Kieran Rose, inter alia.The legal reforms wrought since 1992 in the wake of the European Court of Human Rights decision in the Norris v. Ireland case, President Mary Robinson's reception for Irish lesbian and gay leaders, the steadily eroding influence of the once dictatorial Catholic hierarchy and the rows over the St Patrick's Day Parade in New York City have focused world attention on a re-definition of Irishness and sparked unprecedented discussion of the long-suppressed subject of sexuality - including homosexuality - among the Irish public. Here a range of voices of those closely involved in the process of change engage with the shifts in Irish society, politics, faith and values. Each writer reflects on their work in the lesbian and gay community and envisions what the future holds for lesbian and gay citizens in the Republic. Contributors include Senator David Norris (of Norris v. Ireland fame), Mary Dorcey, Emma Donoghue, Louise Walsh, Father Bernard Lynch, Cherry Smyth, Eibhear Walsh, Jonie Crone, Kieran Rose and Anne Maguire.The extraordinary political successes of Ireland's queer community in 1993 after a twenty year struggle for equality, their achievements since then, and the impact of all of these events and processes on Ireland seen against the wider background, betokens a sea-change in the Irish body politic, that along with the prospect for peace and the creation of a Civil Society in the North afford a great promise and a bright hope for the Ireland of the 21st century. \\"Lesbian and Gay Visions of Ireland\\" offers the reader a fascinating account of these processes, events and personalities."},{"Title":"At the Edge of the Light: Thoughts on Photography and Photographers, on Talent and Genius","review":"\\"At the Edge of the Light\\" is a collection of seven essays on Brassa, Kert&eacute;sz, metaphors about the parallels between photography and mathematics, the role of narratives in photography, Weston, Stieglitz, and Strand.The first essay on Brassa covers a long swath of his life, but the parts I found most interesting where those about his relationships with other artists in Paris during the late 1920's and 30's, particularly Henry Miller, and his intellectual influences, such as Goethe and Nietzsche. The best word I can find to describe the narrative and writing in this essay is \\"pleasant.\\" I particularly enjoyed Travis' description of Brassa's work as capturing \\"flow and duration\\", and contrasting it with Cartier-Bresson's \\"decisive moment.\\" I found this description of Brassa's work to be among the best aspects of the book.The second essay deals with Kert&eacute;sz. Although Travis discusses much of Kert&eacute;sz's work during the 1920's, he mainly focuses on the picture \\"Chez Mondrian,\\" Kert&eacute;sz's relationship with Mondrian, and even much on Mondrian himself. While I did enjoy this essay, I didn't take as much away from it as the others.The third essay was by far my favorite, not just because it is about the relationship between mathematics and photography and I am a mathematician, but because it is genuinely deep and novel. Travis discusses the creative process in photography through metaphors with mathematical reasoning and proof in the (relatively) accessible field of number theory, even going so far as to proclaim that \\"there is no difference in the way a creative idea comes to a mathematician and the way one comes to a photographer.\\" Although most of the metaphors are just that, and effectively so, the comparison between Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean Theorem and Cartier-Bresson's \\"Hy&egrave;res, France\\" approaches a true bijection. This example was my absolute favorite part of the book. Travis goes further and explains the role of beauty and aesthetics in mathematical creativity, drawing upon Hadamard's \\"The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field.\\" Here Travis also gets into the role of the subconscious in both mathematical and artistic creativity.A respected curator of photography, especially at a place like the Art Institute of Chicago, going off and studying mathematics, and then coming back and teaching so much about photography, has to be one of the most remarkable intellectual exercises I have every encountered.The fourth essay deals with how the presence or absence of narratives in photography affects our experience of the artwork. This leads to the primary discussion of the last three essays on artists in old age. Travis tries to show the importance of the later work of Weston, Stieglitz, and Strand, and the tenor of his arguments are summed up in one he makes about Strand:\\"What then is there to say about a photograph of an autumn leaf, especially one in black and white? Beyond some diagram of composition, the answer to this question depends on the photographer who made it. Of Paul Strand, there is a lot to say. Of a leaf centered in his 1973 'Fall in Movement', there is less.\\"Travis does note that Strand himself felt photographs should stand more or less alone. I can't give an opinion on this issue, but, like all the other essays in this collection, the last four are a joy to read.As noted by a previous reviewer, the photographic printing in this book leaves much to be desired. While mostly a distraction, the poor print quality strongly interferes with what Travis has to say about Weston's \\"Point Lobos.\\"All in all, this book is a must read if you have an interest in the art history of photography or art photography in general."},{"Title":"At the Edge of the Light: Thoughts on Photography and Photographers, on Talent and Genius","review":"Whether it's a re-interpretation of Bresson's \\"decisive moment\\" or his feeling of strangeness that Kert?sz's Chez Mondrian remained unpublished and unknown for so long; David Travis' seven essays make for an excellent afternoon's read and offers insight into some of the subtle nuances that comprise the gamut of photographic genius. In fact, I found his essay on Kert?sz more interesting for what it said about Mondrian than about Kert?sz himself although it does provide context for his meticulous compositions Chez Mondrian and Mondrian's Pipe and that the Mondrian studio environment may have \\"helped to discipline [Kert?sz's] lyrical eye.\\"I'm afraid I was less than convinced with the curious relationship of number theory to photographic composition. Particularly the statement attributed to Cantor that \\"...these two sets form the same size of infinite set..\\" (an absurdity without dimension) and I switched-off from the details at that point. I did however, enjoy his conjecture regarding the role of the subconscious in both mathematical and artistic creativity and the acknowledgement that inspiration and perspective is often found far away from the perceived comfort of our own artistic discipline. For me this is where the book's title made every sense and on reflection served as it most important lesson.Travis' final three essays offer plausible conjecture into the generational stages of Weston, Stieglitz and Strand not only with regards to the chronology of creative expression as identified by the Japanese tea master Sen no Rikyu but also because there is much within the Rikyu aesthetic that speaks to their latter work. Well recommended!!"},{"Title":"At the Edge of the Light: Thoughts on Photography and Photographers, on Talent and Genius","review":"The book consists of seven essays, most of them based on 1991-2001 lectures. The first two deal with Brassa and Kert&eacute;sz, who were active in the early part of the twentieth century. The next two concern the parallel between creativity in mathematics and in photography, and the importance of narrative in photography. The author concludes by musing on late photographs (or sets of photos) from three outstanding photographers: \\"Point Lobos\\" by Edward Weston (1944), the \\"Equivalents\\" series of clouds by Stieglitz (1920s - early 1930s), and \\"Fall in Movement\\" by Strand (1973). Some 10 pages of notes follow the 162 pages of text.I found the book thought-provoking, and many of the photographs were new to me, but the book could have been improved in the following ways. First, an index would have enabled the reader to find specific passages or artworks of interest. For example, one might like to see again the paragraphs on Poincar&eacute; on pages 74-75, or the photos by Sternfeld on pages 80 and 85. Second, it would have been nice to know the dimensions of the original photographs. A work that is only a few square inches in size will have a different impact than one that covers an entire wall. Third, virtually the entire book discusses creations by white men; it would have been nice to introduce some diversity in race and gender. Finally, while the off-white matte 6\\"x8.5\\" paper is lovely for the text, it does not allow high-quality reproduction of the photographs. Pure white semi-glossy paper in a larger format would have been better.Buy this book from Amazon.com!"},{"Title":"At the Edge of the Light: Thoughts on Photography and Photographers, on Talent and Genius","review":"In his introduction to this book David Travis says that he wants readers to consider \\"that some images are expressions that found their form because of particular human conditions in the lives of the photographers.\\" That certainly sounds like a more achievable goal than the exploration of talent and genius described in the subtitle.Of the seven essays included, five are devoted to the photographers Brasai, Andre Kertesz, Edward Weston, Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand. Two essays are more general dealing with the relationship between mathematics and photography and narrative and photography.The essays about the artists are chatty little stories, most of which seem to support a thesis that photographers careers reflect a movement from trying to please their public to trying to please themselves. The essays are interesting, but don't seem to lead to what the author himself calls the \\"aha\\" phenomena. Since the audience for this book is likely to be people who take a serious interest in photography, rather than the man on the street, the reader is unlikely to be surprised by the conclusion that some pictures nail us into a moment while others are full of ambiguity. And the essay that says that some mathematical models call to mind the work of some photographers is more likely to tell us something about the mind of Travis then about photography.It's nice to know that even when the artist Michel Seuphor pressured Kertesz into taking pictures of Piet Mondrian's studio, Kertesz was able to impress his vision upon the picture, or that Stieglitz's affair with the 23-years-younger Georgia O'Keefe affected his photography (I should hope so!). Still, I got no new insights into photography, although that may be because I've noticed that I myself seem less interested in pleasing others and more interested in pleasing myself as I've grown older. I'm not even certain that the author's narrative achieved his goal of showing us that the photographers' lives shaped their pictures, although I'd have been willing to accept that thesis without any supporting essays. Still, the book reads quickly and interestingly, and even if it provides one with no new insights into talent and genius, it's an enjoyable way to while away a day."},{"Title":"The Golden Rider","review":"It seems that everyone has a different opinion of what constitutes the best tarot deck, but the Golden Rider fills the bill for me.In choosing my deck, I spent many hours peering over images on the internet. In doing so, I developed my own criteria for a good deck...1) Images based on the Rider-Waite tarot, since many tarot texts are based on these.2) Simplified images and colors, so my aging eyes won't have so much trouble focusing in on the details.3) Card backs that look the same upside-down or right-side-up, so it's not obvious if the card is reversed.The Golden Rider fulfills all the criteria and gets my vote for the best of them. While some people want the traditional coloring of other Rider-Waite clones, I vastly prefer the Golden Rider because the images are easier to look at.I don't put much stake in the publisher's claim that the Golden Rider uses colors that trigger an intuitive response. For me, the reaction feels as if it's based more on my esthetic sense.I do have to say, though, that a tarot deck decision is highly personal, so my advice to anyone looking to buy is to find the deck that speaks to you most with the greatest clarity. That takes looking at a lot of decks, and perhaps discarding the preferences of other reviewers.Good luck finding the deck that works for you!"},{"Title":"The Golden Rider","review":"This is my personal favorite Rider deck, and the one that I use the most. The images are the same as any Rider-Waite deck, but they are recreated in an oil painting style. The colors are beautifully rich and at times dark, but I find this to be a perfect compliment to the gold colored framing, and the gold cups and pentacles. The card backs also have a gold and bronze colored cross design, with a pink spot in the middle. The whole deck gives me a colorful sunset feel, with it's bright oranges and pinks, reds and blues. It almost looks tasty, like Napolitano ice cream!(I know that sounds a little crazy, but hey...)The only down side is that the outline details are not as clear as in the Universal or Radiant decks, especially in the facial expressions (the child's face on the SUN card looks a bit smudged). You may want to do an image search on the net and judge for yourself.So if you're looking for an alternative to the standard Rider-Waite, this deck might be for you."},{"Title":"The Golden Rider","review":"Fundamentally, this is a reprint of your typical Rider-Waite-Smith deck, but it is embellished with gold paint. There have been other reviews criticizing the art work, but I didn't notice the differences enough to complain. I've done a few readings with this deck so far and everything felt right to me.Five stars because I truly have nothing to complain about."},{"Title":"The Golden Rider","review":"This deck, is quite simply, a reproduction of the Rider-Waite Deck. Repainted in oils, there are small discrepancies between the original deck and the golden rider that any searcher should be able to see. What is most intriguing about this deck is the way the images change-- at least for me. However, like the Rider-Waite Deck, it relies heavily on Christianity symbols and interpretations."},{"Title":"The Golden Rider","review":"I use the Universal deck in my professional work, but I love the coloring of this deck for personal use. It's strong and evocative, but in a quality way, not loud or garish."},{"Title":"The Golden Rider","review":"I have used the Rider-Waite for quite some time and wanted to try something new. After looking at many decks I found this and decided to go with it. It's my regular deck but better. The colors are more intense and often remind me of sunsets. I have a more positive feeling from many of the cards because of that. The images are all the same but deconstructed. I recommend it for those who like the standard deck but want a little more of a special feel from it."},{"Title":"The Golden Rider","review":"I purchased a deck of these cards based somewhat on the reviews here, and also because I am a professional reader and enjoy collecting various renderings of the Rider deck. Basically, I am appalled at the artwork. The paintings seem unprofessional in the extreme, as though painted by an untalented child. For example, the facial expression of The Fool is grotesque to say the least; the lady depicted in The Star seems to have a huge black eye; and the rendering of the IX of Pentacles lady seems quite cartoonish. These pictures are gross from beginning to end. In my opinion they are an affront to the tradition of the Rider deck. I am aghast that U.S. Games should publish them at all. The only reason I gave the deck two stars instead of one is because of the physical quality of the cards. They seem to be of an extremely high quality, thereby making it quite easy to handle and shuffle them. The pictures, however, are so repulsive that I will be handling and shuffling them no more."},{"Title":"Genesis and Evolution","review":"I had been told that \\"Genesis and Evolution\\" by M. R. DeHaan was a non-existent book but I knew otherwise because I used it when writing a thesis in Bible college (in the early 1970's). I had been told this by Kregel (now out of business). Imagine my delight when I found it through Amazon's used book service!"},{"Title":"Manual of mineralogy","review":"This text is often used in college mineralogy courses. As one having considerable experience with minerals before taking the college course, I found the 21st edition a distinct improvement over the two previous editions.The strengths of this edition are in its treatment of crystallography and of crystal chemistry (however, Bloss' Crystallography and Crystal Chemistry covers this well), mineral chemistry (compositional variation in minerals, calculation of analyses, etc.), x-ray crystallography, mineral stability diagrams, good line crystal diagrams in its systematic section, and a usefully organized index. Although this reviewer has often disliked determinative tables as a waste of space (checking entries takes time but is educational), those in this edition have been found useful to students.A few weaknesses are the removal of interfacial angles from this edition (even cleavage angles may aid in identification), the absence (except for hydrochloric acid upon a few carbonates) of most simple chemical tests upon samples, using cheap hardware store acids and reagents, and the absence of any passing reference to the subject of blowpipe analysis, a historical adjunct that served mineralogy as much as the Bunsen burner served chemistry. Although that is a separate subject not possibly treated adequately within a one-semester course, and not generally treated in college courses today, it is a historic part of our mineralogical heritage, and often can serve a useful purpose in the aid of identification of commoner species. A few notes as to its place in history, and a few text references for further study, would have been appreciated. However, the Field Guide to Rocks and Minerals, by Frederick H. Pough (Peterson field guide series) may serve as a useful complement to this text.This could use rewording in a few places, as some sentence structure (indeed some formula structure) may be found ambiguous, an example being formulas on page 75 to find a and c, which are not clear as to whether parts of these, as in the last paragraph on said page, are in the numerator or in the denominator... Another example is the use of the stereographic net, which I had quite a time figuring out from the text, and when I did I rewrote directions and pinned them up on the bulletin board of the geology dept. Kudos, however, to whomever put the stereonet inside the back cover of the text with the suggestion to photocopy it for use. Also the list, two pages past the last numbered page, of locations of some key tables and illustrations. Clarity of language is important to a student desiring to learn more about some aspect of the subject.It is difficult to rate books upon a number system, as objective reasons and examples are more informative. The rating, which seems to be required, is an average based upon my own personal opinion: 6.7. [DMM]"},{"Title":"Manual of mineralogy","review":"The book contains excellent diagrams, graphs and other illustrations, which are useful for all students. Although the CD has valuable tutorials for beginning students, the text is often too technical and &quot;dry&quot; for beginners. Besides discussing crystallography and mineralogy, the book also provides a good review of chemistry and methods for analyzing minerals. Overall, the book is an excellent reference for upper level undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty. Lower-level undergraduates may require a less technical textbook."},{"Title":"Manual of mineralogy","review":"I just finished the semester, so I think I have a pretty good feel for the book now. At the beginning I found it difficult simply because it occasionally used terms and diagrams before explaining them. As the semester progressed and I became more knowledgable about the subject, I found the textbook increasingly helpful and readable. Certainly there is a lot of good stuff in here, and the CD was unecessary but fun. Overall, it was a good complement to the lectures."},{"Title":"Manual of mineralogy","review":"Into the 5th week of Mineralogy class, this book *then* became extremely informative - this is not a self-instructional manual, and I do not believe it was intended to be so. Most students will find the writing style in this text a bit intellectually heady, having been written by a distinguished Harvard PhD professor. It could have been written more concisely, perhaps more simplisticly, but all the information is there, and from what I understand, past editions were more comprehensive than this 22nd edition. I personally love this text, and only *after* an introduction to the subject will this text make real sense to the reader. And yes, I agree with the previous posts regarding certain statements about crystal structures that require some sort of base level knowledge of chemistry or physics or math (i.e. symmetry concepts) in order to fully comprehend a particular passage, but that's what you get from an Ivy League PhD-er! I believe this text was designed for the third year student who should already have taken 1 semester each of at least chemistry and calculus. Although calculus isn't necessary for the class, it presupposes that you know and understand some basic conceptual geometry.I would suggest reading some basic introduction to mineralogy websites before tackling this book. Also, I have found that for the conscientious mineralogy students who possess a \\"more refined\\" reading level and who are putting genuine effort into the class, this book is a valuable edition. Other texts simply do not cover as much material as found here, such as x-ray diffraction and optics. Overall meant for students and not the self-taught, although that depends on the individual, but in general I would not recommend this for the beginner who wants to learn on his/her own. Still, a great text.

The book might be considered a 'Mineralogy 101' and has been a very good textbook to introduce the science to my budding mineralogist. Not really having the same interest, I wouldn't be able to tell you if the book would be a good reference for someone already familiar with mineralogy. The things my nephew likes best is it filled in gaps of his knowledge of crystalline structures & how they form & how the formations affect what you do with them (faceting).

The author started this book when she realized she had too many supplies and since she almost broke the bank buying more (that she didn't need) she decided to challenge herself. Every scrapbook layout she made, she had to do only with the supplies she had on hand. Im sure this proved difficult, I know when Im scraping a page I'll run right out to the store cause I just NEED a sheet of vellum or something rediculous like that. In this book Erin teaches you to improvise and use other things around your house that you wouldn't normally use. She even goes into instruction of more common scrapbooking techniques as well, so you see there is always something to learn as a beginner or as someone looking to expand their horizons.I just wanted to say this to be helpful to others, and it is in no way slamming this book or the author. Seeing the ad for this book in Creating Keepsakes Magazine I was under the impression from the example layout that this book would be about incorporating larger objects into your layout. The ad shows a layout with real chop sticks as an embellishment, by reading the blurb about the book and seeing this picture, I was led to believe that this book would show me how to use those kind of supplies in my layout. Semi-large, semi-bulky items, were my thought, and how to integrete them into the layout. I am not disappointed with what I found in 'Supply Savvy', in fact I was pleasantly suprised. Instead of large objects in layouts, she teaches you how to use something you would find in your kitchen drawer, or tool box to form a design. Instead of buying patterned 12X12's, you can create your own pattern with sponges, and stamps. Instead of buying add on embelishments she shows you how to make your own with cardstock.I hope you all enjoy this beautiful book as much as I did. Not only do you learn a lot, but Erin's example layouts from her own personal work will inspire you!"},{"Title":"Supply Savvy for Scrapbooking","review":"If you are like me, you don't want to start a page until you have the \\"perfect\\" supplies.

They were in Germany until late 1938. While there, Nora wrote Reaching for the Stars - her observations of the German people, Hitler and life during the rise of Nazism.During the war, she lived in London where her home served as a temporary half-way house for children the underground smuggled out of Germany, Norway and Czechoslovika. After the war she went back to Germany as a correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly. In 1946 she did a speaking tour to 60 cities in the US and Canada to raise money for relief efforts and encourage members of her sority, Kappa Kappa Gamma, to make layettes she promised for the babies of Norway. These parents did not even have newspaper to cloth their children.I learned of Nora Waln when I was a child because Kappas gathered around a ping pong table in my mother's basement to sew nightgowns, booties, hats, blankets and other items for these layettes. 5,000 layettes (each layette made up of 70 items) were delivered to Norway the following year.If you liked House of Exile, you may want to try Reaching for the Stars.

So, judging from a beginner's point of view, the &quot;object-oriented programming&quot; chapter is very clear and concise, right to the point. The &quot;Objective-C primer&quot; chapter might need a little bit more work. For a C/C++/Java programmer, it should be easy to read, but it lacks some essential information on some of the syntax.From an experienced programmer's point of view, this book is too basic although it does give you a good introduction on how to use the tools.The whole book is pretty much a tutorial. Personally, I think the step-by-step instruction is just way too much. The instructions are usually duplicated in a lot of chapters.

While these &quot;tutorials&quot; provide no real room for guided independent development, they do have some worth for learning good Cocoa development procedures and for getting in to the habit of writing Cocoa code.All in all, Learning Cocoa didn't advance my knowledge very far, and I don't see myself counting on it as a reference at any point in the future.

It is very helpful if you have experience with makefiles and the GNU cc, linker and GDB.That said, I think that a beginners can write quite astounding programs in a short time with just the book and the knowledge of C programming and data structures.My experience was that this book was an easy read BUT I have about 20 years of C programing (more in other languages) and extensive experience with Think C and code warrior and their frameworks. I am very competent in Unix programming.One reviewer complained that most of the book can be found on-line. This is partly true but you have to look in a lot of places to find it AND the flow and introduction of subjects makes reading the book that much easier. You will need this material in any case since it presents the meat to support this books intro.

The palettes have been rearranged, and some of the interface elements are different. For example, the book directs one to click on the &quot;electrical outlet&quot; icon next to the class name.

I could hardly wait until the day it arrived. But not long afterwards did I realize that this book is one of the biggest disappoints in programming guides I have ever experienced. You can obviously tell that a single person did not work exclusively on this book. Several chapters are in different writing styles... --And the book contained a couple of chapters I had previously downloaded from Apple's site!This book did little for me in advancing my knowledge of Cocoa and Objective C. It is probably and excellent book for someone coming from the NextStep/OpenStep world, but not for someong new to Mac OS X and Objective C. I found the book unorganized with the subject matter presented in an awkward flow. I am a just becoming exposed to Mac OS X Cocoa programming, but am not by any means an inexperienced professional programmer.Perhaps a more appropriate title should have been, &quot;Cocoa - A Primer For Experienced NextStep/OpenStep Programmers&quot;.And what's with the lame Hello World program you first develop? You write a program to print a message to the debug log in the Project Builder environment. That's a program?And what about packaging your applications, creating icons, and whole other slew of potpurri and developmental aspects? These are just about completely ignored.This book is better than nothing... --but not by much.I hope an individual author (OUTSIDE OF APPLE!) writes a book on Cocoa soon.

Quite literally this is a bunch of documentation you can download from Apple's site bound in a book. Yes, you do learn something, but the ratio of useful information to &quot;type in the program&quot; is awful and it's very dry reading.Try the Aaron Hillegass book, or the new O'Reilly &quot;Building Cocoa Applications&quot; if you want a useful title on programming Cocoa. I see there's a second edition of this book due in September 2002 - hopefully this'll either pep up the existing content, or add something more (published paper documentation for the Cocoa frameworks is non-existent, probably because some of the on-line documentation I've looked at still has big gaping holes in it - and people wonder why Carbonized apps outnumber those that use Cocoa...)"},{"Title":"Learning Cocoa","review":"I found learning Cocoa to be a good read and I found it easy to understand the concepts covered. Particularly useful is how it covers the integration between project builder and interface builder. Something totally alien.It gives enough to whet the appetite but unfortunately not enough to fulfill it. Hopefully it will be followed up with an Advanced Cocoa volume. However this doesn't detract from the book since it is only a beginners guide. It is careful to show some useful examples without trying to cram too much in."},{"Title":"Learning Cocoa","review":"There are quite a few high points to this book which make it a worthwhile introduction to using Cocao to program for Mac OS X. The overview of Objective C is complete enough for anyone coming from another language to grasp it quickly. The introduction to object oriented programming and the Apple developer tools is also rather well done for those who need refreshers or a place to start.The programming examples are all simple and clear, thoug building on one another towards the end of the book until you're typing quite a bit just to get through them. Skipping the examples isn't necessarily a good idea either, though early on I was able to do this farily effectively as they deal more with the concepts of how Cocoa is intended to be used than with any real deep material.The main down side of the book is that it is the best cure for insomnia I have ever encountered. Most O'Reilly titles are more engaging than this one is. The difference in authoring and editing by the people at Apple Computer is evident in the books ability to put anyone I've given it to right to sleep about halfway through any given chapter."},{"Title":"Learning Cocoa","review":"This book is a great start to the Cocoa API's and the Objective-C language.

The only thing I knock it for, is that it could have gone a tad farther in depth. I guess they are saving that for &quot;Programming Cocoa.&quot; If it follows the traditional Oriely naming scheme.

Sure I've picked up some C and C++ books, but even the O'Reilly publications on those languages weren't as clear on the foundations as this one. Perhaps it's the OS X development application that's so cool, but the book has empowered me to understand how to use it, and *more importantly* to feel comfortable exploring it. In the first seven chapters, I had a solid angle on how to construct a functional graphical application (try that, Java...which generally after seven chapters gets to &quot;Hello World&quot;; graphics are far far into the book). Objective C is a language I do not know, and the constructs are all new. With a good balance of learn-by-example and learn-by-definition, this book has certainly given me enough to go on for decent applications, and a great grounding for really learning Objective C should I choose to pursue it. Four stars because I really enjoy it. Minus One because it could be too complex for a total newbie (though do-able)."},{"Title":"Learning Cocoa","review":"This is the only computer book I have ever purchased whose pages began to fall out within hours of its arrival.

I have to confess that I was a bit disappointed.The cover art is outstanding - great colors, great imagery. Binding seems tight, edges are well-trimmed, but - and this is a big one - the type is so dotty that it looks like it was printed on a dot-matrix printer. It seriously impacted my enjoyment of the book.I don't know if Scrybe Press is doing their own printing in-house, or if they're contracting it out, but they need to see to the quality of the type.Sadly, this book is not so much a collection of short stories as it is a series of vignettes, some longer than others. Only one has any sort of internal resolution, and at least one is completely nonsensical, while another is an apparent excuse to write a sex scene.Story issues aside, Wedel's writing is pleasant and well-crafted, but those who aren't familiar with his other work may find themselves at a loss due to the disconnected narratives."},{"Title":"Call to the Hunt","review":"This captivating collection of stories leaves the reader well satisfied.

The steamy Kiss of the Wolf will certainly make us think twice before slipping away from a party with a stranger.My only complaint is that there were not more stories - I could read Wedel's work all day and never tire of it."},{"Title":"Call to the Hunt","review":"Fans of werewolf thrillers will want to howl with this strong twelve story compilation.

Seven of the contributions star Josef Ulrik, an interesting lycanthrope who steals the show even when the competition is the queen of howling Shara Wellington. For the most part the tales are serious with Sunday Dentistry more a tongue in cheek tale.

Jerome, Jean Shephard, and Monty Python. This books is so very English, though Mackinnon is Australian- it is told with love, warmth, wisdom, humanity, and with prose as crisp as Beaujolais and warm as old port. This is a very FUNNY book, but also life affirming without being pretentious. Once you start this book you will want to keep rowing through the pages as the author travels along the great rivers of Europe from Wales to Romania. This book is definitely a new classic, and ranks up there with The Saga of Cimba and Alone in the Caribbean as one of the three most evocative nautical travelogues ever written. A genuine treasure- and pleasure."},{"Title":"The Unlikely Voyage of Jack De Crow: A Mirror Odyssey from North Wales to the Black Sea","review":"Like the Author, once you start this journey it is difficult to stop. This book is very difficult to put down.As you breeze along the waterways and across seas with Sandy you find yourself saying \\"No! You can't? You won't? You shouldn't...\\" then you turn the page and he can, he will and he has; your eyes open wide and you read fervently onwards.After one crisis is over you are calmed back into the beautiful journey, bumbling along serenely and naively into the arms of the next demon waiting beyond the horizon.Whilst many of the literary quotes went over my head I found this a fantastically written story of eccentric daring-do with laugh-out-loud moments of extreme hilarity.A real, live \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" journey full of near-death experiences told as if they weren't and real life experiences told like it was.You have to read this book.Incidentally whilst not putting down this book at 1 am, high up in the Taipei Hilton the other week I found my hotel bed shaking with laughter, when I stopped, the bed didn't and the contents of the min-bar spilled out onto the floor.

Not only is it hard to put down once begun, it is hard not to immediately restart once finished."},{"Title":"The Unlikely Voyage of Jack De Crow: A Mirror Odyssey from North Wales to the Black Sea","review":"By the time I'd reached page 20 I was hooked on Jack de Crow. Mackinnon's style is both charming and humorous. The very idea of setting sail in the river 'at the bottom of the oval' simply because he found a boat and becuase he could, is what we would all like to do but never actually get around to. Jack de Crow is the perfect antidote to the repetition and obligations of everyday life. When he reaches his target destination he decides to go to the next one, simply because it seems like a good idea - a good definition of real freedom.His journey through the canals of England are fascinating, particularly as he learns how to handle his tiny sail boat in such a restricted space. One of the best passages, I found, was after London. He decides to cross the Channel - in a Mirror dinghy! Is he mad?Once in Europe I found the narrative slowed and became occassionally repetitious; until he reaches Serbia. The ending I thought was a bit flat, but perhaps that was because I wanted Jack de Crow to keep sailing.MacKinnon's style reminds me of William Dalrymple's travel books, engaging, informative, adventurous, yet sufficiently plausible that the reader can identify with the author, and enjoy the ride in comfort.Geoffrey Lambert - author of \\"The Morozov Inheritance\\""},{"Title":"The Unlikely Voyage of Jack De Crow: A Mirror Odyssey from North Wales to the Black Sea","review":"Mackinnon's odyssey, traveling in an 11 foot sailing dinghy from Wales through rivers, streams, locks, canals, across the English Channel, and ultimately all the way to the Black Sea, is an unforgettable read. He's a very funny guy, and I laughed frequently as I read the book. His story is full of misadventures and mishaps, courage and determination, flexibility and improvisation, challenges and overcoming of obstacles. The author has wonderful encounters with people all along the way, most of them incredibly helpful, a few of them extraordinarily the opposite. It's a page turner, and I stayed up several nights till 2 or 3 in the morning, unable to put the book down. As soon as I finished it, my wife started it, with the same reaction. We bought 4 copies to give to friends on the next suitable occasion, and are contemplating buying more. I've read a lot of travel adventures, and this book is one of the best. The author has also illustrated the book with a number of hand drawn maps and illustrations of his boat and various events and scenes.

I did not want to put it down, and I was sorry when I turned the last page and realised there would be no more. End of story.But what a story. A.J. (Sandy) Mackinnon, born in Australia, but with strong links to Britain, is teaching at a school in Shropshire, close to the Welsh border, when he decides that it is time to move on \\"not by the Inter-City 10.15 to Birmingham with a suitcase in each hand, not by a lift to the airport checking the whereabouts of my passport every three minutes....but like dear Doctor Doolittle, by sailing away in a jolly little galleon and seeing what I bumped into on the way.\\"The \\"jolly little galleon\\" was in fact a Mirror dinghy called Jack de Crow after a pet jackdaw, long since departed, which had in turn taken its name from the school's headmaster. Initially planning to take Jack down various canals and minor rivers to Gloucester near the mouth of the River Severn, Mackinnon just decides to keep going, cutting back across Britain to the Thames, then across the English Channel to France, Germany and through the heart of Europe and eventually to the Black Sea - 4900 kilometres in a tiny vessel more suited to a sunny afternoon on Lake Burley Griffin.And what an adventure it was. Hardly ever out of sight of land he nevertheless encounters a succession of obstacles including obstructive lock keepers, stifling bureaucracy, drunken revellers, a burgeoning Balkan war and Danube River pirates. Forced to strip off and swim out to a wayward Jack swept downstream by floodwater on the River Vyrnwy in Shropshire he inevitably encounters a party of female canoeists as he is rowing back to his camp site with nothing but a trusty pith helmet (an essential part of his equipment until it is stolen somewhere in Germany) to cover his modesty.Mackinnon is without doubt an eccentric and while the British are known for their love of them, the Europeans also embrace him. He is fortified by a throng of friends and acquaintances along the way, but several times damage which could easily have ended his voyage is repaired, usually without cost, by kindly strangers bemused and intrigued by this intrepid adventurer. Many times, wet, miserable, and in Serbia penniless and starving, he admits he is on the point of quitting, yet the new day somehow recharges his enthusiasm often simply by finding a warm, dry Laundromat where he can wash his clothes and write letters.\\"An astonishing question kept insisting: why wasn't everyone doing exactly as I was? For there was no doubt about it: this was the most perfect occupation known to humankind.\\"The story is aided by its author being not just an adventurer, but an artist, philosopher and keen observer of the world around him. Details of birds in flight, the plants and animals of the riverbank work their way into his narrative, often with appropriate extracts from the great nature poets, Masefield, Keats, Wordsworth and so on. Anyone with an education that predates the computer age will delight in the classical references and there are moments in the journey painted so vividly one is almost inside the writer's head, sharing his experience completely.One of my favourite passages among many comes as he is struggling to take Jack through London on the Thames at night and (illegally) without lights. Desperately dodging party boats and giant barges which had no hope of seeing him in the darkness he still has time to observe the Houses of Parliament, towering above him.\\"As I passed, one youngish-looking man came to the window and stood staring out beyond the glass into the darkness over the Thames. He rested his forehead for a moment against the cool glass. He looked tired and a little glum, I thought, as though he longed to be away from that lit room, its secretes and its linenfold panelling. Perhaps he longed to be in a small sailing dinghy off to foreign parts on an outgoing tide under the stars.\\"Finally, I will commend this book for its illustrations, drawn by the author, which add greatly to the gentle humour of the narrative. Sandy Mackinnon is now on the staff of Geelong Grammar at its Timbertop campus in Australia. His students are fortunate to have such a teacher."},{"Title":"The Unlikely Voyage of Jack De Crow: A Mirror Odyssey from North Wales to the Black Sea","review":"A. J.

J. Mackinnon has gone and done it and written it all up for us. Heck, maybe it might motivate you enough to have a go at it one day. Certainly A. J.

Along the way, Sandy sporting a pithe helmet to protect his head from swinging booms, low hanging branches and various other protudenances, meets all sorts of people most of whom are kindness in itself.

Although his voyage involves many privations and even humiliations, he is always optimistic, happy, and carefree--well, almost always. Mackinnon's joy and love of adventure, people, and the outdoors is highly infectious. No one will come away from reading this book with anything less than a lighter heart and a brighter outlook on life and its tribulations. Jack de Crow is witty, entertaining, and edifying. It is one of the best sailing adventure books that I have ever read and I have read very many. I highly recommend this book to every reader whether or not you are a sailor or boater. You don't need to know anything about boats or sailing to fully enjoy this wonderful book.I have one important and heavy dissatisfaction with the book that I must air. I almost broke ranks and would have been the first reviewer to give it fewer than five stars. Mackinnon from start to finish depends on the kindness of strangers to get him through tough spots. His journey, and even his life, is saved several times by other boaters or people along the shore who give him shelter, a tow, make repairs for him, etc. etc. He simply would not have gotten more than a few miles on his own. Of course, this is part, and a central part, of the whole story and journey--trusting to your luck and to the unanticipated and unpaid assistance of strangers. Mackinnon is basically a good natured and kind hearted screw-up. He really doesn't know what he is doing or how to do it, but goes on anyway. Well this makes for a good story as Mackinnon recognizes--no screw-ups, no stories.But I favor a tradition that values self-reliance at least in things nautical. A watery voyage requires proper craft, charts, equipment in good order, and the ability to navigate and conduct the voyage on one's own. The only excuse for seeking or accepting help from others is dire and unavoidable life-threatening emergency. Mackinnon violates these basic principles of boating, often to his peril, sometimes to the peril of others. I cannot respect this. I believe that Mackinnon should not have made this voyage, that he was morally irresponsible, and that despite the wonderful book that resulted, the overall effect may be detrimental.One other minor problem with the book is that readers should be aware that there are many many references to English children's literature and other works that are obscure and will not be familiar, and there are no notes or explanations. This comes off as a bit pretentious and puzzling and somewhat diminished my enjoyment of Jack de Crow.Sometimes Mackinnon can be insensitive. He glows over the beauty and wealth of Vienna--Europe's greatest city (his description). Mackinnon describes with excessive enthusiasm Vienna's glorious history, but never mentions the most important event in Vienna's history--the anything but glorious Kristallnacht. I quote from Wikipedia: \\"Events in Austria were no less horrendous. Of the entire Kristallnacht only the pogrom in Vienna was completely successful. Most of Vienna's 94 synagogues and prayer-houses were partially or totally destroyed. People were subjected to all manner of humiliations, including being forced to scrub the pavements whilst being tormented by their fellow Austrians, some of whom had been their friends and neighbours.\\" I find it hard to share his insensitive enthusiasm for Vienna.But in the end I suppose that Mackinnon is some sort of genius, a genuine free spirit, and true eccentric and cannot be held to the same standards as the rest of us."},{"Title":"The Unlikely Voyage of Jack De Crow: A Mirror Odyssey from North Wales to the Black Sea","review":"I read this book while on a multi day fishing trip in my small boat.

I loved the description of the journey from small streams in the north to the tidal rivers of the south and the crossing over to France. It all rings true to my own much more limited experience of rivers and canals in small rowing boats and canoes. But this man is much more capable than you might think from a superficial reading of the book - I know this because I'm on my third reading and have no intention of leaving it there.The only other book I've loved this much is Riddle of the Sands by Erskine Childers, in some ways the complete opposite of this book where the main character convincingly describes the skill and expertise of Davies, the owner of the small yacht Dulcibella. A J Mackinnon as a single-hander must write of his own journey himself, so to preserve modesty and to entertain the reader he presents himself as a bumbling amateur with little idea of how to row, sail or maintain his eleven foot boat, but he still gets to the Black Sea by way of rivers and canals that would challenge any experienced sailor. His self-deprecation mightn't fool me but I'm left feeling even more impressed by the journey he describes so well."},{"Title":"The Unlikely Voyage of Jack De Crow: A Mirror Odyssey from North Wales to the Black Sea","review":"A friend shared this book with me, hoping I'd enjoy it as much as he did.

It is the story of an Australian schoolteacher who finished a stint in an English private school and decided to travel by boat through some of the inland waterway systems of England. The trip was meant to take just a couple of weeks but the author, Sandy Mackinnon, was enjoying the challenges and successes so much that he just continued rowing and sailing in a small 11 foot Mirror class dingy. Weeks turned into months as he kept extending his trip. After navigating down to the River Severn he found his way down the Thames to London and, after a break, on to Dover, then, remarkably, across the English Channel in an amazing and risky solo effort and on into the canals and waterways of Europe.McKinnon is a teacher of English literature and drama and so was well-equipped to tell the story and illustrate it with delightfully chosen literary references. He also does a nice line in sketching and is the author of the book's more-than-capable illustrations.I read it with UK and Europe maps beside me, which added to the fun. Next time I will try Google Earth.It is so easy to get swept along with the narrative and the helpful characters he meets that you could find yourself finishing this book very quickly.

Sandy MacKinnon set out in a Mirror dinghy, thinking he just might be able to reach the channel.. and ended up in Eastern Europe!Beside being a great adventurer, MacKinnon is a first-rate storyteller. He paints a vivid image of his adventures large and small, whether he's crossing the English Channel in his tiny open craft, or simply trying to navigate the shallow rivers that mad up a good part of his early journey. He has a knack for putting the reader into the boat with him, sharing his trials and triumphs alike.If you own a small boat, have ever thought of owning a small boat, or if you're a fan of Swallows and Amazons, or even The Wind in the Willows, you'll love Sandy MacKinnon's real life adventure.

As an example of the above, in its chapter on Islamic pronouncements on sexual affairs, it reports and comments on the matter in an extensive way, with a most dispassionate scholasticism, especially regarding the prophet's sexuality and preferences. In doing that, it is doing something rare, yet utterly needing doing: That the man himself, whatever else he may have been, was also merely a human being, subject to human characteristics, not the unreachable, glittering, profound, glorious symbol of utterly complete perfection &quot;for all times and all men&quot; that Muslims have made him out to be, with such fierce conviction. Of course, the truth of the matter is that most Muslims themselves privately laugh at and violate such notions without a second thought in the conduct of their daily lives, especially nowadays; the reasons for the strong public/social presence of such notions is more deep and sinister, having more to do with the social nature of these people, and their treatment towards each other."},{"Title":"Geographic Information Systems: A Management Perspective","review":"Aronoff text is a must for anyone interested in the subject of GIS.

It deals with the most fundamental question of experimental science: how do we assign plausibility based on data? What if we have very little data?

Also included are examples of applications, and places where Jaynes leaves the door open to further development. After all, this field is far from complete.This book is a manifesto.

Such a sense is not misplaced here."},{"Title":"Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (Vol 1)","review":"This is a great book. Getting it all together is well worth the price. Jaynes is always a joy to read, polemical and opinionated as he is. One of the very few writers who can put drama into the dry subject of statistics. This is a book about the subject of statistics, rather than a statistics book, with a lot of critical thought and criticism of other statisticians, and statistical paradoxes. It's not, however, the book to choose if you just want another text to help you pass your stats course as its more about the why rather than the how of statistical thinking and logic."},{"Title":"Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (Vol 1)","review":"I have rarely learned so much from one book. This book is somewhat unusual among mathematical texts in that it is heavy on prose and (compared to other texts) light on equations. However, don't get the idea that it is any less rigorous! It simply focuses on precisely what most math books neglect: exhaustive explanation of the concepts...and to very good effect. Jaynes (and his editor) are possibly the most articulate writers of mathematics I've ever read. If you can read equations like English, you may not appreciate this. The rest of us will.Summarizing the content: The book very exhaustively demonstrates how Bayesian statistical approaches subsume rather than compete with \\"orthodox\\" (sampling theory-derived) statistics. Importantly, it begins by deriving the sum and product rules (which in other texts are typically presented as axioms) from \\"common sense\\" considerations. In other words, what is usually treated as \\"given\\" in other statistics texts is shown to, in fact, depend on even more fundamental (and, thus, indisputable) considerations of what constitutes rational plausible reasoning. This places the whole endeavor of statistics on firmer ground than any other text I've seen. The book is worth buying for the first few chapters alone, but it just gets better from there.Jaynes goes on to link Bayes rule to information-theoretic considerations and build up probability as an extended form of logic (as the title implies). In some cases this yields a new and deeper understanding of \\"orthodox statistical practice.\\" In others it exposes (and explains) the absurdities of strictly frequentist approaches. Again, I have rarely learned so much from one book.One caveat: It does not at all require a statistics background, but, obviously, some of Jaynes (mildly polemical) discourse will, of course, be lost on you without it."},{"Title":"Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (Vol 1)","review":"This is a refreshingly unique book about logical and statistical inference.

You're going to be that much smarter.Thank you ET Jaynes for finally providing a satisfactory theory of conditional probability. Now I finally can kick all the heavy-baggage measure theory definitions into the bin, which on the one hand are useless for an engineer as you don't want to carry around the sigma-field formalism for each new problem you're working on, but on the other hand you feel helpless to apply probability calculus without it because it's the only formal definition of conditional probability (unless you consider the tautological P(A|B) := P(AB)/P(B) a foundation..)Thank you for ridding me of the frequentist viewpoint, which other Bayesian books have not achieved because their theory was flawed as well.Everything is falling into place now.

Even something seemingly simple such as a toss of an ordinary coin cannot have some objectively fixed frequency unless concepts such as \\"toss\\" are specified in unreasonable detail. What we think of as randomness is best thought of as a procedure for generating results of which we are ignorant.He derives his methods from a few simple axioms which appear close to common sense, and don't look much like they are specifically designed to produce statistical rules.He is careful to advocate Bayesian methods for an idealized robot, and avoids addressing questions of whether fallible humans should sometimes do something else. In particular, his axiom that the robot should never ignore information is a goal that will probably reduce the quality of human reasoning in some cases where there's too much information for humans to handle well.I'm convinced that when his methods can be properly applied and produce different results than frequentist methods do, we should reject the frequentist results. But it's not obvious how easy it is to apply his methods properly, nor is it obvious whether he has accurately represented the beliefs of frequentists (who I suspect often don't think clearly enough about the issues he raises to be clearly pinned down).He does a good job of clarifying the concept of \\"induction\\", showing that we shouldn't try to make it refer to some simple and clearly specified rule, but rather we should think of it as a large set of rules for logical reasoning, much like the concept of \\"science\\"."},{"Title":"Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (Vol 1)","review":"This is the most insightful book on probabilities I know. It goes far beyond any other exposition (frequentist or measure theoretic) and it is the road for using probabilities in decision/game theory, mathephysics or statistics. The author presents probability as inference logic. His exposition is COMPLETE, i.e., both fundamentals and applications.WHY is important? There are many reasons all explained in the text. My angle for its importance starts by recognising that probability as logic means that the former now becomes discrete mathematics. So (i) one circumvents the CIRCULAR definition of probability via frequencies in ...random experiments, (ii) one does not need to wait until analysis and measure theory to see stochastics as Kolmogorov theory. This solves an obvious puzzle: mathematical informatics (MI) appears very much a combination of Logic and Combinatorics (i.e., discrete mathematics) yet it is based on the concept of information (entropy) that needs a theory of probability. If only the Kolmogorov one is available an obvious conceptual problem appears. Following the author however, one defines directly information as logic and they are free thereon to use the notion in the various MI branches(databases, computing, communication etc). The author performs in this way a great contribution to the roots of mathematical thought. I also see lots of space for applying his point of view to the interpretation of quantum mechanics and probabilities.Finally, I share very much the author's comments on the disastreous effects of the Bourbaki point of view on the health of mathematics as a science and perhaps even more as a profession. This does not mean that Bourbaki point of view is not a significant point of view within maths. It only means that it ought to be (in my opinion) only a flavour of mathematical research (and not even its most important).A really gifted point of view of probability and information, not to be missed."},{"Title":"Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (Vol 1)","review":"I read the draft of this book before its publication, which was freely available online at that time.

Therein, it is a more valuable work that will surely influence Bayesian theory.[3] Bayesian inference in theoretical physics may enlighten mathematicians as to a wider and deeper understanding of Bayesianism."},{"Title":"Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (Vol 1)","review":"Jaynes has done a brilliant job of constructing a logical framework for incorporating and explicating the crucial differences between causal(physical)independence and logical(epistemological)independence that will enter into the assumptions underlying applications of the probability calculus(statistical inference)to scientific analysis in physical science(physics,engineering,chemistry,biology,etc.).Jaynes shows repeatedly how one goes about applying maximum entropy and/or Shannon's information approach to a host of problems in the physical sciences.Jaynes also incorporates valuable historical commentary on a host of individuals,from Laplace and Boole to Keynes,Ramsey,Fisher,Neyman and Pearson,Jeffreys,Savage,etc.For instance,on pp.564-65,he corrects the mythology and misdirected criticism directed at Laplace's calculation of the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow,given that it has already risen a certain number of times before,using the rule of succession.Laplace made it clear that he was not using any of the extensive ,relevant background knowledge ,available a priori, in his calculations.Thus,relative to the evidence specified only,there is nothing incorrect about the answer arrived at by Laplace.Jaynes,however, needed to add some chapters that would deal explicitly with social science and liberal arts,as well as disciplines like education,educational psychology,economics and business.I will spend the rest of the review commenting on the broader aspects of the work of John Maynard Keynes and Benoit Mandelbrot that Jaynes has appeared to have overlooked.First,Keynes intended that his interval estimate approach to probability,based on partial orders that do not satisfy the assumption of a sigma algebra,was applicable to all areas of life.Thus,Keynes obtains a general theory that is applicable everywhere.Nothing written by Keynes in the A Treatise on Probability(1921) contradicts the work of Jeffreys or Jaynes since the specific areas of science that Jeffreys and Jaynes seek to apply a logical approach to probability to satisfy the conditions need to specify a continuous mapping of the real numbers into each other.Single number probabilities under such a mapping require that a sigma algebra be specified in order to calculate the appropriate sums of unions and intersections.The basic data of physical and life science(molecules,cells,genes,chromosomes,atomic and subatomic partcles,electrons,etc.)is generally independent ,homogeneous, and invariant through time.When one turns to the other fields mentioned above,this is not the case.Keynes complemented his interval approximation approach to decision making by systematically constucting a conventional coefficient of risk and weight,c, that is able to deal with the nonlinear types of effects generated by the type of data available in the social sciences.Keynes's c coefficient equals p/(1+q)[2w/(1+w)].Define A to be an outcome.The decision maker maximizes cA,as opposed to the expected value rule,maximize pA or the expected utility rule,maximize pU(A),where U is a utility function and p is a probability(p+q=1).w represents the weight of the evidence.It measures the completeness of the actual and potential available ,relevant evidence upon which an estimate of probability will be based.It is an index that is normalized on the unit interval,0&lt;=w&lt;=1.Keynes's approach explains and gives solutions for all of the socalled paradoxes of decision theory.I now turn to the theoretical and empirical work of Benoit Mandelbrot.Based on a massive amount of data analysis from a number of different countries drawn from a number of different financial markets(cotton,commodity,stock,money,currency,bond),Mandelbrot has shown empirically that price movements in these markets demonstrate both long and short run dependence and discontinuity over time.Mandelbrot has incorporated variables representing these effects along with variables representing skewness and kurtosis into a generalized model that simplifies under special conditions to the normal distribution .Unfortunately,it is the normal probability distribution(and its relatives,the t,F,and chi square)that is used practically everywhere in the social sciences.Jaynes discussion of turbulence effects in his two page discourse on economics(7.21,pp.233-234)is suggestive that he also is somewhat aware that a different approach to analyzing social data that is nonhomogeneous and subject to abrupt and discontinuous change over time is needed in the social sciences."},{"Title":"Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (Vol 1)","review":"Reading this book is an exhilarating intellectual adventure. I found that it shed light on many mysteries and answered questions that had long troubled me. It contains the clearest exposition of the fundamentals of probability theory that I have ever encountered, and its chatty style is a pleasure to read. Jaynes the teacher collaborates fully with Jaynes the scientist in this book, and at times you feel as if the author is standing before you at the blackboard, chalk in hand, giving you a private lesson. Jaynes's advice on avoiding errors in the application of probability theory -- reinforced in many examples throughout the book -- is by itself well worth the price of the book.If you deal at all with probability theory, statistics, data analysis, pattern recognition, automated diagnosis -- in short, any form of reasoning from inconclusive or uncertain information -- you need to read this book. It will give you new perspectives on these problems.The downside to the book is that Jaynes died before he had a chance to finish it, and the editor, although capable and qualified to fill in the missing pieces, was understandably unwilling to inject himself into Jaynes's book. One result is that the quality of exposition suffers in some of the later chapters; furthermore, the author is not in a position to issue errata to correct various minor errors. Volunteer efforts are underway to remedy these problems -- those who buy the book may want to visit the &quot;Unofficial Errata and Commentary&quot; website for it, or check out the etjaynesstudy mailing list at Yahoo groups."},{"Title":"Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (Vol 1)","review":"This book has been on the web in unfinished form for a number of years and has shaped my scientific thinking more than any other book. I believe it constitutes one of the most important scientific texts of the last hundred years. It convincingly shows that &quot;statistics&quot;, &quot;statistical inference&quot;, &quot;Bayesian inference&quot;, &quot;probability theory&quot;, &quot;maximum entropy methods&quot; , and &quot;statistical mechanics&quot; are all parts of a large coherent theory that is the unique consistent extension of logic to propositions that have degrees of plausibility attached to them. This is already a theoretical accomplishment of epic proportions. But in addition, the book shows how one actually solves real world problems within this frame work, and in doing so shows what a vastly wider array of problems is addressable within this frame work than in any of the forementioned particular fields.If you work in any field where on needs to &quot;reason with incomplete information&quot; this book is invaluable.As others have already mentioned, Jaynes never finished this book. The editor decided to &quot;fill in&quot; the missing parts by putting excercises that, when finished by the reader, provide what (so the editor guesses) Jaynes left out. I find this solution a bit disappointing. The excercises don't take away the impression that holes are left in the text. It would have been better if the editor had written the missing parts and then printed those in different font so as to indicate that these parts were not written by Jaynes. Better still would have been if the editor had invited researchers that are intimately familiar with Jaynes' work and the topic of each of the missing pieces to submit text for the missing pieces. The editor could then have chosen from these to provide a &quot;best guess&quot; for what Jaynes might have written.Finally, there is the issue of Jaynes' writing style. This is of course largely a matter of taste. I personally like his writing style very much because it is clear, and not as stifly formal as most science texts. However, some readers may find his style too belligerent and polemic."},{"Title":"Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (Vol 1)","review":"From a few common sense requirements, the books starts by deriving basic results such as the product and sum rules, for probabilities defined not in terms of frequencies, but as degrees of plausibility. This was an eye-opener for me, having imbibed the common attitude that such probabilities are 'subjective' and, implicitly, lacking rigor and utility.Jaynes' knowledge of the history and philosophy of statistics is far deeper than that of most statisticians (including myself). His trenchant style gives the book a narrative drive and cover-to-cover readability that, in my experience, is unique in the field. One such strand is the continual battle between his respect for RA Fisher's abilities, and his exasperation at how wrongheadedly he feels they were channelled. And he doesn't hesitate to take on philosophical heavyweights such as Hume in defending the possibility - - in fact, the necessity - - of inductive inference. However, this style also produces some more bitter fruit, such as the way the author repeatedly likens himself to historical victims of religious persecution.The book weakens when it turns to applications. Regression with errors in both variables is said to be 'the most common problem of inference faced by experimental scientists' who have 'searched the statistical literature in vain for help on this'. Good points. So why don't the author and editor give us at least a reference for just one of the 'correct solutions' which 'adapt effortlessly' to scientists' needs? And Jaynes' argument that the null hypothesis procedure 'saws off its own limb' would also rule out mathematical proof by reductio ad absurdum.When estimating periodicities, we're told that 'the eyeball is a more reliable indicator of an effect than an orthodox equal-tails test'. So why not show us the data of the example used, to let us use our eyes? In fact, there's only one graph of empirical data in all the book's 600+ pages.Several convincing arguments are presented for the use of the Jeffreys (reciprocal) prior for scale parameters, including scale independence. However, just when I was ready to go and use it, there's a warning against the use of improper priors except as 'as a well-defined limit of a sequence of proper priors'. A few pages later a uniform prior is used for the mean of a Gaussian, with no such justification as a limit, which makes it far from clear what exactly is being recommended.I could give a lot more space to the book's many other insights, and several other annoyances. Instead, I'll finish now by recommending it to anyone interested in the foundations and practice of statistical analysis."},{"Title":"Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (Vol 1)","review":"First off, I can in good conscience only recommend this book to experts who already have a deep understanding of both Bayesian and frequentist probability theory. The most useful function of this book is to illuminate puzzling features of probability theory that niggle at the minds of experts. If you don't already understand the subject at a fairly deep level, Jaynes will only leave you confused. (I could not imagine the torment of someone trying to learn probability and statistics for the first time from this book!)Expect little in the way of examples or practical solutions here. Jaynes is concerned more with fundamentals and philosophy. Phil Gregory's textbook, although overly fond of Mathematica, is a better intro to practical applications. What examples there are tend to be highly idealized, with a high amount of tedious calculation.Jaynes died with his book in an unfinished state. What he needed was an editor, but what he got instead was a hagiographer. Rather than inject himself into Jaynes' work, the editor instead has left all of the flaws, incomplete explanations, and many out-and-out mistakes in place. This was a bad mistake. Too many important points are left as exercises to the reader.Jaynes himself is highly infuriating on a number of points. He repeatedly argues for a Haldane prior as a non-informative prior for a binomial distribution, but doesn't come to grips with the fact that this improper prior gives absurd results in some limits, whereas the more commonly used and more robust Jeffreys prior is ignored. Jeffreys priors themselves are scarcely mentioned in most places, while discussion of how to apply KL information measures to construct non-informative priors is completely missing. Jaynes' commentary on the state of quantum mechanics will strike most physicists as misguided as at best.I find it ironic that I have mostly negative things to say about a book that I rank at 4 out of 5. The trouble is that this could have been the greatest single book ever written on the subject if it only had better editing, fewer polemics, and a more practical bent. I find myself mourning for what this book could have been. What it actually is, however, is a great probability text from a Bayesian perspective. It contains many gems, but you have to wade through a lot to find them."},{"Title":"Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (Vol 1)","review":"I read this book before it was published; I downloaded it from a WU website. It has been of immense use to me in my career, it is a very practical book. Other reviews that say Dr. Jaynes' ideas are at odds with traditional measure theoretic probability are mistaken. Dr. Jaynes is a true Baysian. A Baysian is one who believes that probabilities do not model serendipity in nature, but do model subjective certainty. The Bayesian concept of probability is epistomological, i.e. the uncertainty is in our minds, not in objective reality. Traditional probability takes the reverse view: probabilities model unpredictable events, they are a model of objective reality like any science, i.e. probabilities are ontological. The trick is to realize the two are not mutually exclusive! There can be true ontological randomness in nature, and our minds can have uncertainty from incomplete knowledge as well. Probability theory as a branch of mathematics makes no claim what it models. The beauty is that probabiltity distributions integrate the two seamlessly. Thus, it is perfectly valid to put a distribution on an unknown parameter, epistomologically unknown, and derive that distribution from an experiment with, presumably, ontological randomness. Dr. Jaynes' book is well worth reading for the many case studies he presents. His background as a physicist is key to understanding some of the esoteric philisophical points."},{"Title":"Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (Vol 1)","review":"OutlineThis book develops probability theory from first principles as an extension of deductive logic. In deductive logic, propositions can have only three possible truth values: true, false, and irremediable uncertainty. Therefore, the goal of the book is to describe a consistent extended logic that assigns real numbers to the plausibility of propositions. The requirements for such a system are derived from five simple desiderata, which serve as the postulates of this theory - and it turns out that *any* such system is equivalent to probability theory, to within a monotonic transformation.Probability theory is then developed through applications to problems which grow more and more complex. The author demonstrates its use in direct sampling problems and so-called inverse problems, aka Bayesian probability. He derives procedures for multiple hypothesis testing, parameter estimation, and significance testing, and shows that although there are close connections between probability and frequency of occurrence in a large number of trials, no probability is *simply* a frequency.Following this, the author presents solutions to the problem of assigning prior probabilities, and develops decision theory as an adjunct to probability theory. The author then compares and contrasts mainstream or \\"orthodox\\" statistical theory with probability theory as extended logic, and (perhaps unsurprisingly) finds severe deficiencies in the orthodox methods. The final chapters concern even more advanced applications.Math RequirementsReaders should be well versed in simple calculus and multivariate calculus; some familiarity with convolution integrals and finite combinatorics is also an asset, but not essential. In isolated places, the author uses or refers to the calculus of variations and the theory of function spaces (in this case Hilbert spaces); but lack of familiarity with these branches of mathematics will not seriously hamper the reader.Critical ReviewThis book represents a major step forward in the understanding of what probability theory is and how to use it. In particular, a lack of solutions to the problem of prior probabilities is the main reason that for the past 100 years, mainstream probability theory was taught as a theory of frequencies instead of as an extenstion of logic; therefore, having solutions to the problem of assigning priors in a textbook is a great step forward in the development of probability theory.The book is a pleasure to read, with a text-to-equation ratio that is uncharacteristically high for a textbook of probability theory. That is not to say that the equations are simplistic; on the contrary, solutions to quite challenging problems are presented. In addition, the author's polemics against orthodox theory are quite entertaining (and convincing); he wields an acerbic pen when describing the efforts of those who actively reject probability theory as extended logic.One negative feature of the book is its incompleteness: the author passed away before finishing the book, so occasionally large chunks of planned text are missing. The editor has cleverly mitigated this flaw by inserting \\"Editor's Problem Boxes\\", which challenge the reader to fill in the missing text. Still, as one reads the book, one gets the vaguely disquieting feeling that the author wanted to include much, much more information, but didn't have the chance."},{"Title":"Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (Vol 1)","review":"To \\"pure\\" mathematicians, probability theory is measure theory in spaces of measure 1. To the extent to which you remain a \\"pure\\" mathematician, this book will be incomprehensible to you.To frequentist statisticians, probability theory is the study of relative frequencies or of proportions of a population; those are \\"probabilities\\".To Bayesian statisticians, probability theory is the study of degrees of belief. Bayesians may assign probability 1/2 to the proposition that there was life on Mars a billion years ago; frequentists will not do that because they cannot say that there was life on Mars a billion years ago in precisely half of all cases -- there are no such \\"cases\\".To _subjective_ Bayesians, probability theory is about subjective degrees of belief. A subjective degree of belief is merely how sure you happen to be.\\"Noninformative\\" _objective_ Bayesians assign \\"noninformative\\" probability distributions when they deal with uncertain propositions or uncertain quantities, and replace them with \\"informative\\" distributions only when they update them because of \\"data\\". \\"Data\\", in this sense, consists of the outcomes of random experiments.\\"Informative\\" _objective_ Bayesians -- a rare species -- ask what degree of belief in an uncertain proposition is logically necessitated by whatever information one has, and they don't necessarily require that information to consist of outcomes of random experiments.Jaynes is an \\"informative\\" objective Bayesian. This book is his defense of that position and his account of how it is to be used.\\"Pure\\" mathematicians will not find that this book resembles that branch of \\"pure\\" mathematics that they call probability theory.Jaynes rails against those he disagrees with at great length. Often he is right. But often he simply misunderstands them. For example, writing in the 1990s, he said that pure mathematicians reject the use of Dirac's delta function and its derivatives, and related topics. That is nonsense; the delta function has long been considered highly respectable, and required material in the graduate curriculum. Unfortunately Jaynes's misunderstandings may cause some others to misunderstand him when he is right. Statisticians are more informed than \\"pure\\" mathematicians and will disagree with Jaynes for better reasons. _Some_ statisticians will agree with him.Jaynes has many flaws, made all the more annoying by the fact that we need to overlook them in order to understand him. His message is important."},{"Title":"Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (Vol 1)","review":"Beginning with three simple reasoning desiderata, Jaynes derives two theorems from which the whole of probability theory as the logic of plausible reasoning is inferred. Deductive, Aristotlean logic, it turns out, is but a theoretical by-product affirming logical certainty. If you're drowning in a flood of epistomelogical doubt concerning the foundations of probability theory, specifically, or inductive reasoning in general, and wish for a cogent, literate account of both, this book is for you. Examples abound, including an analysis of Bertrand's paradox. The text is lively and engaging throughout. Jaynes has poured over 30 years of thought into this work, a masterpiece of clear thinking that interprets probability as a measure of our imperfect information about the world. This book is for truth seekers, mathematicians, scientists, and open-minded philosophers of science and mathematics ready to sort through the facts rather that make a-priori pronouncements about reality. The author's warnings regarding the mind projection fallacy and the paradoxes associated with infinite point sets alone is worth the cost of this extroadinary work."},{"Title":"Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (Vol 1)","review":"I've never seen another book like this. Jaynes definitely has an agenda, but he justifies his viewpoint through an amazingly deep tour of probability theory. Not every viewpoint he expresses is convincing (such as his view that quantum theory is inherently probabilistic only because physicists are lazy), but he always raises deep and interesting questions while teaching the ideas. If you can read a book and accept some but not all of its viewpoint, then this is the book on probability for you."},{"Title":"Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (Vol 1)","review":"Jaynes' work on probability has inspired many students and academics over the years. Jaynes advocates probability as a degree of belief. In the first two chapters he refers to the two axioms of Robert Cox relating probability to plausible reasoning and comments on \\"subjective\\" vs. \\"objective\\" reasoning. He moves on to discuss many aspects of classical statistics such as hyptohesis testing and parameter estimation from a Bayesian view. He also presents his famous work on prior probabilities and builds on Shannon's entropy definition to present the maximum entropy principle. A lot of people have been waiting for this book to be published.It should be on the bookshelf of every person who deals with probability."},{"Title":"Windows 98 Networking","review":"Useful both to the novice and the network administrator, this book is a no-nonsense guide that eliminates the technical jargon that only an electrical engineer would find useful in the real world.

Wrox is really onto something with it's handbook series. It's what I've always looked for: a complete book on one subject that is all meat and no bones.In fact, I used to learn various programming techniques from Wrox's \\"Programmers Reference\\" series for this very reason: all meat, no bones.It's great having a book that doesn't spend hours explaining things the I already know and that gives me everything I need to know about the topic at hand. I've noticed on Amazon that there are several other books that fall into the Handbook series that are due out this year. I'm looking forward to them also.While this book would be good for the beginner, I found it great for the Intermediate programmer looking to understand all of the power of string handling new to .NET. In fact, this book starts of with a great, highly technical discussion on how .NET and other platforms handle strings. This discussion isn't used heavily through out the rest of book but makes for better programming practices and good geeky water-cooler discussions.From there, it's all very practical. The book explains just enough to make everything clear and avoids the all-too-common over-explaining that is a downfall of most computer books. I found myself re-reading the odd page 3 or 4 times to get the concept through my head. I would far rather do that then read a book that makes me want to pass out from boredom due to the massive over-explanation.Plus different programmers might re-read different pages due to different understandings. Believe me, it's all there and it's all presented well. And since the book is only, like, 230 pages long (plus the Appendices), it's awesome. It covers as much as a 1000 page book but it's all laid out and explained so much better. You can use the 80% time savings to actually use what you've learned (or make fun of your manager, which ever is more valuable to you).Lastly, this book is quite complete. Programming for different cultures and languages could honestly be a handbook in it's own right, but certainly this book gives you a great introduction and more. The regular expression coverage is a very completely introduction as is the string handling chapters at the beginning of the book. Oh, and the last chapter is like a regular expressions \\"Cook Book\\" with REALLY practical examples.This book is fantastic to use as a learning tool and just as fantastic to have on your bookshelf for reference. Seeing that text manipulation is the name of the game when it comes to data, this book isn't leaving my side. Check it out - you'll love it."},{"Title":"Visual Basic .NET Text Manipulation Handbook: String Handling and Regular Expressions","review":"Wow! Quite impressed! I have been programming in VB, C and Java for years. This book is a concise explanation of strings with great history for perspective and detail about .NET implementation.This book reads very well and has great code examples. I suppose someone that doesn't know anything about programming shouldn't be trying to read a book about string encoding and regular expressions in the first place. This is not an introductoryto VB.net book (thank god!)If you are an intermediate or greater developer that is new to .NET then this book is a must read. I've seen so many VB developers hurt themselves with string concat in VB. This book explains why and how the .NET framework solves those problems.Regular Expressions is such a powerful tool. It is a shame that it took so many years for it to become part of the Microsoft arsenal. It has been used in Perl for decades.It behooves every programmer to learn about the following three topics...1] The StringBuilder class2] Interning Strings3] Regular Expressions.Also, in the past, I have not been a big fan of wrox books. ..not sure why. I think, comparatively, they were hard to read. Even when reading topics that I thouroughly knew, I found the wording and layout less than ideal. It was probably just a bad group of editors.

By reading VB.NET Text Handling I got a total different perspective for text manipulation techniques.As the book starts with great introduction especially on chapter 2 about Strings and builders it broads the way you stop thinking about Strings as sophisticated wrapper classes from a primitive data type. I was also very pleasant with the way that leads me to demystify some \\"pluming\\" idiosyncrasies I got through out the years.Chapter 5 introduces in a very transparent way how to start using Regular Expression where it glues so well with chapter 6 containing excellent applied approach for more complex uses of Regex.I would definitely advise to watch for chapter 7 where very tricky tasks are well explained and exemplified such as various types of validation and HTML TAGS MANIPULATION BEYOND LIMITS.If someone wants some actual information on how to put into practice commercial text manipulation I would recommend this book mostly because I will save hours of needless work"},{"Title":"Visual Basic .NET Text Manipulation Handbook: String Handling and Regular Expressions","review":"Unless you are writing games for a living, YOU WILL be spending a lot of time manipulating text.

This book is very disappointing. First, it is difficult to read because of the font used. The lower bar of the 'e' is not very distinct and gives the text a faded appearance at all times. The book is full of typos. Mispellings that are obvious, hyphens in the wrong place, etc. occur every couple of pages. It is written in an unsophisticated style, as if written in German and then translated into English by someone who was not himself a writer. Second, it is not an in-depth biography of Brigitte Helm. It deals with her films, and her impressions making the films, culled from magazine articles. There is a smattering of biography - but everything ends after she made her last film. The rest of her life is dealt with in a couple of paragraphs. I did not get the impression that the authors, Herzog &amp; Vazzana, had ever talked with Helm. It is also very short, less than a hundred pages, so the coverage of the films is also not as in-depth as it might be. There are several photographs (which fill out the book to above a hundred pages)- and these are the best part of the whole book, and make it worth its purchase price. Photos of Metropolis and most of her other films, as well as publicity shots."},{"Title":"Brigitte Helm: From Metropolis to Gold. A portrait of a goddess","review":"The introduction states that this book was inspired by the \\"recent\\" restoration of _Metropolis_ by Giorgio Moroder. Moroder made his version in 1984, and this book was published in 1994. It sounds like it would be worth the wait, but it is very poorly done.I am not sure what audience the book was intended for. It often reads like a biography written for elementary-age readers, and then Herzog and Vazzana drop in thousand dollar words like \\"obfuscate\\" and bits of film studies terminology. The book is loaded with typos (\\"classis,\\" \\"os\\" for \\"of,\\" \\"Atrhur\\") many of which could have been caught with a spellcheck, no less, and the \\"e\\"s often look like \\"c\\". At one point he has several quotations from \\"Arnheim, a critic.\\" He is never fully identified nor cited, and this further suggests the approach of a children's biography. The book has a bibliography, but no actual citations for its quotations.The font size, which is also suggestive of a children's book, is indicative of just how padded this book is. There are two interviews with Helm that were originally published in 1930s magazines, and even further padding with a complete transcription of the Moroder version of Metropolis--its intertitles and subtitles (not the Pete Belotte lyrics) and some descriptions I didn't bother to read since the rest of the writing her is so amateurish.The book is utterly confusing in its approach. The Herzog biography on the jacket flap says that Helm is Herzog's favorite actress and that she represents the apex of film stardom. However, that is certainly not the message that one gets from this book. In numerous cases, he tells of films where she was panned, sometimes agreeing, sometimes waxing poetic about her performances and still agreeing, sometimes challenging, but not often. Worst of all is that sometimes his detailings of the negative reactions to her films seem totally out of balance when one encounters a paragraph like this:\\"_Spione am Werk_ (1932) had a long run at the Gloria Palast in Berlin and when it was shown in New York City, _Variety_ (April, 1993) praised the acting and the photography in it.\\"No further mention or description of _Spione am Werk_ is given. If it's a lost film, say so. After film after film where her acting was faulted, you come to one where she was praised and gloss over it? Was the copywriter of the jacket flap mistaken?The editing of this book is so poor that there are two papragraphs about _The Contess of Monte Christo_ on page 46 and 49. The first is stuck in at the end of Chapter V, while the second is embedded in Chapter 6, and is written as though it is introducing the film to the reader for the first time. A reader of the copy I read (belonging to the New York Public Library) was prompted to add some details on page 46 that were on page 49, apparently thinking that some important info was dropped off before they read ahead to find it! Again, I say, ten years to produce a book this disorganized?The last page of the book proper is only page 58. Its last paragraph starts with \\"In 1935 Helm was a great success in the role of a young girl.\\" No mention of what film this is, and what else would she be playing? An old lady? Yes, she played a robot, as the photos clearly show, and a vamps not young girls? That's a vague term. Was she playing a child or adolescent? Perhaps the film referred to is _An Ideal Husband_, (Herzog is inconsistent about the article; \\"an\\" is consistent with the German \\"Ein\\" in the film's original title) as the last sentence of the book reads, \\"One of her last films, _The Ideal Husband_, proved once and for all that Helm was truly a great film actress of the time.\\" Where is the support? In the middle of the paragraph, he talks about Karl Hartl's ability to direct her. According to the filmography, Hartl had not directed her in a film since 1933, so he's not trying to lead up to it in a clumsy attempt at dramatic writing. The last film Hartl directed her in was _Gold_, which, as the title indicates, is the last film that Herzog and Vazzana want to discuss, so they slap on a mess that tries to be a conclusion?As to the value of the supplements? The filmography does not include the documentary that was mentioned several times that Helm supposedly appeared in and considers _Metropolis_ her first film. Helm's name is also presented in boldface in the filmography, as if we didn't know that her credit in the film was a given. There are 56 tipped-in plates with one or more photographs on each. Some are very revealing, such as Helm in the robot suit with the helmet off getting a drink. Of the twenty still photographs of _Metropolis_, most of them are very commonly reproduced, some of which do not even show Helm. Seven of these I absolutely guarantee you have seen.I was not familiar with Helm's work other than _Metropolis_ when I read this, though I had some awareness of her further career from IMDb. The book does not really compel me to seek out more of her work. I probably will, anyway, since she intrigues me enough that I read the book to begin with, but the impression one is left with is that Helm was a mediocre actor who happened to be in a landmark film classic and left acting after only ten years to get married and raise a family. Certainly, as a defense of her acting ability, the book fails, but considering how much of a failure the book is on so many levels, that isn't surprising. The subtitle is supported only by the numerous references saying that she looks like she could be a Greek goddess.For Helm completists only."},{"Title":"Brigitte Helm: From Metropolis to Gold.

I very much recommend it to everyone to have in their house."},{"Title":"American Medical Association Family Medical Guide","review":"It is no surprise that the latest edition of this excellent consumer reference is better than ever. For those who are newcomers to the power of this authoritative tome, its centerpiece is a series of symptom charts enabling users to conduct the equivalent of a differential self-diagnosis. Charts are available for the most common symptomologies--e.g. coughing, chest pain, abdominal pain, back pain. Through an interrogatory consisting of sequential questions which might be asked by a health professional presented with the symptoms in question, the charts guide the reader to action steps--ranging from reassurance and self-help options to advise to seek medical attention (urgently or in due course as the case may be).By saving unnecessary visits to the doctor's office or emergency room (thus helping to control medical costs) or spurring the overly complacent to imperative action, the AMA does a great service to the public and the profession by publishing this reference at an extremely affordable price.The bulk of the book consists of articles regarding various diseases and conditions encompassing symptomology, description diagnostic techniques (tests and such) likely to be employed, treatment options, and the range of expected prognoses--in a nutshell, what do I have, how will they find out, what will they do to treat me, and what's the outlook in terms of cure and survival.A wealth of reliable, understandable information is readily accessible to the lay person and accompanied by helpful illustrations.I have relied on this book for years to help me deal intelligently with health matters involving my friends, my family, and myself. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking to empower themselves to be a prudent steward of health and well being.The update is most welcome, as the dynamic pace of medicine has yielded therapeutic innovations (in particular new pharmaceuticals) that provide much happier endings to many of the disease entries."},{"Title":"American Medical Association Family Medical Guide","review":"Very informative. Easy to read and understand. Almost every disease I looked up was listed, and gave an easy to understand description of the symptoms and treatments.

It has always been very helpful, informative, and always accurate... to date.I highly recommend it and feel that the benefits will far exceed the cost of the book.In one case, based on the charts at the front of the book and the symptoms section on the corresponding referral page, the book gave the correct diagnosis for my father's condition. His doctor had misstated diverticulitis when, in fact, my dad had appendicitus. Because of the misdiagnosis from the doctor, my dad got peritonitus but thankfully recuperated from his resulting extensive surgery and hospital stay."},{"Title":"American Medical Association Family Medical Guide","review":"This latest edition of \\"The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide\\" has been thoroughly to keep it up-to-date and as one of the most authoritative and reliable family health reference.

This way, as an informed patient, and if the potential need for a physician's intervention arises, you can help him get the best and definitive diagnose."},{"Title":"American Medical Association Family Medical Guide","review":"Very useful guide, almost all things you could think of are covered (a few are not though, i.e., I found one particular eye-related problem that although is mentioned somewhere in the book, is neither explained nor dealt with anywhere). As it is obvious given the time passed between the last two editions, the panel of doctors differs from the prior one, and some topics are treated differently as well, not necessarily due to the passage of time or technological advances, so I kept the former edition. I suggest you do the same if you have the older version."},{"Title":"American Medical Association Family Medical Guide","review":"We had the first edition of this Medical Guide and used it for years as our family grew up.

We particularly appreciate the diagnostic flow chart to help determine the problem."},{"Title":"American Medical Association Family Medical Guide","review":"I have the first edition that I have used for years.

Again, this guide has not failed me. More information and updated to fit my needs. I recommend getting this book for your family.

I bought this for my daughter who now has a baby. I found it to be helpful and reassuring. Children tend to get sick on weekends and evenings, when it is a bit more difficult to get in touch with a doctor. Frequently the diagnosis I found from this guide was reiterated by the doctor. I correctly diagnosed scarlet fever, mono, and a hernia based on this guide. The self diagnosis charts are easy to follow. while it will never take the place of a doctor's visit, and the internet is a great resource, this is a concise resource which should be in every home."},{"Title":"American Medical Association Family Medical Guide","review":"If you are seeking useful medical information on a wide variety of health issues, this comprehensive guide could be just what you need.

I used this Medical Guide all the years raising my children. My middle daughter had a baby last year, and I wanted her to have a revised/updated version! I searched and found this newest revision for her to have, in raising her children, and for herself and husband, as I did. It was a gift for Christmas.I had this book first mailed to myself to compare with the one I've used all these years. though happy that it was much larger and obviously up-dated - I was disappointed in the type of really cheap paper now used in the book! The visuals (photos) were more varied, with many more of them ... but set oddly on the page compared to what mine was in 1981!Regardless, it was still in the format I loved so much! Amazing how much has been added for today, when needed!I still use my old one, and amaze people with how helpful it is even now - in wonderful way of knowing when to see a Dr. and when not to.

I'm not saying children aren't worth all the going back and forth to the doctor's office and emergency rooms, but they do get costly, and medical coverage provided by employers is beginning to cover less and cost the employees more. For me, having a guide like this that provides current information allows me to nurse my child's wounds and my husbands work injuries without fear. It is an exc ellent starting point. It also has wonderful photos that explain rashes from childhood diseases, etc. This was a great purchase as far as I'm concerned."},{"Title":"Free to Be Beautiful: Ordinary Principles for an Extraordinary Life","review":"I just finished this book and now feel equipped to begin the Free To Be Beautiful journey. You first must know that number one, I HATE to read, and number two, I could not put it down. It was as every page had my life story on it somewhere.Let me begin by saying that I buried my dreams years ago and refused to ever open the box again, it hurt too much. I stayed away from anyone who encouraged me to dream big, because it was a cruel reminder of the life I longed for but would never live. Those dreams were to go to my grave with me and I had accepted the fact that I would die with my song still in me........ Until I read Free To Be Beautiful.The principles in that book have created a stirring in my heart that has been dormant for many years. Principles I knew and had learned but were no longer willing to acknowledge.I have begun journaling in the format presented in the book, and re-implementing the lost principles into my life once again. I'm ready to begin the process of losing the chains of the past and gaining hope for a future, a purpose, the freedom to live a beautiful life.

I enjoy making the most of my time, and this book affords that luxury!On a more inimate level, over the past couple of years my self confidence has grown in leaps and bounds because of my accomplishments and the accomplishments of those I work with. However I found that many times I have avoided dealing with \\"life's complications\\" by staying busy. Through their book God has used Karen and Tina to very gently peel away the proverbial bandaids from the wounds, and allow the healing process to begin. I am learning not to ignore the hurts and disappointments of life, not to pretend there are no struggles, but to face them head on--actually embrace them, and find myself and my children more empowered for it! As difficult as it can be to do this, it is worth the effort...I am loving who I am becoming, and what I can offer to others--especially my daughters!I highly recommend this book to any woman, as it speaks to females at any age or time in life...teaching us to take an honest look at our lives and our thinking, and challenging us to become who God intends us to be.

I was looking for a book to quickly review some things I may not know. This book is not only boring to read but confusing. I spend more than half of the time looking for the examples supplied on the diskette of practice files. Some I never found, I just gave up and looked around my access database for something similar. The practice test in the back has no way of scoring you. You have to know what you did or did not know when you are finished, then review. Pass on this book."},{"Title":"MOUS Access 97 Exam Cram","review":"This book is very difficult to follow. There are errors in the book, which are not all cleared up by going to the author's web site. But without going there, you can't even follow along after a certain point, because some crucial instructions are omitted.But even more than those kind of errors are errors of omission. Steps that are worded confusingly, steps left out, the lack of progressive sample files (even files needed to practice import/export are left out with a lame excuse). The sample files are pretty much what you end up with when you've finished the book, not interim files that would make it possible to go back and easily review chapters.For just one specific example of this books shortcomings, there is an Exam Alert that tells you encryption/decryption will fail if user-level security has been established and you don't have correct permissions. Makes it sound like that is something you should know how do adjust, right? Wrong! Permissions are not covered AT ALL in the book. If they are necessary for the test it would be nice if they were in the book. Why warn us otherwise? If you try to encrypt some of the sample files provided, encryption will fail due to read permissions. It would be nice to have the book tell us how to fix that condition."},{"Title":"MOUS Access 97 Exam Cram","review":"The book was fairly comprehensive and covered 99% of what was on the test.

Dozens of other minor characters appear briefly and vividly in the spotlight, each animated with the spark of life.The plot is unspectacular in the extreme, but for lovers of Trollope, the ability to understand the drama and heroism of ordinary life, as well as its tedium, pettiness, and villainy, will always be his special appeal. This novel is slow, perhaps, to seize the reader's interest -- at least, so I found it -- but in the end the volume acquires a remarkable momentum from the progress of its various subplots and possesses in the final two hundred pages a sort of urgency in its narrative momentum that carries it briskly along. For me, the &quot;hobbledehoyhood&quot; of Johnny Eames is sometimes hard to bear. Trollope even says at the end of the novel that &quot;I feel I have been in fault in giving such prominence to a hobbledehoy.&quot; But biographers tell us that such was Trollope in his youth, so a grateful reader is, I suppose, bound to cherish a special feeling for Johnny Eames also.At one moment a character arrives at his sister-in-law's house in London and is obliged to wait several moments while the servant changes into livery before answering the knock at the door -- for it is thus that the daughter of an earl clings to the trappings of her rank. I love such glimpses into the ways of a vanished world, and they are one of the charms of reading Trollope. But the ways of the human heart have changed less than its outward customs, and the twenty-first-century reader will encounter the shock of recognition several dozen times in the course of reading *The Small House at Allington*.The handsome Oxford University Press edition, a bargain at the price, has an insightful introduction by James R. Kincaid. If only it were presented as an afterword! Is there really any point in giving away the plot of a novel?"},{"Title":"SMALL HOUSE AT ALLINGTON","review":"Lily Dale is sublimely happy when she becomes engaged to Adolphus Crosbie, assistant secretary in a government agency and a mortal Apollo to Lily. And Crosbie is happy too--while he is with Lily. But when he is invited to spend a week at Courcy Castle and is looked upon with favor by Lady Alexandrina De Courcy, the temptation to marry into a noble family is too much for him, and he becomes engaged for the second time in a few weeks.John Eames, a young government clerk, has loved Lily Dale for years. He longs to replace Crosbie in the jilted girl's affections, but she still loves Crosbie, despite his treachery. The ambitious Crosbie, however, soon finds that his aristocratic bride brings no money into the marriage, but maintains her expensive tastes. The marriage is a disaster from the start.As John Eames' fortunes rise and Crosbie's decline, the reader is led to believe, as all Lily's friends urge, that Eames will eventually win the heartbroken lass, but Lily stubbornly clings to her hopeless love.There are several subplots, some of them humorous, as Trollope's settings range from castle to rooming house, with vivid characters from varying social strata. As always, the characterizations are thorough and convincing. These are real people who behave realistically. Even when their actions seem surprising, they flow logically from the strong personal basis which the author has built into each character. Although the outcome is not nearly so pleasing as that of &quot;Dr. Thorne,&quot; for instance, this book is a solidly enjoyable novel from one of the greatest literary series."},{"Title":"SMALL HOUSE AT ALLINGTON","review":"The Small House at Allington, one of Trollope's Barsetshire novels of provincial life, does not require a familiarity with the other books in the series. Its plot device, much like the slightly superior Framley Parsonage, is to show the effects of poor choices and the way in which life sometimes gives folks pretty just desserts for the silly choices they make. As with all Trollope, though, the plot is a jaunty cover for his real theme, which is a social satire of his era in an effort to illumine human nature. Sometimes Trollope's plot devices had a different effect on the reader than he intended. Lily Dale, placed in the novel largely to illustrate the consequences attendant to self-willed dedication to victorian ideas of true love, in fact became a celebrated character in her time as an example of a perfect jilted lover. It is somewhat amusing reading the novel today, seeing how Trollope showed Lily as a stubborn girl from a stubborn family, stubbornly devoted to &quot;Love&quot;, and then to think that in his time, Lily was seen as a perfect avatar of true love.This is a good read--lots of rich satire of persons of both high and low station. It is not Trollope's best, but it is a good read, and well worth a Sunday afternoon read. If you have not read Trollope, prepare for a richly human story laced with satire. If you have read Trollope, then expect a wit slightly less sharp but a story a bit more engaging than his others. His character Crosbie, the &quot;villain&quot; of sorts, is a fine creation, and this one is worth a read."},{"Title":"SMALL HOUSE AT ALLINGTON","review":"Like all of the Barsetshire novels, The Small House at Allington is a delight to read.Less delightful is the Nonsuch Classics edition.

Both girls are of marriageable age, though they have no fortunes, and as the novel develops, the reader sees the extent to which marriage in Victorian England is often a business transaction, negotiated by families to ensure their daughters' welfare and continuing standard of living. Because Lily and Bell have no fortunes, their courtships become the primary vehicle through which Trollope examines the contrasts between marriages for love and marriages for convenience.When Lily falls hopelessly in love with Adolphus Crosbie, a young friend of her cousin Bernard, he returns her affection. Thinking that her uncle will give her a substantial dowry, Crosbie then proposes, and she accepts. When he discovers there will be no dowry, Crosbie suddenly wonders how he will support Lily in the manner to which he would like to become accustomed. One week after the betrothal, he has left Allington and become engaged to the wealthy, but cold, Lady Alexandrina De Courcy. Though the heartbroken Lily believes that she can never love another, the way she has loved Adolphus, she resolves (somewhat priggishly) to lead a good life and do good works. Her sister Bell refuses marriage to a cousin who had expected to to collect the dowry from their uncle.Other subplots continue this money/marriage theme.

Marriage to Johnny would greatly improve Amelia's way of life.

His use of Mrs. Roper, Amelia's mother, as a character with financial troubles is realistic without being maudlin, and Adolphus Crosbie, the bounder, is also realistic in his naive assumptions and his regrets.

But it is my belief that Trollope, like Austen, is better on a bad day than most authors are at their best, so \\"Small House\\" is still eminently readable. But it is still not my favorite.As per usual, the characters are well written and believable. The writing is superb. My only problem is with the choices Lily makes. On one hand, while I admire Lily's refusal to marry someone she does not love, I have very little use for martyrs, and Lily seems to revel in her martyrdom.The book may not have been originally a part of the Barchester books, but since many of the characters appear in the last book of the series, The Last Chronicle of Barset, it does help to have read all 6 in the series if you want to be completely \\"up\\" with what is going on."},{"Title":"SMALL HOUSE AT ALLINGTON","review":"Beautiful book. Though it's the 5th book in the series, any newcomers to Trollope could profitably start here to get the flavor of the series."},{"Title":"SMALL HOUSE AT ALLINGTON","review":"Money was terribly important to Anthony Trollope who never quit his day job at the British Post Office but laboured industriously both at his novels and at his career in the British civil service.A typical Victorian civil servant in London worked from 10 to 4 for a little over a hundred pounds a year, wages with which a gentleman could pursue a comfortable life occupying a room in the city while dining at clubs, but wages at which he might not marry and raise a family without abandoning this high life. Having both required a much higher revenue, say a thousand a year. A family required a house not rooms, a carriage, not cabs, a housemaid for the wife not chores for the housewife. And there you know all you need to know of Adolphus Crowley, the man who jilts the novel's heroine, Lily Dale, when he learns she comes with no dowry.A hundred pounds a year also amounted to the wages of Doctor Crofts, a young country doctor with only poor patients. He feels it's not quite enough to allow him to pursue Bell, Lily's older sister. It was also the fantastic sum promised the wards of Hiram's Hospital in the earlier Barsetshire novel, the Warden. Johnny Eames, Lily Dale's other suitor, also belongs to the civil service but at somewhat under a hundred a year and lives in a boarding house in rather unpleasant company.And yet, money can't be everything. Lily Dale lives rent free with Bell and their widowed mother Mary in the small house of the title, while her bachelor uncle, the Squire of Allington whose land brings in some four thousand pounds a year, lives in the larger house. But when the childless uncle hints that their living there gives him some fatherly authority, the women refuse to recognize this and move out. On principle. We easily recognize Trollope in this careful working out of what actions are right and wrong, of how higher principles translate into practical everyday decisions.Trollope does paint his characters with more contrast here than in his other Barsetshire novels, making his villain a little more villainous than Sowerby in Framley Parsonage and his heroine Lily Dale purer than Mary Thorne in Doctor Thorne. But I can't say I liked Lily very much. I certainly sympathized with her plight and admired her fortitude, but I think Trollope idealized her too much and turned fortitude to stubborness. Fortunately, other characters make up for a priggish Lily.Since Trollope is Trollope, we end up sympathizing a little with the villain as he finds no solace in the woman for whom he left Lily. Uncle Christopher Dale relents somewhat in his position and acknowledges he loves his nieces, regardless of whatever duty he might or might not owe them. Johnny Eames, apparently more a more than slightly autobiographical character, grows up achieving something resembling manhood.And we meet Plantagenet Palliser, the hero of Trollope's other great series, the Palliser novels, who appears scandalously often with the young Lady Dumbello. What will we make of that, now?Vincent Poirier, Dublin"},{"Title":"SMALL HOUSE AT ALLINGTON","review":"The Small House at Allington (1864) is a nearly 800 page Victorian three decker novel by Anthony Trollope (1815-1882. The former postal employee wrote 47 novels and is one of Britain's greatest authors. The Small House at Allington is the favorite novel of former Conservative Prime Minister John Major. You don't have to be a politician or pundit to enjoy this excellent book.Lily Dale lives in the Small House with her mother and sisters. She becomes engaged to the London playboy/cad Adolphus Crosbie. The office clerk John Eames is also in love with Lily. When Crosbie jilts Lily to wed Lady Alexandrine De Courcy a rich ninny the plot thickens. Will John win Lily or will she remain true to Crosbie her first love depsite the impossiblity of ever marrying him?Trollope is very good in his realistic dialogue and situations. We see the British middle and upper classes at home, the club, in London and in the country. We encounter two major love triangles and see how these romances work themselves out in the class conscious world of high Victorian society. Unusual for Trollope is no mention of a fox hunt!The novel is very long and was published serially in the Cornhill magazine over a number of months. I found it and Barchester Towers to be the most interesting of the Barsetshire novels set in and around the mythical town of Barset.Trollope lacks the broad and comic vision of Dickens; the intelligent psychological insight of George Eliot and the satirical verve of Thackery but is still a novelist of the highest caliber. Read him and enjoy hours of reading pleasure."},{"Title":"SMALL HOUSE AT ALLINGTON","review":"(The info provided here by amazon gives James Kincaid as author. Actually it is by Anthony Trollope. Amazon has this very annoying habit to give editors or translators as authors.)Wisdom that comes with age is owed to the reduction of temptation, more than to thinking and reflection. We all know that. The mature ones among us do. Well, one or two of us.Most of the young people (and the older ones too) in this story behave unwisely and thus give us a plot suitable for Mr. Trollope's narrative skills. They do so less from lack of thought, than from lack of judgment. As we know, good judgment comes with experience, which results from bad judgment.Our heroine Lily falls for a sweet talking, good looking, ambitious but miscalculating Apollo. It runs in her family to be stubborn, hence she will attempt to be loyal to her first love even when he shows her what we knew from the start, namely that he is a windbag.The windbag had falsely assumed that the pretty and smart girl would be given a fortune by her rich uncle. That miser has however no such intentions.The miser, on the other hand, wants to convince his nephew, a cold schemer, to marry Lily's sister, who can't be won for the love of money though.This gets complicated and messy, and not always entirely plausible, and heroine Lily, as much as we might be disposed to like her, gets mightily on our nerves with her lack of pragmatism and her insistence to stick to her initial mistake.Imagine, she gets jilted and forgives him. Unbelievable. We can't forgive her that she fell for the creep in first place.Lily Dale is said to be Trollope's most popular female production. I don't know. I think I liked some others better, including glorious Glencora of the Pallisers.This novel seems to have been Trollope's most successful novel, commercially, while it is one of his weaker ones, really. Just goes to show how dumb the market can be.Apollo, after jilting Lily, marries into a noble family. Chief pleasure of reading the novel is the domestication process among the new in-laws. We wish the man all the worst, and he gets what he deserves.This novel is part of the Barchester series in a rather loose way, and it also links to the Pallisers via some of the personnel of that later series, who show up here. Foremost Planty Pal, the future Duke of Omnium and Prime Minister, here still without the ambitious Glencora, in a rather creepy pupa stage.It is the typically entertaining, slow, funny-serious Trollope novel, here of 650 pages. If you don't know the man, starting here can't do damage.But beware, Trollope can be addictive in his mild leisurely way. If only most of the people in this story were not so unreasonable."},{"Title":"SMALL HOUSE AT ALLINGTON","review":"I read this on my kindle as part of a compilation of Trollope's works. It was the first book I read on my kindle, and I realized the great advantage of it - I had no idea how far along I was at any point, as the kindle only shows me where I am in the entire compilation, not the individual novel. If I had known how far along I was, I would probably have given up on this novel at some point, as it does lag here and there. But I persevered, and it turned out to be a very pleasant read.It surprised me as being the first Victorian novel I've read where a major plot point (a potential romance) is left unresolved. The happy ending is so common, I was very surprised when I reached the end. As usual, Trollope is a master of realistic (and astonishingly modern) dialogue and character. I think Crosbie is a very realistic character, a rather ordinary man who has to grapple with his inner demons and his English gentleman's conscience. An interesting case of a person who makes a major decision on a subconscious level and the destructive effects it has on his life and those of others.The Plantagenet Palliser introduction was very awkward, however, and it seemed to me to be a last minute addition. This plot is completely separate from the Crosbie/Eames plot and it really doesn't fit in. I had already read the Palliser series, though, so maybe I suffer from prior-knowledge-itis."},{"Title":"SMALL HOUSE AT ALLINGTON","review":"I have written several highly favorable reviews of Anthony Trollope's novels for Amazon; this will be my first unfavorable review of the work of one of my favorite authors. For me, nothing works in The Small House at Allington. I took little interest in the main cast of characters. First we have Lily Dale, the heroine of the novel, who falls in love with Adolphus Crosbie, a weak, confused, cowardly young man. The two become engaged and almost immediately Crosbie jilts Lily for Lady Alexandrina, daughter of an Earl. Much of the rest of the novel is concerned with Lily and her dedication to her false fianc&eacute;. Into this sad story comes Johnny Eames, one of the most poorly written of any of Trollope's characters. Having read twelve of Trollope's novels I feel confident in my appraisal of young Eames. Trollope gives us a confused picture of a young man who himself is confused in all things concerning his life except for his love of Lily Dale. I could only shake my head in disappointment at Trollope's inept handling of Eames and also Lily Dale. I think most readers will be unhappy with the resolution of the story of Lily and Johnny and almost everything else concerning them.Additionally, the plot of The Small House is thin. Not much happens from beginning to end of this fifth novel in The Chronicles of Barsetshire. Many supporting characters make their entrances and exits with little bearing on the main story line. For example, Lily's sister Bella's role is as confused and unsatisfying as her sister Lily. \\"Bel's\\" purpose seems to be to frustrate the wishes of her uncle, Squire Dale, which she does at any and every opportunity. The Squire himself is one of the saddest character's Trollope has created. He mopes about from beginning to end of the novel feeling sorry for himself and adding little to the story line.Another disappointment comes with the introduction of Plantagenet Palliser, nephew of the Duke of Omnium. Plantagenet is the central character in the six novels of the Palliser series of books by Trollope, and is one of Trollope's greatest novelistic achievements. In The Small House he has none of the monumental qualities of character that will eventually result in his being named Prime Minister of England in the fifth novel in the series aptly named The Prime Minister. Like almost everyone else in The Small House, he appears weak and confused. His brief entrance and exit contribute little to the main plot of the novel.As mentioned in the beginning of this long review, I think Anthony Trollope is one of the finest of all English novelists. Until reading The Small House at Allington, I would have said to anyone that it is not possible to make a mistake when choosing a novel by Trollope. I was wrong. Trollope disappointed me with this novel; even so, I look forward with interest and anticipation to reading the Last Chronicle of Barset, the final novel in the series. Several Amazon reviewers consider this the best of this series of books and I am confident Trollope will return to form."},{"Title":"SMALL HOUSE AT ALLINGTON","review":"Lily Dale knows that Adolphus Crosbie is a swell.

Crosbie decides to marry Lily anyhow, but to postpone the wedding.Prior to his leaving the area, Lily tells Crosbie she is willing to release him from the promise to marry, but he refuses the offer.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and found it moved much more quickly for me than the previous books in the Barsetshire series.

Although Trollope's charming, funny characters and gentle humor were as enjoyable as ever, it felt sharper, especially when it came to Crosbie getting his comeuppance for being a fickle jilt and dumping poor Lily (although I think if I were her mother or sister I would have slapped her after a while - it got to be too much!) Devotion is one thing, but she was rather nauseating (when she uttered something about wishing she could be \\"the godmother to their first child\\" I thought UGH!!!) Ah, well, I look forward to tackling \\"The Last Chronicle\\" to catch up on the further adventures of the Allington residents and the rest of the large cast and tie up the loose ends of this delicious series (and then onto the Palliser novels - Plantagenet seems like such an adorable geek, part policy wonk, part Don Quixote - who could resist?)"},{"Title":"SMALL HOUSE AT ALLINGTON","review":"I do not expect a fairy tale, like that of Cinderella being carried off by her Prince Charming but I was quite disappointed that at the end of the story, John Eames had not managed to win the heart of his lady.In my opinion, Trollope was unkind to portray too much of the hobbledehoyness of John Eames. He did not quite elaborate much of how John Eames came to become a man since he should be our hero in the book.I really admired Eames's unquenched love and loyalty to L.D. Seldom we find such great exertions in men nowadays. At the same time, I do feel that Eames was a people pleaser to an extent except the time when he thrashed Apollo Crosbie and when he insisted on Sir Raffle Buffle giving him an extension of leave to stay in Guestwick Manor.About Lilian Dale, I have to say she was a strong woman because to be jilted in the age where she existed was a great disgrace. How she managed to still sustain her love for the man who hurt and abused her, I cannot comprehend.In conclusion, I think the book is quite okay even though it doesn't have the 'Oomnps!

The book is an excellent balance between the natural and human history of the river and the river valley. The human history focuses on the early settlers, the growth of agriculture and lumbering as well as the later growth of tourism. It disusses some current problems with pollution and sprawl. The unique nature of the St. Johns truly comes across in the descriptions of the natural history. It has narrow passages through subtropical vegetation and then goes through a number of lakes, large and small, all of which have their own personality and unique characteristics. To me, the most interesting part of the book were the dives into the cave from which the many spring come to the earth and are the point where manatees often gather. Well-written, lyrical with just enough ironic humor to make you enjoy the trip."},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"It is rare to find a 21st century man as aware of his natural environment as Bill Belleville. In a world of turnpikes, shopping malls, gasoline emissions, the shriek of airplanes, the thunder of traffic and the relentless river of asphault that paves over memories and dreams, it is refreshing to find an author who longs to simplify, who notices apples snails and gopher tortoises, who endorses a way of life that has virtually vanished and writes lovingly of a place on earth and a watery path that modern society has all but forgotten."},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"Bill Belleville invites you aboard an allegorical raft as he explores Florida's St. Johns River.

Very true. This is a fascinating exploration of the St. Johns river and surrounding areas in Florida, much of it still largely unspoiled wilderness. I have been to one of it's (small) tributaries , Juniper Springs, twice while canoeing, and it is a beautiful wilderness I can attest. The author, Bill Belleville, takes readers on a leisurely tour of the St. Johns river system starting in his own backyard and neighborhood, and from the marshy headwaters in an airboat, and later a kayak down river to a houseboat, and finally to the ocean, sometimes written in a dreamy poetic style, but still with lots of river lore and information. The St. Johns river is steeped in tons of history and Bill navigates it to great effect. By reading this book you can learn a lot about geology, history, plants and animals, ecology and conservation, evolution and natural selection, the beauty and value of nature, why it is important to preserve our wetlands, and along the way meet several interesting folks.At the back of the volume is a list of access points on the St. John river and near it, a list of public and private agencies, and also an extensive bibliography. Finally, I want to add that the part in the book where Belleville was floating past that tavern next to the river that was blaring out the Patsy Cline song &quot;Crazy&quot; (p. 140), in light of the history associated with that area, well, I laughed so hard I almost broke a rib!"},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"Quite by chance I was gifted with this book.

Belleville truly takes you on a trip into the past and on into the present. His humor and his way with words will not disappoint you. This is one of those books you will share with friends and take off of the shelf frequently. How did Belleville know to write a book just for me?"},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"The mix of nature, history and good writing is perfect. Find a comfortable chair, put your feet up, and settle in for a good read. When you get to the last page, try Cracker Childhood or Bullough's Pond."},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"Bill Belleville's sublime story of the St. John's River was a book I could not put down. A modern version of William Bartram's Travels, &quot;River of Lakes&quot; truly catches the history, geology and flavor of life along the St. John's River. For those of us who have grown up on the river, and who have played in its creeks and springs since childhood, it was an absolute joy to read. I hope that Belleville (who also makes films about rivers) makes a film about the St. John's based on this book. Hang up your hammock by the river, sit back and soak up the beauty of this poetic odyssey. If you haven't seen the St. John's before, you will want to now!"},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"For those of us who love the St. Johns, this is a wonderful trip, downriver, back in time, and into the unique terrain and history of wilderness Florida. I had the good fortune to meet Belleville at a reading, and the better fortune to meet him through this excellent book. Belleville is a writer with an eye to detail, be it historical, scientific, or in the observation of human nature. His sense of humor is apt, and he clearly loves the subject. My great hope is that this book will bring the right kind of visitor to this beautiful place."},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"What a splendid writer is this Bill Belleville. The burden of the nature narrative is to make any place as familiar as home, and as inviting, here in particular, as a river glade. Belleville's confidence is not only in the turf, so to speak, but in his touch. The St. Johns River, even to this Connecticut Yankee, is where readers today, as marine animals in the time before places had names, can still come to dream."},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"This is a fantastic book about the St. Johns River in Florida. Many people see this river every day but few people experience the river the way the author did. To read this book is to undertake a journey down the St. Johns as people did in the 1800's, from the headwaters to the mouth and all points between. After reading this book I realized what I was missing and determined to go back and really see the river again for the first time. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates what is left of the true Florida or who is even the slightest bit interested in the real world. The author's style is casual but compelling and you may have a hard time putting it down except to rush out, load the canoe, and head to the river! A must have book for anyone who lives near the river, nature lover or not."},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"River of Lakes is a masterpeice and will sell itself! Environmentalist and adventurer Bill Belleville traveled the entire length of Florida's fabled St. Johns River in a very small boat. The past comes alive! He writes so vividly you can almost see, hear and smell the Timucuans, Spanish explorers,the early settlers and the smoke belching paddlewheelers and, especially, the reality of the present day St. Johns. I thought an alligator tried to bite me while I was reading this book! The author has probably researched this river better than anyone in history and turned it into a fascinating story as well as a benchmark for generations to come. Also, the exploitation of this beautiful river is detailed and its future is brought into perspective. Belleville who is best known for his expeditions on behalf of the Discovery Channel has written a great book. His style, at least in my mind, resonates with the travel writings of Paul Theroux. River of Lakes is a delight to read and I loved it!"},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"Every river should have a writer-in-residence as fine as Bill Belleville. He gives the St. Johns its due, and commands a reader's respect with the quality of his prose and depth of his research. &quot;River of Lakes&quot; is personal without being confessional. Belleville is river-absorbed, not self-absorbed, and the result is a rigorous and companionable book. I'm just sorry Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (another important witness to the St. Johns) isn't around to read it."},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"This is a terrific book. If you live along the St. Johns you want to read it. It's loaded with information about the human history, natural history, and current condition of the river. It is an engaging read only occasionally mared by bad writing. If you can get past the swamp of the first paragraph the rest is good, with only a few overpriced three dollar words sprinked through the text."},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"Summoning the spirit of William Bartram, Bill Belleville offers a description of the lands, people, water, wilderness, and animals around the St. Johns River in Florida. Belleville clearly likes to identify with Bartram, even refering to him as \\"Billy\\" based on a single letter from Henry Laurens to Bartram's father. Belleville is an excellent writer and offers a compelling narrative.Yet there is much that I find disturbing about this book. Belleville's grasp of history is not very strong. While he gushes about the French Hugenot colonial experience, he seems to have little to say about the Spanish. The French were in Florida for the better part of two years; the Spanish were in Florida for well over two centuries. Belleville seems to have little to say about the black experience in Florida either. No record survives of what happened to the slaves \\"Billy\\" Bartram abandoned when his plantation went under. Maybe \\"Billy\\" was not the saint that Belleville seems to think.Worse, Belleville seems to have little use for a lot of people. He does not like toursits. He does not like the city of Jacksonville. He resents development and so on. All well and good. But the tide of humanity, both past and present, are some of the strongest factors in what makes the St. Johns unique and it's something Belleville does not seem to fully appreciate."},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"A very thoughtful and elegant book which shares the author's passion for a very unique river with the rest of the world. I hope it becomes as associated with the St. Johns as M.S. Douglas' River Of Grass did with the Everglades, for it seems to grasp the full reach of ecology and art every bit as thoroughly as Ms. Douglas once did. I heard about this book from a friend, and have since heard about it from others. Already, it seems to have the feel of a Florida classic to it."},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"This is one of those vacation-like books that I hoped wouldn't end. From the peaceful beginnings of the St. Johns to its rollicking arrival at the Atlantic Ocean, each page delivered a new marvel. Belleville followed his nose deep into the river-weeds, down into underwater caves, and out to the center of beautiful, bird-ful lakes. And he didn't shy away from observing that damnable human yearning to live as close as possible to the water's edge. All the world is wrapped up in this river: I found reason to marvel, reason to rail, and reason to hope for the future."},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"It's a great journey charting the entire course of the St Johns river and it's many lakes.It's lightly interspersed with historical facts and stories.

Thank you very much for a smooth transaction."},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"by David LambertNorth Florida's St. Johns River is a troubled water. It crawls slowly northward through the top half of a troubled state. The river took shape in the Pleistocene-era Florida, nearly 65 million years ago, but it has taken humans only 400 years to change its nature--to harness its energy, redirect its flow, dredge its depth, widen its banks, pollute it with wastes and runoff, fill its floodplains, and draw down its water. New threats to the St. Johns River seem to pop up daily, so keeping tabs is a full-time job for researchers, enviro groups, scientists, and writers like Bill Belleville.About the only thing humans haven't managed to spoil is the character of the St. Johns. It's that special character that writer/naturalist Bill Belleville admires, and it's what he writes about with such grace and enthusiasm.Belleville's 2001 book on the St. Johns, River of Lakes, brought readers a new understanding of Florida's longest river. Others have told us how much North Floridians depend on and love the St. Johns; Belleville's book shows us why. River of Lakes helps demystify, and in fact often clarifies, the interconnectedness of man, land, and water. Its evokative prose derives from the author's special understanding of place.Belleville's words ring honest and true because he \`kens' his subject, understands it at a nearly molecular level. One senses that he uncrated much about himself in the process of writing River of Lakes.Belleville's newest book, Salvaging the Real Florida, is an equally compellingly read. It's more about love of place than any book in recent memory. In the 10 or so years since he penned River of Lakes, Belleville's relationship with the natural world seems to have taken on an almost spiritual side, as though he were seeing natural Florida through the eyes of paleo-Natives, the Timuqua or Tequesta, the Calusa or Creek. Other times he's a scientist, examining Florida with magnifying glass in hand. Still others, he's a poet, a wordsmith who articulates and illuminates the wonders of the natural Florida with a lover's eye, but without the flower and fluffery that usually accompany books of this sort.Salvaging the Real Florida speaks of Belleville's understanding of the connectedness of man and the natural world. His is a near Shinto perspective of the benefits (and pleasures) derived when man immerses himself in nature, surrounding himself (or herself) with forests, sky, dirt, and water--forest bathing as the Shinto call it.Belleville's Salvaging the Real Florida is a series of. . .do we call them essays? Narratives is more correct. Written mostly first person present, his prose is elevated imagery, subtle metaphor from a suitor's pen; he writes with an earnest clarity and a near obsession of place. His real Florida is as grand as a first magnitude spring, but it's also close at hand, like the backyard woods you played in as a kid. His narrative pieces are siren song, but note . . Belleville's temptress could as easily be a murky swamp as a crystal blue spring or saltwater cavern.For those who love the natural Florida, or those who wish they did, there are simply no better books than these two from writer/naturalist Bill Belleville. Mind you though, after reading them, Belleville's obsession with place may become your own.--David Lambert, Southerner's Journal, 2011"},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"I now \`ration' my re-reading of this book, one of my favorites, to intervals of longer than eight months, as I am so familiar with each of the gloriously interesting chapters. After I retired and returned to boating on the great St Johns River here in central Florida, it became a regular part of our understanding of the river, traveling with us on-board a series of boats and on multiple adventures - and on my lone, pure river wanderings. My first copy (of at least four that I have purchased) became so dog-eared, annotated and water stained it had to be retired to the local Marina laundry shelves. Another was a gift for my younger son, who accompanied me on weekend cruises up to Jacksonville, or Silver Glen. A further copy went back to live on the boat and a \`best' copy was retained for indoor reading!When failing health required the last boat to be sold, the on-board copy was considered by the new Skipper to be such a valuable \\"Navigation Aid\\" that it became an item in the cruiser's inventory. My remaining indoor copy still has sorties on our walks in parks and on trails and one long weekend - coupled with Bartram's and Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' Journals - served as a touring guide from Palatka back to Sanford on Lake Monroe.A book to be enjoyed and valued then on different levels, as a boating and river guide, an ecological briefing, a recounting of both the Bertram's journeys and a history of the settlements, towns and peoples that populate this glorious river. Geographically it covers the entire 300 miles of the river, from the first lake to the sea. This journey allows the author to paint the ecological and historical tale of the St Johns, now one of just 14 American Heritage Rivers.In correspondence with the author he mentions our growing need in this too-well connected life to share \\"a sense of place\\" and by his tireless efforts on behalf of the rivers and the few remaining wild areas of Florida, Bill Belleville, with his books, films, and talks has himself become part of this State's heritage."},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"River of Lakes is, indeed, a fascinating journey from the headwaters of the St. Johns River to the sea. Mr. Belleville's writing, while accurate and fact-filled, is almost poetic. I have read and re-read portions - tagged areas of our wonderful river thatI have visited and enjoyed and also places I want to visit."},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"I really enjoyed this book as it is a wonderful mixture of history, exploration, and imagery. The author is so descriptive that you can easily follow the entire journey with a map. I suggest anyone really wanting to get into this book to follow the author in Google Earth - all of the coves, springs, rivers, points, towns, islands, lakes, and bridges are named, and on top of that there are Panoramio pictures to view in most areas. For example, when he describes the huge oak tree in Astor, I zoomed in and clicked a few pictures people had taken of it. Or you can follow the Oklawaha to Rawlings' house. I also used Wikipedia often for more back stories (and a dictionary).I did want a little more of some of the conversations/interactions with locals, some were condensed to a paragraph, but maybe that's all they were. Others on the boat with him weren't named but only described in passing, but he probably wanted to focus more on the river/journey itself and not dialogue. As a personal preference (that probably wouldn't be wanted by others) I wished a lot of his historical facts were cited directly and not in one big massive bibliography at the end, and maybe a map and some pictures, but you can get those easily online. Also, some of the rivers and side lakes got cut short or not mentioned but I'm sure only so much can go into one book.Overall excellent read. This book has caused me to explore five different places this weekend alone that were mentioned in the book, and I could point out some interesting facts to people with me (such as the decrease in water cycling through Lake Jesup). I will definitely be investing in a kayak or canoe to explore some of the local tributaries."},{"Title":"River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River","review":"If you've ever dreamed of spending time on the St. Johns River, this is definately worth the read.

F. Bruce is an excellent mid-level commentary on this most important book of the Christian New Testament. I am reviewing a 1985 Second edition which has many notable improvements over the 1963 First Edition, especially the switch to the RSV translation and consultations with some of the most important scholarly commentaries on \`Romans' such as the one done by Ernst Kasemann.One of the few problems with Professor Bruce's edition is that it falls smack in the middle of Bible commentary styles. It is seriously scholarly, especially in it's very important interest in avoiding \`political correctness' when covering some of Paul's stronger opinions possibly not too popular in today's world. On the other hand, the book belongs to a \`popular' series, \`The Tyundale New Testament Commentaries' and it aims at serving the lay Bible Study audience.Since I believe that when dealing with serious and difficult subjects, it is best not to lead your audience into a false sense of simplicity, I applaud Professor Bruce's leaning in the direction of the scholarly, with battalions of footnotes, Greek and Aramaic texts, and careful expositions on central concepts such as \`flesh', \`spirit', and \`righteousness'.Thus, Bruce is deeper and potentially more satisfying than William Barclay's \`The Letter to the Romans', which has few of these. Bruce's analysis of Paul's letter is distinctly more carefully thought out than Barclay's one-dimensional list of subjects. Oddly, Bruce diverges substantially from both Kasemann and N. T. Wright in his commentary in \`The New Interpreter's Bible' in his outline of the Epistle around Chapter 3 Verse 20. In this, he follows the scholarly Kasemann's lead, so I anticipate he has important good scholarship on his side.Aside from the scholarly (Kasemann) and the lay (Bruce, Barclay, and Wright) commentaries, one may also wish to consider the theologically based commentaries from, for example Martin Luther and John Barth. These approaches may be great for a history of ideas, but they are to be avoided as a best source of what Paul was really saying. Luther and other early Reformation leaders saw Paul as a supporter of their own agenda. But, while Luther may have been seeing Paul correctly on many points, he may also have been misreading Paul's emphasis and especially misreading him on Paul's analysis of the failure of the Jews.My first choice for a lay commentary is Wright's monograph cited above. The only problem with that is that you need to buy the whole volume X or read it while sitting in your library's reference room stacks. On the other side of the coin, if you or your church can spring for the entire \`New Interpreter's Bible', you have scholarly works on the entire scripture. And, I find Wright's text easier for aging eyes to read, and his bibliography is more current (however, I found nothing of importance missing from Bruce's bibliography)."},{"Title":"Romans: Tyndale New Testament Commentaries","review":"&lt;romans_bruce.jpg&gt; An very sound commentary on the book of Romans by F.F. Bruce. Bruce explains well Paul's stance on righteousness, faith, the Law and it's modern application to the Church of God. He shows that Paul does indeed distinguish between the natural Jews, and the Spiritual Jews.Bruce also fills you in on the historical setting in which Paul wrote the epistle to the Romans, and concerning the possible additions to the text. Bruce breaks Romans up into several sections so you can better analyize the book of Romans and a quickly make reference. Full of wonderful quotes of not only other commentaries on Romans, but some very excellent sayings of Bruce himself. A very insightful commentary that everybody should own.A favorite quote of mine from the book...Should a man not lay his hand upon his mouth before he criticizes his brethren? When we pass swift, uninformed, unloving and ungenerous judgments, surely we have forgotten that if we speak evil of them, at the same time we speak evil of the Lord whose name they bear. p. 232"},{"Title":"The historians' history of the world;: A comprehensive narrative of the rise and development of nations as recorded by over two thousand of the great writers of all ages;","review":"\\"The Historians' History of the World\\", editor: Henry Smith Williams, at least 2 versions: (a) the original \\"Hooper & Jackson\\" publishers [in conjunction with \\"The History Association\\" (London, England) and the \\"Outlook Co.\\" (NYC)] in 25 volumes with a later 2 volumes totaling 27 volumes, released between 1904-1909; and (b) all 27 volumes compacted into 15 volumes, as released by \\"The Encyclopedia Britannica\\" (England) that was released in 1926 (with at least 5 editions).

Covering a product as huge as Axapta in less than 500 pages is impossible, so choosing the right level of detail is vital. The authors chose the same approach as the online documentation shipping with the product. They describe in a clear and easy digestible language the most important forms in great detail. The online documentation has rightfully been accused of not providing procedural information (Step-by-step descriptions of how to accomplish tasks spanning multiple forms) or overview information (How everything ties together). Unfortunately this book does not provide that information either. Since the page count is limited one could have hoped non-trivial information was prioritized. That isn't the case. This book is however more than just a rewrite of the online documentation. It contains many valuable and interesting insights where appropriate. Don't expect this book to give you a lot of new information; but it gives you the opportunity to bring it all to the beach.The content in the book is fairly accurate, and fairly complete. If you are new to Axapta it will help you, if you already are somewhat familiar with the product, the technical inaccuracies and missing key information may throw you off track. An example of missing key information is in the X++ chapter. Here both transaction and exception handling are well described in sequent subchapters. However not a word is mentioned on how they interact, which is something every X++ developer needs to understand to write business logic. Hopefully this and many similar issues will be ironed out in a revised edition.The architecture chapter is quite a disappointment to me, as it mostly describes deployment scenarios and lists the files that come with the product. The chapters on development and X++ will not teach you to be an Axapta developer. Just like reading a car's manual won't teach you how to drive. In the book there are no examples of business code, but a lot of screenshots and descriptions of the MorphX toolbox. The structure and contents of the development chapters makes me wonder if the authors ever used MorphX themselves.The book has an edge towards Microsoft, which at times is mind-opening, but mostly plain ignorant. At times it seems more focused on finding ways to crash the system, than ways to successfully avoid the crashes.By the way: Don't be tricked by the book's title. The book is about Axapta version 3.0 released in 2002. \\"Dynamics AX\\" is the name of version 4.0 scheduled to release in 2006."},{"Title":"Dynamics AX: A Guide to Microsoft Axapta","review":"It would have saved me a lot of time, effort and pain if I had had this book when I started.

However, learning math helps if you understand the fundamental topics. If you miss the fundamentals God help you.I said this to say that this book is not for the experts who are looking for something deep, it opens your eyes to the fundamentals and gives you a base to start with. I am a self learner and I find a lot of the materials for Axapta hard to grasp if you do not understand the fundamentals.

The stories are concise,(about three pages long) explaining the stories of the old testament, in chronological order. Very easy to read for devotions and easily understandable to children, while giving them all the important elements of the stories."},{"Title":"Teaching manual for Jesus of History, Christ of Faith","review":"I go to a Catholic high school and am in the tenth grade. I must say that this book fails utterly in what it is striving to do, to give teenagers an interesting base for their faith in Jesus. I think that it would be so much better if we just studied straight out of the bible. Right now I am studying for a midterm in Religion based on this text book. It is so disillusioning what people do with Chrisianity. They focus so much on the religion part that they forget the true meaning of faith in Christ. I have read the whole bible through a number of times, in addition to devouring any book I can get my hands on. This is not good material."},{"Title":"Teaching manual for Jesus of History, Christ of Faith","review":"The invitation and the challenge to come to your own recognition of Jesus-offered to you by the larger community and in this course - is an intensely personal one. The intent of this invitation is not to compel you to accept faith in Jesus. What can and must be asked of you, however, is that you take the person and message of Jesus seriously and recognize the questions he posed about the meaning of life as central to your own struggle to be come a mature person. What you ultimately decide about him is for you to determine with honesty, openness, and integrity. That you must decide is a reality that can be postponed but not permanently avoided. This is a paragraph from page 279. This refers to the paperback edition."},{"Title":"Teaching manual for Jesus of History, Christ of Faith","review":"This book strives to make a young person interested in their faith. However it is completely saturated with higher criticism. It does not strengthen a persons faith but rather it brings doubts. Infact throughout the entire book they seem to remind you that our faith is based on nothing but a book, a book that may be fatally flawed.Of course if you like that stuff this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Teaching manual for Jesus of History, Christ of Faith","review":"I bought this because my son's Catholic religion teacher is still using it suplementally, and I wanted to check it out. I question whether the author is really Catholic. It is texts such as this that lead students away from truth. I would recommend the Didache series developed by Scott Hahn."},{"Title":"Teaching manual for Jesus of History, Christ of Faith","review":"This book is a fine expression of faith- for liberal Protestants. For Catholics, \\"JOHCOF\\" represents the indoctrination of new generations with the same confusion everyone has felt in the recent frenzy in the Church. Used as a teaching tool, this is especially deadly to the Faith. Every thing a Catholic would have learned just half a century ago is openly rebuked in this mess. To the writers, Jesus is just a man who lived in Galilee. Every thing supernatural- from the miracles to the appearance of the star and the magi at Christ's birth are all analyzed from a \\"scientific\\" viewpoint to try and explain away the Divinity of Christ and the historicity of the Gospels. The Church teaching on the authors of the Pentateuch and much of the New Testament are thrown aside; this book prefers to make use of secular \\"scholars\\" in cracking the origins of the Bible. The whole book is about \\"Jesus the Jew,\\" and makes it appear as though He never renounced the immense errors of Judaism. It adds a vocabulary word- \\"anti-Semitism\\" for anyone who espouses the traditional teaching on Christ's criticism of the Pharisees and the Jews' eventual murdering of Christ out of envy- both sound Catholic doctrines. The book lacks any element of the rich sacred Catholic Tradition as well. There are hundreds of images of Jews worshipping in their synagogues and Mohammedans in their mosques but you will find not a single image of the Roman Mass, the only Sacrifice that actually goes to the True God, as used by the Holy Church for 2,000 years. The book teaches the very anti-Christian heresy of syncretism, and denies that the Church is the only way to salvation in Heaven. No teachings about Catholic doctrines such as Purgatory, and nothing about the Popes and the teachings of the Holy Office against heresy. No teachings about the usage of Latin as the universal language of the Church, the language used in the Mass, which is the offering of the Sacrifice at Cavalry, not a meal like the Protestants have. The Catholic Church is just an accident left over by the life of a Jewish man 2,000 years ago, if this book is to be taken at face value. The only time the Catholic Church is mentioned at all is in the last few pages- to mention the wonderful \\"fruits\\" of the \\"Second Vatican Council,\\" the source of all this confusion. When will these people stop kidding themselves and cut this charade out? It is a shame that something coming out of \\"St. Mary's Press\\" is such a sorry peace of work, but there is no doubt this book would hit the Index Librorum Prohibitorum if Pope St. Pius X saw this abominable Modernist piece being circulated. Stick to the doctrinal security of the Roman Catechism, and avoid this large editorial on what liberal laypeople want the Church to teach. Pray for an end of this grand mockery... the Catholic Church is the Church of the Christ of Faith, Jesus of History established Her in A.D. 33 and She is the Defender of the Sacred Deposit of the Faith, not these Modernists."},{"Title":"Teaching manual for Jesus of History, Christ of Faith","review":"This beautiful piece of work s filled with pretty pictures and wonderfull lessons on history. The books uses carefully chosen historical facts to back up it's commentary. While explaining the life of the ancient Jews during Jesus' time, the book uses this carfully chosen historical fact, \\"The Jews were great walkers.\\" The book is filled with these beautifully stated facts. Another example: \\"A day for the Jew begins at sunset.\\" The book goes on to contrast the difference between Jesus and the Jews. Examples of this are the comparison between the Jew's narrow-minded love for only eachother, and Jesus' love for everyone. The Jew's view on the inferiority of women, the ill, the homeless, and the crippled, and Jesus' acceptance of them. The Jew's journey in the desert and failing to stay true to God, and Jesus' success in staying faithful. The brilliant comparisons lead to the book's conclusion that the key to faith is recognizing flawed Judaism and accepting Jesus as the new and improved version.It is fact."},{"Title":"Teaching manual for Jesus of History, Christ of Faith","review":"My son needed this book for school.

I had access to it elsewhere but it was only available in poorly used condition."},{"Title":"Teaching manual for Jesus of History, Christ of Faith","review":"This book is based on a very flawed Christology that denies the divinity of Jesus. It brings doubt, not faith. It has been found by the American bishops to not be in conformity with the Catechism of the Catholic Church. I am appalled that there are Catholic high schools who are still using this text."},{"Title":"The Arm and the Darkness","review":"It is a unique experience to read a period piece and feel that when you're finished you have learned things that can easily be applied to your own world. Connecting history like that to the present is very amazing.Set in pre-revolutionary France in the days of Cardinal Richelieu, Taylor Caldwell brings to life the man the forever changed France in ways surpassed by none other than perhaps Napolean Bonaparte. Each character comes from opposing religions, ideals, and childhood experiences and they influence eachother in very profound ways.Besides feeling connected to a period so distant from us, this novel explores the possibilities of human interaction and how much a person can change. If you enjoy history as well as exploring our own humanity and relationships we forge, you will not be disappointed by this book. The beginning is very exciting then it staggers a bit, but it picks up right till the end. Truly, a great book."},{"Title":"The Arm and the Darkness","review":"Caldwell sets this novel in 17th century France, when the persecutions of the French Protestant Huguenots is about to resume after a hiatus of tolerance. She offers her usual vivid portraits of characters, especially the wily Cardinal Richelieu, and a vivid depiction of the bitterness of the poverty of Paris peasants. The novel culminates in the dreadful siege of Rochelle, which led to the Huguenots' mass exodus to the New World, where they founded New Rochelle. Caldwell's usual flaws are evident here--why is everone so &quot;inexorable,&quot; so bitter, so alientated, so all-or-nothing in their approach? Still, this novel is a highly entertaining account of this turbulent period in French history, and Caldwell's many fans won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Arm and the Darkness","review":"As hostilities flare between Catholic and Huguenot, Cardinal Richelieu relentlessly pursues the favors of Queen Anne. The story tells the saga of two brothers, Arsene de Richepin and Monsieur de Rechepin, personal secretary of Cardinal Richelieu. They represent two opposite worlds which never will meet each other. The author has a similar style as Dumas in telling some historical facts, the pre-revolutionary ideas of Paul de Vitry and the high price he payed for this, the dramatic siege of La Rochelle by the french and english people."},{"Title":"The Arm and the Darkness","review":"Book looked like hundreds of people had just read it. I haven't read it yet. Because to small print-worn etc.Of course Taylor Caldwell will not disappoint me."},{"Title":"The Yellow Fairy Book","review":"When I was younger my Mom used to read me a book until I fell asleep. As I grew older, I began to read myself to sleep. As things changed only one thing stayed constant, my favorite books are still Andrew Lang's Fairy books. The Yellow Fairy book is a collection of 48 fairy tales written the way they were supposed to be written. Each tale ranges in length anywhere from a couple of pages up to about 20. The tales are fairly easy reads, but they don't lose any of their appeal. The book also contains several wonderful illustrations.Some of the stories include: The Six Swans, Story of the Emperor's New Clothes, The Crow, The Cat and the Mouse in Partnership, The Three Brothers, The Magic Ring, How to Tell a True Princes, Thumbelina, and more.I would suggest reading this book, I love it!"},{"Title":"The Yellow Fairy Book","review":"With tales such as The Blue Mountains, The Cat and the Mouse in Partnership, The Dragon and His Grandmother, Fairer-than-a-Fairy, The Flower Queen's Daughter, The Glass Axe, How To Tell a True Princess, and many others how can anyone not find this book fun to read? Once again, Lang edits a book full of fairy tales from many lands that will entertain children and adults. The black and white illustrations are also superb."},{"Title":"The Yellow Fairy Book","review":"What makes this particular volume of Lang's collection remarkable is its collection of quite unknown stories. While we all love \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" and \\"Cinderella\\", there is nothing wrong with venturing for more complex stories, and that is what this volume provides.I have not researched these, but I am under the impression that many of these stories were actually \\"written\\". I'm not sure how everyone will take that threat to oral folklore, but good fantasy is good fantasy, and I enjoy reading a fairy tale-esque story with extra complexity that still holds the same aura.The illustrations are gorgeous, as usual, and display intricacies that fit the stories superbly.Perhaps a more wild collection, but for that I love it all the more."},{"Title":"The Yellow Fairy Book","review":"In the late 19th century, historian, scholar, and anthropologist, Andrew Lang, began publishing collections of fairy tales from around the world. The first volume was \`The Blue Fairy Book' published in 1887. Lang was not a true ethnologist, like the German Brothers Grimm. He was far more the \`translator' than collector of tales from the source, stories transcribed from being told by people to whom the tales were passed down by word of mouth. In fact, many stories in his first volume, such as Rumpelstiltskin; Snow White; Sleeping Beauty; Cinderella; and Hansel and Gretel were translated from Grimm's books of fairy tales. Some of his \`fairy tales' were even \`copied from relatively recent fantasy fiction, such as A Voyage to Lilliput, the first of the four episodes in Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels.My inspiration for commenting Lang's series of fairy tale books is for the sheer quantity of tales, the wonderful woodcut illustrations, some few of which may have become almost as popular as the tales (although not quite in the same league as Sir John Tenniel's illustrations for Lewis Carroll's great fantasies), and the fact that I had these when I was young.With twelve of these books, with between 30 and 36 stories in each book, this gives one about 400 different stories. If I were to recommend anything as standard equipment at a grandparents' house, it would be a complete set of these books.Needless to say, there are a few \`warnings' to accompany books assembled over 100 years ago. You will encounter a fair number of words with which even an adult may be unfamiliar, let alone a five year old. For example, on the second page of The Princess Mayblossom in The Red Fairy Book, a character puts sulfur in a witch's porridge. This requires at least three explanations. What is sulfur, what is porridge, and why is sulfur in porridge such a bad thing. More difficult still is when a prince entered the town on a white horse which \`pranced and caracoled to the sound of the trumpets'. In 19th century London, caracoling (making half turns to the right and the left) was probably as common and as well known as \`stepping on the gas' is today. But, if you're a grandparent, that's half the fun, explaining new words and ideas to the young-uns.There is another \`danger' which may require just a bit more explanation, although in today's world of crime dramas on TV, I'm not sure that most kids are already totally immune to being shocked by death and dead bodies. In these stories, lots of people and creatures get killed in very unpleasant ways, and lots of very good people and creatures suffer in very unpleasant ways. It's ironic that the critics in Lang's own time felt the stories were 'unreality, brutality, and escapism to be harmful for young readers, while holding that such stories were beneath the serious consideration of those of mature age'. The success of a whole library of Walt Disney feature length cartoons based on these stories is a testament to how well they work with children. But do be warned, Uncle Walt did clean things up a bit. Lang's versions hold back on very little that was ugly and unpleasant in some of these stories.The down side to the great quantity of stories is that even when some come from very different parts of the world, there is a remarkable amount of overlap in theme, plot, and characters. But by the time you get to another story of a beautiful young girl mistreated by a stepmother, it will have been several month since you read Cinderella or the Little Glass Slipper in The Blue Fairy Book. The other side of the coin is that you can play the game of trying to recall what that other story was with a similar theme.There is one very big word of caution about buying these books through Amazon or a similar on line outlet. I stopped counting when I got to twelve different editions of The Blue Fairy Book, or a volume including several of these books. Not all of these editions have the original woodcuts and even worse, not all have a table of contents and introduction. The one publisher which has all twelve volumes is by Dover. Other publishers, such as Flying Chipmunk Publishing (yes, that's it's name) also have all the original illustrations, table of contents, and introduction, but I'm not certain that publisher has all twelve volumes. Dover most certainly does, as I just bought all twelve of them from Amazon.While I suspect these stories may have been \`old hat' for quite some time, it may be that with the popularity of Lord of the Rings, the Narnia stories, and the Harry Potter stories, all of which have their share of suffering and death, that these may be in for a revival. Again, the main attraction is that for relatively little money and space, Grammy and Grandad get a great resource for bonding with children."},{"Title":"The Yellow Fairy Book","review":"This edition is very incomplete. I should have done more research and found a better publisher. There is no picture or table of contents, just jumps right into the stories without intro or explanation. I wouldn't mind that if there were at least a table of contents to direct my use of the book. I also haven't started reading the stories to my kids just yet, but the idea is that this is a collection of classics, so I am eager to dive in soon."},{"Title":"The Yellow Fairy Book","review":"This is part of a collection that I am ordering, a few at a time. I hope to have the whole set displayed in my dining room available for my grand-children and I to share."},{"Title":"The Yellow Fairy Book","review":"My biggest problem with this book is there is no table of contents. Every time I look for a particular story, I have to look through the entire volume, which contains maybe forty fairy tales, maybe more. I just can't fathom how any publisher would have thought this incomplete volume would be a good idea."},{"Title":"The Yellow Fairy Book","review":"The colored fairy tale books by Andrew Lang include stories from around the world. This is no exception--it even contains 3 Native American stories and 3 from Iceland! Others come from Hungary, Poland, Russia, Germany, France and England. The illustrations by H. J. Ford in each of the colored fairy tale books by Lang are marvelous creations in black ink. Dover books can get colored pictures wrong, but for black and white illustrations they are great. Don't miss the whole series--start with the Blue book."},{"Title":"The Yellow Fairy Book","review":"Did our mothers really read these stories to us?? I was so surprised when I started reading these stories aloud to my husband. I thought it would be fun to reminisce since I did my very first book report on one of the stories in this book. But when I read the stories, one after the other, I was shocked to see the violence in each one. I guess the memory filters out the bad stuff, or else my mother gave her own rendition of the endings. It was fun, though, to go back to the old stories and read the classics. But don't delude yourself about the \\"good old days.\\" They were just as violent as they are today! And that goes for cartoons as well."},{"Title":"The Yellow Fairy Book","review":"As much as I was looking forward to this book it disappointed in many ways, it seems stale in today's fantasy literature.

He also manages also to so us once again that these were people and not icons. While fiction, it is easy to visualize the petty argumnets and personality struggles within this group that most of us assume was a cohesive unit with a united purpose. Using his now familiar device of switching back and forth from now and then, Martin paints a living picture of the early history of the Cape. This was the last of Martin's books that I read prior to Citizen Washington. I hesitated because I thought the topic limited but I ended learning and enjoying a compelling history of a special niche in American history.Martin demonstrates an uncanny ability to tell the great stories (Annapolis - US Navy) a the small (Cape Cod) and make them breathe."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"At least not in William Martin's novel of the same name. In Martin's CAPE COD there are feuding families, long-held secrets, regional history and, tying it all together, a mystery - as well as those wondrous beaches and that natural essence of 'The Cape' (as we New Englanders know and love it) that he brings to life in this story.From the first pages of this novel, in which whales inexplicably beach themselves, Native Americans and White men clash, and the Pilgrims, noble, flawed and human as they were, suffer the awful indignities of the relentless voyage to the New World, we're off on a William Martin-style adventure. As is his BACK BAY and ANNAPOLIS, the story unfolds through the eyes of (sometimes warring - always interesting) families, and jumps back and forth in time. This enables us to feel the historical events that are going to impact on the modern-day intrigue. I have always liked this about William Martin's stories. This sense of what it was like 'then,' how people felt, how they acted. We get to enjoy a well written tale and learn a thing or three along the way. Martin's respect for, and love of, history is evident throughout CAPE COD, as it is in ANNAPOLIS, BACK BAY and CITIZEN WASHINGTON. And his reverence for 'The Cape' will be evident to every reader, especially we Cape lovers! For us, that's a bonus. To read CAPE COD is to feel, in those pages, that essence of 'TheCape,'that infuses us as soon as we have crossed the Sagamore and the Bourne bridges....CAPE COD is a wonderful story, a lesson in our history, and the kind of enlightening adventure we have come to expect from William Martin. As usual, he delivers! Read this book...Perhaps sitting in a lounge chair on a sunny summer day at the edge of Old Silver Beach...You'll be glad you did...."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"As a devout reader of Michener, Rutherford and Jakes, William Martin's Cape Cod is just as good as anything written by those authors. I judge historical novels on how well they capture the 'sense of place' of the region they focus on. I have spent summers in Cape Cod when I was very young and am currently delving into the genealogy of New England families, and for me, Cape Cod really captured the historical and present-day feelings of the land and the people extremely well."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"I am a history buff here at Harvard and search for novels that capture the power and essence of the time they cover. I have found such a novel in Cape Cod by William Martin, a riveting, very well researched tale of power, romance and intrigue. I could not put it down, a comment I rarely use."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"Cape Cod is the kind of book you can't put down. Makes you question many of the characters actions; making you, the reader involved in the Bigelow/ Hilyard fued. A wonderful book to learn from about being human and human actions."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"I read &quot;Annapolis&quot; and became a fan of William Martins'. Now...

Tracing the history of two Mayflower families in their personal, economic and political struggles provides an entertaining way to learn more about American history! A must-read book!"},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"The Bigelows and the Hilyards have lived on Cape Cod for going on four centuries, and they began getting on each other's nerves while still on the Mayflower. William Martin, way back in 1992, wrote a saga about these families. Jack Hilyard is a nonconformist trouble maker, and Ezra Bigelow builds his life around what he perceives to be divine providence. Right down to the present day, their descendants have feuded about land, religion, race relations, money, independence, and whatever other issue is important at the moment.But it seems the Mayflower's captain, Christopher Jones, wrote a journal about the journey, and that pesky book has been appearing and disappearing ever since he returned to England. For Jones writes about the mysterious death of Governor Bradford's wife, and Ezra Bigelow was the last person to see her alive. What a coup it would be locate this priceless account; the financial return alone would be fabulous, never mind that one of the feuding clans would finally have the last laugh on the other.The historical sections of Cape Cod are well done, and the family stories are engaging, particularly because Martin has done his homework. The 20th century descendants, however, descend into squabbling and bickering about money, money, money. The old and new parts of the saga are presented alternately, and I found myself skipping the new stuff to return to the historical. Martin managed to steer clear of annoying anachonisms, and made it fun to learn about how people learned to survive and then thrive on the arm-shaped spit of land that juts off the eastern side of Massachusetts."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"This book is, without a doubt, one of the best books I have ever read. The characters aren't loveable, but they are so human and real that it pulls you right into the story. The plot never gets dull, as it keeps changing time periods with different points. Even though I just recently finished it, I feel as though I could pick it up right now and read it again. It is relatively long, but completely worth the time that it takes to read.The ending isn't as good as it could be, meaning about the last 3 pages, but considering how amazing the rest of the book was, that doesn't really bother me at all."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"This book is a must read for anybody who owns property on, or has become intimately involved with Cape Cod. The historical aspect of two \\"firster\\" families brings out the strife and the reality of coming to the new world without the glamour given it in our grade school history books. It involves areas that have been known to me all my life on family trips, but more so in adult life with summers overlooking Nauset Beach, complete with Bay seals, stranded hump backs, beaches closed to protetect the Piping Plovers and so much more. It shows today's all too familiar struggles of property owners striving to keep the beauty that is Cape Cod. People who no longer even consider the upper Cape south of Chatham, a part of Cape Cod proper any more."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"This is a wonderful version of the settling of Cape Cod. The story begins before the boats arrive in the New World and follows a family's struggle through the present time. The history is interwoven with his fictional town. I read this after I visited Cape Cod for the first time and loaned my copy to a friend from the area. It didn't find its way home and I bought another copy. Highly recommended. The flashback chapters which are worked into the story may be confusing, but stick with it, this is a great book. My novels are set just north of Cape Cod on the Cape Ann coast and I'd love to read his take on Cape Ann."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"The book was wonderful! I couldn't put it down -- until I got to the end where William Martin could have ended it in several ways. Instead, he chose to end it, and end it, and end it . . .

Books like this make history exciting and memorable. I have read several of his books and will read the rest."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"This was a great read. It is my fourth Martin book. My first was Annopolis, which I found to be reveting. My second was Citizen Washington and then, (back to back) Back Bay and Cape Cod. Martin's fiction equals that of Jackes and Michener. I just retured from a visit to the Boston area; unfortunately, I didn't visit Cape Cod. After reading this book, I want to go back!"},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"Another fantastic read by this wonderful author. History comes alive. One learns a lot by reading his books. We learn that the Pilgrims were just like us except they had nothing except their desire to make a better life and a deep abiding faith in their Lord. It is always amazing to me how humans can treat each other--just because one does not believe as I do does that mean we must cause harm to them. This book is one tense moment to another and just when you think you have figured it our here comes another Martin wave to wash your thoughts away to replace it with another Martin wave of intrigue and suspense.There is also many tender moments. A lot of beach time and enjoying the scenery. Everyone needs to take some of this time for themselves--look out at life as you read this book and count your blessings. We were founded by some very intelligent people who brought many good ideas with them. Mr. Martin's book should be a must read for every American."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"I like the historical parts of this piece of fiction.

CAPE COD is an outstanding read dating to the time the Mayflower approached our shores. After completing this novel, I read Nathaniel Philbrick's non-fiction MAYFLOWER, and discovered that, in addition to being a wonderful storyteller, William Martin is an excellent historian.The author creatively presents the conflicts over the centuries between the Hilyard and Bigelow families, intertwined in the present with the struggles of the married couple at the heart of the story. Having read THE LOST CONSTITUTION, HARVARD YARD, BACK BAY and CAPE COD, this is my favorite Martin novel."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"Fantastic book that alernates historical passages with present-day passages.

I keep my book journal on my desk with the names of all authors that I check on occasionally for new offerings - and William Martin has soared to the top of the list. His characters are full bodied, flawed, human, believable and impossible to leave. The history is infallible and tangible. The story line is akin to your own family history. This book is over 700 pages and I felt like I flew through the centuries and grieved when it was through. I then purchased ALL his other books. This man has an amazing talent and you will do a disservice to your reading life if you miss out on his books. Please read!"},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"The amazing amount of detail in this fascinating novel leads me to believe that these are &quot;real&quot; people. The excellent genealogy charts are a must to follow along with the story. Where can I find more facts on the Pilgims?"},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I have moved to the Boston area only a year ago, and this book has helped me learn a lot about the life in and around Cape Cod since 1621.

I highly recommned it to any reader who enjoys historical novels (the best!)."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"This book is an interesting historical drama about two families with a long history of not getting along. The book alternates between historical chapters and present day (1991) chapters; the historical chapters begin with the Pilgrim voyage and then slowly progress up to the 1960s or thereabouts. I personally found the historical chapters to be the most interesting and was happy that they tended to be much longer than the ones that took place in the present. I read this before my planned Cape Cod vacation and, while I haven't gone there yet, I think it was a good way to get ready and learn a great deal about the area's history, geography, and character."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"Cape Cod, Engrossing..Entertaining..The perfect book to take to the beach-so says the Boston Sunday Hearld. A mixture of truth..and misleading fallacy.. Entertaining? Slightly..Engrossing? hardly. I had to force feed parts of it to my brain..other parts I simply skimmed, How much DESCRIPTION is a person expected to sustain? Annapolis was the first book I read by William Martin, I instantly feel in love, and mistakenly thought the seeming lack of depth to the \\"story\\" near the end of the book was a conscious effort to bring the reader down easily. In the reading of Cape Cod..I find the same shallow feel to the 20th century aspects of the book.Cape Cod is a yoyo, sucking you down into the past, wrapping you in the arms of another time,engulfing you in the beauty of a well told tale, then jerking you up, ripping away the comfort of oblivion and rudely inserting you into the black embrace of..here and \\"now\\".I enjoy Martins' tales of the past, I do not enjoy his depiction, or characters of the 20th century, he lacks..something in that area, and leaves me wondering if the same man mints both sides of the coin. One interesting thing about this book, which amused me greatly and had me applauding, is that there is not one single character amoung the many, that is even partially likable, which satisfys my misanthropic view of the world. Martin should stick to weaving words which draw A picture of the world behind us..and leave others to dwell in the present..I think I'll try Nerve Endings next.. Who wants to send it to me? As it seems to be out of print.. *sigh*"},{"Title":"The Great Los Angeles Swindle: Oil, Stocks, and Scandal During the Roaring Twenties","review":"For those of who grew up in Los Angeles during the 1960s, much of the past was obscured, unless you went to the Huntington Library or had access to good oral history from those who lived in the City of Angels while it was growing up, in the 1920s and 30s. My parents never told me of the great oil land grabs, although they were a big part of Angeleno lore. My mother the historian was more aware of the auto companies' diabolical shutdown of the street-car system in the late 1940s, and of the Hollywood Blacklist period, than of the land-and-resource grabbers.Tygiel has thoroughly researched this history of the pitchmen and speculators who ripped through fertile Los Angeles looking for black gold. Sleazy-though-lovable salesmen, corrupt (and virtuous) district attorneys, town fathers-- all are portrayed here by an unbiased journalist and student of L.A. history who should do more books on the subject.I am a fifth-generation Californian who has lived in New York for many years, and I thirst for more history of my hometown (Los Angeles) at every turn. Jules Tygiel has sated that thirst for the time being with his cogent take on the LA of the (fictional) Chinatown era. Now, he should get a three-book deal to write even more about the period, which I shall earnestly await."},{"Title":"The Great Los Angeles Swindle: Oil, Stocks, and Scandal During the Roaring Twenties","review":"This book reads like a well-written detective story, with fascinating characters, unforseen plot twists, and a breezy narrative style. It is, unbelieveably, a true story, which makes it even more mind-boggling.For native Angelenos, another fascinating feature of the book is the history of the city's development. This was a formative period when city fathers were just beginning to aspire to civic greatness. Tygel has woven LA's history through the book and dropped in wonderful historical tidbits."},{"Title":"The Great Los Angeles Swindle: Oil, Stocks, and Scandal During the Roaring Twenties","review":"Con-men, scandal -- this well-written narrative history of Los Angeles in the 1920s reads like a great movie. Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Great Los Angeles Swindle: Oil, Stocks, and Scandal During the Roaring Twenties","review":"I first came across this in another bookA Bright and Guilty Place: Murder, Corruption, and L.A.'s Scandalous Coming of AgeAs I have become more concerned about the level of rampant fraud that has overtaken much of the private sector I decided to order this book.What this book deals with is not 1 but at least 2 swindles in which the \\"Julian Petrouelum Corporation\\" figured. In the early 1920's one C.C. Julian formed the above named \\"business\\" and began running ads in the Los Angeles newspapers, employing colorfull language as a sales gimmick.Julian would these ads urging new residents of Los Angeles, who had just come into money to invest in his corporation where he claimed that his oil wells in among other places Santa Fe Springs CA, where Juilan claimed there was more oil than there was in Texas.The book goes into the hucksterrism of Santa Fe Springs where inside the various tents there were bars and houses of prositution.Quite early Julian begins to run afoul of the \\"Corporations Department of California\\" which is claiming (correctly) that there has been an overissuse in the amount stock of sold.This happens at the same that Julian has also run afoul of the powerful and hated Harry Chandler and the \\"Los Angeles Times\\" who are aligned with Standard Oil and who are denouncing Julian and people like him.It then turns out that the \\"Corporations Commissioner\\" for California is a former employee of the Times and a personal friend of Chandler's.But Julian IS a con-artist of the 1st order instead of using the money that he gets through his subscriptions on plants and equipment etc. he uses it instead to lead a highly hednostic lifestyle.In 1924-25 Julian sells his \\"corporation\\" to an even bigger crook, S.C. Lewis who begins to develop an even bigger swindle the so-called \\"Million Dollar Pool\\" in which the most wealthy people in LA were involved in a conspiracy to defraud as many as 40,000 residents of Los Angeles of thier money.The so called \\"Julian Pete\\" collapses there is lots of tough talk aboutvox-populi by the D.A. but \\"deals\\" are struck and only very few of the crooks were ever brought to justice.I highly recomend this book, it is well worth whatever you pay for it."},{"Title":"The Great Los Angeles Swindle: Oil, Stocks, and Scandal During the Roaring Twenties","review":"Even though this isn't exactly my kind of book, I give it 5 stars, because I think the author did a fine job researching and writing about this unfortunate part of Los Angeles history. I became interested in the whole thing because of the death of Motley Flint, who played a role in this ordeal. I wanted to read all about it and see if it was all really true, and it is. I just don't need to know as much information as is written here---I get bored with court trial information and the financial parts of things, certainly when it comes to stocks and bonds and that sort of thing. But otherwise I real interesting story of early Los Angeles."},{"Title":"The Great Los Angeles Swindle: Oil, Stocks, and Scandal During the Roaring Twenties","review":"This book is banal.

If you are anything like me, a junior grade codger who's last study of a second language was sophomore Latin class 49 years ago, it's an intimidating thought. I've heard for years now how rich and enlightening the Greek language of the New Testament is, and how difficult it is to translate it into pedestrian English when there is no word-for-word equivalence, but my desire for such enlightenment never overcame my sloth.Dr. J.D. \\"Doc\\" Watson, pastor of Grace Bible Church in Meeker, Colorado, has solved my problem. That's \\"JD,\\" in the literary tradition of Salinger, MacDonald and Wetterling.... His daily devotional is entitled, A Word for the Day, published by AMG Publishers. One new foreign language word a day is just the right pace for a three score and three-year-old mind. Doc has done a wonderful job explaining each word with scripture support and historical linguistic background in a single page per word per day. But you won't get the full effect unless you begin each reading by going to Crosswalk's New Testament Greek Lexicon \\"based on Thayer's and Smith's Bible Dictionary plus others,\\" plugging in the Strong's number that Doc provides, and listening to it spoken correctly. As I replay the audio of the Greek word, I envision myself as a small boy sitting on the end of the dock beside a wizened old Greek fisherman as he repeats the words for me, complete with just the right degree of roll on the \\"r's.\\" And I realize that most of the preachers I have heard doing Greek work studies as part of their sermon mangle the pronunciation. For example, when a true Greek pronounces Abba (Mark 14:36 et al), the accent is on the second syllable, not the first, and the modern idiom translation--\\"daddy\\"--is a bit hyperbolic. Hearing Greek spoken by a Greek is also an excellent memory device. I write Crosswalk's phonetic spelling of the word under Doc's title word on the page as a further aid to memory. Of course you could, without buying the book, just read the Greek definitions at Crosswalk, but the words will not come alive and become memorable--and God's amazing grace will not shine--the way they do with Doc's word study and application for practical living. I'm just loving this devotional.In the interest of full disclosure, I have an endorsement in Doc's book, as if that is worth anything. It was solicited, but this review was not.Little is lost by starting anywhere in the book. As the back cover says, \\"These brief devotionals will enrich the mind, stir the soul, and empower the life of God's people.\\" Taste and see if you don't deepen your understanding of how blessed you are to be a kainos anthropos (2537, 444)."},{"Title":"A Word for the Day: Key Words from the New Testament","review":"As a Christian I have always wanted to learn Greek so I can have a better understanding of God's Word from the language the New Testament was originally written in. However I don't have years of time to take college level courses to learn all the nuances of the language. J.D.\\"Doc\\" Watson's book is the perfect way to learn Greek in \\"Baby Steps\\". His book is arranged in such a way that you learn a different Greek word each day of the year. Don't feel like you have to wait for January to start. Start today like I did. Each page has the date printed at the top. His descriptions are easy to understand and give practical ways to apply God's Word to daily life. Each day he gives you specific scriptures to find in your Bible further to enhance your study. I highly recommend this book for anyone who seeks to go deeper in your study of God's Word; from a new Christian to someone who has known the LORD for many years."},{"Title":"A Word for the Day: Key Words from the New Testament","review":"A great book for the serious Greek and/or Bible student.

Since the NT was written, they are no longer needed. He also says evangelists are really just church planters. Why, then, did God choose the foolishness of preaching to save men? Doesn't God appoint evangelists \\"to herald the Gospel;\\" to preach?He is weaving in HIS doctrine while he is supposed to be just giving us Greek definitions. Now I need to toss the book, or go back and re-read everything and strain out any previously unnoticed bias.I don't know Greek, so its going to be hard to spot where he uses definitions (and if his definitions are right) to \\"preach\\" his own theology.I never saw it coming - his take on the gifts. I'd like to know his eschatology - does he think all prophecy already happened, i.e. Antiochus Epiphanes already fufilled the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel? Has the tribulation already occured?I've been trusting this book to be a legitimate and unbias source of info on Greek vocabulary and I feel as if I've been sucker punched learning he decided apostles and prophets are no longer \\"offices\\" God appoints. I'm left wondering what else, in his theology, will I disagree with? And how can I trust his use of Greek?I saw that he also has a Word For The Day in Hebrew. Am I to assume he is both a Hebrew and Greek scholar?"},{"Title":"Linux Multimedia Guide","review":"Well, of course I would think that this is the greatest book because my son wrote it.

Sarah signed a contract with wealthy Ethan Pembroke in which the single schoolmarm gave up her newborn in exchange for some money. Ethan and his wife Priscilla plan to adopt the infant. Zach, who believes he has no conscience, thinks Ethan is being charitable.Sarah realizes her quest to hide with her beloved Danny is over. On the trail, she thinks back to when Ethan courted and seduced her, a naive teacher. She thought they would marry and even gave him access to her bank account, which he stripped bare. When she told Ethan she was pregnant, he, accompanied by Priscilla, explained the trap they set for her. They offered her cash and her reputation plus a home for the child. Sarah signed the contract, but fled with Danny three days after the lad was born. Meanwhile, Zach feels two new emotions, guilt and love, but still feels he must complete his obligation to Ethan.MONTANA BORN AND BRED is an entertaining and exciting western romance starring two wounded characters healed by love. The story line is very exhilarating especially on the trail, but the ending is a major stretch. The lead couple is a pleasant duo healing through love. Alexis Harrington has written a thrilling western romance that sub-genre fans will fully enjoy. Readers will get lost into the fantasy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Montana Born and Bred","review":"The story is about a woman (Sarah) with a newborn son (Danny)who is hiding in a small town in Montana, trying not to be found by her son's father. We learn fairly early on why she's hiding and we can feel her pain at the thought of losing her son to the boy's father. Unfortunately, early on in the book, a bounty hunter that was hired by Ethan (the father) named Zach, arrives on the scene and the story takes off from there. Ethan is ruthless, deceptive and cold hearted and the story that comes out about Ethan and Pricilla (you'll learn about her in the book) will have you wanting to hide Sarah and her baby from them. Zach was orphaned at an early age and lived on the streets until he ended up on one of the &quot;orphan trains.&quot; He's never cared about anyone and the only thing he ever wanted in life was to own his own land and to have something of his own. He won't let anything stop him from achieving his goals and tries to keep his conscience and his morals buried deep inside where they won't stop him from doing what he has to do to survive and achieve his goals. If anyone dislikes children in books, don't let that stop you from reading this one. Danny is a major character, but you will find your heart warming to him and he will not distract from the romance. All in all, it's a great story and one that fans of the author will want to read!"},{"Title":"Montana Born and Bred","review":"I have liked most of Ms. Harrington's books but I can find nothing to recommend her latest \\"Montana Born and Bred.\\" I had a hard time having any sympathy for Sarah or Zach.I didn't find either one of them to be interesting characters. Zach's many stories of his childhood seemed contrived and if they were meant to make the reader like him more, it didn't work. His motivations got especially fuzzy near the end. His desire to get his land back (because of his lack of a childhood home) wavered unconvincingly back and forth.Sarah was a weak character and it was never clear why she had to tell everyone the baby was her nephew when all she had to do was say her husband had died. How she got into the whole situation of being pregnant and unmarried only made her more unlikeable.The villains of this story are so way over the top they are a joke. It wasn't enough to make Priscilla, the woman who wants Sarah's baby, crazy, she's cruel to small animals, a murderer and a lesbian too! Her character just kept getting more ridiculous as the story progressed. The contemporary issues of adoption and the rights of the birth mother could have been so much more compelling if the author had used her abilities to write deeply emotional stories. Instead, she presents characters that could be rejects from a bad soap opera. This story is not up to the usual quality of Ms. Harrington's previous books and I hope this book is not a sign of what is to come."},{"Title":"Montana Born and Bred","review":"Great book, kept interest entire story, never lagged.

But Ethan only bothered seducing her to provide a child for his wife, Priscilla. That woman is a real piece if work!Bounty hunter Zach is an orphan from New York City who got the short end of the stick in his adoption from the orphan train. He hunts our heroine down for Ethan in order to get his ranch back. It's convoluted, but still realistic. Ethan has his sticky paws in a lot of different deals.It's a nicely developed love story with the requsite love scenes well written. It has quite a few twists and turns to keep it interesting.

Then the index in the back refers to the personell on albums. The AMG may list personell in the review, and indexes artists by any mention of them whether they are on an album or not. Penguin's version is much better for Jazz, where an artist's best work may be on someone else's album. Using the Penguin, you can look up every album Jack DeJohnette has played on as a sideman, just by flipping to the page numbers listed. In the AMG you have to wade through reviews (and many albums don't have reviews) which may just compare Jack's style with whoever is drumming on the record being reviewed.2- Not every album is reviewed. Many albums are left only with ratings and no commentary whatsoever, which can be frustrating if you are wondering whether to buy a specific album. WHY did something get the rating it did is more important than the rating itself.3- Consistency: The Penguin guide is written and judged by 2 men. As you go through it, you learn their biases and can glean more information about whether you'd like an album even if they give it a low score.4- Mistakes. There are several mistakes in the AMG. For example, calling Speak Like A Child Herbie Hancock's last album for Bluenote a paragraph after reviewing the Prisoner.To be fair though, there are advantages to the AMG:1- The Penguin Guide limits itself to CDs out at the time it is published. This means you are SOL if you buy vinyl or used cds that have since gone out of print or if an album is rereleased after the Penguin Guide date. I think the AMG lists all albums whether they are currently in print as CD or not.2- Tutorials. The AMG has essays in the back describing the many genres and time periods of jazz. In the body of the text are nice charts of the evolution of individual of instruments, from Saxophone to Bagpipes. Interesting though not vital if you are already into the music enough to need a definitive listing of albums."},{"Title":"All Music Guide to Jazz : The Definitive Guide to Jazz Music","review":"In addition to this great book, I own the Penguin guide and the Rough guide and all three are very worthwhile (see my other reviews). In my opinion this is the one you should buy first as it includes numerous essays and lists about jazz music styles, instrument types and musicians that the other two guides do not. These features are a really useful guide to knowing where to start with jazz. This guide also appears to have the largest number of reviews. The reviews in the AMG seem a bit more generous and open-minded than those in the more conservative Penguin guide. I suspect that this is because you are getting the opinions of a larger number of reviewers, with a wider range of tastes.

However to publish this new edition and keep the page-count constant with the 3rd, they have reduced the size of the type. It can be read if one has normal sight--but with difficulty. Older readers might well need a magnifying glass."},{"Title":"All Music Guide to Jazz : The Definitive Guide to Jazz Music","review":"I never go into a jazz store without the book or notes from the book in hand. It has rarely steered me wrong in ten years of use. Don't believe me. Just look up an artist you have several selections by already and see how close their observations are to your own.

The whole AMG series is fine but the jazz one is great especially if you are building your tastes or collection."},{"Title":"All Music Guide to Jazz : The Definitive Guide to Jazz Music","review":"This is THE resource for jazz record buying as it is far more comprehensive than any alternative. I take it with me to used vinyl stores because unlike any other guide, it attempts to include all major releases by an artist, not the ones that happen to be in print. On top of that, each artist and each release is considered in context, unlike the Penquin Guide, which attempts to apply a pecking order to artists based on their perceived &quot;significance.&quot;"},{"Title":"All Music Guide to Jazz : The Definitive Guide to Jazz Music","review":"This book covers the whole range of styles in Jazz, with specialist essays on individual areas, and 'family trees' of the key players in Jazz history.It is more comprehensive than any other volume I have found. The only area I have any critisism of it is in its coverage of European and British Jazz where (as I assume its an American publication) it is a little poor. For this reason it only gets 4 stars.

I, too, am a Type-A \\"good girl.\\" (\\"You need this report by Friday, would Thursday be better?\\") Fortunately for me, I was forced into a sabbatical before I really knew that I needed one (and then, of course, spent the next two years struggling with the fact that I had my entire identity wrapped up in my job/career, that only now am I beginning to enjoy life). I was floored when Mary Lou wrote about being so tired that incurring enough injuries to require a stay in the hospital (without being life-threatening) seemed an attractive way to take a break from the craziness. That thought had crossed my mind more times than I would like to admit. If you're thinking about taking time off, or are so tired that you can't even think, then you might want to pick this book up. Even if you can't financially swing a sabbatical, it's helpful to understand that you are not alone in feeling overwhelmed with your life."},{"Title":"Time Off for Good Behavior: How Hardworking Women Can Take a Break and Change Their Lives","review":"I have reviewed books for a major business magazine for over a year now, and I think this is one of the best I have seen.

Being a mother, a spouse, taking care of the house and managing a career doesn't always provide women with the time to take a break and consider what we want for ourselves.

She takes you into her own life as well as into the lives of many others, which ultimately becomes an invitation to take a nice, fresh look inward.

I loved the different perspectives that were woven into it -- including the psychology behind type A's, the variety of women's issues that were presented relating to work, life stage and lifestyle choices, and the impact this has on corporations.The actionable exercises at the end of the chapters were a great idea and can help women take the first steps towards assessing their own situations.

Mary Lou showed me how I can get more out of life and work by being smarter, better AND by taking it easy occasionally.

Anyone, male or female who wants to have a rich professional and personal life will gain by reading Mary Lou's insights."},{"Title":"Time Off for Good Behavior: How Hardworking Women Can Take a Break and Change Their Lives","review":"Mary Lou Quinlan really knows what she's talking about. As a thirtysomething single woman, reading \\"Time Off for Good Behavior\\" was extremely validating. Her own story and the stories of other women captured in this book are truly rivoting, and made me realize I am not alone. Amazing that the book summarizes how I've felt all of my working life(and even before then). A serious page-turner; you feel like you're having an initimate chat, rather than reading non-fiction."},{"Title":"Time Off for Good Behavior: How Hardworking Women Can Take a Break and Change Their Lives","review":"I can say no less about this book than it is a gift to anyone who reads it-- Type A burned out female exec, their children, their friends, their mothers, their employers, just about anyone who's been in life's express lane or been along for the ride, and feels like they deserve to exit.I may be a bit biased given that I am profiled in the book, and am at this very juncture finally getting my time off for good behavior after one failed effort last year.I can tell power of a book by the number of times I want to grab a pen to underline passages or dog ear the pages. This bit of wisdom from Mary Lou sticks with me today... \\"We are often our worst bosses, because as much as we expect of the world, it's nothing compared to what we expect from ourselves.\\" So give yourself a break, read this book, and enjoy every moment"},{"Title":"Time Off for Good Behavior: How Hardworking Women Can Take a Break and Change Their Lives","review":"At 49 years old, I realized that my daily routine was really getting me down. I couldn't figure out what was wrong. So I reduced my work day to 4 days a week and took a 20% pay cut. The first couple of weeks I was anxious about my expenses and then one day, I discovered Mary Lou's book. It confirmed that I did the right thing. Now I'm thinking of how to go into 2 days off a week, and then a 3 month break and return refreshed to a new career or my own business.This book is very encouraging and uplifting. It's a must read for women (and men) who lack the courage to take the plunge towards taking care of themselves after years of excessive focus on work that resulted in burn out. A great alternative to stress reducing medications!!!"},{"Title":"Time Off for Good Behavior: How Hardworking Women Can Take a Break and Change Their Lives","review":"When I purchased the book I was in the process of planning for a 6 week sabbatical. The book desctiprion sounded perfect. I'm Type A, and the author is a self-described Type A as well so I figured it would be a good fit. I definately found the book interesting, but it was more of a post-reflection memoir including stories from women she met. I was looking for something to match my type A personality that was more list-like. Action planning, etc. Now that I'm one week into my sabbatical, I can understand how quickly you move from list-girl to trying to tap into your emotions (since I neglect them in my working life).

I loved the combination of fact and anecdote that she has woven throughout. And yes, all her characters are women, but I think anyone who finds themself living the kind of life she describes -- mired in appointments, trying to be in three places at once, trying to please three or four different masters, etc -- that's the person who will get a lot out of this book. I find myself thinking of one or another anecdote, as it occurs in my work place, almost every day. And once you start to see the absurdity of what you're doing, you're on the road to recovery. I know I am!"},{"Title":"The Black Panther Party [Reconsidered]","review":"This is the first book to attempt to discuss the legacy of the Black Panther Party. The fact that a second book, Liberation, Imagination and the Black Panther Party, managed to continue the work begun here without significant overlap shows what a rich legacy it was.One essay, \\"The Black Panthers and the 'Undiscovered Country' of the Left\\" proposesthe novel idea that the Panthers had begun to emulate many aspect of an emerging nation-state by taking on the functions of provideng serverices for the community, setting up independent relations with other nations, etc., While this seemed to be unintentional, it does suggest the larger potential of the Party.It's important to realize that there were many Black Panther \\"chapters\\" that were inspired by the Oakland Panthers but developed autonomously and had different levels of political development. The Oakland BPP attempted to gather them all into one big centralized organization but had neither the political experience ,or the time [they were attacked by city, state and federal governments almost from day one] to properly pull it together. The essays by some of the ex-Party members in this volume provide great insight into the different ways in with the BPP were able to speak to local Black communities while encapsulating the grievances and hopes common to them all.The one weakness of the book is its defensiveness. The city, state and federal governments used the Panthers' militant politics and gun imagery to portray them as reckless thugs who covered up their criminal tendencies with political rhetoric. The authors in this book attempt to refute that by emphasizing the community organizing aspects of the BPP such as the free breakfast programs. However, none of the authors explored the question of whether the Panthers had a legitmate case for armed revolution in the US. By avoiding the debate, the authors seem to be ceding ground to the Pantthers' opponents.This book should not be seen as the final word but as the beginning of an important conversation. Anyone who wants to understand post-60's political movements can't avoid the fact that the Panthers helped shape the debates that continue up to our time. Read this book to see how."},{"Title":"The Black Panther Party [Reconsidered]","review":"This book is the first book that comes close to giving a balanced view of the history of the Black Panther party, its problems and its ultimate demise. It includes a view by regular rank and file members. It is well worth reading for those looking for an alternative to those books written by Party leaders, informants, or critics."},{"Title":"The Black Panther Party [Reconsidered]","review":"The Black Panther Party is perhaps one of the most misunderstood political movements in the U.S. due to government disinformation and harrassment and misperceptions magnified over the years that fiction is now considered fact.In one volume, the history of the party from 1966-1982 and beyond is presented through original writings from rank & file members and those in leadership roles and scholarly papers that cover a variety of issues, including inner-party gender relations, how the party fit into the Third World revolutionary movement and the grass-roots movement in each chapter to assist residents of all ages with nutrition and health-care.Perhaps most important is the extensive footnotes after each piece, which assists the reader in pursuing further material and dismisses any criticism that the author has some ulterior agenda by allowing opinion to supercede a conclusion based on research.Founded because the power structure maintained what I consider a plantation mentality to Black people in general and Black urban areas in particular and ultimately destroyed by the same power structure due to its programs of empowerment and solidarity, the real Black Panther Party may never truly be uncovered.But this book starts that process and it is as important a retrospective as any that has been published."},{"Title":"The Loom of Youth","review":"Alec Waugh (elder brother of Evelyn Waugh) wrote this semi-autobiographical and thinly disguised account of his teenaged student years at Sherbourne School in Dorset. In his next to last year, Alec and another boy were caught engaged in homosexual activity (later described as a \\"mild flirtation\\" and which his great-nephew, Alexander Waugh, opined was likely nothing more than kissing.) Nevertheless, Alec was expelled. In a fit of nostalgia and rebellion, Alec wrote The Loom of Youth over two months in early 1916 when he was 17 1/2 years old and training with the Army O.T.C.The Loom of Youth was published by his father's firm in 1917 just as Alec was shipped to France in The Great War. (Happily, Arthur Waugh was a writer and publisher in his own right.) It was considered a sensational evocation of public school life. It was notable for its frank portrayal of homosexuality which Alec wrote was \\"the inevitable emotional consequences of a monastic herding together for eight months of the year thirteen year old children and eighteen year old adolescents.\\" Although initially well reviewed, the book was later subject to a virulent letter campaign by public school masters and graduates decrying (and denying) its scandalous allegations. Alec Waugh went on to write novels (some of them quite racy), travel stories, magazine articles on wine and spirits and to briefly teach writing at a small college in Oklahoma.How has the book aged over the past near century? Like other 'school days' books of the time, we are treated to tales of athletics, cribbing for papers and exams, ragging masters and tricks played on other students. (I admit to skipping through the passages on rugby and cricket -- completely inscrutable to this American-bred reader.) Other readers have likened the novel to 'Tom Brown's School Days.' However, the greater debt is likely to Arnold Lunn's 'The Harrovians' (1913), which is discussed in The Loom of Youth. (Lunn's papers contain correspondence with Alec in 1917-18). Usual school boy antics can give readers a 'step back in time' frisson. Waugh's novel transcends, delving deeper as his protagonist Gordon nears graduation. Here is a real grappling with issues over the purpose of education and the student's own complicity in and responsibility for his academic growth.To modern eyes, the 'shocking' portion dealing with Gordon's 'romance' with Morcombe is anything but. Alec in the 1955 preface admits to its don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-it quality. Readers looking for racy boy sex will be disappointed. Readers will be rewarded with a remarkably well written book, particularly by one so young."},{"Title":"The Loom of Youth","review":"This book was written in the very early days of World War 1 and describes the author's time in a great english public school. It describes the era, the patriotism, the mores of the upper classes of England in the beginning of the 20th century. In many ways, it compares with the \\"Tom Brown's Schooldays\\" but describes the england of 80 years later. A huge change. A very interesting book indeed !It's also interesting that the author is the brother of Evelyn Waugh, who wrote \\"Brideshead Revisited\\". It's hard to imagine books that are so different !"},{"Title":"The Loom of Youth","review":"This is not so much a novel as an artifact. Much of it is practically incomprehensible due to a great deal of English-public-school vocabulary that few people living will be able to understand. There are pages of descriptions of \\"footer,\\" including sentences such as, \\"The last ball he placed in front of short-leg for a single,\\" and \\"The next ball was full pitch to leg,\\" but there are almost no details of the boys' academic studies or of the rest of their lives. The writing style is very terse and choppy, and the boys have no personalities. The jerkiness, the lack of explanations, and the lack of any character development at all, make reading this book a bizarre experience."},{"Title":"No Cash, No Fear: Entrepreneurial Secrets to Starting Any Business with No Money","review":"Funny man, Terry Alen, writing about his roller coaster ride in the world of business, revealing tips on how to start even when you have no money.May not work in some countries, read the book, you will find out!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"No Cash, No Fear: Entrepreneurial Secrets to Starting Any Business with No Money","review":"The only people who will ever really appreciate this book by Terry Allen are those who are deadly serious about being self employed. Those of us DO-ERS who are LIVING the \\"dream\\" have already woken up to the fact that yes - living the dream is fun and rewarding and also acknowledge that its at the same time a nightmare rollercoaster of ups and downs. Terry captures this perfectly. THERE IS NOT a real step by step guide to setting up business and being successful - if there was everybody would do it - and those looking for one are just dreamers and are bound to fail ! Why? because its all about Entrepeneurial spirit, enthusiasm and learning along the way. In the very rare instance of the lucky chips all lining up and your business being an immediately huge success - then thank your lucky stars! - but success brings all types of problems of its own and each situation and business is unique. So even these lucky few face problems at some point.Every page of this book speaks of a fascinating insight into what true Entrepreneurs are like and for those who can truly \\"SEE\\". - This book is full of great advice and warning.Those who spout about not getting anything from this book are solidly in the \\"dreamers only camp\\" and would clearly do better working up through management and hopefully reaching Director / or even Chairman where they rely on everybody around them to be the brains and creative ones driving the business forward!If you really have the passion and desire to be your own boss - then buckle-up and keep re-reading this superb biography. I was given this book from a fellow sucessful entrepreneur and we have thoroughly enjoyed what Terry Allen has had to say. As a business owner of three different businesses, two failed businesses behind me and percentage interests in another two businesses - I have certainly taken on board one or two of his more creative methods of solving problems.BTW - All entrepeneurs fall over at some point in being in business. They dont stay down (The \\"also-runs\\") they get back up and say NEXT. You dont ever fail until you give up !!! ;-)"},{"Title":"No Cash, No Fear: Entrepreneurial Secrets to Starting Any Business with No Money","review":"Most business books are so deadly dull that when something like Terry Allen's NO CASH NO FEAR comes along, I want to shout my joy from the rooftop! A reviewer here criticized Allen for having failed in so many of his enterprises. So? Isn't it valuable to learn from others' mistakes, as well as from their successes? Another reviewer said that this is good autobiography but bad &quot;how-to.&quot; How so? It is certainly good biography, which is what makes Allen a delight to read, but each chapter closes with &quot;lessons learned,&quot; and each page is FILLED with &quot;how-to&quot; -- IF you're paying attention. The trick is developing the skill to apply others' experiences to your own business situations.This is a terrific, entertaining, and educational book. And I'm sure I'll be reading it again and again."},{"Title":"No Cash, No Fear: Entrepreneurial Secrets to Starting Any Business with No Money","review":"The back cover of this book brags that the author has &quot;started more than 20 businesses.&quot; Well, when you read the book, you learn the reason he started so many, is that so many of them TANKED, and he had to keep starting over!! This book reminds me of a guy in my fraternity who told me that it would be REALLY hard for me to get a date with a certain beautiful girl, because HE had courted her for 6 months, and she had never gone out with him, despite all his efforts. Despite his pessimism, this girl went out with me the first time I asked her! Terry Allen's business life is filled with fitful success, and a lot of failure. And he assumes your record of failure as an entrepreneur will duplicate his. He gives the old bromide, &quot;An entrepreneur works any 24 hours he wants to.&quot; (Few things are as tiresome as the entrepreneur-as-martyr.) So he assumes that EVERY entrepreneur is going to fail for years, and work all the time, before victory by attrition. One of my best friends from high school started a business right out of school...it did $1 million in sales its first year. He was on the FORBES 400 list eight years later with a net worth of over $1/2 a billion. He succeeded immediately, without experiencing failure, and he succeeded BIG. He also had a lot of free time off this entire time. Another friend of mine became very wealthy very young, and lives on a giant estate in the South of France. And he averages about 6 hours of work a day, not including the months he takes off to stay in his mansions around the world. And he is not retired. I know from my friends that you can become a very successful entrepreneur without killing yourself work-wise, and without failing over and over. Just because Terry Allen messed up so much, and had to declare bankruptcy twice, doesn't mean you will. He's a bizarre source to give &quot;advice&quot; it seems to me. Another entrepreneur who didn't fail repeatedly, and didn't wait years for success to finally hit, is Michael Dell. He started Dell Computers when he was 19 out of his dorm room, and did $6 million in sales its first year. Dell Computers grew and grew, with only a few slips, making him a billionaire while he was very young. He's been a billionaire for awhile, and he's STILL young. I saw him on PBS recently, and he says his work hours are about 8:30 to 5:00. These are his hours as CEO of a global, multi-billion dollar corporation!! NO CASH, NO FEAR has an occasional good piece of advice. But you'd do better to read Michael Dell's book DIRECT FROM DELL. It's like taking golf lessons from Tiger Woods...rather than from a golf teacher at a community college."},{"Title":"No Cash, No Fear: Entrepreneurial Secrets to Starting Any Business with No Money","review":"The title \\"No Cash No Fear\\" is perfect. Terry Allen is an expert at starting risky business ventures using money from investors, and if he loses it, no fear, because it's not his money. All of his business ventures are really just kooky get-rich-quick schemes that collapse in a matter of months.The only redeeming part of the book is the one where he opens a pizza place in Moscow. It turns out to be the cheapest and most wildly profitable scheme he's ever done. But he leaves because he doesn't want to get involved in the shady world of bribes and payoffs that dominate Russian business.Don't read this book if you want to be an entrepreneur. Terry Allen is a con man."},{"Title":"No Cash, No Fear: Entrepreneurial Secrets to Starting Any Business with No Money","review":"The title implies that this is a book about how to start a business with no cash. Nothing could be be further from the truth. Yes, the author did start many businesses with little or no cash however this book is in no way a road map as to how the reader can apply the author's methodology on a regular, consistant basis. Each of the author's ventures are truly unique to time, place and circumstance.If you're looking for a good story book about the adventures, trials and tribulations of a confirmed self-employed individual, then this is an interesting read.In the meantime, don't quit your day job until you find another book."},{"Title":"No Cash, No Fear: Entrepreneurial Secrets to Starting Any Business with No Money","review":"I read this book, had to look hard to find all that is advertised. 4 ingredients to cook up a business idea, 4 commandents for running a solid, profitable company. Well, three stories about his business experience would have been sufficient to explain his business idea. It was a tiresome read about all his business disasters. I tried the no money down route to buying a house. Never found a guillable person to agree to this. I tried to purchase a business this way as well. If a business is for sale,everyone that is selling wants their money. Even if the business is not worth what they are asking, some fool will come along pay the price. Its the American dream being a business owner. I tend to think now all these books on how to do it with no cash are full of nonsense. If i find out the secret to making money, why would I tell anything else?? If I make it, i dont need to boast. Save your money.

I broke the cardinal rule, I bought the book on a 'whim' and didn't even open the book before purchase...my ERROR don't let it be yours!I skimmed the book in less then 30 minutes, less I actually think, because there is NOTHING of value in it! Terry Allen wrote strictly of his personal experiences, which were very one sided and lacked ANY substance. For example, he states, he sold 100 worth of options to his family for $1 each, then sold the stock years later for $100,000 each. Question is how!? Why would anyone buy stock from members of his family for $100,000 each? What did the investors get in return, what was the basis for the sale? No information is given.There is just a bunch of incomplete thoughts and ideas in this book. Sad and totally disappointed with myself for spending any money but mostly disappointed to think that apparently anybody can write a book with absolutely no value in it and still get it published. Did the publisher even read the book? Did anyone? Doubt it because it is a complete waste of paper and ink."},{"Title":"No Cash, No Fear: Entrepreneurial Secrets to Starting Any Business with No Money","review":"As a professor of entrepreneurship and a periodic entrepreneur, I read a lot on the subject, and this is the most honest book on entrepreneurial life that I have come across. I like the author's mildly self-deprecating tone, the wit, the brevity, the lessons, but most of all, what seems to be unflinching honesty.I'm not yet sure how I'll use it as a teacher, but I do find it helpful to me in my personal life. What I most appreciated is the raw story of roller-coaster ups and downs. In my experience and observation, surviving the downs is the great challenge of entrepreneurial life, and it is reassuring to see how often he was able to recover from severe setbacks.I like the list at the end: How to turn $10 into $10 million in ten easy steps. \\"See how easy it can be?\\" he asks. Of course it wasn't easy at all; starting out, there is no travelogue or map at all. Despite Mr. Allen's intelligence, top tier education, an apparently supportive family, an early start as an entrepreneur and unceasing efforts, he was well on in years before he hit it big. Along the way he suffered two divorces, two bankruptcies, and lots of lesser failures.In a book filled with all stripes of lessons, the most important is this unstated one: No one makes it easy for us. Life throws us a lot of curves, and some of those curves will floor us. Mr. Allen's story is of an entrepreneur who just kept getting back up, enjoyed the game, and, incidentally, hit a homer at the end.Thanks, Terry, for a great book."},{"Title":"No Cash, No Fear: Entrepreneurial Secrets to Starting Any Business with No Money","review":"THIS BOOK IS JUST WHAT BEGINNING ENTREPRENEURS AND STUDENTS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP NEED.

Here's why. Usually these books are all about the author's successes...just brag rags. Terry Allen's authentic style and approach reveal both the many victories and the many defeats along the way. He unabashidly shares his schemes and dreams in a humorous, approachable and really human way. And each chapter is filled with engaging stories which become a fabulous list of entrepreneurial dos and don'ts.The question is how can a guy like this with a Harvard MBA and also and a also business PhD. be so practical and at the same time funny.

Having read the other reviews already written, I find it interesting that there would be such a wide range of reviews. I like to read, particularly books on business etc as I am an entrepeneur. I was amazed at the open-ness and honesty shown in the authors writing, what other people have criticised, I found refreshing. I was glad that he talked not only of his successes but also his failures. So often books are written which give the reader the sense that business and/or investing is as easy as 1,2,3, however here is a very real and honest summary of one mans attempts. Does this mean that for everyone of us life will be like this, no, but it gives us more of a realistic idea of some of the struggles we may have to go through ourselves. I laughed out loud (on the plane) when reading what he did as a teenager, I anguished with him as he went through bankruptcy, but through it all I was amazed and astounded at his tenacity, his commitment. In all honesty I think I may very well have given up long before he did, and in the end he made it. And to me that was one of the lessons in the book, if you keep trying you will do it. The various ways he found to get some funds together were certainly creative. I think he adequately showed the reader that there certainly are a lot of different places from where to source funds. I have to be honest and say that I do not know if I would want to use some of the methods he did, but then up until this point in time I have not needed to.Was it a good book, yes. Worth reading yes. Personally I think Terry probably has far more that he can teach those of us who are young entrepeneurs, simply because of the trials he has been through, than those so called very succesful business people who may never have had to struggle to see their dreams become a reality.Thanks Terry for your honesty and being willing to share the downs as well as the ups."},{"Title":"No Cash, No Fear: Entrepreneurial Secrets to Starting Any Business with No Money","review":"I loved this book. Despite the handful of negative comments, let me tell you: they are simply wrong. The commenters seem more to judge the author, as opposed to the book itself. This book is actually quite good. I really enjoyed reading about the author's entrepreneurial adventures and how he bootstrapped himself through it all. You will learn from it, and it may give you some inspiration. This is a &quot;real world&quot; entrepreneur's story, unlike so much of the bloated theory you see in other books out there. I've bought thousands of 'theory' books over the years, so when I spot something like this, it's a real treat. If you love the idea of being an entrepreneur, and want to learn from someone who has done it, by all means, get this book. I think you'll thoroughly enjoy it, as I did."},{"Title":"No Cash, No Fear: Entrepreneurial Secrets to Starting Any Business with No Money","review":"This is probably the best book ever written on raising money for small and medium size businesses. Here's why. Usually these books are all about the author's successes...just brag rags. Terry Allen's authentic style and approach reveal both the many victories and the many defeats along the way. He unabashidly shares his schemes and dreams in a humorous, approachable and really human way. And each chapter is filled with engaging stories which become a fabulous list of entrepreneurial dos and don'ts.The question is how can a guy like this with a Harvard MBA and also and a also business PhD. be so practical and at the same time funny. Most PhD. business authors are stuck in their ivory towers and really never get their hands dirty with the real work of the entreprenuer. Professor Allen, on the other hand, lays seige to the ivory tower of business rules and stifling protocol, with a refreshing, innovative and practical outlook. This is a must read for anyone who wants to own their own business and have fun doing it!"},{"Title":"No Cash, No Fear: Entrepreneurial Secrets to Starting Any Business with No Money","review":"I'm an entrepreneur myself and I work with many other entrepreneurs. Terry Allen has laid out what it's really like in a gutsy, tell-all way that you won't find told very often. Of course this isn't a paint-by-numbers book -- anyone looking for precise, reliable instructions would do better to buy a franchise or get a job with a large company that has well-defined work procedures.I smile when I read some of the other reviews, and I'm reminded of the scene from the movie &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; where Jack Nicholson, when asked for &quot;the truth,&quot; bellows with a sneer, &quot;You can't HANDLE the truth!&quot;:)It's hard for someone who hasn't been there to appreciate the wisdom in this book No doubt, Terry Allen is at the extreme of both failure and success, and it is not necessary to go through all he has gone through to find your place in the sun and achieve financial independence.But be forewarned: Running your own show is, by its very nature, going out into uncharted waters, and there will be failures, frustration and obstacles to overcome. Once you are rich and famous, you certainly have the option of conveniently forgetting about these things and convicning all your admirers that the path is easy and the rewards are good.But you're not doing anyone (other than your own ego) any favors by telling happy little lies like that. Terry Allen has done the world of emerging businesses a huge favor by showing you many of the things that can (and typically do) go wrong on the way to lasting success.Think about it -- if most people could handle the failures that happen along with way, would 8 out of 10 start-ups go out of business, as they do now? Probably not; it's resilience and resourcefulness that you need to make it as an entrepreneur. Terry unashamedly models these two important qualities as he shows what went wrong and how he navigated his way through uncertainty until he finally hit it big.I laughed out loud many times reading this book -- not at Terry's misfortunes, which are not laughable, but at his remarkable sense of humor. For a man with a Harvard MBA and a Doctorate in Business from the University of Virginia (and a mutltimillion-dollar net worth), Terry has kept an admirable sense of humility and what the Zen practitioners call &quot;beginner's mind&quot; in observing and recounting his life story as an entrepreneur.If for no other reason than to realize there's still hope when your cash flow dribbles to a halt (temporarily), get and read this book. You'll have a great time and feel better about your own foibles. You'll discover that the only place &quot;perfection&quot; comes before &quot;success&quot; is in the dictionary. And, you'll certainly learn a lot that will help you in the day-to-day of running your own business."},{"Title":"No Cash, No Fear: Entrepreneurial Secrets to Starting Any Business with No Money","review":"I purchased this book looking for information on specific methods of financing my pre-startup with little of my own money. I read the book in it's entirety and here is what it is: A wonderful personal story of winning and losing in business. It shows that creativity can be used to overcome lack of cash, but gives few useful ideas. Like I said, it's just a nice story, not a business resource."},{"Title":"No Cash, No Fear: Entrepreneurial Secrets to Starting Any Business with No Money","review":"Wow. This guy left a wake of bankrupt investors, angry customers & employees (and all for good reason), everywhere he went!He frequently spends money he hasn't earned and creatively parlays it until the house of cards collapses. And this happends over and over again.Somehow, out of decades of disasters..., a business emerges that he sells for a lot of money.What I took away from the book is that Terry has more business experiences than nearly anybody - but he still hasn't learned anything from it!He got lucky 1 time out of 50 and wrote a book.I finished the book still looking for the \\"invaluable lessons\\", but gave it 2 starts because it is an engaging read."},{"Title":"No Cash, No Fear: Entrepreneurial Secrets to Starting Any Business with No Money","review":"This is a book I wished that I had written myself. It is a tell-all tale documenting Terry Allen's starting and building up a number of businesses.I have started a variety of businesses and have a lot of experiences. But Terry writes so well and none of my experiences can top Terry's. Not only does the book contain very valuable stories and specifics for an entrepreneur, it is superbly written and it reads like a novel.Are you thinking that you want to start a business, but you don't have the money? Terry's book will inspire you. Terry's story is very instructive because he gives you the details. He draws lessons from his experiences, and the lessons are terrific.Unlike many books of this type, Terry does not pull punches when it comes to analyzing what he did, even if on occasion he explains how it was not the brightest thing he could have done. He is not afraid of telling you everything, good bad or ugly, making the lessons here even more valuable.You will think that &quot;if Terry can do it, I can do it&quot;.

Vocabulary is the foundation for good reading and writing. Many smart kids don't do well in reading because of limited vocabulary. Unlike some other skills, a good vocabulary cannot be achieved quickly. Young students need to learn and read extensively to snowball their words. This book is a great help. It gives thorough practice through the use of synonyms, antonyms, compound words, homophones, homographs, plurals, etc., to ensure that your child will learn the meanings of the words used in each section. Through a variety of exercises that vary within and between each section, a child will become familiar with not only the word's meaning, but also the meaning of each type of word (i.e., synonym, homophone, etc). Little by little, this book built the word power for my child without stressing. Now his reading level is at the top of his class. His confidence is high. This book is an excellent tool for after-school enrichment."},{"Title":"240 Vocabulary Words 4th Grade Kids Need To Know: 24 Ready-to-Reproduce Packets That Make Vocabulary Building Fun & Effective","review":"Bought this for my advanced 3rd grade student who we recently began to home school.

Although the writing is not polished, Wilkinson's perspective is unique, insightful, and thought-provoking. I have studied Astrology and metaphysics for 20 years, yet still found the information useful. The concepts in this text are not, however, for the novice. Readers who do not have a solid understanding of Astrology before they begin are likely to be dissatisfied with this book, due to their own inability to comprehend the esoteric concepts contained therein. However, for the rest of us, I would say enjoy!"},{"Title":"A New Look at Mercury Retrograde","review":"Robert Wilkinson's book is an amazing work that explains many different things associated with this interesting phenomenon which occurs three times a year. Just like the lunar cycles, the Mercury cycle is equally important in our lives. This book helps us understand everything we need to know about this in clear and concise language. It raises our awareness, reduces the misunderstandings, and helps us bring more order as we move through these strange periods.I wholeheartedly recommend this work as being unique, useful, deep, and very well-written. If you or a loved one have Mercury retrograde in your chart, you may want to get this book to help gain insights into how a retrograde cognitive process can function at its best.From personal experience, this book has helped me reduce my anxiety and frustration in coping with my Mercury retrograde. For instance, I learned that during these times, my life affairs actually move forward and things get a lot clearer for me. There are hundreds of more insights I've gotten from this remarkable work. You will too."},{"Title":"A New Look at Mercury Retrograde","review":"The author is a practicing professional astrologer over 30 years. This book is divided into two parts. The first part is an article of mercury retrograde - its general meanings and its application. The second part is a large volume of materials related to mercury retrograde, including a list of celebrities with mercury retrograde, a list of famous events during mercury retrograde, and a calender of mercury retrograde during 1900-2035. Even if you may not find any interesting issue in the first part, you can use the second part for your reference.According to the author, people with mercury retrograde usually lack confidence in their own ideas. They tend to learn by copying others and rethink the same thing again and again. But there are some areas where mercury retrogate can work productively. These areas include teaching, doing research, and understanding non-verbal communications. The author also provides a cookbook about how to interprete mercury retrograde in each sign and what kind of impact transiting mercury retrogate brings to people of each sign.Though the title of the book begins at \\"A New Look,\\" I do not think that the author has peculiar opinion. The book does not go deeper into the topic, but I think that the semi-beginner of astrology can enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Barbarossa to Berlin Volume One: The Long Drive East: 22 June 1941 to November 1942 (Barbarossa to Berlin a Chronology of the Campaigns on the Eastern Front 1941-45) (Vol 1)","review":"In short, this book is a day by day diary of major developments on the Eastern Front in WW2. Don't expect to find anything new here, but the past secondary works (mainly Erickson &amp; Glantz) have been well covered and used as source material for this work. It is a good book to have as a quick handbook to what was going on, and where. My chief criticism is that the author overlooked important works from Ziemke &amp; Bauer, and Fugate, regarding the first phase of the Russian War. For that reason, use this book only as a guidline to the key events. I would hope that a 2nd edition would incorporate those missing references. I recommend this work for the east front fanatic, and I would support a 2nd edition drawing from Ziemke &amp; Bauer, and Fugate. If the author were to try this approach with different theatres, please do a better job selecting your reference materials."},{"Title":"Barbarossa to Berlin Volume One: The Long Drive East: 22 June 1941 to November 1942 (Barbarossa to Berlin a Chronology of the Campaigns on the Eastern Front 1941-45) (Vol 1)","review":"If you're into chronology this 2 volume set is a must. Its the most comprehensive list that I have found of the war in Russia. The 2 volumes have over 600 pages of daily entries. During key campaigns like Barbarossa, Typhoon, Stalingrad, Kursk etc, each day's entries are two or three pages long. Each entry will give key commanders and units involved, the tactics used, nearby cities and rivers, the bridgeheads established etc and with a little effort you can follow a favorite general or division throughout a campaign or even the entire war. Putting this info into a database makes it easy and interesting to follow Manstein, Kluge, Zhukov or Rokossovsky etc on how they bested their enemy. There are a few cases of individual or company size bravery mentioned but for the most part the engagements are discussed at a division, corps or army level. After a brief introduction volume one starts at 6/22/1941 and ends on 11/18/1942 and the second volume takes you to 5/15/1945.Between the two books there are 52 black and white maps that are helpful and there are only a very few photos. There is a bibliography that I found helpful and there is separate indexes for people and places. These two volumes are an easy way for a beginner to learn about the war and if a certain campaign or general peaks your interest you can search for other titles to enhance your knowledge."},{"Title":"Barbarossa to Berlin Volume One: The Long Drive East: 22 June 1941 to November 1942 (Barbarossa to Berlin a Chronology of the Campaigns on the Eastern Front 1941-45) (Vol 1)","review":"Although exploring nothing new about the Eastern Front and even making some mistakes in the introduction (for example about the Red Army Purges) this book is a very good source to have for the general account and movement of the German Army throughout 1941 on the Eastern Front as well as the respective response from the Soviet side. Although more sources could and should have been used, I can understand why they were not, as the book would be too cumbersome and hard to follow. Detailed studies can be found in various other books of individual unit actions, but that is not what this book is for. If one has an interest in a certain action and/or day that an event occurred on, they can do their own research with this book being their beginning general account/source."},{"Title":"Barbarossa to Berlin Volume One: The Long Drive East: 22 June 1941 to November 1942 (Barbarossa to Berlin a Chronology of the Campaigns on the Eastern Front 1941-45) (Vol 1)","review":"Many books have been written and are yet to be written on the Eastern Front battles between Germany and the Soviet Union. This book and its companian are a good starting point for a novice study of these battles.The books are a quick read but with only a half page or less per day it leaves a lot left out and only covers the major actions of the combatants.A recommended addition to a Eastern Front libary as a good starting point for future research."},{"Title":"Barbarossa to Berlin Volume One: The Long Drive East: 22 June 1941 to November 1942 (Barbarossa to Berlin a Chronology of the Campaigns on the Eastern Front 1941-45) (Vol 1)","review":"If you are a fan of the Eastern Front then this book would fit into the \\"must have\\" category.You get an average of around half a page on each day's events, but it varies a widely.

They are correctly placed and fit conveniently with the narrative.The two main sources used, Glantz and Erickson, are indeed the best sources available by a wide margin, in my view.

The hard-to-understand explanations provide little insight into the topic areas covered.One has a sense that the author rushed to print just to be the first with a Java 2 title, by adding a few Java 2 items to a Java 1.1 text. Some chapters use Applets (Java 1.1), others Japplets (Java 2). Much of the Java 2 material is just filler--listings of the class definitions. Important Java 2 Swing concepts such as the various &quot;panes&quot; that are used to overlay graphics (content pane, glass pane, etc.) are not discussed nor does the book mention overriding the paintComponent() method for doing graphics."},{"Title":"Mastering Java 2","review":"The advanced topics are same as developer's handbook by Roberts and Heller.I have been through both the books and noticed that the chapters on advanced topics of Java are identical (word to word,figure to figure).

I keep trying to use this book as a reference, but am mostly just wasting my time when I do so.

Agreed - it does not go in depth into many of the topics it covers, but I do not feel that is its intent. The book is aimed at imparting a decent level knowledge of all the essential technologies behind the Java 2 enterprise platform.The book does unfortunately contain a number of typing errors and non-compilable examples, mostly due to the fact that it was written before Java 1.2 was available (so the Swing package changed, for example) - check the errata list for this sort of thing.If you are looking for a book that takes you through Java from the beginning to the end, without going too deep into any one topic, then this is the book.

A number of companies are partnering to accomplish their business goals. Businesses that refuse to adapt in these changing times face the possibility of being left behind.

This book was released in 1997, which probably means it's over a decade old in IT years. This book provides the most basic of introductions to the whole idea of e-commerce. I think this book is good for a certain type of person. If you fit this description, you will benefit by reading it. You obviously have to be interested in learning e-commerce. Maybe you know what they are, but you shouldn't be able to give in-depth descriptions of protocols, networking, security or encryption. The case studies were disappointing. I only really liked the Gateway one. Again, very outdated. The best part of the book has to be the diagrams. I'm a Master's IT candidate and they even help me. Simple with icons to represent a supplier or buyer, it's the easiest way to describe a situation (like electronic processing using Verisign) without giving someone a long, confusing speech on each step.

This book consists of 13 chapters and an excellent glossary at the end. The book provides a clear introduction into the various possibilities of electronic commerce (e-commerce).Although most people think e-commerce/Internet is still very young, it has been around since the 1960s. In Chapter 1, the author starts with a short historic review of electronic commerce and what it is. \\"To many, electronic commerce is defined as buying and selling of products and services over the Internet, but there are many more aspects.\\" The author also introduces a very useful comparison between traditional and electronic business transactions. Chapter 2 - The Importance of the Internet - discusses the network infrastructure of the Internet, the various protocols (TCP/IP, application protocols), and other possible networks (intranet, shared data!bases, extranet). In Chapter 3, the authors discusses how financial transactions (can) take place on the Internet, the requirements of payment systems, types of electronic payments, and the tools for implementation. Chapter 4 - Security and Electronic Commerce - is for many people probably the most boring one, but for others it is essential. Kosiur introduces an overview of cryptographic background and then discusses the principal standards to secure the Internet for electronic commerce.Chapter 5 - Consumer and Busines Markets - is really part 2 of the book. The author now really starts to introduce how business can use the various available technologies to actually conduct electronic commerce. Chapters 6 to 11 introduce different case-studies which are build on this chapter. Chapter 6 uses Gateway, the supplier of personal computers, as an example company to show how companies can offer products on the Internet. Chapter 7 introduces Nets Inc.'s approach to building a !marketplace of business by facilitating the transacitons between buyers and sellers. Chapter 8 shows how underwear business Fruit of the Loom integrated their distribution chain. Chapter 9 explains how companies can build an Online catalog. Chapter 10 provides examples of electronic customer support, while Chapter 11 explains the possibility of the virtual factory.Chapter 12 - Strategies for Electronic Commerce - provides excellent guidance for integrating electronic commerce into existing businesses, whereby it \\"should focus on information - not only its collection and dissemination, but also its use in marketing and as a salable product in and of itself.\\" The author uses the final chapter, Chapter 13 - The Future of Electronic Commerce - to provide his personal view on the future of electronic commerce. Basically, what is happening right now (2000/2001).I gave the book a 3 star-rating since the book is outdated in some areas (the book was written in 1997). So!me of his examples are now outdated and other applications do not exist anymore. The author should really take some time to update the book and it would be worth 4 stars instead. But apart from this the book is an useful clear introduction to many people who have no experience with e-commerce and the Internet."},{"Title":"Understanding Electronic Commerce (Strategic Technology Series)","review":"This book is a great introduction for the technology manager who is developing a strategy for bringing his or her business onto the Web.

It is also a story of a process of change that took place decades ago as the country of Morocco was becoming an independent nation state.I was fascinated by the stories of the women who spent their lives hidden from the outside world within the family enclaves of the middle class in Morocco.

By using a Fatima's young perspective, the book gives a fresh way to look at women in other cultures. Fatima takes the readers through her confusing life of trying to please her father by obeying tradition, and trying to please her mother by modernizing. Dreams of Trespass explains life in a Harem, which allows the readers to breakdown common stereotypes. This is an excellent book that explains the Islamic culture in an easy to understand way."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"It is rare and hard to find a book like this. So emic, so true, so feminine. Through the simple stories of her life as a child, Mernissi shows us the falseness of Western stereotypes and the tragedy of Islamic sexism. She shows us what a true harem is- the pure companionship of women, and not the sexual lasciviousness which the Western imagination dreamed up in it\`s ideal of the exotic- in the process revealing far more the degradation of Western society than they anything true of Arabic culture. But she writes with great honesty about her own people as well, and the control that a woman is constantly placed under, perceived as the \\"devouring vagina\\" (as she writes in another work,Beyond the Veil), needing to be controlled and put into it's place for the protection of men. One sees here, not through telling, but through story, how Moroccan women have so little freedom to be who they desire in a world where all that is public is also male. But we also see the beauty of women together in that same society, and through that, can dream."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Dreams of Trespass is a wonderfully written novel about a young girl growing up inside a harem.

Especially if they don't believe they have the means to get very far.

Since it took the view of a child it was an easy book to read. As a child, Fatima struggles growing up. Her father is strictly traditional and her mother is open for change and wants her children to have opportunities that she never had. Before reading this book, I did not know what a Harem was. Now that I have read this book I have a better view on what it might be like to grow up in a Morrocan Harem."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"I couldn't help but fall asleep whilst reading this book. I only was able to go through about a little over a half, mostly because I was required to read it. Generally, the book is about a middle eastern girl living in a Harem and surrounded by the conflicting Western Power, the French Army. Lots of battles with tradition and western cultures, and primarily about the rift between men and women. So you're in for a subtle yet quite obvious gender conflict, which was in my opinion awfully sexist (I know it's from the view of a woman but that doesn't take away from the fact that she explicitly tries to write as if she were a child again with \\"innocence\\" yet fails because of her mature agenda). The author, Mernissi, spends about 10-15 pages per chapter driveling on about the most useless facts or coincidences. Just when you think she's reaching her point and finally bear fruit, it's the start of a new chapter and another take on a topic or segment of her life that is completely irrelevant."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"once again, mernissi has used the literary forum to vent her personal venom against her faith. As a reader searching for actual scholarly or literary value, I find her books an absolute abomination. A &quot;bayt arabi&quot; (arab-style house with a courtyard in the middle) is not a haram, nor is the extended family setting Mernissi describes. At least not in most households. But an account of life in a &quot;haram&quot; is sure to sell. I've travelled widely throughout the middle east and have spoken to countless women, in seclusion and privacy, learning their language in order to gain their trust, and rarely have I encountered the kind of frustration Mernissi depicts in this, or any of her books."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"i was surprised to find only one unfavorable view on this book.. i found it's ornate diction along with its detailed descriptions and banal subjects most suffocating and tedious to read. and i was disappointed that she made Islam such a big part of the book.. it's clear her frustrations are merely an image of her mother's.. and those are just fantasies of wanting to be like the others.. if she was to speak about islam.. she should have mentioned islam was the first to give women political and social rights.. and the women that are veiled today are the true hardcore feminists.. the book really disgusts me.. she is a pseudo feminist.. if she wants to rebel.. why not do it against her culture and her dress.. she enjoys her lavish abode.. spends countless hours on beauty (and a million pages it seems).. it's no wonder she wants to go out and flaunt it.. i thought the book sucked.."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"The struggles of a girl's life in Harlem brings together the major ideas of this book together. In the book Dreams of Trespass a girl tries to understand her place in society, but doesn't want to accept what might lay ahead in her life. As generations go by women want more out of their life and ultimately want to be considered equal with men. Unfortunately not only Men stand in their way, older women are content sticking to the old traditions and it was hard to even explain why they would want a life out of Harlem. The plot in this book in nearly non-existent, the book itself is merely a description of life experiences that will shape a young girls life later life. Untimately I didn't realy like this book because its lack of plot. I was hoping for more of a continuing story, but this book is a series of stories. The author does a good job in blending these stories together, but this is not the kind of book that I would normally ever like."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Mernissi's book is a refreshing departure from the usual stories out of the Muslim world. Mernissi does not focus on the sterotypes of Muslim women present in the Western world, but she also shows mixed feelings about the system in which she was raised.

Mernissi's varied childhood experiences are fun to read."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Fatima Mernissi creates a vivid and sympathetic picture of her haram childhood. Her description of the dying institution of the haram and the women within is heart-rending. Dr. Mernissi's mother emerges as a strong a poetic woman who has ambitions for her daughter reach far beyond the walls of the haram.

This aside, Mernissi does not attack any religious institution in her book. She simply writes of her own mental progression, and the diverse influences on that progression throughout her youth. Do not read this book expecting political fireworks or a grand emotional saga. If those styles seem better suited for you, I recommend Savushun. This novel is a much gentler, more subtle investigation of the culture through the eyes of a young girl who is trying to make sense of her world. I find the innocence of this novel very endearing, and feel that the understated messages make this book a more powerful read than most memoirs. I hope to read this novel with my English students this year."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"As far as the content of this book, if you are curious as to Moroccan women's culture with an emphasis on personal care, family structure, communication, and biological/social development milestones this book really is great. It is not a dry scholarly read at all. It is a fun novel that entertains as well as provides a wealth of I guess \\"insider information\\" of the author's family experiences as a moroccan female. Most importantly, the events in the book are well tied in with historical and social contexts that is easily read and understood.

The book tells of her life growing up in her father's home. It describes the richness of her life, living among an extended family of cousins, aunts and sisters. It tells of nights of communal story telling and play acting, of special outings like going to the public baths and the movies and life in the country side. The men in the book have no names but the women are richly described with their many interests and backgrounds. What makes this book interesting and different is that it is told from the point of view of a 10 year old girl rather than an adult looking back on her childhood. Therefore the book is full of wonder as she is seeking to describe life, trying to figure out what life is about and seeking to define the concept of harem. She discovers that a harem in the city means being locked inside a very large house with a guard on the door and having to seek permission of the men of the house before a woman is permitted to leave, however in the countryside, harem means something much different.

We get rare glimpse of what went on in the 1940's behind those high walls with little windows-inside was a whole other world meant to be hidden from the outside world-a \\"retreat\\" that was supposed to hide as well as to protect women-that \\"veil\\" was dropped after many years and the author speaks to its demise-enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Subtitled, Tales of a Harem Girlhood, this is a most fascinating tale of the realities of a Moroccan harem. Most Westerners take the word harem and think Turkish harem - hundreds of women floating around large tiled rooms waiting to serve the lord and master. Mernissi, a western schooled sociologist, feminist, and scholar, takes us into the life of a young girl born into a family in Fez (in Western Morocco) in the 1940's. Her harem is not the rooms of I-Dream-of-Jeannie look-alikes but rather the complex social structures of the Moroccan/Muslim family in the middle of this century. Her harem is the world of women, daughters, mothers, aunts, and grandmothers who live 'inside' the urban home (but interestingly, live more freely out on the country farm). We learn about the feelings she and her brother (with whom she is close) experience when they come of an age to be separated; he relegated to the world of the men, and she to the hidden world of the harem. Mostly, though, this beautiful book tells the stories of the women in Fatima's harem who have dreams and fantasies (that will never come true), including the dreams of trespass into the outside world, the world of men. After having worked in Morocco in the early 1990s, I could see that much has changed for Moroccan women, but thoughout the Arab world there still exist plenty who still have those dreams of trespass."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Subtitled, &quot;Tales of a Harem Girlhood,&quot; this is the story of the author, Fatima Mernissi's Moroccan childhood in the 1940s. Now a sociologist at the University Mohammed V in Rabat, Morocco, she has skillfully recreated the sense of wonder and observation of a child. Her own father had only one wife, but she lived in an extended family with an aunt, uncle, cousins, divorced female relatives, and even some women who had once been slaves and who no had nowhere else to go. The term &quot;harem&quot; as she uses it, means the seclusion of women. Her mother, who was illiterate, dreamed moving beyond the walls, but did not even have the privilege of simply walking down the street as western women do. Instead, she rebelled by embroidering birds of flight and encouraged her daughter to get an education. The household was lively, and I felt myself drawn right in, getting to know each person through Ms. Mernissi's eyes. I was treated to their storytelling and home theatrical productions; I observed them sneaking up to the roof to get a bit of privacy; I understood why the act of chewing gum was considered a rebellion; I left the walled compound in the city with her when she visited her maternal grandmother who lived on a farm, one of eight co-wives, who gets to &quot;cuddle&quot; with her husband only one out of eight days.As I'm about the same age as the author, I couldn't help thinking about my life and how much I took for granted in my own childhood - such as the simple act of walking down the street and being exposed to the outside world through newspapers, radio and television. This book provided a magnificent glimpse into a world that seems as strange to me as mine would have seemed to her. And it certainly opened my eyes. At only 242 pages, &quot;Dreams of Trespass&quot; was much too short. I could have gone one reading and reading. And my only criticism is that it was only about her childhood. I wished it would have gone on and described the next fifty years. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"To me it is alarming how prevalent the myth of the \\"harem\\" is among Americans. I just watched an interview a few weeks ago and the gentleman interviewer smiled from ear to ear when his guest (a female professor) mentioned the word. I guess I was lucky to have visited a harem in Berrechid, Morocco over a decade ago and got the true story of its cultural evolution over time. Well there were pashas at one time and they did have several wives, but today it is the tales about them that feed our curiosity. Although these stories are not as Romantic as we may like, they still feed the imagination in a remarkable way. This book is simply wonderful in its direct and simple approach to a cultural phenomena that is still evolving, and Mernissi is helping that evolution to occur. It is above all her way of telling old stories that can tame the Shahriyar's in all of us. How could you not fall in love with Chama? Mernissi writes with deep feeling and compassionate understanding for the Morocco that all Westerner's should know but so rarely get a chance to experience. In her writing she takes you behind the hijab and the 40's harem wall to meet with people who have so much to teach us about limits, boundaries, and breaking out. But breaking out means knowing the rules (qa'ida, read 62-3). I think that the lesson is in learning 'how to know.' Not just knowing the rules as they are but in knowing 'how' they exist.Mernissi explains all uncommon and new words to readers by way of interesting footnotes that are valuable even for people who are familiar with Moroccan societies. That helps the reader again to know 'how' the rules of the harem exist.More than anything I am attracted to her descriptions of the beautiful people that live in her memories. Though some may see this book as just anthropology, socoiology, or even feminism, I think it is actually a book about the human capacity for compassion and love. In fact when I go back through the book I see it everywhere in Asmahan's \\"Ahwa!\\" (I am in love) and even in such names as Aunt Habiba (root habib=friend, companion). Even when she writes about Christians or Jews it is always with a comical kind of curiosity never malicious or spiteful, just enough to make you smile. She brings the outside in. This is a dream book, one you can enjoy in your own interior harem, or if you prefer Castillo Interior (Santa Teresa's \\"interior castle\\")."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"I found this book to be entertaining, educational, inspirational and thought provoking all at once. I personally and Americans in general are largely confused and misinformed about the concept of the harem and how the women in them lived; and it is no wonder or surprise that we are! It seems that even within the high walls and locked gates of the harem the residents cannot agree on the subject! What is a harem? Is it a den of iniquity? A commune? A brothel? A prison? An extended family? A refuge?Told from the perspective of a 6-9 year old girl growing up in a domestic harem in Morocco in the late 1940s, this book has a freshness and naivet&eacute; that only a child can muster as she ponders her place in her home, society, and the world at large.Her observations of the world around her are uncensored, and guide the reader to a greater understanding not only of other cultures and other women, but of our relationships and ourselves. Only a child has the innocent courage to stand up and say, \\"The Emperor has no clothes!\\"As I learned about another world, I began also to draw parallels to may own life and current times. Changing laws does not grant freedom to individuals. Here in America we have all the freedoms that these women were deprived of and fought for, and yet in many cases we remain trapped- prisoners of our fears, our habits, our insecurities, and our weaknesses.In this book I found lots of hope and inspiration, reminding me of many ways to experience freedom inwardly- without the necessity of changing outward circumstances.2006 Shahina"},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"It is really difficult for Americans to comprehend a culture as different as traditional Moroccan culture. In particular, the lot of women, confined in domestic harems and obliged to submit to male rules, seems intolerable.

The stories are beautifully human and funny. It is easy to be critical of another culture that seems so different, and I would never be able to live that way.

With words alone, she could put us onto a large ship sailing from Aden to the Maldives, or take us to an island where the birds spoke like human beings. [We] traveled so far that no gods were to be found, only sun-and-fire worshippers, but even they seemed friendly and endearing when introduced by Aunt Habiba. Her tales made me long to become an adult and an expert storyteller myself. I wanted to learn how to talk in the night. (page 19)We enter each chapter of Dreams of Trespass through an exquisite photograph and are held there by the magic of Fatima Mernissi's words, proving that she has indeed become an expert storyteller. Mernissi's memoir about her childhood in an urban domestic harem in Fez in the late 1940s recounts the life experiences of her female relatives and her own reactions to the world around her. The book demystifies the harem and puts a face on Arab Muslim women in a personal and highly entertaining manner, exploring the nature of women's power, the value of oral tradition, and the absolute necessity of dreams and celebrations.The comfort of tradition is recognized and celebrated while women's advances and past accomplishments also are applauded. The strong women characters-mother, grandmothers, aunts, cousins-have different responses to and methods for coping with restricted life in a harem. Fatima's mother celebrated her daughter's birth with the same level of enthusiasm usually reserved for boy babies; she claimed male superiority was nonsense and anti-Muslim. The nationalists' struggle against French rule and for gender equality gave strength to the women's occasional acts of rebellion. The intimacy of harem life allowed eight-year-old Fatima to observe and to participate as well as to question endlessly in order to understand what was happening in changing Morocco.Her grandmother Yasima, although also part of a harem, lived on a farm where the women had access to the outdoors. She grew plants and rode horses, redesigned her clothing for more freedom of movement and told Fatima that the days were near when men would have only one wife and women would be equally educated. As the men held on to tradition, with the support of some of the women, most women argued for equality and change and found ways to express their desires. For example, cousin Chama and Aunt Habiba staged elaborate plays celebrating famous women's lives with all the women and children of the harem (and occasionally the young men) participating as members of the production or members of the audience. These plays helped Fatima decide that singing, dancing and sensuality were part of the feminists' lives and should not be forgotten; sensuality is a refreshingly natural part of life throughout the book.In Dreams of Trespass we glimpse a world of Arab women struggling to maintain some aspects of tradition while emerging into a modern and freer world. As the women identify the nature and limitations of their power and the opportunities for change, they do not abandon their dreams. Mernissi tells us on page one that the women dreamed of trespassing all the time and that the world beyond the gate was their goal. But how they got to that world was an important part of achieving their goals: Confronting Ahmed (the gatekeeper) at the gate was a heroic act. Escaping from the terrace was not, and did not carry with it that inspiring, subversive flame of liberation. (page 60)The power of the oral tradition, a tradition very important to the Arabs, is manifest in this book as it opens worlds, creates variety, provides sensuality and inspiration. Fatima's Aunt Habiba, who could take her listeners all over the world, says: When you happen to be trapped powerless behind walls, stuck in a dead-end harem, you dream of escape. And magic flourishes when you spell out that dream and make the frontiers vanish. Dreams can change your life, and eventually the world. Liberation starts with images dancing in your little head, and you can translate those images into words. And words cost nothing. (page 113.)Magic flourished throughout this book as it educated and entertained us. It is wonderfully written and has the power to open Western eyes to a world often objectified and trivialized. In the process, it creates a new appreciation and understanding for the varied lives of Arab women."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"I had to read this book for class and I found this book to be easy to follow and interesting. It was interesting because it discussed what life was like in a harem. The book was written from a child's perspective, which made it more personal. The book provides a lot of information on harem life that the reader does not even realize they are being taught while enjoying the story. I also thought the title was good because it describes how the women of the harem are dreaming of the outside world and what is beyond the walls. I thought Fatima Mernissi did a good job describing harem life and I would recommend reading the book for those interested in harem life, Moroccan women, or for enjoyment."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"This was a great, easy reading book that many people could really use as a tool for learning about a different culture. In this book, Fatima tells us about her life as a child growing up in a Harem, and the trials and tribulations that go along with that. Throughout the story, one of the major themes that is asked over and over is what is a Harem? Is it a place with four walls like the Harem she lived in? Or is it like her grandmother's Harem which is out in the country with no walls, only open fields. Fatima's mother's role is crutial in this book because her mother is so against everything that has to do with the Harem. She wants her two daughters to grow up and have every opportunity they can in life, unlike the lack of opportinities her mother had. To do this, Fatima's mother dresses the girls in western style dress with frills and lace. Fatima's father does not seem to say much when his wife does this, unless it is a holiday, then the girls are expected to be in traditional attire. The book itself was great and I would highly recomend it! The details Fatima Marnissi uses in describing the women's lives is fantastic, as is her point of view that this is being told by a child. Any age that is studying this area, or time period in history would enjoy this book as did I!"},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"This is a tale of a young girl born in a haran in Morocco in the 1940's and the struggle she and other Moslem women faced. Fatimi Mernissi was a shy girl born into a world she was sheltered from. She is restricted by the Moslem culture, but uses her imagination to escape beyond the boundaries of the courtyard to see the outside world. She is encouraged by her mother and relatives to fight for women's rights and she tells of the lessons she has learned. I think that this is a great book. Very interesting and easy to read. If you have the time, it could be read at one sitting."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"I would have given this book a 10, but subtracted a point because of the title. I agree with Kirkus' review (below) which suggests a more appropriate title, _The Making of a Muslim Feminist_. The present subtitle, _Tales of a Harem Girlhood_, is not only sensational and provocative, but detracts from the real subject matter of the book. Yes, the book does contain tales of a harem girlhood in a sense, but more importantly it provides a rich, eloquently told description of a culture in which women were (and still are) held back from achieving their potential because of prejudice, ignorance, and blind obedience to a dysfunctional cultural tradition. I find this book to be an enlightening account of the life of an intelligent, courageous woman for whom I have the utmost respect and admiration. After first reading _The Veil and the Male Elite_, what Mernissi has to say in _Dreams of Trespass_ provides insight into some of the events and perceptions of her early life that helped shape who she is today. I highly recommend this book, but would urge readers to first read some of her non-autobiographical works (then you can more fully appreciate her autobiography)."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Fatima Mernissi did a great job writing this book.

Mernissi transports the reader to 1940's Morocco with her frank tales of childhood. Colorful vignettes and reminiscences tell the story of her youth and underscore the restrictive lives of harem women She tells of the methods women used to entertain themselves and each other in a world that allowed women to participate in few activities outside of the harem. Dreams of Trespass emphasizes the solidarity that occurred between the women that were so closely confined. Mernissi's numerous references and footnotes lend authenticity to her memoirs and tempt readers to further study.The vast differences between city and country harem life are particularly interesting, as the country harem in which her Grandmother, Yasmine, lives is much less restrictive than the harem in which she lives in the city. In the country, the harem is more a state of mind, as the women have free run of the surrounding countryside. The harem in which the author lives restricts the women of the family to the home. The gatekeeper will not allow any woman or child to leave the home unless an adult male family member has granted permission.The similarities between harem life and that of African slaves living on plantations in pre-civil war America was striking. Certainly there are many differences, for example, harem women were generally affluent and often had servants and slaves of their own to wait upon them while plantation slaves often had few resources to call their own. Both groups were totally dependent upon others for their upkeep and were not allowed to make decisions. Neither group had a sense of autonomy, because the freedoms experienced by both groups were dependent upon the will of their masters, husbands and fathers in the harem, owners and overseers on plantations.Mernissi's description of the possession dance that Mina participated in has its roots in Ghana and is reminiscent of the stories of slave celebrations in the United States. As Mernissi states on page 161 in a description of the women's behavior at the possession dance,\\" It was as if the women had freed themselves for once of all external pressures\\". I can't help but wonder if the slaves weren't feeling the same sense of release when participating in their own celebrations.The same sense of camaraderie experienced in harems may well have been felt by slaves in their own restricted societies. Harems had their own rules of social order, as did those in slave's quarters on plantations. Hierarchy was determined primarily by age in both cultures. Stories, plays and other forms of entertainment were methods used to experience the freedoms that were forbidden. Perhaps the subjugation of people generates a desire for entertainment that includes the independence that they lack.The progressive feminism that existed in the harem was surprising in that the women were so very cloistered. They were allowed no radio or other means of information unless they had first secured permission from one of the men and yet they had a real sense of how little freedom they had and just how much of the world they were missing. Throughout this book, runs a thread of dissatisfaction and a desire for more education, opportunities and experiences.The methods used to rebel against suppression were almost comical. They smoked forbidden cigarettes and chewed outlawed gum and designed embroidery that did not fit the accepted rules of tradition. The women were very aware of how limited their freedoms were. \\"Running around the planet is what makes the brain race, and to put our brains to sleep is the idea behind the locks and the walls... the whole crusade against chewing gum and American cigarettes was in fact a crusade against women's rights as well...but men opposed them because they gave women opportunities to make decisions on their own, decisions which were unregulated by either tradition or authority\\" (Mernissi, p.186-187).It is apparent that the same tactics were used against the American slaves. Keep them ignorant, allow no decision-making and they will not cause trouble seemed to be the prevalent attitude on plantations. But no one figured out a way to prevent dreams, in the harem or on the plantations. And dreams of freedom were common and necessary in both societies."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"We all have preconcieved notions of the Middle East and the idea of harems. This book, written by someone who should know, will dissipate any stereotypes the reader may have about harem life. By wrestling with the definition of a harem throughout her childhood and her narrative Mernissi is able to reveal to western readers who are unexperienced and often unknowledgeable about harem life the truths and untruths envolved with being raised in a non-western society. A real eye opening read for anyone seeking knowledge about a society all too foriegn to us."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"This was a good look at life on the other side of the world.

I enjoyed the tales of the narrator's life. I was also interested in learning thata harum is not what most people think that it is. The only problem I had with the book is that it glossed over a serious issue. The author sacrificed credibility for readability."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"This is a great book that describes a world that is foreign both to nonMuslims and the vast majority of Muslims. The book describes a world where females are shut out from the world, locked in a house, unable to live a normal life. Many of the women are starved for affection as a result of having to share their husband with other women. The story of women deprived of the things that should be normal, everyday life (monogamous marriages, jobs, schooling, shopping, charity work, interacting with men), who retreat to fantasy worlds is truly depressing reading. One reviewer described this as \\"Islamic culture\\", which it most definitely is not. The seclusion of women is a preIslamic cultural practice that has no basis is Islamic teachings. Unfortunately Mernissi leaves the impression that this is common behavior in the Muslim world. 99% of Muslim men are monogamous and many Muslim women live lives not much different from those of western women. In the most populous Muslim nations such as Indonesia, Bangladesh, India etc. this kind of lifestyle is nonexistent. Men and women are not separated in daily life and mongamy is the norm. Men who practice polygamy for any other reason other than for the purpose of caring for orphans are violating Islamic principles, not following them. I'm also troubled to see some Muslims condemning this book. Wake up, take your heads out of the sand and realise that there are many Muslims twisting Islamic teachings to oppress women. Does it matter that Islam gave women lots of rights if some Muslim men forbid the exercising of those rights?"},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"The book was great and interesting.

She describes a world few people have ever seen and gives a voice to the countless powerless women who were kept prisoners in a man's world. It proves that female intelligence, emotion and creativity are universal, that even if you lock someone up like an animal and deny them education, you cannot change human nature."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"One of the most misunderstood aspects of Arab life is the harem. Long viewed by the West simply as a place of sensual abandon, promiscuity, and overall languor, the harem has suffered denigration and misrepresentation based largely on supposition alone. With her semiautobiographical Dreams of Trespass, author Fatima Mernissi subverts this Orientalist viewpoint by providing a much more accurate portrayal of harem life through the eyes of a nine-year old resident. This female narrator, also named Fatima, relates her life and the events of her world in an innocent fashion, yet her voice is wizened with an insight that bespeaks her burgeoning understanding of patriarchy.As she gains acumen into the familial structure of the harem, Fatima is plagued with confusion on both personal and political levels. She is, after all, a young girl, content with the games, laughter and trappings of childhood; yet she is also growing up in a highly sheltered world dominated by men, and this emerging reality constantly penetrates her thoughts. It is through this unique lens that the reader is invited to understand Fatima's struggle between boundary and freedom, and the distinct ways in which both are found within the harem.Young Fatima's world, restricted largely to her harem compound, is beset with boundaries - both physical and implied - and to that end, the book is rife with metaphor, as well as visually rich descriptions of Fatima's home. Her scope of life is widening with age and insight, and she begins to understand all the ways in which the home and family life she loves is indicative of a restriction she cannot name. Instead, she resorts to naming those things with which she is familiar. Often she sits on the threshold of the harem's courtyard and observes her world, describing the appointments of the harem and ultimately coming to a confused conclusion that there does, indeed, exist a freedom that remains tantalizing but intangible. And in a child's manner, Fatima discovers the cracks in her patriarchal home life, teasing into the slippages and winnowing out the ways in which she can maintain a loyalty to her family, yet grow into independence as an Arab woman.I appreciate not only the succinct way in which Mernissi begs social change from especially her female readers, but also the book's rich visuals, portrayed with photography and painted textually with Fatima's voice. The Moroccan art and architectural patterns that pervade the book also serve as a grounding point for Fatima - a touchstone, a way in which she can remain secure through the things she knows, as she senses the changing world outside the harem. I believe this type of grounding is a way in which all women firmly grasp their place in their respective societies, and I applaud the skillful and affirming way in which Mernissi weaves together this global unity.I found this to be a beautifully compelling and insightful novel that offers a unique perspective into the realities of harem life. Mernissi's clever talent is apparent in using the young voice of Fatima to address not only the problematic position of Arab women in a patriarchal culture, but through the wide array of distinctive female voices in the book, Mernissi speaks to all women."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Though the book jacket and title suggest this is an exotic and lurid look into the hot, steamy and abusive world of Middle Eastern brothel life it is actually a humane portrait of familial relations within the confines of a harem (quite different than its reputation would suggest) and how they operate under foreign occupation. Fatima Mernissi understands the misconceptions about female domesticity-within Morocco specifically and the Middle East in general-and proceeds to cordially deconstruct and undermine western stereotypes at book's length. From the affectionate father that attempts to accommodate Mernissi's mother while both suffer under the constraints of patriarchy (a problem not uniquely Middle Eastern) to the private feminine community behind harem walls to the varied interaction with popular culture both local and foreign, this book doesn't offer pat indictments of anything, but, in a way that mirrors the harem, creates a space in which discourse can operate. The Harem is partly presented as a sacred space, one in which the Western gaze of the colonizer and the general gaze of the male cannot penetrate at will. Despite notions to the contrary, the activity that takes place behind these walls can be read as feminist and in some cases radical. Thus, Mernissi is a feminist, but one that works within the context of Islam, endlessly reconstructing traditional patriarchal interpretations of the scripture with those women can assert agency in. Like many Arab Women Writers she walks a tricky line between humanistic portraits of brethren that combat Orientalist stereotypes while also, as per James Baldwin's phrasing, putting her people's business on the street. Her mother, deprived of formal education but smart as a whip, provides deep-seated ire at her status as a woman, but the book isn't a stark and depressing, black and white reduction of everything to her situation. Like all good literature, it's complicated. The book is rich, too, in non-western literary and cultural tradition as well, from Sheherezade to Om Khoultoum, showing that binaries between Western \\"civilization\\" and Eastern \\"primitivism\\" are false and destructively counterintuitive. Worth a look!"},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"The author describes the every day life in a family in this culture. I found it very interesting and entertaining. This is another view of the stories of harems that we hear all the time."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Dreams of Trespass is an interesting insiders view into the life of the author, Fatima Mernissi, growing up in a 1940s Morocco harem. (Harem, in this case, referring to the extended family within the walls her family's home.) Mernissi is a skillful writer who effectively draws the reader into her story. Along with Mernissi, the reader learns about the role of women in the harem and the boundaries which hold them there. Throughout the story are mixed in jewels of wisdom told to Mernissi by her mother and other female relatives through stories, plays, and discussions, about the importance of thinking for herself and not letting anyone else control her life.However, this is not a particularly exciting read. The story does not really follow a plot line, but simply moves through Mernissi's childhood and stops rather abruptly around the time of her reaching adolescence.Overall, I would recommend this book as I found it entertaining, and connected with the ideas presented by Mernissi on following your own path and being who you want to be."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Mernissi's memoir is of her childhood in an affluent, traditional Moroccan household in the 1940s, when the country was largely dominated by the French, with one enclave in the north under Spanish control. I've used it to teach on issues of modern imperialism to undergrads for a few years now, and it's one of the best resources I've encountered for that topic.Mernissi's memoir documents a world in rapid flux. Morocco had been forced open to French hegemony barely two generations earlier, ushuring in deep social changes in part based on foreign models and aspirations: (affluent)women driving their own cars, dressing in European ways, moving about unsupervised by men, and serving as a \\"bad examples\\" to others. Young men educated in French-style schools, speaking fluent French; not to ape European ways, but for acquisition of European technical knowledge as part of the liberation struggle. One wife of Mernissi's grandfather who as a young woman abandoned a traditional life to engage in the armed struggle against the French and Spanish during the Rif War of the 1920s. The structure of traditional family life under stress as some Moroccans opt for the model of the nuclear family pionnered by the Dutch bourgeoisie in the 17th century, verses the multi-generational extended family that typified family life in nearly all societies until the advent of modern capitalism and its social forms. Meanwhile, the great imperial power, the French, are a humiliated nation under German occupation, their weaknesses now exposed to subject peoples. There are few other biographies that make these great historical themes of the modern world come so alive in such quotidian and human ways as does this little book. Mernissi's sympathies clearly lie with her mother's frustrations against the restraints of traditional Moroccan family life, particularly as these traditions are defended by her paternal grandmother. But there is nuance here, and Mernissi treats all parties to these struggles in her family with love and respect. This book would not be half as good as it is if she did otherwise.The fact that Mernissi has written this memoir from a little girl's perspective makes it all the more immediate and readable. It's an enjoyable read in its own terms, without reference to the world-historical dramas I contextualize it in for use with my students. I recommend to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"I read this after returning from Morocco. The insight into what life used to be like for most women enriched my understanding of the culture which I found fascinating. I'd spoken with several women while in the country who are \\"liberated\\" but heard none of the story of the lives of women who adhere to the old traditions. I saw many others who still live behind closed walls. This is the story of the latter group's growing up years that I couldn't have gotten otherwise."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"In 1940, harems still abounded in Fez, Morocco. They weren't the opulent, bejeweled harems of Scherezade, but the domestic sprawl of extended families encamped around a walled courtyard that marked the edges of women's lives. Though born into this tightly sheltered world, Fatimi Mernissi is constantly urged by her rebellious mother to spring beyond it. Worried that Mernissi is too shy and quiet, her mother tells her, \\"You must learn to scream and protest, just the way you learned to walk and talk.\\" In Dreams of Trespass, an enjoyable weave of memory and fantasy, it is clear that Mernissi's fertile imagination let her slip back and forth through the gates that trapped her restive mother. She spins amiable, often improbable tales of the rigidly proper city harem in Fez and the contrasting freedoms of the country harem where her grandmother Yakima lives. There, one of Yakima's cowives rides like the wind, another swims like a fish, and Yakima relishes twitting the humorless first wife by naming a fat, waddling duck after her.From Publishers WeeklyThis rich, magical and absorbing growing-up tale set in a little-known culture reflects many universals about women. The setting is a \\"domestic harem\\"in the 1940s city of Fez, where an extended family arrangement keeps the women mostly apart from society, as opposed to the more stereotypical \\"imperial harem,\\" which historically provided sex for sultans and other powerful court officials. Moroccan sociologist Mernissi ( Islam and Democracy ) charts the changing social and political frontiers and limns the personalities and quirks of her world. Here she tells of a grandmother who warns that the world is unfair to women, learns of the confusing WW II via radio news in Arabic and French, watches family members debate what children should hear, wonders why American soldiers' skin doesn't reflect Moroccan-style racial mixing and decides that sensuality must be a part of women's liberation. With much folk wisdom--happiness, the author's mother told her, \\"was when there was a balance between what you gave and what you took\\"--this book not only tells a winning personal story but also helps to feminize a much-stereotyped religion.

I expected the exoticized harem of one sheik with many wives that we hear about in the movies and in literature. However, this discussion of a real harem without all the exotic trappings shows Mernissi's family life and her experiences growing up while finding her place in the world. It is a story of family, but also Mernissi's own feminist story of breaking through the patriarchal walls and gaining a higher education and social standing despite tradition. Telling the story from the perspective of a female child coming of age shows the reader how far Mernissi came from her childhood locked within the walls of the harem. Mernissi's mothers, aunts, and cousins, while not able to escape the harem themselves, plant the seeds within Mernissi that allow her to find her own path in the world outside the harem."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"This book was very entertaining and informative.

Hershel of Ostropol was a real person that did live for a time in the tiny European village of Ostropol.

These tales embody the common concept of the petty con man, a person that uses slight of hand and language in order to get money from the local rich people.Hershel is portrayed as a very poor man, regularly down to his last ruble and crust of bread. His scams are designed to manipulate others and involve some very precise speech, tall tales, an unusual twist on the \\"money from nothing\\" story and even how a simple con man can talk his way into heaven.The main points of the stories here are found in the folklore of many cultures, men of deceptive characters seem to be a universal component of all cultures.

The law of diminishing returns is an essential part of a science which still has practitioners that are convinced that the application of the law, all other things being constant, leads to an economic equilibrium. Mr. Tainter retraces the history of the aforementioned societies in great detail and presents a convincing case that such an equilibrium is not a foregone conclusion.He in 1987, i.e. two year before the fall of the Berlin wall, thought that collapse was neither an option nor an immediate threat. The reason being that modern societies no longer operate in a vacuum, but are part of a peer politics system. Quote \\"Any nation vulnerable to collapse will have to pursue one of three options: (1) absorption by a foreign power, (2) economic support by such a power or by an international financing agency and (3) payment by the support population of whatever costs are needed to continue complexity.\\" This is not to say that the future looked bright in those days. The law of diminishing returns being also applicable to the \\"current\\" complex global system, there was (is?) a need to quickly find the new energy source(s) necessary to maintain our economic well-being.Mr. Tainter wrote his book almost 25 years ago and thus obviously was unable to reflect new insights on complexity. I suspect that if one would rewrite mr. Tainters book it would probably refer to \\"strange attractors\\", \\"phase changes\\", \\"bifurcations\\", \\"operating on the edge of chaos\\" and other complex complexity theory terms that are in vogue today. It would make the book more acceptable to the modern theoretical palate, but would not add to the wealth of historical details I enjoyed reading."},{"Title":"The Collapse of Complex Societies (New Studies in Archaeology)","review":"This is an utterly brilliant stunning work of genius. It begins with a comprehensive review of what appears to be every work in English relative to the topic being considered. The author has done a phenomenal job of both dissecting and then discussed the varied authors contributing to each of the following lists explanations for prior collapse of civilizations (from page 42):1) Depletion or cessation of a vital resource2) The establishment of a new resource base3) The occurrence of some insurmountable catatrosphe4) Insufficient response to circumstance5) Other complex societies6) Intruders7) Class conflict, societal contradictions, elite mismanagement or misbehavior8) Social dysfunction9) Mystical factors10) Chance concatenation of events11) Economic factorsThis book is exceptionally well organized, well presented, and well spoken. The complex discussion is delivered in easy to read and absorb constructs. After a review and elegant dismissal of all of the prevailing theories, the author leads us into his approach by positing the collapse of civiliazations as resulting from the collapse of the larger systemic process for processing information to effect the increasingly complicated system of systems. In the author's words, at some point the cost of micro-managing a complex system is so high, and yields such poor returns on investment, that the natural and beneficial response of the whole is to collapse into more readily sustainable and resilience smaller parts.I am reminded of Charles Perrow'sNormal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies, in which he discusses how simple systems have single points of failure easy to diagnose and correct; sophisticated systems have multiple points of failure that interact in largely unforeseen ways and are very difficult to diagnose and correct; and the finally, Earth and Humanity, a system of systems so complex that \\"Intelligent Design\\" is failing us, and a natural Darwinian selection is kicking in.For America to have 27 robust secessionist movements and a plethora of \\"Home Rule\\" regimes springing up local levels, while the Bush-Cheney regime runs the nation into bankruptcy with their elective war in Iraq that has cost half a trillion dollars that could have been better used to restore our failing infrastructure and our failed schools, tells us all we need to know: the federal government has collapsed, and the Republic as a whole is next absent draconian public engagement and mandated electoral reform prior to 2008.The author concludes that \\"complexity is a problem-solving strategy\\" and that when it fails to solve the high-level threats or challenges, then the society collapses so that smaller and more resilient parts might be more innovative and adaptive, and hence survive better without the burden of inept \\"guidance\\" from above.In the context of this book, the 27 secessionist movements in America are clearly what the author calls \\"resistance\\" to the now unaffordable higher costs and lower results of the federal mismanagement of the nation, best depicted by the grotesquely inept and even inhuman lack of effectiveness with respect to New Orleans and the Katrina hurricane.There are gems throughout the work, which joins that of Philip Allott, also of Cambridge, who in hisThe Health of Nations: Society and Law beyond the Statesuggested that the Treaty of Westphalia was a huge mistake, and we should have elevated and recognized peoples instead of sovereign states, as the latter have been too easily corrupted into aided the global elite to loot every commonwealth. A few that I noted:Military expenditures and arms races suck the health out of nations. See my review ofThe Domestic Bases of Grand Strategy (Cornell Studies in Security Affairs), a book in which one author discusses the consequences of allowing the military to dominate what passes for strategy in the budget, while the politicians pander to domestic interests bereft of any grasp of international reality, and the intellectuals posit solutions that have no political, military, or overall holistic integration of all the sources of national power over time and space. The books onWar Is a Racket: The Anti-War Classic by America's Most Decorated General, Two Other Anti=Interventionist Tracts, and Photographs from the Horror of ItandThe Folly of War: American Foreign Policy, 1898-2005are mounting in influence today.The author notes that the physics of time and space make an extended dominance of distant cultures and places impossible when relying solely on the force of arms. I am of course reminding of Jonathan Schell'sThe Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the Peopleas well as Derek Leebaert'sThe Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Has Shaped Our World.The author notes that no strategy can be considered viable that steals from the future to support the present. This observation is in perfect harmony will all that has been done by Herman Daly inEcological Economics: Principles And Applicationsand Paul Hawkins inBlessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming, among other works.Collapse is cultural, systemic, a collapse of process, not of any discrete event, institution, or location. The information processing becomes impossible for a complex system that does not adapt from an industrial-era model of command and control to an information era model of distributed localized resilience. I think ofThe Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)and The The Global Class War: How America's Bipartisan Elite Lost Our Future - and What It Will Take to Win It Back on the one hand, and the varied books on the \\"wealth of knowledge,\\" wealth of networks.Although others including myself in my US Institute of Peace paper on virtual diplomacy have expressed concern over the growing gap between people with power and people with knowledge, this author has provided us with what may well be the most erudite focused diagnosis of the coming collapse of the West, a lumbering industrial era mammoth whose small elite brain cannot compete with the sleeker Third World \\"tigers\\" that are using leap-ahead technologies to avoid our legacy of ashes.In my view, the West can be saved only if America achieves electoral reform and restores the constitution, with a draconian reduction of federalism and the federal budget, while restoring to the states all of the powers not explicitly assigned to the three branches. Open Carry, Open Spectrum, all of the \\"opens\\" must prevail against the rule of secrecy and the use of scarcity to impoverish rather than enrich what should be \\"seven billion billionaires (forthcoming from Medard Gabel).\\"This is a righteous book.

That runs the risk of either producing an answer so vague and general as to be useless or shoehorning data where it does not belong. Instead, his analysis of marginal returns to investments in complexity allows for an empirically verifiable definition of conditions likely to lead to collapse without being so narrow as to preclude flexible application to widely different circumstances. He demonstrated the approach with credible explanations for the Roman, Mayan and Chacoan collapses. He distinguished what does and does not constitute a decline in marginal returns, gave examples of situations that produce declining returns, and described the context in which declining returns will or will not likely lead to collapse. Finally, Dr. Tainter did a fine job of demolishing some older theories of collapse. My main suggestion for future development of the theory would be to consider the interplay of complexity, technology, climate change, and resource depletion in the context of an updated understanding of \\"carrying capacity\\" where complex institutions are \\"carried\\" (with a variable cushion against collapse) at a \\"capacity\\" defined by resources with levels influenced by climate and technology."},{"Title":"The Collapse of Complex Societies (New Studies in Archaeology)","review":"I read this for private study, to try to understand where we are, how we got here, and where society is heading.

As input increases, productivity increases, then decreases without exponential new inputs: Growth carries an associated energy cost.

(The argument had many parts and so some parts did need rereading.)The second thing is that the prose was not excessively wordy (only a couple of hundred pages of what could have turned into 500 pages).He gave us a broad overview of MANY societies that have come and gone in the very first chapter. Whenever someone is talking about societal collapse, they invariably use the Roman Empire. This author seems to give credit where credit is due (i.e., societies that have existed for some number of hundreds of years and then vanished without a trace and for no reason).The author seems to pick up where Jared Diamond left off in Guns, Germs, and Steel. In fact, he says that same thing that Diamond does about the four levels of society (Band-->Tribe-->Chiefdom-->State), but he takes a great many more words to say the *same* thing. (A chart really would be enough to summarize the whole second chapter--\\"Complexity\\").One thing that is interesting is that he goes over SO many different societies and presents SO many different, independent theories for collapse that it is hard to know which specific one to believe. Cullen Murphy (Are We Rome?: The Fall of an Empire and the Fate of America) mentions that there are over 200 different theories for the collapse of the Roman Empire alone. But something that he doesn't get into (that Tainter DOES get into) is the difficulty of even establishing what happened. Even for societies one which he spends one paragraph, he cites references to several competing theories.Tainter dispatches several theories as to why societies have collapsed (resource depletion/ natural disasters). But the overall assumption that he seems to work with is that just because a theory works in some places but not in others that it is useless. If one treats societies as complex (in the sense that they are like a fuzzy set), then of course some set of circumstances will not act in a predictable way and yet it MIGHT be enough to explain the outcome. (Prostate cancer may kill one patient but not another.)Ultimately, I'll have to call the book \\"impressionistic.\\"1. None of the cases that he worked with were well documented enough to understand every single factor that went into their makeup. (He didn't exhaustively go into the demographics, resource endowments, geography, etc. of every single empire-- both for brevity and likely because such information was not forthcoming.) And so the author was left with trying to test various theories against incomplete data sets.2. Even if the data sets had been complete, it still would not have been enough to demonstrate the theory because each of these empires only happened one time. It's not like the experiments could be run dozens of times to work out every aspect of every theory.3. Even during the time that I am reading the book, I am inventing different theories that the author did not go over/ bring up. How do know that *those* theories weren't the case? (For example: What if not every emperor is as technically proficient as the last? How many inept administrators can an empire withstand? And remember that anthropologists are not mathematically/ statistically inclined people who would try to build models to test something like that.)4. For that matter, with all the confounding variables surrounding the societies themselves....does it make any sense to try to find any systematic explanation at all for the collapse?It's worth the time for the intellectual exercise, and can give you some nice talking points. Also, if you like to read books about the history of certain socities (I've read a fair amount about China, having lived here for long), you can interpolate some of his explanations to the Chinese case and see how well they work. That all said, I am not sure how conclusive it is (his use of the phrase \\"Summary and Implications\\" at the end of each chapter is a propos)."},{"Title":"The Collapse of Complex Societies (New Studies in Archaeology)","review":"Excellent.

For some reason it has been endorsed by a certain fringe libertarian / doom-mongering crowd. Tainter's thesis is understandable by anyone who has taken a course in introductory economics: namely, that the law of diminishing marginal returns holds true to societies. Tainter repackages this concept by arguing that a society collapses after the marginal benefits of making a society more complex become outweighed by the costs of doing so. Unfortunately, Tainter's theory is true by definition, and therefore is of questionable value in my opinion.The actual meat of the book is during a span of approximately sixty pages when the author applies his theory to three civilizations. An additional chapter provides data showing that diminishing marginal returns exist in certain aspects of historical and contemporary society. Again, this should be of little surprise. Most of the remainder of the book is spent summarizing his argument and reviewing the pre-existing literature. The review of literature is, to put it politely, extremely robust, and assumes pre-existing knowledge on the part of the reader of the mostly obscure cultures and circumstances discussed. This book was not intended initially for the lay person. I believe that overall, the book easily could have been condensed down to a 20-page article in the New Yorker.As I said earlier, it is my general perception that this book has been picked up upon by a certain libertarian element of society. It is not entirely clear to me why. Obviously these people would like to simplify government. But based on how I interpret Tainter's argument, doing so wouldn't stave collapse; it would merely buy time."},{"Title":"The Collapse of Complex Societies (New Studies in Archaeology)","review":"For anyone interested in the comparative macroeconomic view of history, this is a must-have book; a triumph of interdisciplinary deduction and rigorous, astute observation."},{"Title":"The Collapse of Complex Societies (New Studies in Archaeology)","review":"Professor Tainter has written a useful review of many Nations' declines, blaming the increased complexity of successful societies as a ballooning burden on productivity that brings on the Fall. Like most historical surveys of this type,the author provides a scholarly review of many competing theories and an overview of the major issues facing successful nations throughout history. However, this book's conclusions, like most theories explaining the cycles of history, deals with the symptoms of decline, and fails to get to the underlying heart of the matter. Of course by their very nature all large successful societies become more and more complex, but the complexity itself is not the problem. Indeed, the extraordinary complexity of the computer and internet age may be what saves this nation from decline.No theory of history's failures can be comprehensive unless correlated with the cause of history's successes. Many writers have argued that individuals make the difference: the creative hard working citizenry, if given the freedom to exercise their genius, will solve all shortages and move a nation forward. There have been only a handful of societies that achieved widespread freedom and prosperity for their people--Phoenicia, Greece, Rome, Florence and Venice, Holland and eventually England, France and America. Most of the billions of people in the hundreds of other nations throughout history have lived under oppressive rulers and in hunger and poverty. The common denominator for the few successful cases is that their national and theological cultures empowered the common people and allowed them room to operate. For an exposition on this theory seeCOMMON GENIUS: Guts, Grit, and Common Sense: How Ordinary People Create Prosperous Societies and How Intellectuals Make Them CollapseExcept for these few free successful enclaves, the isolated stepping stones that led to America's overwhelming affluence, everywhere else in the world, for the past few millennia, the ordinary people were held down, restricted, subdued. Now, if that is the case, collapse and declines must come when the populace of a nation lose their freedom and motivation to contribute in a coperative way for their own benefit. Any reduction in marginal returms on investments, which Tainter's theory blames for collapse, only arise because the elites of the land burden the citizenry with excessive regulations and inordinate taxation, or weaken their motivation by excessive federal hand-outs. Young vibrant societies have usually been free of these classes of people that come in and burden prosperous nations--after the heavy lifting has been done!These burdens are a form of \\"complexity\\" but they are not the actual cause of decline. Complex labor saving devices and medical and scientific breakthroughs do not hurt, because they empower the citizenry to be more productive. All one has to do to evaluate what helps vs what hurts is to ask, Does this new complexity free the people to be more productive or less productive? Thus the author is close to the answer, but avoids going the next step to the fundamental underlying cause of success and failure.The basic difficulty faced in explaining why societies Collapse is that the concept of Social Complexity by itself is too vague to be useful. The author is right in arguing that a bloated class of administrators not involved in production, and excessive central governing structures, creates inefficiencies and lowers the marginal rate of return on investments. Reviewer Robert Steele is quite correct in calling for a downsizing of government and restoring states rights over many issues. Reviewer Allen Hundley asks the key question: Can we have an advanced society immune to complexity's dangers. The answer may be to allow the complex technical, scientific and industrial communities the freedom to solve the tangible problems we face and keep the nonproductive \\"experts\\" out of their way. If the common people create progress, as Wayne Te Brake argues in \\"Shaping History,\\" then it is only necessary to keep them free of excessive government complexity. The IRS Code is a good example--the complexity of this monstrosity costs the American people billions of dollars of wasted money. The complexity of the internet, if it allows a grass roots demand for tax simplification, could on the other hand increase marginal rates of return for all. Thus, it is necessary to separate helpful complexity from destructive complexity to preserve the nations unprecedented success and avoid decline.A final point is that \\"sudden collapses\\" are rare--invasion by the Huns, meteor strikes, the plague. The problem facing America is the slow gradual decline brought on by those favoring an expanded and suffocating big government that is designed to replace the citizenry's creative self-reliance with dependency on centralized cures that rarely work. The complex theories of these Platonic elites, that want to create niches ruling the rest of us from \\"on top,\\" are the only type of complexities that we don't need!

He then lays out his theory of decline: as societies become more complex, the costs of meeting new challenges increase, until there comes a point where extra resources devoted to meeting new challenges produce diminihsing and then negative returns. At this point, societies become less complex (they collapse into smaller societies). For Tainter, social problems are always (ultimately) a problem of recruiting enough energy to \\"fuel\\" the increasing social complexity which is necessary to solve ever-newer problems.Complexity, writes Tainter, describes a variety of characteristics in a number of societies. SOm aspects of complexity include many differentiated social roles, a large class of administrators not involved in the production of primary resources, energy devoted to different kinds of communication, centralised government, etc. Societies become more complex in order to solve problems. Complexity, for Tainter, is quantifiable. Where, for example, the Cherokee natives of the U.S. had about 5,000 cultural artifacts (things ranging from recipes to tools to tents) which were integral to their culture, the Allied troops landing on the Normandy coast in 1944 had about 40,000.Herein, however, lies the rub. Since, as Tainter writes, the \\"number of challenges with which the Universe can confront a society is, for practical purposes, infinite,\\" complex societies need to keep on increasing their level of complexity in order to survive new challenges. Tainter's thesis is that these \\"investments in aditional complexity\\" produce fewer and fewer returns with time, until eventually society cannot muster enough energy to fuel complexity. At this point, society collapses.Consider this example: A simple hunter-gatherer society with limited agriculture (i.e. garden plots) is faced with a problem, such as a seasonal drop in food production (or an invasion from its neighbours who have the same problem and are coming over for food). The bottom line is, this society faces an energy shortage. This society could respond to the food crisis by either voluntarily declining in numbers (die-off, and unlikely) or by increasing production. Most societies choose the latter. In order to increase production, this society will need to either expand territorially (invade somebody else)or increase agricultural production . In either case, this investment can pay off substantially in either increased access to already-produced food or increased food production.But the hunter-gatheres of the above example incur costs as they try to solve their food-shortage problem. If they conquer their neighbours, they have to garrison those territories, thus raising the cost of government. If they start agriculture on a larger or more intense scale in their own territories, they have to create a new class of citizens to man the farms, distribute and store the grain, and guard it from animals and invaders. In either case, the increases in access to energy (food) are offset somewhat by the increased cost of social complexity.But, as the society gets MORE complex to confront newer challenges, the returns on these increases in complexity diminish. Eventually, the costs of maintaining garrisons (as the Romans found) is so high that both home and occupied populations revolt, and welcome the invaders with their simpler way of life and their lower taxes. Or, agricultural challenges (a massive drought, or degradation of soils) are so great that the society cannot muster the energy reserves to deal with them.Tainter's book examines the Mayan, Chacoan and Roman collapses in terms of his theory of diminishing marginal returns on investments in complexity. This is the fascinating part of the book; the disturbing sections are Chapter Four and the final chapter. In Chapter 4, Tainter musters a massive array of statistics that show that modern society has been facing diminishing returns on investments in complexity. There is a very simple reason for this: we solve the easiest problems first. Take oil, for example. In 1950, spending the energy equivalent of one barrel of oil in searching for more oil yielded 100 barrels in discovered oil. In 2004, the world's five largest energy companies found less oil energy than they expended in looking for that energy. The per-dollar return on R&D; investment has dropped for fifty years. In education, additional investments in programs, technology etc. no longer produce increases in outcomes. In short, industrial society is looking at steadily fewer returns on its investments in both non-human and human capital.When a new challenge comes, Tainter argues, society will eventually be unable to muster the necessary resources to deal with the crisis, and will revert-- in a painful and unhappy way-- to a much simpler way of life.In his final chapter, Tainter describes the modern world's \\"arms race of complexity\\" and makes some uncomfortable suggestions about our own future. (...). In an age where, for example, the U.S. invasion of Iraq has yielded net negative returns on investment even for the invaders (where's that cheap oil?), and where additional investments in education and health care in industrialised countries make no significant increases in outcomes, the historical focus of Tainter's work starts to become eerily prescient.The scary thing about this deeply thoughtful and thoroughly researched book is its contention that the future, for all our knowledge and technology, might be an awful lot like the past."},{"Title":"The Collapse of Complex Societies (New Studies in Archaeology)","review":"To get an idea of the impact this book has had both among scholars and on the general public one has only to look at its publishing record. It was written by an academic for academics and published by a university press (Cambridge no less) yet it is now in its fourteenth printing since its initial release in 1988.Tainter argues that human societies exist to solve problems. He looks at a score of societal collapses, focusing on three: Rome, the Maya, and the Chacoan Indians of the American Southwest. As these societies solved problems - food production, security, public works - they became increasingly complex. Complexity however carries with it overhead costs, e.g. administration, maintaining an army, tax collection, infrastructure maintenance, etc. As the society confronts new problems additional complexity is required to solve them. Eventually a point is reached where the overhead costs that are generated result in diminishing returns in terms of effectiveness. The society wastefully expends its resources trying to maintain its bloated condition until it finally collapses into smaller, simpler, more efficient units. (Does this sound like any contemporary societies we know?)One of the powerful attractions of this book is that, although written by an academic for a scholarly audience, the author is fully aware of his theory's relevance to the future of our own society, comments upon which he reserves for the final chapter. While Tainter states explicitly (writing in 1988) that he does not believe the collapse of our civilization is imminent, in a remarkably candid passage he characterizes the survivalist movement in the U.S. (excluding the lunatic fringe element) as being a rational response to concerns about the viability of our current political system. The same goes for those in the self reliance, grow you own food movement. \\"The whole concern with collapse and self-sufficiency may itself be a significant social indicator, the expectable scanning behavior of a social system under stress...\\" (p.211).Keep in mind that Tainter is writing before the first Gulf War, Y2K, 9-11 and before our current involvement in Iraq. New energy sources are the key, he says, to maintaining economic well-being. \\"A new energy subsidy is necessary if a declining standard of living and a future global collapse are to be averted.\\" By subsidy he means the development of new forms of energy. This \\"development must be an item of the highest priority even if, as predicted, this requires reallocation of resources from other economic sectors.\\" (p. 215).Almost twenty years have passed since Tainter wrote those words. I leave it for you the reader of this review to judge the capability of our current political system to respond to such a grave and obvious crisis.I have given this book 5 stars not because it is the final answer to the question of how civilizations or societies collapse but because it represents an important step along the way to that answer. As Jared Diamond correctly points out in his new \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed,\\" complex societies would be expected to be the best at staving off collapse because they are by definition the most highly organized, with the best information, resource and administrative structures to deal with new challenges. Clearly other factors must be at work. Tainter however dismisses all previous theories of collapse, calling many of them \`mystical'. Included in this latter group are many of the world's greatest thinkers from Plato and Polybius to Gibbon and Toynbee.What Tainter really means is that their explanations are not quantifiable, therefore not scientific, and therefore unworthy of further consideration. This is a most unfortunate mistake. Insight is insight regardless of whether or not it is quantifiable. If a scientific approach to societal decision-making always worked Robert McNamara's faith in body count statistics should surely have resulted in a U.S. victory in Vietnam.At one point Tainter states that individuals can never alter the course of world history, only powerful long-term societal forces. This flies in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, from the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae to Lee's bungling at Gettysburg, to Winston Churchill and Lord Dowding in the Battle of Britain. (See my review on the latter.) The fact that at critical junctures in history a handful of individuals have made a huge difference is extremely frustrating to those in the \`social science' community. They would like to believe that with enough good statistics you can predict the future with precision. This has never been and likely never will be the case, a reality I came to terms with many years ago and the main reason I never completed my doctoral studies in \`political science'.Allowing that Tainter's complexity model really does have considerable explanatory power, the important question is can you have an advanced society that is immune to complexity's dangers? The answer in this reviewer's opinion is a qualified \`yes' but such a society would have to be organized very differently with far less interdependence, and hence fragility, than anything we now know. If world events (terrorism, Iran, North Korea, etc.) continue along the track they have taken in recent years, we may soon, for better or worse, have the opportunity to find out."},{"Title":"The Collapse of Complex Societies (New Studies in Archaeology)","review":"In contrast to Jered Diamond's \\"Collapse,\\" this volume does not just focus on one theory of why societies collapse--depletion of natural resources--but presents in summary several different theories. In academic style, Tainter examines the pros and cons of each, offering a cornucopia of references that would be an invaluable source for future research.While he sees some merit to most theories, one he holds in complete contempt, while another he tends to prefer. Tainter has no patience for \\"mystical\\" notions that societies collapse because their moral fiber has degenerated, a theory made famous by Gibbon, Spengler and Toynbee. What he does believe is that complex societies always at some point reach a stage where they become too complex, where the costs to citizens and elites alike begin to outweigh the benefits of keeping the society together. At that point, the society is vulnerable to breaking up.This is what happened to the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century. The burden of inflation and taxes became so heavy on the populace that even the Italians began to yearn for \\"liberation\\" by barbarian tribes. And collapse is not always a bad thing: tribes like the Vandals actually governed their sections of the old empire more effectively.So, what about us? Because of globalization, any collapse would affect all industrialized countries together. So, the US cannot collapse without either being taken over by a competitor or bringing everyone else down with us. Oil running out might be the end of our era of complexity, an anomaly in human history, but we still have time to make changes that could forestall collapse. Overall, a fresh view of history key to understanding the present."},{"Title":"The Collapse of Complex Societies (New Studies in Archaeology)","review":"What I found interesting about Joseph Tainter's treatise on civilizations is his application of economic theory to explain how they collapse. After a methodical review the two basic theories of why civilizations develop in the first place, the integration theory and the conflict theory, he launches into why he thinks economics is useful: it explains marginal returns.In simple terms, societies are machines for solving social problems. As problems become more difficult, solutions become more complicated, eating into resources. Eventually, all societies are faced with marginal returns on their investment. Economics is a study of how supply meets demand and management of scarce resources.Tainter begins by exploring the two concepts of civilization. Actually, it really does not matter whether you subscribe to the integration theory or the conflict theory. Economics helps explain complexity. Screw drivers exist because hammers weren't enough. Power drills were eventually developed and so on. Societies created such things as cash because lugging things around to exchange slowed commerce. Eventually, monetary policies developed to both explain transactions and allow regulation and taxation. Taxation pays for society.Here is where the two theories on civilization diverge. Integration theory proposes that societies become more complex because of a growth in people's wants and needs. Conflict theory says that societies exist because an upper class wants to control the output of society to further their own comfort and avarice. Personally, I agree with Tainter that neither theory works, although many societies I've read about, including our own can lean in one of these directions or another. Tainter agrees that economic theory cannot explain everything. After all, society and people have a rational and irrational half. For example, he explains how the taxation of citizens in the later Roman Empire became so unbearable that citizens frequently welcomed invading barbarians; miners in one central European province went over to the barbarians en-mass. Meanwhile, the rich in Rome fled to the countryside to avoid being conscripted into a failing series of governments. Peasants were encouraged to migrate to the cities, where they became a burden, because Roman governments deprived them of even subsistence --- all went to taxes.Getting back to Tainter's approach with economic theory, he supports this theory very well. There are figures showing the declining returns on increased investments in agriculture, medicine, education, pollution control, nutrition and scientific research. Taken as a whole it is very impressive.Unfortunately, I think the author relied too much on Rome as an example. Perhaps it was one he was extensively familiar or just a well-documented example. There are several examples of societies that have moderated their behavior and survived, at least long enough to be taken over by the current, predominant western culture: e.g., Japan. Faced with resource problems since the beginning they showed a remarkable ability to adapt without the widespread famines that seemed to plague the Chinese.As for the current crisis that western civilization is experiencing now, Tainter provides a few clues but no concrete predictions. He believes that the civilization will adapt and survive. I believe that instead it will break down. Some countries will be abandoned to their fate while others, such as India and the European Union will strive to exist as separate entities long after the collapse of the United States and China. Tainter believes, while providing a few historical examples as proof, that societies existing together, like the European Union, cannot collapse because they are bonded together in competition. I, however, feel that as collapse becomes inevitable, worrying about what your neighbors will do becomes less important than worrying about your own survival.Eventually, we in the US will climb out of the hole created by our demise but generations to come will wonder at our foolishness.If this review helps, please add your vote."},{"Title":"The Collapse of Complex Societies (New Studies in Archaeology)","review":"Tainter develops a theory for why civilizations collapse. His theory is to my taste more disciplined and maybe more persuasive than Toynbee's or Spengler's. That doesn't mean Tainter's theory is right. He summarizes his theory on page 93 as follows:\\"Four concepts ... can lead to an understanding of why complex societies collapse. These concepts are:\\"1. human societies are problem-solving organizations;\\"2. sociopolitical systems require energy for their maintenance;\\"3. increased complexity carries with it increased costs per capita;\\"4. investment in sociopolitical complexity as a problem-solving response often reaches a point of declining marginal returns.\\"I see three problems with his theory:--Tainter measures complexity by energy use. According the World Bank figures, in the US and some other developed countries per capita energy consumption has been flat (with some fluctuation) since the early 1970s. For example, in 1973 the US used 8,164 kg of oil equivalents per capita; in 2007, the figure was 7,759. So either Tainter is wrong in using energy as a measure of complexity; or he is wrong is saying that complexity increases over time. Many people find it difficult to believe our per capita energy use is roughly flat. If you are skeptical, you should check for yourself. The World Bank is not the only relevant source: the US Energy Outlook 2010 has a chart showing the same thing.--The Law of Diminishing Returns was developed in the context of using labor and materials to produce goods. It can plausibly be extended to the production of services. But does it apply to an abstraction like complexity? Recall the classic explanation of diminishing returns, that businesses will use the most easily available resources first, so that as the need for resources grows, businesses have to use resources that are more and more difficult to get. Contrast complexity. When society is faced with a problem, does it systematically seek out the least complex solution, as the law of diminishing returns would imply? Or does it seek out the solution that (a) will work and (b) is palatable to a sufficient number of politically influential groups? To give an example, Nixon's solution to the problem of inflation was wage and price controls, which are complex indeed. Jimmy Carter's solution was simple: appoint a tight money sadist, Paul Volcker. It was brutal but it worked. Nixon undoubtedly knew about the tight money solution, but chose not to use it, probably because of the short-term political blowback Carter in fact encountered. So what actually happened was that society tried a complex solution, and when it didn't work, tried a simple one. That doesn't fit Tainter's theory.--Tainter's theory is like much of the economic theory he draws on: it is post hoc. The US in 1900 was a much more complex society in any common-sense meaning than it was in 1800; yet it did not collapse. Why not? Apparently it wasn't complex enough? The US in 2000 was a much more complex society than it was in 1900; yet it did not collapse. Still not complex enough? At what point does complexity become excessive? Tainter's theory gives no way to answer this question, except after the fact. In 1970 Somalia was a less complex society in any common-sense meaning than the US. Yet Somalia collapsed, and the US hasn't. Why not? Tainter's theory sheds no light except to say that technology may make complexity more feasible, a post hoc explanationSome other facts that conflict with his theory:1. Tainter on page 116 says that \\"Once developed, complex social features are rarely dropped.\\" He is simply wrong. Forty years ago, the US had a draft; we had unions in much of the private sector; and we had government regulation of some prices, for example airline prices. In these respects, things have become simpler. I could give other examples.2. On page 116 Tainter claims that tax rates go up more often than they go down and that standing armies rarely get smaller. Among developed countries in the last half century, income tax rates have generally gone down, and standing armies have generally gotten smaller.Notwithstanding the foregoing, I respect and admire Tainter's achievement in this book. He tackles a big issue, and tackles it intelligently, with creative thinking and scholarship. His theory may be flawed, but he provides a solid foundation for further thinking. I wish we had more people like him."},{"Title":"The Collapse of Complex Societies (New Studies in Archaeology)","review":"Tainter's book is a seminal and thorough analysis on the collapse of societies. Writing in a somewhat academic language, the author gives the stories of collapsed civilizations and one by one refutes the generally accepted theories searching for a explanation with a larger scope, which accounts for the outcome of all the collapse stories. Naturally, he comes up with one and in the real contribution of the book, the second half, gives this explanation in detail.Other reviewers have very nicely summarized the refuted theories (catastrophe, intruders and the like) and the idea of the book: More investment brings less marginal return and then society will inevitably collapse.I very much like the integration of the beautiful law of \\"declining marginal returns\\" which is functioning in all cases all the the time, into this context. But quite frankly, I think the Tainter's theory on collapse is a revised version of the resource depletion theory. Extreme makeover maybe, but a makeover. Simply put, if there were no resource depletion, there would be no reason to jump into the next level of complexity. And since obviously first the easiest resources are the first to be depleted, the return from the next resource will inevitably be smaller.Tainter, while refuting the previous ideas for collapse, gives an analogy between a dinosaur and a complex society. He says, it is often thought they are both giants locked in an evolutionary dead-end. They are both adapted to their present surrounding but will die away if it changes. But he then says a complex society is in itself something designed to adapt to its changing surroundings. So this analogy cannot be true. I actually think it is true, and the author fails to scrutinize his own theory as he did the previous \\"incomplete\\" theories. After reading his view, a very trivial question to ask the author would be \\"Why the once triumphant complex societies did not find a new resource, or a new way to govern that had a high marginal return, when they realized that their returns were diminishing?\\" A fine example could be: Why did Romans not use petroleum, why didn't Ottomans discover the New World? I do not believe Tainter answers this question, and the obvious answer to this question is, they were locked up in an evolutionary dead-end: They were dinosaurs!A minor thing to add is, while the idea that complexity and civilization is something that emerged only in the last several thousand years and it could prove to be a bad experiment is cute, it is flawed in the sense that only in the same range humanity has accrued a certain population density.Still, the book is marvelous in its scale and content, and I think it adds a lot to our thinking on how societies collapse and how we can avoid our fate: Find new ways for getting returns, the new ways which have large marginal returns (or use birth control and somehow avoid arms race between nations)."},{"Title":"The Collapse of Complex Societies (New Studies in Archaeology)","review":"This is well researched and well written overview of complex societies, describing their strengths and weaknesses.

The book was recommended to me by a guy currently writing a book who was clearly coming up with Roman analogies that I found compelling. (I thought they were coming from Henri Pirenne, but they were from Tainter.)I found the book to be scholarly, engaging, and still quite readable. (It's only 200 pages!) He avoids the term \\"civilization\\" like the plague because of its multitude of connotations, critiues a number of his predecessors (especially Toynbee), and then goes on to describe ideas about societal complexity and it's occasional rapid demise. He defines complexity as you might expect (division of labor, centralized organization, etc) and defines \\"collapse\\" as a marked and relatively sudden decrease in complexity. Tainter uses the Romans, Mayans, and Chacoans (New Mexico) by example. I, of course, found the Roman discussion the most compelling but the others had their place.Tainter builds a case that complexity has benefits, but that there is a marginal rate of return that diminishes with ever increasing complexity to the point in which more complexity becomes detrimental. He pays adequate homage to the role of energy input and innovations. (For you techies, I was constantly thinking about the enthalpy-entropy battle and whether there is a non-linear relationship in which negative entropy simply costs way too much enthalpy.) A critical part of his presentation is to deconvolute causal relationships. OK: So the German tribes start beating on Rome. Why did this happen in the fifth century and not earlier? Why did environmental damage seem to blow out the Chicoans when they had mitigated the risk of droughts for centuries? (The answer is more interesting than you think.) There are a lot of superficial \\"causes\\" that had been thrown out to explain collapses, but Tainter makes and excellent case that many are effects and symptoms, not causes per se.As an aside, I give a lot of five star ratings.

I chose carefully."},{"Title":"The Collapse of Complex Societies (New Studies in Archaeology)","review":"Well presented, logical analysis of why and how complex societies collapse. Simple answer (according to the author): it is a logical response to declining marginal returns to an investment in complexity. The sort of \\"fall of Rome\\" collapse only occurs, according to the author, with isolated, dominant states.Also according to his thesis, states that are embedded in a cluster of \\"peer polities\\" (as we find in the current globalized national environment) \\"cannot collapse\\" (at least not in the same way as Rome or the Mayans), but just continue to spend their way to oblivion, with government elites and bureaucracies employing coercion to derive smaller and smaller returns from the producers in society (who eventually get crushed out of existence). Nations/societies, absent some sort of new energy subsidy, will remain locked in to spending more to try to achieve an unachievable competitive advantage until they all degenerate in one gigantic global collapse. Very cheery.The author's thesis is a helpful template. I really liked some of his descriptions of the fall of ancient civilizations. As an economic historian I agreed with much of his argumentation. I believe, however, that he overestimates the ability of people (including leadership) to always make rational choices, and underestimates the ability of leadership to help or harm society. One bad leader can do a lot of damage. He also underestimates the effect of culture (and the working out of religious beliefs in history) on the whole process."},{"Title":"The Collapse of Complex Societies (New Studies in Archaeology)","review":"As a history book on the rise and fall of ancient civilizations dating back to 1000 BC and beyond, Professor Tainter's book was interesting in places and more than acceptable in others to a historically challenged lay person like me. I purchased this book because the title suggested that its contents might help me make sense of the socio-political-economic turmoil of today. Unfortunately in this regard the book did not satisfy. Tainter's proposals about diminishing marginal returns on investments in complexity as possible factors leading to sociopolitical collapse in ancient civilizations was way too much for me to accept as relevant to our modern day troubles. To envision a Mayan Head of State in 500 BC unable to sleep because he is troubled about whether he should invest more or less of the nation's wealth into \\"complexity\\" because last year's returns had fallen below his expectations is beyond my visionary powers. To envision a current head of state losing sleep about national deficits is also beyond my visionary powers. He/she simply takes the nation deeper into debt and loses not a minute of sleep.In his early pages Tainter defines collapse as a \\"rapid, significant loss of sociopolitical complexity\\" and then goes on to define complexity and relate it to civilization; asserting that civilization implies complexity and complexity implies civilization. (Note that \\"civilization\\" here is unrelated to morality). In order for an ancient society to advance, he claimed, they had to invest in complexity and in so doing they inevitably ran into some rigid limitations that lead to declining marginal returns on their investments. If such conditions persist the society becomes vulnerable to collapse, he argued. In his final pages Tainter assures us that \\"Collapse today is neither an option nor an immediate threat.\\" Since nearly 20 years have passed since he wrote those words and the USA society is still functioning (?) it seems he was/is correct.The major portion of the book is a literature review using the 400 or so references listed on 25 pages. Such an enormous quantity is obviously great for archaeological students but I as a lay reader disinterested in all the various models put forth by archaeological scholars belonging to the various ideological schools identified by Tainter, all the various taxes levied by all the various Roman Emperors, I found the reading dry and choppy. Yes, I went into high gear and speed-read through most all of this. Example graphs are presented in chapter 4 to illustrate his explanations of declining marginal returns on investments in complexity, all from societies that have not yet collapsed. In his final pages he assures readers that we have nothing to fear in the immediate future but if a society does go under, it will not do so exclusively; the whole world will go down with it. Two final comments.First, I find his proposals about the importance of declining marginal returns from \\"investments in complexity\\" to be highly shaky, built on shifting sands, forcing a fit of parts that do not comfortably fit. At first glance it gives an appearance of innovativeness, of originality, of creativeness but on further study I conclude that it adds little to our store of knowledge about the dynamics of abrupt social changes.Secondly, on page 3 Tainter writes that his objective is \\"...to develop a general explanation of collapse applicable in a variety of contexts and with implications for current conditions.\\" If so, I submit that he falls way short of his goal. I found almost nothing applicable to our current troubled times in his book for which a more appropriate title would have been \\"The Collapse of Ancient Societies\\"."},{"Title":"The Collapse of Complex Societies (New Studies in Archaeology)","review":"A review of theories of collapse of complex societies. complete review of the theories on the collapse.

With their administrative structure and their capacity to allocate labor and resources, dealing with adverse environmental conditions may be one of the things that complex societies do best.

Congratulations to Sacks and Thiel for having the courage to swim against the ideologically polluted academic current of today's campuses."},{"Title":"The Diversity Myth","review":"This is an interesting and informative book on an important subject. It concerns multiculturalism and political intolerance at Stanford in the 1980's. The authors (both now lawyers/businessmen/non-academics) were Stanford undergraduates. Thiel took his J.D. at Stanford; Sacks took his at the University of Chicago. If nothing else, the book demonstrates the quality of the Stanford experience and/or the ability of the admissions office to select students of quality because the book is well-researched, well-argued and well-written.It is a partisan book in the sense that it adduces evidence to support a particular point of view, one wholly inimical to the multiculture (as they term it). It is not, however, a flailing, mindless screed. It points to a multiplicity of events, interactions and facts. It names names and it provides a great many of the specifics germane to the case(s). Its arguments and narratives cannot simply be dismissed as reactionary or studiedly partial. If the authors have misused evidence or conveniently forgotten counter examples they should be challenged on the facts, not criticized, e.g., because of their later business success or their extensive use of campus journalistic records. Their frame of reference is far broader than that. To say that they were too involved in the issues and those issues' initial reportage is also to acknowledge that they were involved, personally and directly. Reporters are among our society's most notable writers of \`instant history'. The degree to which that instant history will stand the test of time will ultimately be decided on the actual facts of the case(s).There is a great deal of analysis in addition to the reportage. They examine, e.g., the contradictions of the multiculture. For example, if that multiculture turns on the notion of victimology and individuals take their identity from their oppression, what happens when they are vindicated or receive power? Do they lose their identity? If that identity is dependent on their victimhood, what happens when that victimhood is ameliorated or even reversed? Are they dependent on the sustained allegations of oppression because its absence or mitigation would reduce their claims to moral authority?Their final argument is thoughtful and interesting. Essentially it is something like the following: the multiculture's grievances are with bad elements of European/American cultureS. In addition to those separate cultures (with both good and bad elements) there is something that is better termed \`civilization'--the distillation of the positive elements of those separate cultures, best encapsulated in our country's founding documents in the phrase \`natural rights.' (We would now say \`human rights.') Those rights focus upon the individual. They privilege the individual over the desires of the collective. They are principles rather than shifting cultural practices. Sometimes we are faithful to them and sometimes not. They are a product of the enlightenment, but purged of some of the enlightenment's more negative impulses. Those principles should transcend the urgings of partial cultures, including the multiculture.All in all, this is a very engaging book. It is not one that will be enjoyed by former Stanford president, Donald Kennedy. In addition to looking at cultural/political issues the book offers a mini- case study that highlights some of the problems with contemporary higher education. In support of the multiculture, Kennedy expanded dramatically the administration and staff of Stanford (though not the faculty) and then fell victim to a financial scandal/fiasco. Using an indirect cost recovery rate far higher than, e.g., Berkeley's (which also does very big science in an expensive geographical area), it was discovered that a number of inappropriate items were funded through the overhead on federal grants (university yacht maintenance, antique furniture for the president's house, a wedding reception for the president and his new wife--an attorney working at the university, who replaced his wife of 34 years a scant 2 months after the divorce, and so on). The inference, of course, is that utopian collectivism often fails to live up to its promises, but the elites always manage to acquire an impressive number of perquisites and benefits along the way.The bottom line: this is a passionately argued book, replete with facts and incidents. The authors do infer that Stanford represents something of a special case here and that the majority of higher education institutions have not suffered from the extremes visited upon it. That is hopeful."},{"Title":"The Diversity Myth","review":"This book came out in the early 90's and attempts to shed light on the goings-on at Standford at the time.

The authors often have an inverted or biased interpretation of the events which becomes clear to the objective reader. Greedy and corrupt campus officials are not individuals making bad choices - they're people who are part and parcel of a so called multicultural movement/ideology/culture that gives them carte blanche to do what they want. Racial identity politics is said to be a dangerous offshoot of the new ideology yet this is something that has been with us for centuries, long before 'multiculturalism' got started. American slavery based on racial affiliation is a stark example of racial identity politics.The book overemphasizes problems on the campus and links these problems to the presence of a multiculural ideology. The same problems would be found in any era at any time for any cross section of society. It is not necessarily the sign of a radically new trend. The school campuses that I attended nearly a decade after this book was written didn't resemble anything contained in it.For what it's worth, it does offers fantastic insights into the significant and distinguishing features of Western Civilization (not to be confused with Western cultures) and its place in society.As an interesting aside, one of the authors is now a billionaire (co-founder of Paypal and investor for Facebook). He's also a libertarian. If you find libertarianism lacking in fundamental ways, you'll notice those things lacking in this book. Like libertarian philosophy, the book is deeply and richly analytical, yet too often simultaneously misses the boat completely."},{"Title":"The Diversity Myth","review":"This is a great book, a sad reflection not only of our Universities but of society in general. Basically its great to talk about all the fantastic things that blacks, gays and women have done. Its amazing that they have got anywhere because of the terribel white males. Blacks are stupid, lazy, violent rapists because white males oppressed them. Homosexuals are deviants because evil white heterosexuals made them feel inferior. Women don't hold as many positions of power because angry white men would feel their manhood dissapear. These groups are allowed to hate the whites because they caused all their troubles. Society must be re-programmed to understand this.Unfortnately this is the absolute garbage that goes on in our Universities under the guise of diversity and multiculturalism.

The great majority of the footnotes in this book are to the Stanford Review, a &quot;newspaper&quot; that is a laughing stock in the Stanford community, and the majority of articles within were written by Sacks, Thiel, or one of their close friends.

In trying to be complete in coverage, most of the information is too general. The author not only dealt with many types of fear and anxiety but also with different age groups running the gamut from childhood to adulthood. There isn't much new in ways of dealing with fear and anxiety if you are a reader of these types of books. The chapter that I found most illuminating was the one about why you won't have a heart attack, die, etc. while having a panic attack. I've never seen that information written in any of my previous readings. I do disagree with the previous reviewer, however. I did not feel any of the conditions were trivialized. I also suffer from agoraphobia and think that it is naive to expect a self-help book to cure you. I think it is extremely difficult to give specific help when the audience is such a generalized population with varying degrees of symptoms, fears, and anxities. I did not feel I learned much new but the suggestions and strategies were straightforward and consistent with my other reading. The bibliography is a good starting point for further reading. Overall I would say this is a good overview but for more specific types of worry, fear, anxiety and phobia, I would chose a book that was narrower in focus."},{"Title":"Complete Idiots Guide to Conquering Fear and Anxiety - 1999 publication.","review":"This book was too ambitious.

Safekeeping is nothing like A Three Dog Life and so I was left disappointed.A Three Dog Life is a moving memoir which displays Ms. Thomas's keen insight and hyper-self-awareness as well as her beautiful way of being able to translate her thoughts and feelings into words. Safekeeping also showcases, Abigail's unique and talented writing style, however, Safekeeping is a collection of short vignette's and does not tell a complete story or recount contiguous events in her life. The stories were disjointed and jumped around.I should note that I am not a huge fan of short story collections to begin with, so I am perhaps not the best critic of a book which is basically mini short stories. Abigail Thomas's writing is sparse and insightful. Those who love short stories will like this book.I recommend reading a Three Dog Life first so as to gain knowledge and backstory on Abigail's life. I feel that this knowledge enables a greater appreciation of Safekeeping despite the fact that it was written before A Three Dog Life."},{"Title":"Safekeeping: Some True Stories From a Life","review":"I can't remember now why I bought this book.

Poetic, direct, heartbreaking.

Unfortunately, this earlier work, a 179-page collection of about 100 stories, ranging in length from one sentence to a few pages, was disappointing. In Safekeeping, snippets of her life from an eighteen-year-old pregnant wife, to grandmotherhood, her writing feels stiff and forced and even though I disliked it from the start, I trudged on hopefully. Unfortunately, my disappointment never disappeared and only wavered during two of the stories, I Ate There Once, about a conversation which takes place as she rides in a car with her second and third husbands and, What the Moment Can Hold, which tells of her feelings and actions during an encounter with her newborn granddaughter. Both felt authentic and true. As far as the rest of the stories, they seemed like what you'd get from an above-average college student if you assigned them to create a journal of life, specifying, \\"Write down any random thought you have.\\" Additionally, it is written in the third person, which doesn't suit the theme, memoir-like \\"true stories from a life.\\" Readers should skip Safekeeping in favor of her later and many-times-better memoir, A Three Dog Life."},{"Title":"Safekeeping: Some True Stories From a Life","review":"I absolutely loved this memoir!

I'm glad I bought a used copy and didn't waste too much money!"},{"Title":"Safekeeping: Some True Stories From a Life","review":"Reading Safekeeping: Some True Stories From A Life, a memoir by Abigail Thomas, is much like being in conversation with a trusted friend - defenses aren't necessary, smiles abound, tears flow unashamedly.The author, who established her literary mettle with three previous novels, most memorable for me, Herb's Pajamas (1998), writes close to the bone and straight from the heart as she reveals her life in a series of affecting vignettes. All of these engagingly candid sketches are short, some as brief as a paragraph. Yet, brevity adds to their luster.Ms. Thomas's life was partially formed by the 1950's, a time when love was defined to her adolescent mind by parents who still closed their eyes when they kissed, and she thought 'We might all live happily ever after if only I could find the right man.' But she is no longer the girl who sang 'Hey Jude' everywhere as 'her prayer, her manifesto,' she is now thrice wed, the mother of four and grandmother of six.Recalling her marriage at the age of eighteen Ms. Thomas notes, 'We were children, not meant to be married, but we did make beautiful babies.' A decade later, with three youngsters in tow, she ran away from her husband to live in the basement of her parents' New York City home.It was some two years before she married again, this time to a bachelor of forty-six, a man who 'thought it gave a woman the upper hand if you told her you loved her.' He, the man with whom she spent thirty years and had one child, is at the center of much of Ms. Thomas's memoir as she delicately traces the arc of their relationship from love to rancor and back to love again. There was acrimony before and after their divorce. She does not remember when they became friends again, but writes of him, 'Now that nothing was expected of you, you were free to give.' She, too, gave as she cared for him during his final illness. To this day, it seems, she misses him, saying, 'It is so hard to comprehend gone.'Safekeeping is studded with conversations between Ms. Thomas and her sister. At times the author is goaded into being more precise in her recollections. At other times, the sisters laugh, remembering their mother who 'didn't exactly spend her days in a red-checked apron plying us with little goodies,' but made sure they knew 'where Ovid was banished.' A poignant sister-to-sister encounter is a telephone conversation which ends in an argument. They both hang up, then immediately try to call each other back. 'Once upon a time anger was the final destination, but not now,' Ms. Thomas observes. 'Because we are older now, and we know what we want.'At one point, following the break-up of her second marriage, Ms. Thomas despaired of being able to find a job because she didn't know how to do anything but fall in love. Not so. Most definitely not so. She knows what is treasure and what is dross; what to keep and what to discard. Today she teaches writing at New York City's New School. With Safekeeping, she teaches life.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Safekeeping: Some True Stories From a Life","review":"After reading Getting Over Tom, An Actual Life, and Herb's Pajamas, I was thrilled to get Abigail Thomas's new book.

Her sister makes occasional appearances in the book, \\"correcting\\" Thomas and questioning her motives.

Why did the New Press decide to break out this chapter and print it as a stand-alone book? I have no idea.'Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship' is divided into two sections: US foreign policy in Asia in the 1960s, and Spanish anarchism in the 1930s. Chomsky draws these two topics together by quoting scholars and journalists, showing their bias against popular revolutionary movements. He uses their own words to show their bias.Chomsky's critique is fair. In the section on Spanish anarchism, he focuses on a book by Gabriel Jackson, but first he praises the book. He's showing that even in a book by a competent scholar --- someone who knows his subject very well --- the anti-revolutionary bias creeps in.Although the facts in this book are valuable, I can't recommend it. It is, after all, a chapter from another Chomsky book. It certainly stands up on its own, but it feels too slight. I'd recommend 'American Power and the New Mandarins' instead. From there, you can read extended critiques of liberal scholars on Vietnam in Chomsky's 'For Reasons of State' and 'Towards a New Cold War.'"},{"Title":"Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship","review":"This outstanding essay is included in Chomsky's book American Power and the New Mandarins. Great as it is, I would recommend spending a few dollars more to get American Power and the New Mandarins which contain this same text as well as chapters on &quot;the responsibility of intellectuals,&quot; &quot;the revolutionary pacifism of A.J. Muste,&quot; &quot;on resistance,&quot; and much else."},{"Title":"Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship","review":"Iraq is a debacle largely because of Neo-Conservative assumptions about the reach of military might and the rightness of America's mission to reshape the Middle-East. The broader public is just now waking up to the calamities of these assumptions and their broader meaning at home and abroad. Older Americans may recall a similar hubris of 40 years ago that drove policy into the infamous morass of Vietnam. Only then, it was not a right-wing consensus that led the way; it was a liberal consensus (led by JFK and LBJ), whose assumptions revolved around the ability of educated experts to solve complex social-political problems, such as the growing insurrection in southeast Asia.Borrowing techniques from the behavioral sciences, American advisors sought to reshape Vietnamese society into a more anti-communist, Westernized polity. Those experts (think Robert Mc Namara) drew their appeal from the prestige of these sciences as a source of hard-headed objectivity. Their methods dealt strictly in cold-blooded statistics and verifiable research results, offered up by some of the nation's leading academic institutions. Emotional rhetoric or other such subjective factors were scorned as soft-headed and unscientific. As I recall, it was said their work with linear graphs and trend lines was extremely impressive, gaining converts in government by the bucket loads. The ironic result was a last minute bug-out from the embassy's roof-top as triumphant NVA forces swept through Saigon.The first half of Chomsky's reprinted 1967 work deals critically with the intellectual climate of that period, and comes from a time when it was not yet respectable to challenge the wisdom of liberal interventionism. Perceptive readers may draw parallels between the assumed right to intervene in Vietnam and the assumed right to invade Iraq. The fact that both Republicans and Democrats share such assumptions decade after decade forms (in my view) the cornerstone of America's far-flung empire that both parties endorse but neither wants to admit exists. However that may be, Chomsky analyzes many of the behaviorist assumptions applied to Vietnam, laying bare the phony claim of \\"objectivity\\" underlying them. This is well worth the read, both as a lesson from the past and a warning for the future.The book's second half is much less perspicuous, dealing as it does with the convoluted complexities of the Spanish Civil War. His point here, however, remains an interesting one. Namely, that liberal analysis of that bloody conflict shows a systematic bias against mass social movements (read the Spanish anarchists) and their capacity for self-organization apart from a political elite to lead them. This of course runs counter to hallowed Jeffersonian and liberal assumptions about the capabilities of the common man, and amounts to a rather odd outcome for professedly liberal scholarship. Still and all, the many players in that long ago drama (anarchists, Stalinists, Trotskyists, bougeious liberals, fascists), along with their shadowy international alliances, create a difficult mix from which to draw hard and fast conclusions of any sort. Nonetheless, his thesis remains a provocative, if tenuous, one. All in all, the book stands as an edifying little reprint, especially for those younger readers who believe that Washington hubris and imperial overreach originated in the dark stew-pot of chefs Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, and Company."},{"Title":"Premiere To Go","review":"While reading this book, it became clear the author has a lot of good knowledge about the film editing process, plus years of experience he could share. Unfortunately, his writing style, organization, and grammar could all use some work. I couldn't make much sense of the way the chapters are organized, and the contents of chapters often seemed somewhat random. The result is that you often don't get what you're expecting from each chapter, and then valuable bits of advice will pop up in unexpected parts of the book.As a guide to getting the most from Premiere, I don't think this book is very successful. It's too scattershot and, well, not big enough.

The protagonist of Waugh's masterful novel meets the youngest son while at Oxford and the depth of their attachment to each other leads him to be intimately involved with the rest of the family , so much so that his affection is ultimately transferred to his friend's sister. The numerous characters in this novel are sympathetic to the reader for a variety of reasons and the depth of their characterizations draw the reader into the story in a very personal way. Waugh was a master at demonstrating the random ebb and flow of human affairs and relationships.The decline of the home itself is symbolic of the disarray of the lives of it's inhabitants.

The story was, in fact, about what you would expect from such a period piece if you've read other novels of the period such as Atonement and Howard's End.At its heart, the story revolves around a somewhat aimless young man, Charles Ryder, without much of a family foundation, set adrift at Oxford College during the period between the World Wars. While there, he meets a young member of the aristocracy and essentially adopts the young man's family as his own. The story follows the relationships and history of the eccentric Flyte family in three different threads, first during the Second World War and then in flashbacks to the early 20s and then the late 30s. In doing so, the author injects numerous comments and allusions to the Roman Catholic faith (and apostasy) of his characters.While I have read several works by Dickens, I found much of the florid prose in this story more difficult to appreciate, perhaps because it is written in the patois of the early 20th century English aristocracy. When the story was following a timeline narrative, I can say that I enjoyed it quite a bit. However there were many periods of little or no activity, in which I felt the momentum of the novel grind to a halt.Certainly, the culture and practices of the English aristocracy, viewed by modern standards, seem ridiculous and silly to us today. This novel focuses on the period when deterioration of the rigid English class structure accelerated and essentially shattered with the outbreak of the Second World War. It bears noting, however, that it was exactly this seemingly ridiculous culture that resulted in a tiny island nation ruling over one of the greatest empires ever known. \\"From whom much is given, much is expected\\", could have been the byword of 19th century English society, and while much was certainly given, expectations were not found wanting."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I think the endurance of this story lies in it's ability to paint a portrait with words. The surroundings, the characters, the plotlines are so vividly written, one can't help but be absorbed."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"For some reason, my choice in books has been leading me to those with obvious themes of decadence, decay, and destruction. In the past few weeks alone, I've read or finished Philip Rieff's \\"Charisma: The Gift of Grace, and How It Has Been Taken Away From Us,\\" (Rieff manages to make Oswald Spengler look like Pippy Longstocking) Cormac McCarthy's \\"Blood Meridian,\\" and now \\"Brideshead Revisited.\\" This wasn't exactly planned out, but reading them so close together has been a wonderful experience, and not nearly as disheartening as one might think it would be.Picking up \\"Brideshead Revisited,\\" I had the odd feeling that it would end up being much like \\"Lucky Jim.\\" It would have its moments, but in the end it would be too peculiar to English mores and ways of life to translate very well for the American reader of the twenty-first century. My initial impression couldn't have been more wrong. It is full of a beautiful pathos, a reverence and passion for those things that have been irrevocably lost, and contains a poignant portrait of a youthful relationship that will stick with me for a while.The entire thing is a flashback; only in the prologue do we learn that the narrator, Charles Ryder, is actually remembering the novel retroactively twenty years in the future while serving as an officer in World War II. Like Proust's, his memories are set off by a particular sensory experience, namely his bivouacking at Brideshead, the palatial residence of his best friend he met at Oxford, Sebastian Flyte. Sebastian comes from an incredibly wealthy family, and carries a teddy bear named Aloysius everywhere he goes. (It's also pretty explicitly stated that Sebastian is a homosexual, and doesn't bother hiding it.) He and Charles become fast friends on campus, often getting drunk together. Sebastian suggests that Charles meet his family, and he slowly develops relationships with Sebastian's mother and siblings. Much of the novel contains beautiful descriptions of Brideshead and its invaluable art and architecture; Waugh even calls the first part of the book \\"Et in Arcadia Ego.\\" When Charles starts to develop friendships with his family members, his drinking quickly spirals out of control, and he starts to exhibit the typical symptoms of denial and drinking in private.While Charles and Sebastian are agnostics, Sebastian's family is immured in cultural Catholicism, which complicates his relationship within the family, especially Julia, Sebastian's sister. There is even a beautiful art nouveau chapel on the estate which Julia and her mother visit often. This combined with Sebastian's drinking leads to Charles' estrangement from the family. Julia and Charles eventually enter into loveless marriages, but eventually plan to divorce their mutual spouses to marry one another. However, when the family patriarch, Lord Marchmain, comes back home from Italy to Brideshead to live his last days, there is tension between Julia and Charles about giving Lord Marchmain his last rites. Because of this, Julia decides that their marriage will be impossible. The epilogue returns to Ryder's unexpected billet at Brideshead, where the prologue began, and where we learn that he's lead a life as an architectural historian and draughtsman.I thought this novel was stunning. Waugh paints a picture of England in the interwar years that is full of nostalgia, but is never maudlin or saccharine. It's about loss - the loss of friendship, the loss of Catholic religion and traditional values, the loss of youth, and the loss of innocence. These are great themes, and Waugh treats them spectacularly. For some great insight into the feelings and intellectual currents that informs the characters, I highly recommend Richard Overy's \\"The Twilight Years: The Paradox of Britain Between the Wars,\\" which topically discusses some of the cultural themes that informs much of the book."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I won't touch on the actual book--ie its literary qualities--but instead want to state that this book was very poorly done for the Kindle. I don't know who's responsible, the publisher, who provided the book for use, or amazon, who developed the format and probably the conversion software...Quotation marks were often half-done, so it seemed characters would start by making conversation and suddenly veer directly into narration. The word \\"I\\" was often replaced by the letter \\"T\\". Frequently, words were br k e n apart and/or missing letters. This technology has been available for two years now, so I should expect that the task of FORMATTING TEXT and CHECKING SPELLING would be under control by now. I've downloaded free old books from gutenberg.org and manybooks.net that didn't have this problem, so to find it in a major publishing house is rather irritating. The same problems recur in the other Waugh book, The Sword of Honour Trilogy...though it hasn't occurred in Waugh's Complete Short Stories, though I've read quite a few of them."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Set in England during the reigns of George V, Edward VIII and George VI, Evelyn Waugh explores in this novel, the varying degrees of spirituality of members of the Marchmain family and the relationships that exists between them and others who share their lives. Some family members weigh desires and progressive attitudes against social and religious convention and find the latter lacking, while others cling to old religious and social practices and seek to continue to enjoy the opulence of a soon to be, bygone era.Waugh documents the excesses and eventual downfall of the youngest son Sebastian, whose burden it is to confront his disillusionment with his faith, with his morally incorruptible mother. Lady Marchmain's control over her children using her charm, piety and the religious doctrine she devoutly observes is unquestionable. Each member of her family is affected to varying degrees, including the absent husband.The novel's narrator and protagonist Charles Ryder, is a self-confessed agnostic and friend of Sebastian. The story commences with Charles, who, at a low ebb in his life, is commissioned to command an infantry regiment during World War II and is despatched by train to an unknown location. His sullen mood determines that he neither feels the need to know his destination nor does he particularly care. Upon alighting the train to make camp Charles discovers he is within sight of Brideshead, the castle that was the Marchmain ancestral home and location of much happiness for him twenty years earlier. Charles recalls that precious time and relates the story with a deep sense of nostalgia and recognition that those languid days of love and abundance are gone forever.Lady Marchmain commands abidance to Catholicism 'in a voice as quiet as a prayer and as powerful' from four very different children. The elder son, Brideshead is pious and conservative, unamusing and annoyingly narrow-minded. Julia is a contemporary woman, smart and very beautiful. She agonises over her marriage to a 'colonial' who doesn't understand centuries of observance to certain social protocol and devotion to a church, which he considers encourages the perpetuation of guilt for its own purposes. As Julia's angst is disclosed she is portrayed as a complex young woman who must reject her faith to marry. She eventually finds herself disappointed with her choices and is left wondering how life could have gone so awry.Sebastian is 'the most conspicuous man of his year by reason of his beauty, which is arresting, and his eccentricities of behaviour, which seem to know no bounds'. Sebastian's charm captivates Charles from the first moment he sees him. They become inseparable and live life at Oxford to the full, however Charles eventually realises that Sebastian drinks to escape, rather than 'through an excess of high spirits, in the love of the moment and with the wish to prolong and enhance it'. Charles must eventually come to the conclusion that he has 'lost' his perpetually sullen friend.Cordelia is the youngest of the Marchmain children. She is too young and devout of faith to fully understand her brother's dilemma, however she loves him unconditionally. Cordelia also seems too young to be aware of her mother's need to control, yet after Lady Marchmain dies, Cordelia confides to Charles that her mother 'was saintly but she wasn't a saint' and that 'when people wanted to hate God, they hated mummy'. There is a resigned acceptance at her inability to love her mother and of the lapse of faith of her father, sister and beloved brother.Sebastian's deep depression and inner battle to reconcile his beliefs with his mother's expectations of him, are exemplified by Charles' responses in the conversation that he and Sebastian shared 'in the collonade with the papers'. Sebastian would not find true solace in his relationship with Charles because he perceived that Charles could not grasp the gravity of his dilemma, despite their mutual love. Waugh's decision to portray Charles as irreligious adds depth to Sebastian's dilemma. The reader is left with the distinct feeling that love does not 'conquer all' and that the chasm between being unaffected by religion and the need to be devout of faith is too wide to bridge for these two introspective young men. The book's most amusing dialogue occurs when Sebastian, unable or not wishing to try to defend his faith, exclaims 'Oh don't be a bore, Charles. I want to read about a woman in Hull who's been using an instrument'.Lady Marchmain attempts to solicit Charles \`to her side' in order that he assist her to deny Sebastian the alcohol he increasingly relies upon. Initially charmed by her, Charles eventually recognises her ploy and rather than winning his confidence, Lady Marchmain's emotional blackmail succeeds in \`closing the low door in the wall' and Charles is destined to no longer meet Sebastian in their \`enchanted garden'.Charles loses contact with the Marchmains until many years later when he and Julia are literally thrown together on a ship in a storm. It is a fitting climax to Charles' involvement with the Marchmain family that he and Julia should become lovers. The raging storm could be perceived to be a metaphor for the consummation of their relationship and that in itself to some degree, closure to Charles' lost love for Sebastian.Presumably Evelyn Waugh sought to mourn the passing of an era and to celebrate his 1930 conversion to Roman Catholicism. In doing so he created an extraordinarily splendid tale. The novel may be excused for glorifying the aristocracy, because it transports the reader to 'that enchanted garden' which is full of life's glorious excesses. It is tragic to lose an enchanting, teddy toting, young man to the bottle and it is sad to see love lost on a technicality but it is comforting to watch Waugh's characters rediscover their faith despite sinking to desolation and despair before doing so. Brideshead Revisited is one of the most beautiful books I've ever read and I have no doubt I shall read it again."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Never before has a novel affected me in so many different ways over so long a time. The older I get, the more brilliant it becomes. It's about love and innocence and innocence lost and tragic dysfunction. In other words, absolutely real life, regardless of its period. I've never come across such profound use of language as his is in presenting this story as art on the page. Now, I'm in my mid-thirties and as each period of time goes by in my life and I re-read this again, another truth is realized within it. It's magically romantic, and as most love is, it is also sorrowfully tragic as demons hatch out of previously enchanting objects, and desires shift, and hearts tire from being so long malnourished. You'll be right there at Oxford from the moment the characters begin their journey, so if you're someone who loves to get lost in a novel, go go go, but understand that you'll pay for the highs of innocence with the lows of inevitable life experience. You're only really young and in love for so long before life takes over to settle you down for good. How you cope with that reality is the measure of your character after all is said and done. But who of us doesn't look back and delight in our innocence and the true love we felt in our youth? You'll find that place in this novel and enjoy yourself within it. I fall in love again every time i read it!"},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"By the time that Evelyn Waugh wrote BRIDESHEAD REVISITED in 1945, he had earned the reputation of one who saw a decline and fall of sustaining Upper Class British values, a descent which he exposed through his satire and one in which he could see no forseeable solution. The closing of the Second World War oddly enough filled Waugh with a whiff of hope that there may yet be a Grace that watches over us all: He wrote the book \\"to trace the workings of the Divine Purpose in a pagan world.\\" Such a shift in metaphysical gears is noteworthy in that in his earlier books, Waugh saw religion only as a cover for hypocricy. Now in BRIDESHEAD REVISITED, Waugh continues to depict religion as a cover, but this time, it may obscure that for certain people, religion may have a base that provides ongoing faith, even if they lapse into faithless actions.The novel opens with Captain Charles Ryder revisiting a mansion that in his youth he had often frequented, Brideshead. Except for the last few pages, the entire novel is a flashback that shows how Ryder enters the lives of the powerful Marchmain family. As Ryder interacts with them, he can see that they are a family in crisis, not the least of which is a failure to maintain a sustaining ethos that Waugh has railed at in all of his previous novels. The patriarch of the clan, Lord Marchmain, early in life found himself in religious confusion; he thought that by converting to Roman Catholicism, he might find inner peace. He did not help his cause by abandoning his wife and family to take a mistress in Italy. His four children, Sebastian, Brideshead, Julia, and Cordelia, have their own issues, many of which revolve upon either a too heavy or a too light emphasis on religion.At first, Ryder has an idyllic existence in his youth as he becomes intertwined with the Marchmains. His friend Sebastian, is a hopeless alcoholic. Later in the novel's second half, Ryder marries, but begins an affair with Julia, which ends predictably unhappy when Julia refuses to divorce her husband and to marry Ryder because of religious restrictions. There is no one in the novel who is happy with the way that things have turned out.Critics have tended to focus on the religious implications of the novel. A typical comment is that there are so many religious overtones at all, a surprising development considering the lack of same in Waugh's earlier canon. Further, many readers have confessed confusion as to the purpose of all this religion. Did Waugh intend it to be revered as a sustaining ethos or did he see religion as he did earlier, as yet another symbol of an irrelevant institution fit only for ridicule? The answer is both cryptic and troubling. If the search for values is limited to the sphere of mortality, then there can be no possibility of an ethos to sustain one when circumstances become dire. Waugh implies that it is only when one has faith that there is a realm of faith beyond the earthly walls of Marchmain castle, that life and death may have meaning, however terrible and terrifying that meaning may be."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"This book deals with many themes, friendship, love, duty, religion, and art. Charting the declining fortunes of the Catholic Flyte family, we are introduced one by one to the dysfunctional but totally charming members of the family, from Sebastian who turns from a beautiful but lightheaded student to a hopeless dipsomaniac; his father, mother, sisters and brother who are all affected by their Catholicism in different ways. We see Julia emerge from a social butterfly to a depressed beauty; Cordelia from a quaint child to a devoted nurse... all through the eyes of Charles Ryder, who himself undergoes a series of transitions from idealistic twenty-year-old to disillusioned artist. it is a poetic book about 'forerunners', how he first loves Sebastian then Julia, then learns to appreciate Cordelia for her strengths, and finally is able to love the House ---Brideshead Castle. A moving and almost epic book. Reviewed by FMJ Shaw"},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"A classic of 20th century British literature and a book one is not likely to ever forget. This is the very sad depiction of an aristocratic family's decline and fall in the years between the two world wars. It is one of those rare novels where the reader doesn't necessarily have to like any of the characters to be moved by them. Through the brittle and rather unsympathetic narration of Charles Ryder, the reader is given glimpses of a world sundered by the hypocrisies of sex, religion, and class and the impending cataclysm of World War Two. We come to know the Marchmain family without really knowing them, much as Charles - an outsider himself - does. Still, this does not deflect from our sympathy for Sebastian's alcoholic devolution or the repressed misery of the tragically beautiful Julia.Read the book and then rent the splendid - and faithful - BBC adaptation starring a young Jeremy Irons, Anthony Andrews, and Diana Quick.

It is a book that I will enjoy reading again."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"This is not Waugh's best novel, but is perhaps his enduringly most popular thanks to Granada's immortalisation of the book in the film version with Jeremy Irons, John Gielgud, Lawrence Olivier, Anthony Andrews and others. Often sentimental, often dogmatic, and even, in places, precious, Brideshead remains an important part of Waugh's fictional constructions.Both a coming-of-age novel, and a paean to the English stately home, Brideshead melds history with fiction. Beginning in the midst of WWII, the story weaves back to the narrator's time at Oxford, his interaction with the Flyte family and his introduction to their home, Brideshead. The novel ends by returning to the wartime barracks and provides an image of post-war hope, despite the rain and the gloom and the depression of war and loss. The hope does not stem from a regaining of the past, or the revival of the narrator's relationships with the Flyte family, but instead comes from his acceptance of the Catholic faith - which plays a large role in the novel, as both the narrator's foil and his eventual salvation.This novel may not sit well with readers who enjoyed novels such as Vile Bodies or Black Mischief or Scoop, but will appeal to readers who enjoy Waugh's humour without necessarily enjoying his usual acerbity."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Just as *The Great Gatsby* captured the grand excess of the American Jazz Age, so too does Evelyn Waugh's masterpiece *Bridehead Revisited* capture the age of pre-war decadence.

Sebastian, an over grwon child, introduces Charles to a teddy bear named Aloysius, as well as his own upper crust band of misfits family who change the way Charles thinks about life, love, religion and money forever. From Oxford to the war, Waugh gives the reader a hint of a Britain loyal to the monarchy, yet more loyal to themselves. Read *Brideshead* with an open mind of the beauty you are receiving as a reader: the sybolism of the flower throughout, grand side characters like Anthony Blanche, and the little red light near the end that ties up Charles Ryder's visit to Brideshead in the same manner the green light across the lake summed up Gatsby's."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Everyone is probably familiar with the PBS version of Evelyn Waugh's best known, and quite possibly best written, work. This is the story of Charles Ryder's nostalgic narration of what he experienced years prior to the war....as an officer he finds himself stationed back at the old Marchmain Manor \\"Brideshead\\". He recalls his meeting with the tragic Sebastian, Lord and Lady Marchmain and their daughter Julia...whom he wants to marry. Interspersed throughtout the novel is the subject of religion. The Marchmain's had converted to Catholicism while Charles, having no religious upbringing, was Agnostic. The 'Twitch upon a thread' metaphor is played upon as the Marchmains close in on the eternities.As he closes this chapter of his life, Charles reflects...\\"Something quite remote from anything the builders intended has come out of their work, and out of the fierce little human tragedy in which I played: something none of us thought about at the time; a small red flame--a beaten-copper lamp of deplorable design relit before the beaten-copper doors of a tabernacle; the flame which the old knights saw from their tombs, which they saw put out; that flame burns again for other soldiers, far from home, farther, in heart, than Acre or Jerusalem. It could not have been lit but for the builders and the tragedians, and there I found it this morning, burning anew among the old stones.\\"Read this work and get Charles' perspective on this fierce little human tragedy and the rekindling of that old flame lit once again in his life.

The PBS miniseries was very true to the book, and is wonderful to watch as well"},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Evelyn Waugh was undoubtedly a brilliant writer. He had a gift of being able to verbally nail a character to the wall, exposing in a clear searchlight the hypocritical, the ridiculous, and the preposterous elements of behavior. He could also display the weaknesses and idiosyncrasies of characters he was sympathetic to with a great deal of charm and forbearance. Waugh's arena of action in Brideshead Revisited was the exclusive, artificial world of the British aristocracy between the world wars. This world was such a specialized expression of human existence that I don't believe we find in this work the kinds of situations with which most of us have experience or can identify with. It seems evident from the way he wrote about it that this world was the important one for Waugh. This somewhat narrow perspective on humanity, in my opinion, excludes this novel, considered by many to be his masterpiece, from the group of truly universal classics of world literature. That is not to say that his depiction of this society is uninteresting. It is actually quite an absorbing revelation of the dynamics involved within family groups and societal groups of the British upper classes of the time. The characters are shown with their hopes, ambitions, fears, and desires; and while those are human elements of which we all partake, within this group of people these elements are always circumscribed and defined by their position in society. In Brideshead Revisited, the narrator seems to implicitly believe that nothing of importance could possibly transpire outside the privileged circles with which he has contact. Perhaps it is the intent of the author to show the fallacy of such a point of view, since the book is a chronicle of the decline of one such family, or perhaps disintegration is a more apt term. The weakening of the old, vigorous traits that originally gained the ascendancy for the nobility has set them up for a downfall from their exalted positions. While we don't see the completion of this decay, it is well on its way by the end of the book. There is another major theme to Waugh's novel and that is of religion; perhaps religion is \\"the\\" theme of this work. As the story begins, we see the featured family of Lord Marchmain still in their glory but with the beginning signs of disintegration. There are merely a few small allusions to religion, Marchmain's family being Catholics-a small minority in England. Toward the end of the novel, as deterioration has truly set in, this topic of the Catholic faith becomes more and more pronounced until it begins to seem that this was basically the reason the book was written. A depiction of religion as part of life is perfectly acceptable to me in literature as long as I don't feel the author is trying to propagandize me into his particular belief system. But I got a strong impression that the narrator, having lost his claim to a superior existence through his associations with the upper crust becomes progressively more amenable to religious influences as a route to becoming part of another elect group. The last few paragraphs of the book seem to indicate, in a vague and diffuse imagery, that through all his struggles and disillusionments he has discovered something more important than all the things he previously held dear; that is, the promise of the Catholic faith. This novel has the subtitle; The Sacred and Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder. In my opinion, the profane parts were much more entertaining than the sacred ones. Where Waugh really shines is in the witty conversations between the narrator and the roguish friends of his youth. He also displays great talent in capturing the loveliness and charm of a landscape; and he is a master at conveying delicate shades of poignant emotion evoked by the beauty and sadness of life. As for the sacred parts, I fall back on that old, rather unsophisticated saying; If I want to hear a sermon, I'll go to church."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"The story has been summarized before: from an army camp, Charles Ryder reminisces about his youthful passion for a young aristocrat, Lord Flyte, and his subsequent passion for Lord's Flyte's sister, who has much in her of the young man - meaning she looks a lot like him.Let me dispel a few misconceptions. First, that this is a masterpiece of style:it ain't. the style is pedestrian, efficient in a workaday manner. There are no arresting phrases, no memorable scenes. When the emotional temper of the story rises, the author piles on a lot of qualifiers, but it all seems rather contrived, as if he was trying to get himself pumped up.Second: that it is a brilliant portrayal of a declining aristocracy: yes, there is some of that. It is done, however, in passing, with rushed asides. There is no sustained exploration. In fact, the novel is laughably thin on framing a sense of the age in which it lives. Contemporary references are done by piling on lines of dialogue, mainly lines from Rex's oafish friends. That is cheap theatrical technique, done by someone who is merely trying to imply profundities, and not go into the trouble of actually writing them.Third: that it is a deep exploration of religious faith, or the loss thereof. Phew. I have a question for those who say that: have you read Dostoevsky or even Graham Greene? Read Greene if you want a much deeper understanding of Catholicism in our world. The brief remarks on religion in this book are laughably simplistic: again, allusions, hints at a greater meaning, paths sketched but not followed through. What is the meaning of Julia's hysterical crisis? Can you read that and wonder where it came from?About Sebastian. Of course he was gay. Why was he caring for the German? Just out of friendship? We don't know if Ryder was, but the narrator calls Sebastian the forerunner of his love for Julia. What does that mean?As a novel, this is rather boring. Nothing much happens. There are a lot of re-tellings of events. Narration consists of a number of dialogues. It seems to be mainly about upper class and upper middle class young men who wanted to have sex with each other, but didn't. Classic."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Evelyn Waugh's BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is a flawed masterpiece. It is his only major novel that is not fundamentally a comic novel, as well as his most clearly religious one. In the opinion of many readers - for instance, the great British novelist Henry Green wrote his friend Waugh that he loved the book but did not care for the ending. Famed critic Edmund Wilson felt the same way, as have many, many readers. Charles Ryder's conversion and the not terribly breakup of his and Julia's engagement are not very compelling or convincing. First his intense hostility to Lord Marchmain's taking Last Rites seems to come out of nowhere - at least in its strength and intensity - and then his conversion is even more out of the blue. Waugh had intended the novel to be about Divine Grace, but most readers, including most Christians, find the religious aspects of the book off putting, not least because his theology is unpalatable. Most Catholics that I have talked to find his religious views harsh and un-Christian and Protestants care for them even less. This was my third time to read BRIDESHEAD REVISITED and all three times the ending of the book struck me as hollow and unconvincing.Yet, this is one of my favorite books. How can I love a book so deeply that ends so poorly? There are three reasons. First, Charles Ryder's narrative voice is one of the most splendid in all of literature. His world-weary and defeated telling of the tale is poetic and beautiful, though heartbreaking and unspeakably sad. I would place Charles among the four or five most haunting narrators in all of literature. Second, Waugh's dialogues are exceptionally fine. On a first reading there are dozens of conversations that stick with the reader and get replayed in one's mind over and over. The best in the book are actually not dialogues but monologues by Anthony Blunt, one of the most entrancing supporting characters in fiction. Third, Waugh has created in this book some of the most vividly conceived characters in English literature. All three of these factors merge to create many of the most perfect moments one could hope to experience.All of which makes the ending of the novel even more heartbreaking. As a Catholic convert Waugh wanted to write the Great Catholic Novel for his age. I don't think he succeeded. He made nothing even remotely resembling a case for Catholic belief. Waugh's God - or at least the God projected by the Brideshead set - is hard and implacable and unyielding. But Waugh did manage to created an unforgettable novel of frustrated dreams of youth and self-destruction. Oddly enough, despite the novel beings set among the last days of the English aristocracy and its supplanting by business tycoons - though both feature in the novel as background - it isn't too much about changing class in Britain. But focusing on those elements would have made the book about something other than it was. It was about the individuals belonging to the class rather than the class itself, though the knowledge of what was happening to the class lies like a shadow in the background.The book is also structured around the two romances that Charles has with two members of the Flyte family. It isn't made clear whether Sebastian and Charles have a physical relationship, but their friendship, even if platonic, is clearly romantic. In one way Charles's affair with Julia is merely the consummation of what had started with Sebastian, something that Charles says explicitly to Julia.Had the ending of this book been up to the level of the rest of the book, this might well have been one of the finest English novels ever written. Even as it is, it is a very fine book. I don't think it is Waugh's best novel, even though it contains some of the best things he ever wrote (my vote for his most perfect books would be the Sword of Honour Trilogy, SCOOP, and A HANDFUL OF DUST). And the novel is one of the reasons that Waugh is among my favorite writers. I look forward to reading it for a fourth time.I additionally strongly recommend the exceptionally find BBC miniseries based upon the novel, starring Jeremy Irons as Charles Ryder and Anthony Andrews as Sebastian and Laurence Olivier as Lord Marchmain. I honestly believe that it is the single finest production ever made for television and it is pretty much a scene for scene recreation of the novel. It is also the finest version of a novel that I believe has ever been done either for television or film."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I don't think I'm a typical Waugh reader, if there is one. A friend, devouring his ouvre voraciously, gave me this book in high school or college, and at the time I thought it very good. I recently reread it, however, spurred on by Thomas Howard's lively essay on it in The Night is Far Spent, a collection of Howardiana, mainly essays on literature.The second time around I was more aware of the construction, which seems to me somewhat different than the sort of savage satire Waugh was known for or the occasional dark comedy like The Loved One. I say that having read only a few novels and knowing little of the author's background. Waugh was early on the great champion of P.G. Wodehouse, whose light comedies of manners seem so different from his own novels, that I perhaps search for something of PGW in EW in my reading.This novel illustrates some of the pitfalls and challenges of writing in the first person, in that Captain Ryder talks somewhat differently than he thinks, with his part of a dialogue sometimes amounting to a mere sentence or even a word. Driving (reading)along that smooth road, as it were, one encounters a speed bump in the shift to the second sort of writing, which consists of descriptive passages, and to a third sort consisting of longer ruminations and reflection by Ryder on the present and past. As one reviewer put it, the story is told by indirection.This is Waugh's best known novel, largely due to the popular British mini-series made from it a few years back. It's also often said to be his only Catholic novel, but that means the main characters are Catholics (not Ryder) not that Waugh has some didactic purpose or hidden agenda in the writing. Those well read in Waugh may want to check out Howard's essay. For those new to him, Brideshead may well be the place to start."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"This book is worth a read for one reason: Waugh skillfully portrays the dysfunctions and excesses of aristocratic British life. The evident futility of their lives is very poignantly expressed - Waugh's literary style seems to just ooze 'futility' and a sense of 'an end of an era'.That being said, I did not find the prose very fluid (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). I also do not generally like books where I'm left with a sense of loss and hopelessness. However, if you do like those types of books, then Waugh's poignancy is definitely not to be missed."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Evelyn Waugh's didactic Catholicism intrudes on this otherwise sparkling depiction of the decline of the British aristocracy.Known more for his bitterly funny satires of British 20th-century life, Waugh here weaves only snippets of humor into a broader emotional palette, building a tale that moves from the sophisticated sarcasm of the university to the mourning of a trouble clan ultimately cursed by fortune.Brideshead Revisited reminds us that as a prose stylist, Waugh had few equals. His multi-faceted and strikingly human depictions of the Brideshead inhabitants, his facility with language, his stately compression; few writers can claim to have so often struck upon le mot juste. Yet his central theme of spiritual awakening never stabilizes into a coherent whole; In the end, narrator Ryder's mood is ambivalent (as is the reader's), while the broken Marchmain clan swoons into a somewhat banal parade of rediscovered, yet damaged, Catholicism.In his letters, critic Edmund Wilson pointed to Brideshea"},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I was forced to buy this by clicking on kindle unconsciously ...it's t o o b a dkindle is tricky"},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I don't know if I can think of this book without picturing Jeremy Irons as Charles Ryder. His work on the audiobook is top notch. Highly reccommended for any fan of the novel."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I like the reading of Jeremy Irons, certainly perfectly matched due to his own performance as its protagonist, Charles Ryder, in the BBC miniseries. A couple of decades after that role accelerated his breakthrough, he returns to the novel. He enters smoothly into a wide range of male and female, young and old, foreign and English characters. He responds with the same elegant wit and sensitive emotion which made his Random House audiobook of \\"Lolita\\" similarly praiseworthy. (I reviewed this too.)As for the book, does it hold up? I'd read it in college after I'd seen the series, and I found that Evelyn Waugh, as a Catholic convert, was still handling the shift in his own sensibility delicately. The coming of age of the younger members of the family Charles meets, and how they face the demands of maturity in morals, responsibilities, and economic demands in a changing society serves as the theme for what on the surface, and at first, feels a lighter comedy of manners. Gradually, the defense of the Church's teachings emerges, unsurprisingly and steadily, to counter in the hapless Marchmains the Oxford-London smart set with their own daring morals, or their lack, among the privileged class of post-WWI Britain, and as WWII arrives again. The framing device of Ryder's return to Brideshead, the title of the work, gives added depth in the cyclical brutality within the fate of the ancestral manse, symbolically and spiritually, and some of the last pages in this novel provide its most moving passages.Perhaps the reading betters the book. I admired Waugh's satire and it's enjoyable to hear of so many sent up so well. It does feel a long work even if \\"only\\" ten CDs narrate those interwar decades. Due to Irons' command of the material, he sustained my interest better than if it'd been a text to re-read. If you wonder how the book stands up after you'd seen the series, as many of us came to this novel in this way, I'd recommend the audiobook."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I don't know how or why I never got around to reading the book or watching the PBS series.

Also, Waugh takes every opportunity to embellish the narrative with his dry, slightly cynical wit. I will definitely re-read this at some point. It is certainly heavier and more serious than any of his other books that I have read, but the characterization alone makes it engrossing."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"The use of language - word choice, sentence construction, metaphor - is to be savored. As a record of the deterioration of a privileged and powerful class, it is a compelling history. Reading the story now, seventy years later, it offers a cautionary view of a class - antagonist, at the time, to privilege - that began its vibrant rise in the 1930s and, in its turn, has become privileged, unadaptive, and precarious. The television production of the early 1980s - available on DVD - is rich, compelling, and among the great dramatizations of a novel. In both reading the novel and in viewing the television production, \\"A Companion to Evelyn Waugh's Bridesherad Revisited\\" by David Cliffe, available on the web, is greatly illuminating."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"ONe of the finest novels written in the English Language.

But to read Waugh's novel, you'd think that the greatest single tragedy these conflicts brought about was that his posh friends were deprived of their expensive houses.Advice for aspiring novelists: if you're A) a genuinely gifted prose stylist, and B) an utterly repulsive specimen of humanity, it's best to steer away from writing thinly veiled autobiography.Also, if you decide to ignore the above advice, don't try to exculpate yourself by twittering on about how you've Found Jesus."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"FORMAT. There is one narrator, Simon Ryder. The novel is in four parts. The first and last are in the \\"present\\" while the middle two are in the \\"past.\\" The middle two compose the bulk of the book.SYNOPSIS. The first of them is apparently about an eccentric h*m*s*x**l alcoholic, Sebastian Flyte (I wrote that word that way to deceive the automatic censor). It is mostly about how his alcoholism gets him kicked out of Oxford and how his family tries to get him dried up, without avail. Ryder is in the background, but interacts with the other characters.The second of them is apparently about the affair between Ryder and Flyte's sister Julia. They both are unhappily married and decide to divorce their spouses and then marry one another. However, after they are divorced but before they remarry (or something like that), Julia's father dies. He had become a Catholic to marry his wife, but had been excommunicated later. But, in his death throes, he made some gestures that might have indicated that he wanted to become a Catholic again. The whole family (also Catholic), whether observant or not, is concerned about his soul. They are therefore relieved when it seems he might have repented. Ryder, seeing this, suddenly stops being a jaded agnostic and believes in God. He and Julia decide not to marry after all, since Catholicism forbade remarriage unless the marriage was annulled by the Holy See.The first and last parts are Ryder returning to the Flyte family house (known as Brideshead, it being at the head of the stream called Bride) years later.EVALUATION. The dialogue is frequently scintillating and delightful. The narration has some great phrases. Take, for example, the metaphor, \\"thin bat's squeak of sexuality audible only to me,\\" which refers to his reaction when a girl asks him to light a cigarette, apparently requiring him to put it in his mouth. The narration, however, is obnoxious at times. Waugh tried to use a physics metaphor without even describing the metaphor, pleading ignorance of physics.The division of the book mostly into two separate stories is bad. It disassociates parts of the story from one another, interrupting the narrative and one's identification with the characters. In fact, the two halves seem like different novels.The whole feel of the story of a dysfunctional English aristocratic family in the 1930s was warm and fuzzy.Now for the book's purpose, which is supposedly to show divine grace. Firstly, I do not like novels that try to demonstrate a proposition or teach a lesson. Secondly, I do not like the proposition or lesson of this book. Are we to believe that grace comes at certain times to certain persons for no given reason? That seems quite odd. The idea that one has lived his whole life one way can suddenly decide to change at the last minute is inexplicable. Also, it seems that the book is saying that those raised Catholic cannot escape the faith. That seems to deny the power of choice of the one taught. I regard these theses as repugnant."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"The story begins with Charles Ryder being in the army during in world war two. He comes across the estate of his old friend, Sebastian Flyte during the war and it stirs up his old memories and that's where the story actually starts because that whole first chapter, you must understand, is entirely boring. The novel is sort of told in flashback mode by Ryder who befriends Sebastian during his college years after meeting him in a contrived way (throwing up in Ryder's room) and that of course, brings about events that would never ever happen (a guy sending a fellow he barely knows a room full of flowers and inviting him to have lunch with his friends) in real life. Sebastian carries around a teddybear that is a gimmick the writer uses to make people remember Sebastian is \\"different\\" from the the rest of the people in the story. Besides the teddybear, Sebastian does very little else to distinguish himself between him and the rest of the people in this story but then half way threw it, he goes from guy who drinks for fun (Charles and Sebastain skip away and get drunk alot) to big just a pathetic drunk. So, I guess he was given TWO chacterstics then, lol. There's another fellow in the story called Anthony Blanche but he's barely worth mentioning but he's big gimmick is stuttering and after a while, it becomes so tiresome and awful. I couldn't wait for that him to be written out. He's supposed to be rather openly homosexual but Charles and Sebastian's relationship is written as more of sort of friendship with hints of homosexuality. It's really left up to the reader's imagination or what you want to believe. So anyway, Sebastian hates his family but he keeps dragging Charles back to his big rich castle home until he eventually encounters them, first sort of as individuals and later as almost a whole family except for Sebastian's dad who left the family and lives with another woman. Sebastian acts like a baby when he gets around his family and worries they'll steal Charles away from him but then he locks himself up in his room and drinks so Charles has little choice but get to socialize with them. Eventually, their 'friendship' falls apart and Charles falls for Sebastian's sister. After their 'friendship' dissolved, sebastian disappears and is only briefly mentioned and I found the novel got pretty dull after that and it was a struggle to finish. The final outcome of it all left alot to be desired to.

Fine as this book undoubtedly is, that does not make for timeless writing. What you have in Brideshead Revisited is an advanced lexicon made to seem grave and thoughtful by the unreasonably harsh view its characters take of luxury. I am not here to denounce the rich and I'm sympathetic to the kind of love described in this book. I think, however, that I was bored by the 450th word for flower turned out by the end of Book One. This seems quibbling but God must be in the details, and I think the incompleteness sensed by other reviewers on this site is a result of Waugh's preference for unusual words over unusual meaning."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I very much wanted to like this book, but didn't.

And I loved his book Scoop.Brideshead tells the story of Charles Ryder and his infatuation with the dysfunctional, upperclass, Roman Catholic, Marchmain Family in the years between the Wars.

I do not care that it's considered a \\"classic\\". That does not save it from its numerous shortcomings, the biggest one being that the plot was pretty thin and uninteresting, dealing mostly with the subject of religion (Catholicism) and how it can potentially destroy lives. The ending in particular was very jarring and dissatisfying. The whole Charles-Julia relationship towards the end of the book felt forced, given the fact that previously there was little interaction between the two. Be aware that Evelyn Waugh himself was mildly disparaging of his creation in hindsight. In his correspondence with Graham Greene in 1950 he wrote \\"I re-read Brideshead Revisited and was appalled.\\" He continues, \\"It was a bleak period of present privation and threatening disaster - the period of soya beans and Basic English - and in consequence the book is infused with a kind of gluttony, for food and wine, for the splendours of the recent past, and for rhetorical and ornamental language which now, with a full stomach, I find distasteful.\\" If you are someone who reads books merely for their beautiful prose, then by all means read this book. However, if you are someone like me who values exciting plots and strong fully developed characters more than the use of flowery language, then skip this book.

When I finished Brideshead Revisited, she declined the offer. She said it was a boring title with a boring cover, and that I hadn't said anything at all to make her think it was a good read. Yet Brideshead Revisited is extremely well written. When it came time for me to write a review of my own performance at work, I tried to find inspiration from Waugh's style; I showed the review to my wife, who was blown away by how well it was written. So where is the disconnect?Perhaps it stems from the fact that there is no real story line. What is Brideshead Revisited about? I can tell you that it touches on religion and war and homosexuality and class and family, but I am hard pressed to provide a synopsis. (I finally concluded that it is a family portrait, which is what adorns the cover of my edition.) More likely my dissatisfaction is a result of the dispassionate voice of the main character/narrator that gives the story a dream-like quality similar to L'Etranger by Camus. If the narrator himself is dispassionate, that makes it tough for me to get wrapped up in the novel.I fear that criticizing a modern classic speaks more to my own unsophisticated tastes than to the strengths or weaknesses of the novel, so it is it is with some trepidation that I give Brideshead Revisited only three stars. The book sat on my shelf for over a decade before I finally picked it up. What took me so long? Perhaps it's as simple as it being a boring title with a boring cover.

Their love comes to nothing when the sister's dorment Catholic morality is reawakened.The thing that saves this book for me is the beauty of the prose.

Waugh was a British aristocrat, alcoholic and a devout Roman Catholic. He was a conservative and a snob. The man could, however, write with power, passion and keen skills of observation.The 300 page novel is narrated by Charles Ryder. Ryder is a middle class chap who aspires to be a painter. His father is distant and dull; his mother was killed during World War I. Charles enters Oxford quickly becoming acquainted with a bohemian set. Homoeroticism is normative in this group led by the outre Anthony Patch. Charles becomes acquainted with Sebastian Flyte wealthy and spoiled son of Lord and Lady MarchmainDuring a summer recess Ryder and Sebastian visit the latter's ancestral home Brideshead. The Marchmains are Roman Catholics who have had the faith instilled deeply into their psyches by the formidable Lady Marchmain.Charles is drawn closer to the Marchmains as time passes. In addition to Sebastian he meets and eventually has an adulterous relationship with Juia. Brideshead the oldest son is a snob and ninnyhead who collects matchbox boxes and weds a fat, fortyish and fatuous widow. The youngest child is Celia who enters a convent later emerging to do nursing work.The glorious springtime of hope for the family comes a cropper. Sebastian drops out of school, becomes an alcoholic and lives out his life in a monastery in Tunisia. Julia weds the obtuse and greedy Rex Mottram but ditches him for Charles. After her mother dies her Catholic teaching keeps her from marrying Charles. Ryder is an agnostic who cannot persuade Julia to leave God for him. Ryder is a sad sack of a man despite his fame in the art world. He and all of the characters are lonely seekers for love which they find elusive.Charles becomes a captain in the British army in World War II. It is in this capacity that he and his squad camp out at the deserted Brideshead estate. Memories flood his nostalgic soul for a lost dawn when life was just beginning and the drab life of wartime England was not even imaginable. At age 39 the divorced Charles pines for the love of Julia dreaming of a happiness which will never be fulfilled.Waugh is adept at using symbolism. Sebastian was an early Christian martyr slain with arrows. Sebastian the Marchmain son is also slain by the slings and arrows in flight which destoy his fragile pesona. Sebastian clutching his teddybear Aloysius is also a fragile toy who cannot escape the Roman Catholicism faith. Sebastian is alwas in flight but never finds a perch in this world. Charles Ryder rides with the Roman Catholic aristocracy but never feels he is really a part of that close knitted group. Ryder becomes a famous artist but is unfaithful to his dull and amorous wife. Lady Marchmain marches forth carrying high the banner of Catholic orthodoxy. The death scene of the old roue Lord Marchmain finds him returning to the faith in a touching death scene. Waugh is a Christian writer in our secular age.None of the characters are lovable and all are deeply flawed. They do live and breathe and become human for us as we are enveloped by the rich prose of Mr. Waugh.Brideshead Revisited has had a big revival due to the new movie and the reissue of the series on DVD which was broadcast by the BBC years ago. The book is very British, slow moving and more character centered than plot driven. It is a novel which will make you think on everything from snobbery to social class to faith. No wonder it is a modern classic."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"This brief review has two purposes. First, to encourage readers to buythe cloth-bound edition, which fits easily into the hand, has much cleaner printing than the paperback, and contains an excellent introduction by Sir Frank Kermode together with a helpful chronology, which puts Waugh into the context of contemporary writings and events. It is well worth the extra two dollars.My second purpose is to alert readers coming to the book after seeing the recent Miramax movie, that the two are likely to be quite different experiences. The film is magnificently set, splendidly acted, and passionately dramatic; it has all the Hollywood virtues. But it almost misses the fact that Waugh's purpose was as much spiritual as secular: to demonstrate, as he put it, \\"the operation of divine grace upon a group of diverse but closely connected characters.\\" You could come away from the movie thinking it was an anti-Catholic tract -- but Waugh's novel, despite its characteristic comedy, is also a profound religious statement. I develop this point in more detail in my review of the cloth-bound edition, but whichever one you buy, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"If you love the BBC TV mini-series based on Evelyn Waugh's \\"Brideshead Revisited\\", it's not an option not to own this book! While the script and dialogue almost follow line by line from the novel, it is an immense pleasure to read the actual novel and savour Waugh's witty and delightful writing style. His education at Lancing and Hertford College at Oxford, comes through vividly in the book about the friendship between Charles Ryder and Lord Sebastian Flyte who met at the Oxford University and their choices and journeys in life. This edition with Evelyn Waugh's photo on the front cover is my favourite."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Jeremy Irons does an excellent reading of Evelyn Waugh's classic novel.

Charles Ryder, artist and scion of a minor upper class family, is a captain during World War II whose unit is posted to a large estate (Brideshead), a place where he spent some of the happiest, and unhappiest, times of his life back in the early 1920s, when he was at Oxford with Sebastian Flyte, the younger son of the wealthy and Catholic Marchmain family. The first part of the book is the story of the rise and fall of the friendship between Ryder and Sebastian, who hates his mother and sinks into alcoholism. The second part, which seems disconnected, is the story of Charles's success and the collapse of his marriage, and of his tenuous affair with Julia, Sebastian's sister. And that's about all the plot there is. But I enjoyed the book mostly for Waugh's mastery of character evolution, his depiction of the changes in Sebastian's grasp on the real world and on the growth of Ryder's cynicism. The supporting characters are fascinating: Sebastian's eldest brother, Brideshead (a lovely name!); the younger, pious sister, Cordelia; their friends, Anthony Blanche and Boy Mulcaster, who grow from tiresome undergraduates to men occasionally worth listening to; Julia's Canadian husband, Rex Mottrom; Sebastian's parents and Charles's father, and even quite minor figures in the story. There are also some great comic scenes, such as the thoroughly heathenish Rex's efforts to be converted to Roman Catholicism to please Julia's family, and Cousin Jasper's disquisition on how to be a proper Oxford Man. And Waugh's take on the peculiarities of the Anglo-Catholic world are very good. On the other hand, few of these characters are actually worth the reader's sympathy; they all have far too much money and the associated freedom to do just as they please, and none of them ever contributes much, if anything, to society at large."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Brideshead Revisited is an eloquently written book, visiting themes such as religion, beauty and the \`languor of youth'.I've read it three times over and it never fails to capture my imagination about the splendours of the recent past, aristocratic life and picturesque settings.Its theme is memory infused with the venomous-pleasures of love and beauty. It narrates a succession of relationships nourished by charm and an eternal search for one's being. It's a tale about illusions, despair, hope, faith, expectations and finally about the voyage in life... a voyage often dotted by encounters with beautiful people."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I loved reading this book for two reasons, first it completely transported me into another country and into another era. Second, it captured the sheer joy of youthful friendship, where the responsibilities and trials of later life have not yet taken their toll.To me, the book realisticly portrayed the drama of life and how life's experiences change not only a persons outlook on life, but changes the dynamics between friends with whom, at some point, we felt we could never live without. What causes friendships that were once so close, to gradually fade away? This poetic tale allows you to ponder the delicate nature of both friendships and romantic relationships. Every once in a while you get in the mood for a story that will leave you in an introspective, if not melancholy mood......this is such a story."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"In his classic novel \\"Brideshead Revisited\\", British author Evelyn Waugh offers an intimate view of English family life during World War II. His story revolves around a dying patriarch, Lord Marchmain, and is narrated by his elder daughter Julia's lover, Charles Ryder. A man notably detached from his emotions, Ryder experiences a dramatic turn-around by novel's end.Ryder's change of heart comes about during the final months of Marchmain's life. The patriarch himself is not overly concerned with his latest round of failing health and confidently expects to recover. His son Lord Brideshead (Bridey), however, sees otherwise and summons the local priest Father Mackay to anoint his father. Not even pretending hospitality, Marchmain has his younger daughter Cordelia spirit the priest out the door. In the words of his Venetian mistress Cara, Marchmain is a scoffer who disdains the Church.Marchmain's shabby dismissal of Father Mackay sets a negative tone. Ryder himself chimes in with the sarcastic remark, \\"The witch-doctor has gone.\\" Skepticism like this, however, provides little comfort to the dying aristocrat. Even his personal physician can do nothing more than to try to keep his patient alive from day to day.Both Cordelia and Bridey are away when their father's condition takes a sharp turn for the worse. Julia, on the other hand, is at the estate and promptly goes out to call for Father Mackay. After she and the priest return, Mackay gets an update from Marchmain's doctor: the patriarch is now semi-comatose. The priest then goes in to see the dying man and asks him to acknowledge remorse.At first Marchmain does nothing. Father Mackay anoints him anyway and as he gives him the final blessing, the dying aristocrat surprises everyone by motioning with the sign of the cross. Marchmain thus makes his peace with God and dies reconciled to the Church. For Ryder this is like the \\"veil of the temple being rent from top to bottom.\\" From then on, both he and Julia know instinctively that their affair is over and that they would be leading separate lives.Dennis J.

The time is pre-World War II, the characters are complex, and the writing is excellent."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"\\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is the kind of novel that seeps into your skin and bones just from scanning a few pages, and when read at length can fill your head for days with the language and vision of the lost world author Evelyn Waugh conjures back from the dead. Yet its sharp insights on society and religion, not to mention liberal and welcome doses of sarcastic good humor, offer far more than a mere precious curio.Charles Ryder, an officer in the British Army, finds himself suddenly stationed at a base located at the now-empty manor house of his long-lost friend, Sebastian Flyte, and his noble family. Being back at Brideshead, as this country seat is called, stirs Charles to remember what he had, what he lost, and what he carries with him.Waugh's ability with language and his keen insights into the human condition are on full display in this, his best-loved work, though it's atypically serious of intent for someone who is popularly thought of simply as a curmudgeonly, grandiloquent wit. For all his talent on display in other novels, you get a sense it came together here in a remarkable way. Waugh here paints a detailed and celebratory portrait of the good life, of picnicking on strawberries and white wine in secluded bowers, trysts on cruise ships, and life lived amid museum-caliber splendor, yet at the same time presents a compelling argument for Catholic austerity and discipline in seeking life's higher purpose.For Charles, it is a hard journey that takes him from being a young student at Oxford who believes with confidence \\"that to know and love one other human being is the root of all wisdom\\" to becoming a sadder, older man who begins to ponder: \\"Perhaps all our loves are merely hints and symbols; vagabond-language scrawled on gate-posts and paving-stones along the weary road that others have tramped before us.\\"Waugh writes with a fine sense of style and language, and cleverness, too, but in this book, unlike any of the others of his I have read, you get a feeling of sympathy, too, of people being observed not just with precision and wit but compassion, too, which is both unexpected and welcome. He promotes his faith unreservedly, but not uncritically, offering hard questions and a sense of grace as hard-won. Humor, too; like the stories one girl tells a credulous would-be convert about how Catholics all believe in \\"sacred monkeys\\" and sleep with their feet pointing East \\"because that's the direction to Heaven.\\"The occasional purpleness of the prose and some later dialogue is oft-commented upon, True, Waugh let himself go sometimes, but given the beauty of his writing, which is really about the best there is, its hard to begrudge the extra line, or the odd declamation that rings a bit false upon reflection. So much else here feels so alive. This is a book worth reading; savoring, too, though the reading's the only part you will have to work at.Whether or not you find the task of reading the novel daunting, worth checking out is David Cliffe's Evelyn Waugh website, which includes a detailed and illuminating \\"Brideshead\\" reading companion, and of course the excellent Grenada TV series from 1981, which is how I and so many others got here in the first place.
