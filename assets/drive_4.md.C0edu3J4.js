As Libertus investigates a seemingly accidental death, sinister details begin to unravel.

'Libertus himself is a highly diverting character, the story moves briskly along at chariot pace and there are many diversions along the highways and byways of Roman and Celtic life' - Northern Echo When Perennis Felix, favourite of the Roman Emperor and would-be enemy of all, heralds his arrival in Glevum (modern Gloucester) with the arbitrary execution of a slave, there are few who dare to question his actions. Indeed, a feast in his honour is universally approved in the cause of self-preservation. Libertus, freedman and pavement-maker, and his patron, Marcus Septimus, are among the reluctant citizens at the celebration. But the festivities come to an end when Felix appears to choke on a nut and dies in front of a stunned gathering. But Libertus suspects that behind Felix's apparently accidental death lies a much more sinister explanation...

Beginning November 11, 1918, when President Woodrow Wilson declared the end of World War I in a letter to the American public, and continuing through his defeat, Prohibition, the Big Red Scare, the rise of women s hemlines, and the stock market crash of 1929, Only Yesterday, published just two years after the crash, chronicles a decade like no other.

Ook de 10-delige tv-serie van Masters of the Air wordt door Tom Hanks en Steven Spielberg geproduceerd. Masters of the Air is het zeer persoonlijke verhaal van de Amerikaanse bomber boys (onder wie bekende filmsterren als Clark Gable en Jimmy Stewart), die lang voordat de geallieerde grondtroepen Duits grondgebied bereikten Hitler in de Tweede Wereldoorlog het vuur aan de schenen legden. Met de verhalende kracht van fictie neemt historicus Donald L. Miller de lezer op een enerverende vlucht door het door de gevechten vuurrode luchtruim boven Berlijn, Hannover en Dresden. De Achtste Luchtmacht (The Mighty Eighth) begon halverwege 1942 met een beperkte bombardementscampagne. Vechtend op bijna acht kilometer hoogte in ijzige omstandigheden, werd de bemanning van de bommenwerpers geconfronteerd met aanslagen op hun geestelijke en fysieke gesteldheid. Daarbij werden enorme verliezen geleden, maar uiteindelijk werd het luchtoffensief toch een succes, waardoor de Duitse oorlogsinspanning steeds meer ontwricht raakte. De Amerikaanse escortejagers maakten korte metten met de Luftwaffe. De prijs die hiervoor betaald moest worden was hoog: de Achtste Luchtmacht verloor tijdens de oorlog meer mensen dan het Amerikaanse Korps Mariniers. En degenen die het overleefden, gingen gebukt onder een enorme psychische druk ten gevolge van het vliegen van operaties die veel weg hadden van zelfmoordmissies. Masters of the Air is gebaseerd op recente interviews, ooggetuigenverslagen, en onder andere Amerikaans, Brits en Duits archiefmateriaal. Donald L. Miller heeft het tot een bijzonder meeslepende en levensechte getuigenis van s werelds eerste en enige luchtoorlog gemaakt, die evenals eerder Band of Brothers tot serie gemaakt wordt door Steven Spielberg en Tom Hanks. \`Het is onmogelijk niet meegezogen te worden door Millers passie voor het onderwerp en zijn grootse prestatie.

Such a label implies that social and cultural decline followed the end of Roman imperial control. But Christopher Snyder shows that Britain developed unique social, political, and religious institutions during this time. Snyder's innovative approach involves analysis of both the written and archaeological record. Looking at contemporary writers such as Patrick and Gildas, he shows how the cultural and political landscape was changing during this period. By the waning years of the Roman Empire, Britain was earning a special reputation as a province fertile with tyrants. These tyrants dominate the historical accounts of the fifth and sixth centuries and tell us much about the transition from magisterial to monarchical power in Britain. Combining this with what we know from archaeology, Snyder reveals a society that was a hybrid of indigenous (Celtic), Mediterranean (Roman), and Christian elements that preceded the coming of the Anglo-Saxons. An appendix explores how Arthur and Merlin fit into this picture. Snyder's other important findings include: - The military arrangements of the Britons owed much to both Roman and Celtic inspiration. - The spread of Christianity (and especially monasticism) after 400 was swift and unhindered by paganism. - The economy of Britain was not completely coinless and, indeed, was seemingly vigorous with the revival of trade with Gaul and the Mediterranean. - The growing cultural antagonism between the Britons and the Saxons would have far-reaching consequences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Yk3iTSxer4gC&dq=An+Age+of+Tyrants:+Britain+and+the+Britons,+A.D.+400-600&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stumbling on God: Faith and Vision in Mark's Gospel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xUGKNwAACAAJ&dq=Stumbling+on+God:+Faith+and+Vision+in+Mark%27s+Gospel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hungry For Peace: International Security, Humanitarian Assistance, And Social Change in North Korea","description":"Smith describes the famine that devastated the country in the 1990s and the international rescue program that Pyongyang requested and received.

To affect a successful landing the French required control of the narrow seaway which remained indisputably and infuriatingly dominated by the Royal Navy. Thus thwarted, the French Army turned about, marching eastwards towards the Danube. This book describes in thorough detail the brilliantly conceived and fought campaign that included the Battle of Austerlitz on December 2nd, 1805, which effectively ended the War of the Third Coalition with a decisive French victory. Indeed, Napoleon proclaimed it as his, 'grandest battle'. When first published in 1905 this book was titled 'A Hundred Years Ago: Battles by Land and Sea: Ulm, Trafalgar, Austerlitz'. This Leonaur edition has been edited to concentrate entirely on the land campaign to give the text greater focus for students of the campaigns of French Napoleonic armies. The role of undiminished British sea-power was strategically pivotal in the war against France, however the Battle of Trafalgar was fought after the campaign of 1805 had been launched and had no immediate influence upon it, so the centenary of the original publication to the naval battle is no longer relevant. This edition contains maps and illustrations which did not accompany original editions of the text. Leonaur editions are newly typeset and are not facsimiles; each title is available in softcover and hardback with dustjacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lhxQzQEACAAJ&dq=Austerlitz+(French+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Broken We Kneel Reflections on Faith and Citizenship","description":"Drawing on her personal experience and knowledge of religious history, Diana Butler Bass ex-amines the contours of the uniquely American relationships between church and state, Christian identity and patriotism, citizenship and congregational life. Broken We Kneel attempts to answer the central question with which so many people are struggling: do Christians owe their deepest allegiance to God or country? In writing both impassioned and historically informed, Bass reflects on current events and political questions that have sharpened the tensions between serious faith and national imperatives. This book incorporates the author's own experience of faith, her voca-tion as a writer and teacher, and her roles as wife, mother, and churchgoer into a larger conver-sation with Christian practice and contemporary political issues. Broken We Kneel is a call to re-member that the core of Christian identity is not always compatible with national political policies. This volume includes a new foreword and reflections on the sixteen years since the publication of the first edition. This second edition of Broken We Kneel includes a powerful new introduction by Rev. Robert W. Lee (author of A Sin By Any Other Name), and new reflections by Diana Butler Bass on the tensions of faith and citizenship, especially regarding race in a post-Charlottesville world. Broken We Kneel is both a lament and a plea for communities of faith to engage important issues.

In later years, untold numbers and kinds of people have felt the draw of the river s torrents, which pour down the Appalachians along the Georgia-South Carolina border. Because of Deliverance the Chattooga looms enigmatically in our shared imagination, as iconic as Twain s Mississippi or maybe Conrad s Congo. This is John Lane s search for the real Chattooga for the truths that reside somewhere in the river s rapids, along its shores, or in its travelers  hearts. Lane balances the dark, indifferent mythical river of Deliverance against the Chattooga known to locals and to the outdoors enthusiasts who first mastered its treacherous vortices and hydraulics. Starting at its headwaters, Lane leads us down the river and through its complex history to its current status as a National Wild and Scenic River. Along the way he stops for talks with conservation activists, seventh-generation residents, locals who played parts in the movie, day visitors, and others. Lane weaves into each encounter an abundance of details drawn from his perceptive readings and viewings of Deliverance and his wide-ranging knowledge of the Chattooga watershed. At the end of his run, Lane leaves us still fully possessed by the Chattooga s mystery, yet better informed about its place in his world and ours.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=T3_QDwAAQBAJ&dq=Chattooga:+Descending+into+the+Myth+of+Deliverance+River&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Married When It's Not Your First Time: An Etiquette Guide and Wedding Planner","description":"Any bride who?s headed back to the altar faces a number of tricky situations -- as well as the challenge of making this second or third wedding unique in its own right.

David McMurray investigates the local effects of the multiple linkages between Nador and international commodity circuits, and analyzes the profound effect on everyday life of the free flow of bodies, ideas, and commodities into and out of the region. Combining immigration and population statistics with street-level ethnography, In and Out of Morocco covers a wide range of topics, including the origin and nature of immigrant nostalgia, the historical evolution of the music of migration in the region, and the influence of migrant wealth on the social distinctions in Nador. Groundbreaking in its attention to the performative aspects of life in a smuggling border zone, the book also analyzes the way in which both migration and smuggling have affected local structures of feeling by contributing to the spread of hyperconsumption. The result is a rare and revealing inquiry into how the global culture is lived locally.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=x_Wtrjs3m1cC&dq=In+And+Out+Of+Morocco:+Smuggling+and+Migration+in+a+Frontier+Boomtown&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ralph Compton: The Ogallala Trail","description":"The trail to riches is lined with danger in this Ralph Compton western...

Suburban Safari is a fascinating and often hilarious record of her discoveries: that many animals adore the suburban environment, including bears and cougars venturing in from the woods; how plants, in their struggle for dominance, communicate with their own kind and battle other species; and that ways already exist for us to grow healthier, livelier lawns.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ad0BbrqsaakC&dq=Suburban+Safari:+A+Year+on+the+Lawn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"eVal","description":"Evaluation of Analytical Methods in Biological Systems","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lDGswqg7JJMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How Golf Clubs Really Work and How to Optimize Their Design","description":"The book entitled How Golf Clubs Really Work and How to Optimize Their Design ($29.95), is the first book published that focuses on the golf club and the way that golfers can utilize their specific clubs to achieve better shot control, leading to lower scores for all golfers. The book is the end result of a 10-year, full-time dedicated research effort for co-authors Frank D. Werner and Richard C. Grieg. Both have advanced degrees in aerospace engineering and together have over 90 patents. The authors have discussed many issues relevant to the game of golf and analyzed the way that different factors play a part in shot making. Chapters are included on optimal face curvature (bulge and roll may be extinct), shaft length and head weight to maximize distance, and the effects of wind drag on club head speed (less than you would expect). In addition, the authors have developed new aiming and shot control techniques that could allow golfers to have better control, hit more fairways and greens, and lower their scores. The book will provide useful insights for a broad spectrum of golfers from touring pros and teaching professionals to struggling beginners and serious golfers looking to shave a few strokes off their game.

It's not just the Duchess who has evidence, however. Windermere's private bank book shows that he's been giving large sums of money to a 'Mrs Erlynne' - on frequent occasions - and he himself even admits to seeing much of the woman. To add insult to injury, Windermere insists that Mrs Erlynne is invited to the ball that is being held for Lady Windermere's birthday. Employing the witty dialogue, social satire and outrageous paradox for which he is still remembered, Wilde's play shows us the destructiveness of gossip and superficial judgment, examines the ambiguous sexual morality and gender politics at the heart of the British ruling class, while simultaneously challenging our perceptions of what constitutes a 'good woman'. This New Mermaids contains a fully annotated version of the play text. The introduction includes an account of Wilde's life and a detailed analysis of Lady Windermere's Fan as well as its stage history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BET5PwAACAAJ&dq=Lady+Windermere%27s+Fan+(New+Mermaids)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Culture of Fact: England, 1550-1720","description":"Shapiro traces the genesis of the fact, a modern concept that originated not in natural science but in legal discourse.

She was twenty-two years old, and would spend the next year moving among the ruins of London, Warsaw, Paris, Prague, Madrid, and other cities as a stringer for a small British news service. In this lucid, affecting memoir, Fox describes her movements across Europe's scrambled borders: unplanned trips to empty castles and ruined cathedrals, a stint in bombed-out Warsaw in the midst of the Communist election takeovers, and nights spent in apartments here and there with distant relatives, friends of friends, and in shabby pensions with little heat, each place echoing with the horrors of the war. A young woman alone, with neither a plan nor a reliable paycheck, Fox made her way with the rest of Europe as the continent rebuilt and rediscovered itself among the ruins. Long revered as a novelist, Fox won over a new generation of readers with her previous memoir, Borrowed Finery. Now, with The Coldest Winter, she recounts another chapter of a life seemingly filled with stories a rare, unsentimental glimpse of the world as seen by a writer at the beginning of an illustrious career.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DQETHUyGBJMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winnie the Pooh and His Friends: Roo's Big Adventure","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=M0S0jgEACAAJ&dq=Winnie+the+Pooh+and+His+Friends:+Roo%27s+Big+Adventure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In memoriam,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EZdfAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Days of awe: Being a treasury of traditions, legends and learned commentaries concerning Rosh ha-Shanah, Yom Kippur and the days between, culled from three hundred volumes, ancient and new","description":"Some years ago an Englishwoman, a relative of the then Archbishop of Canterbury, asked S.Y.

His interpretation is based on one particular dynamic: how Chinese Protestants have sought to situate themselves in a socialist society within the unifying framework of the united front. After an overview of church, Marxism, and Christianity in China, Wickeri discusses the united front. He focuses on ideology, organization, and religious policy. Wickeri then explores the Three-Self Movement as both a Chinese and a Christian movement.

Stanley Jones","description":"The Totalitarian Kingdom of God provides the first examination of the political philosophy of E. Stanley Jones and establishes him as one of the leaders in twentieth century American political thought. Jones published twenty-eight books and was deeply involved in politics as a close friend of Gandhi and Nehru and a major direct influence on Martin Luther King Jr. He was also a prominent opponent of Japanese imperialism in China and the Philippines, and personally intervened with President Roosevelt immediately before the attack on Pearl Harbor, nearly succeeding in delaying or preventing the war in the Pacific. However, his role as a Christian missionary and evangelist led to his actions in politics, with special significance rising from a trip to Russia in 1934. He developed a philosophy of the kingdom of God through the Gospel of Jesus Christ which offers the believer not only personal salvation but also social, economic, and political salvation. This study of his ideas shows how he confronted the challenge of communism, Nazism, and Fascism in the 1930's and 40's, and how they applied to American Democracy after World War II.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4TVxAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Totalitarian+Kingdom+of+God:+The+Political+Philosophy+of+E.+Stanley+Jones&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Goddess Within: With Sun Charm Attached (Miniature Editions)","description":"The goddess exists in every woman--she is, always has been, and always will be a vital presence in our world.

Beginning with the dawn bear, the small dog-sized ancestor of all bears who hails from 25 million years ago, Bieder embarks on a fascinating exploration of the evolutionary history of the bear family, from extinct species such as the cave bear and giant short-faced bear to the mere eight species that survive today. Bear draws on cultural material from around the world to examine the various legends and myths surrounding the bear, including ceremonies and taboos that govern the hunting, killing, and eating of bears. The book also looks at the role of bears in modern culture as the subjects of stories, songs, and films; as exhibited objects in circuses and zoos; and, perhaps most famously, as toys. Bieder also considers the precarious future of the bear as it is threatened by loss of habitat, poaching, global warming, and disease and discusses the impact of human behavior on bears and their environments. Accompanied by numerous vibrant photographs and illustrations, and written in an engaging fashion, Bear is an appealing and informative volume for anyone who has curled up with Winnie-the-Pooh or marveled at this powerful king of the forest.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YX_xAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Awakening Beauty","description":"\\"Awakening Beauty\\" is an unprecedented expos  on the subject of beauty.

This is for the simple reason that human beings cannot comprehend how such feelings can exist at all, as everyone seemingly requires an incentive to perform any act; without some personal gain, people are not prepared to extend themselves. That is why a quality such as altruism can only be imparted to a person from Above, and only those who have experienced it can understand it.\\" Attaining The Worlds Beyond is a first step toward discovering the ultimate fulfillment of spiritual ascent in our lifetime. This book reaches out to all those who are searching for answers, who are seeking a logical and reliable way to understand the world's phenomena.

Fearless and outspoken, it dares to reveal that hidden world where perfumed caresses and half-whispered endearments constitute the forbidden fruits in a Garden of Eden where men are never accepted. This is how Diana: A Strange Autobiography was described when it was published in paperback in 1952. The original 1939 hardcover edition carried with it a Publisher's Note: This is the autobiography of a woman who tried to be normal. In the book, Diana is presented as the unexceptional daughter of an unexceptional plutocratic family. During adolescence, she finds herself drawn with mysterious intensity to a girl friend. The narrative follows Diana's progress through college; a trial marriage that proves she is incapable of heterosexuality; intellectual and sexual education in Europe; and a series of lesbian relationships culminating in a final tormented triangular struggle with two other women for the individual salvation to be found in a happy couple. In her introduction, Julie Abraham argues that Diana is not really an autobiography at all, but a deliberate synthesis of different archetypes of this confessional genre, echoing, as it does, more than a half-dozen novels. Hitting all the high and low points of the lesbian novel, the book, Abraham illustrates, offers a defense of lesbian relationships that was unprecedented in 1939 and radical for decades afterwards.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fy4TCgAAQBAJ&dq=Diana:+A+Strange+Autobiography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wills, Trusts & Estates: Examples & Explanations, Second Edition (Examples & Explanations Series)","description":"Succeed in your course and your paralegal career with WILLS, TRUSTS, AND ESTATE ADMINISTRATION, 8th Edition.

Focusing on some of the deepest instincts of American life and culture--individual liberty, freedom of speech, constructing a life--Arnold Weinstein brilliantly sketches the remarkable career of the American self in some of the major works of the past one hundred fifty years. Weinstein contends that American writers are haunted by the twin specters of the self as a mirage, as Nobody, and by the brutal forces of culture and ideology that deny selfhood to people on the basis of money, sex, and color of skin. His central thesis is that language makes possible freedoms and accomplishments that are achievable in no other realm, and that American fiction is a fascinating record of the human fight against coercion, of the kinds of maneuvering room that we may find in life and in art. This study is unique in several respects: it offers some of the keenest readings of major American texts that have ever been written, including some of the most significant works of the past decades, and it fashions a rich and supple view of the American novel as a writerly form of freedom, in sharp contrast to today's critical emphasis on blindness and co-option.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_xrAqhQgAd8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The enemy in his house (Harlequin romance)","description":"Harlequin Medical Romance brings you a collection of three new titles, available now!

In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!

We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money -- and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success. Using the principles he teaches, T. Harv Eker went from zero to millionaire in only two and a half years. Eker is president of Peak Potentials Training, one of the fastest growing success training companies in North America.

Among many other themes, the authors analyze how research on the origin of life became wedded to the search for life on other planets and for extraterrestrial intelligence. Many scientific breakthroughs of the last forty years were either directly supported or indirectly spun off from NASA's exobiology program, including cell symbiosis, the discovery of the Archaea, and the theories of Nuclear Winter and the asteroid extinction of the dinosaurs. Exobiology and astrobiology have generated public fascination, enormous public relations benefits for NASA, and--on the flip side of the coin--some of the most heated political wrangling ever seen in government science funding. Dick and Strick providea riveting overview of the search for life throughout the universe, with all of the Earthly complexities of a science-in-the-making and the imperfect humans called scientists. Their book will appeal to biologists, historians and philosophers of science, planetary scientists (including geologists), and an educated general readership interested in the investigation of life on other planets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iCrEjiYNXQEC&dq=The+Living+Universe:+NASA+and+the+Development+of+Astrobiology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cursed Land (Magic: The Gathering)","description":"Fantasy roman.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XKLsGwAACAAJ&dq=The+Cursed+Land+(Magic:+The+Gathering)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fifth Queen","description":"The Fifth Queen trilogy is a series of connected historical novels by English novelist Ford Madox Ford.

This conundrum--sometimes alluded to as \\"the anthropic principle,\\" \\"self-locating belief,\\" or \\"indexical information\\"--turns out to be a surprisingly perplexing and intellectually stimulating challenge, one abounding with important implications for many areas in science and philosophy. There are the philosophical thought experiments and paradoxes: the Doomsday Argument; Sleeping Beauty; the Presumptuous Philosopher; Adam & Eve; the Absent-Minded Driver; the Shooting Room. And there are the applications in contemporary science: cosmology (\\"How many universes are there?\\", \\"Why does the universe appear fine-tuned for life?\\"); evolutionary theory (\\"How improbable was the evolution of intelligent life on our planet?\\"); the problem of time's arrow (\\"Can it be given a thermodynamic explanation?\\"); quantum physics (\\"How can the many-worlds theory be tested?\\"); game-theory problems with imperfect recall (\\"How to model them?\\"); even traffic analysis (\\"Why is the 'next lane' faster?\\"). Anthropic Bias argues that the same principles are at work across all these domains. And it offers a synthesis: a mathematically explicit theory of observation selection effects that attempts to meet scientific needs while steering clear of philosophical paradox.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PUtUAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vanity Fair: A Novel Without a Hero","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ql0OAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"He Done Her Wrong : The Great American Novel And Not A Word In It - No Music, Too","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=j_S6QHAov1kC&dq=He+Done+Her+Wrong+:+The+Great+American+Novel+And+Not+A+Word+In+It+-+No+Music,+Too&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Turkish transformation;: A study in social and religious development","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=p4btngEACAAJ&dq=The+Turkish+transformation%3B:+A+study+in+social+and+religious+development&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rating The First Ladies: The Women Who Influenced the Presidency","description":"In this book version of the official report presented to First Lady Laura Bush, the reader will find the same contents that were included in the actual report.

In this volume Peter Drucker focuses with great clarity and perception on the forces of change that are transforming the economic landscape and creating tomorrow's society. Drucker discerns four major areas of discontinuity underlying contemporary social and cultural reality. These are: (1) the explosion of new technologies resulting in major new industries; (2) the change from an international to a world economy?an economy that presently lacks policy, theory, and institutions; (3) a new sociopolitical reality of pluralistic institutions that poses drastic political, philosophical, and spritual challenges; and (4) the new universe of knowledge based on mass education and its implications in work, leisure, and leadership. Peter Drucker brings to this work an intimate knowledge and objective view of the particular and general. The Age of Discontinuity is a fascinating and important blueprint for shaping a future already very much with us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gHT8swEACAAJ&dq=The+age+of+discontinuity%3B:+Guidelines+to+our+changing+society,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Silk Road to International Marketing","description":"\\"The Silk Route to International Marketing\\" presents a new model for international marketing that encompasses every aspect of successful international marketing.

P. Huunnicutt's legendary 10-volume history of American tanks and armored vehicles provides a detailed survey of the American light tank's developmental history, culminating with the M551 Sheridan AR/AAV and the vehicles based on its design. In the period directly after WWII, the Army became interested in developing a light tank. Hunnicutt begins by detailing the program that eventually produced the M41 series of 76mm gun tanks that were designed to fulfill this interest. At 25 tons, the M4 was considered to be too heavy in spite of its popularity with the troops that operated it. Programs developed in an effort to produce a lighter-weight tank resulted in the T71 and T92 tanks, both of which retained the 76mm gun and weighed in at about 17 tons. However, once it was discovered that Soviet tanks of the same caliber were amphibious, the T92 was scrapped to redirect design efforts to an amphibious light tank. This new program produced the XM551 Sheridan, no longer designated as a tank but rather as an \\"armored reconnaissance/airborne assault vehicle\\", or AR/AAV for short. An extremely complex design, the M551 Sheridan AR/AAV was plagued by problems with its weapons system in its early stages. The vehicle required a great deal of frequent maintenance which made it unpopular with troops regardless of the fact that it provided a wide range of services. It was phased out of service in the late 1970s. Part III of this book covers the development of a future replacement for the Sheridan. Part IV covers several other light tracked combat vehicles. Boasting dozens of detailed illustrations, line drawings and photographs, as well as the depth, precision, and nuance for which R. P. Hunnicutt's books are renowned, Sheridan: A History of the American Light Tank is a must-have for anyone with a keen interest in American military history.

Gene Outka examines the literature on agape from Nygren s Agape and Eros in 1930. Both Roman Catholic and Protestant writings are considered, including those of D Arcy, Niebuhr, Ramsey, Tillich, and above all, Karl Barth. The first seven chapters focus on the principal treatments in the theological literature as they relate to major topics in ethical theory. The last chapter explores further the basic normative content of agape and discusses some of the most characteristic problems.  The book is in my judgment the best recent work in religious ethics. Outka brings together analytic moral philosophy and theological ethics, providing a masterly survey of views and issues arising in the past forty years. . . . I can think of few books of interest to scholars in both philosophy and theology, but Outka s is one. Unlike some scholars who are at home in continental theology, Outka is also at home in secular analytic philosophy; he brings them together in a mutually illuminating way.  Donald Evans  Outka has mastered this vast literature on love, and has brought a critical and clarifying analysis to bear upon it. This is a most important book on a most important subject, and brings the whole discussion into a new phase.  John Macquarrie  The first thing to be said about Outka s book quite simply is that it is excellent; in fact, it is probably the very best available book about contemporary Christian ethical theory.

In his cogent, honest, and fully researched and referenced work, The Dominion of Love, Norm Phelps attempts to encourage all who revere the Bible as holy scripture to open their hearts to the suffering that we inflict upon our nonhuman neighbors. He shows that the right of animals not to be imprisoned, harmed, and killed for our benefit flows naturally from the Bible's message of love and compassion and argues that this is the message of the Bible's most important passages dealing with our relationship to animals. He further responds to the defenses of animal exploitation that are often made based on the Bible. Beautifully written, The Dominion of Love is an essential addition to a growing body of literature that argues for a compassionate and non-exploitative reading of Holy Scripture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Lfn3NrjUZ2wC&dq=The+Dominion+of+Love:+Animal+Rights+According+to+the+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Video Study Groups for Education, Professional Development, and Change","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sSwLAAAACAAJ&dq=Video+Study+Groups+for+Education,+Professional+Development,+and+Change&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Comprehensive Guide to Wireless Technology","description":"Wireless communication is an important fact of life.

Booth argues for the relocation of ethics to the center of our engagement with literature. But the questions he asks are not confined to morality. Returning ethics to its root sense, Booth proposes that the ethical critic will be interested in any effect on the ethos, the total character or quality of tellers and listeners. Ethical criticism will risk talking about the quality of this particular encounter with this particular work. Yet it will give up the old hope for definitive judgments of \\"good\\" work and \\"bad.\\" Rather it will be a conversation about many kinds of personal and social goods that fictions can serve or destroy. While not ignoring the consequences for conduct of engaging with powerful stories, it will attend to that more immediate topic, What happens to us as we read? Who am I, during the hours of reading or listening? What is the quality of the life I lead in the company of these would-be friends? Through a wide variety of periods and genres and scores of particular works, Booth pursues various metaphors for such engagements: \\"friendship with books,\\" \\"the exchange of gifts,\\" \\"the colonizing of worlds,\\" \\"the constitution of commonwealths.\\" He concludes with extended explorations of the ethical powers and potential dangers of works by Rabelais, D. H.

The essence of 60 consecutive sermons given over the course of more than a year at Westminster Chapel, London, is preserved in this contemporary devotional classic. The Sermon on the Mount is one of the most familiar passages in the Bible, but is also one of the most frequently misunderstood. For Martyn Lloyd-Jones, the failure of the church today to appropriate its message is a telling symptom of its superficiality, ineffectiveness and unattractiveness. 'The Doctor', as he was affectionately known, shows the remedy for the church's lamentable weakness in Jesus' lakeside teaching, which he explains and applies memorably, through the Sermon's rainbow of themes - including blessedness, joy, spiritual mourning, salt and light, denying oneself, fasting, anxiety, discernment, self-deception, and the trials and tests of faith.

Until the rediscovery of these manuscripts, written between 1625 and 1665, Fane was known only as a patron of Robert Herrick, and as the author of a slim volume of poems, Otia Sacra (1648). This important body of manuscript poetry establishes him as a significant early modern poet. Fane's agonised and changing representation of an England turned upside-down and back again, and of its everyday social as well as political life, is meticulously annotated in this first edition. It uses Fane's surviving account books and letters, as well as a wealth of other contemporary information, to contextualise his poems in a way rarely possible with other early modern writers. The resulting text provides fascinating and revealing insights for cultural and political historians, as well as for all readers of English poetry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pE1qYOrQur4C&dq=The+Poetry+of+Mildmay+Fane,+Second+Earl+of+Westmorland:+Poems+from+the+Fulbeck,+Harvard+and+Westmorland+Manuscripts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diabetic menus, meals and recipes","description":"Offers general advice on the preparation, cooking, and serving of meals for the diabetic as well as providing menus and recipes for fourteen breakfasts, lunches, and dinners","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mC9sAAAAMAAJ&dq=Diabetic+menus,+meals+and+recipes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ragnarok: the age of fire and gravel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HHX1zgEACAAJ&dq=Ragnarok:+the+age+of+fire+and+gravel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flower of the Deep Sleep, Vol. 1","description":"In a haunting vision, Yuuki sees a mysterious little girl with whom she shares a secret connection.

Ranger Sam Burrack has never had a partner before, but Hadley Jones has more than proven his mettle, and Burrack can tell they re cut from the same cloth. But two lawmen might not be enough to stop Lonzo Greer and his Black Moon gang as they blaze a bloody trail of murder and destruction across Arizona Territory. Even worse, the cutthroats have a personal vendetta against the rangers for killing one of their own. If the straight-shooting peace officers aren t careful, they might end up as vulture bait under the hot desert sun.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uheIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Commonwealth, 1877-1890 (The New American Nation Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LToIngEACAAJ&dq=The+New+Commonwealth,+1877-1890+(The+New+American+Nation+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Season of Inquiry: The Senate Intelligence Investigation","description":"The civil rights movement, protests against the Vietnam War, Watergate -- rumors and revelations stemming from these and other events provoked in the 1970s a rising clamor against the scope and conduct of American intelligence operations. Finally, in 1975, Congress launched investigations of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other federal agencies in the intelligence community. This is the story of one of those investigations -- that by the Senate committee chaired by Frank Church of Idaho. The hearings of the Church committee, together with investigations by the House of Representatives and a presidential commission, rocked the intelligence bureaucracy like nothing before; even the CIA's involvement in Kennedy's Bay of Pigs debacle paled in comparison. A deep schism developed within the Senate committee, and the House of Representatives was torn by acrimony and recrimination. From his special vantage point as an investigator and aide to Senator Church, Loch Johnson incisively portrays the human element -- jealousy, friendship, pique, ambition, fatigue -- in these deliberations and traces the tangled lines of conflict and cooperation that stretch between Congress and the White House. Season of Inquiry affords a unique look at the workings of the United States Senate, not in its ordinary day-to-day business but in the heat and glare of publicity during the conduct of a major inquiry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Db8fBgAAQBAJ&dq=A+Season+of+Inquiry:+The+Senate+Intelligence+Investigation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bob Book","description":"A companion set to the bestselling Bob Books Beginning Readers set, featuring the classic Bob Books characters and some new ones, too!

The Wall Street Journal vond het \`geweldig: bescheiden, eerlijk, grappig en vaak ontroerend , terwijl The New York Times het \`net zo charismatisch eigenzinnig als de platen van Mr. Young noemde. Nu, met Special Deluxe, heeft Young een tweede boek geschreven met bijzondere herinneringen over zijn jeugd in Canada, zijn muzikale invloeden, zijn familie, het rock-\`n-rollleven en een van zijn diepste, meest uitbundige passies: auto s. Aan de hand van de vele vervoermiddelen die hij heeft verzameld en waarin hij heeft gereden, verkent Young zijn liefde voor de prachtig vormgegeven vintageautomobiel, en onderzoekt hij zijn pas onlangs ontstane bewustzijn van de negatieve invloed die zijn hobby op het milieu heeft. Als fel voorstander van schone energie vertelt hij het verhaal van Lincvolt, zijn speciaal omgebouwde elektrische auto, en zijn inspanningen om aan wetgevers en consumenten te laten zien dat vervoermiddelen die geen benzine slurpen werkelijk levensvatbaar kunnen zijn. Special Deluxe weet Youngs unieke lyrische, bijna muzikale stem goed te vangen. Het is grappig, eclectisch en prachtig openhartig. Special Deluxe is een onvergetelijke, bonte verzameling herinneringen, illustraties en politieke overpeinzingen van een van de meest oprechte en raadselachtige artiesten van deze tijd.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wylyBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NEW WORLD 96 SPANISH/ENGLISH DICTIONARY SOFTBOUND","description":"The completely revised, second edition of the largest mass market Spanish/English, English/Spanish dictionary available--with over 3 million copies in print!

Every pioneer and musician who would carry a musket went into the ranks. Even the sick and footsore, who could not keep up in the march, came up as soon as they could find their regiments, and took their places in line of battle, while it was battle, indeed.\\" --Col. Joshua Chamberlain The fascinating story of Joshua Chamberlain and his volunteer regiment, the Twentieth Maine, is reprinted with a new foreword by Civil War historian and UCLA professor Joan Waugh. Pullen's classic and highly acclaimed book tells how Chamberlain and his men fought at Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville on their way to the pivotal battle of Gettysburg. There, on July 2, 1863, at Little Round Top, they heroically saved the left flank of the Union battle line. The Twentieth Maine's remarkable story ends with the surrender of Lee's troops at Appomattox. Considered by Civil War historians to be one of the best regimental histories ever written, this beloved standard of American history is now available in a new Stackpole edition.

With that money, our hero can win back his girl and all will be right with the world-but if he and Eddie screw up, the consequences will be grave. Authors including Eric Garcia, C. J. Box, Barbara Seranella, David Corbett, Gregg Hurwitz, and Steve Hamilton, among others, have written imaginative, heartbreaking, funny, and bold stories based on this classic American story of hope and despair, each a surprisingly different experiment with character and plot. For as familiar as this story is, Springsteen's spare lyrics leave much unsaid. How these authors fill in the absences is what makes this collection, published a month before the thirtieth anniversary of the release of Springsteen's Born to Run, such an unusual treasure, proving that, just as with music, in literature no two performances are alike. Jessica Kaye is a publishing law attorney, occasional writer and the founder and former publisher of the Publishing Mills, an award-winning audiobook company, as well as a lifelong fan of great music and great writing.

Sylvia Walby attempts to conceptualize 'patriarchy' in a way that takes account not only of the complexity of relationships of gender, but also of the subtleties of the interconnections of patriarchy and capitalism. She rejects those accounts which treat patriarchy as a unified set of relations, or which confine the site of patriarchy to any one privileged sphere such as the family. Instead, she elaborates a novel view of patriarchy as a set of 'relatively autonomous relations', the connections between which are spelled out through a variety of detailed case studies. In contrast to many other views of 'capitalist patriarchy', Sylvia Walby characterizes the relationship between capitalism and patriarchy as a relationship, not of harmony and mutual accommodation, but of tension and conflict. This thesis is substantiated through a comparative historical analysis of three contrasting areas of employment: cotton textiles, engineering and clerical work. These analyses show the shortcomings of much conventional literature in sociology, history and economics on women's employment, which pays insufficient attention to the independence of patriarchal relations. The book draws upon sociological, historical, economic and geographic materials to argue for an understanding of gender relations in terms of the specific tensions and compromises between patriarchal and capitalist relations. Exploring the impact of the state on patterns of employment and unemployment completes a book rich in theoretical and empirical analysis. Patriarchy at Work will be recognized as a major contribution to feminist thought and the social sciences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nf03AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The future of socialism","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jqPaAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+future+of+socialism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daily Dose of Toxins","description":"Ever wondered why some people are ill in ways doctors seem unable to diagnose?

The volume features a comprehensive discussion of every show that opened on Broadway during the 1999-2000 season as well as several non-Broadway productions of importance or general interest. Each entry is accompanied by credits and cast lists, scorecards summarizing overall critical reception for each show, and a recap of each show's financial performance. A new kind of theatre annual, this distinctive volume discusses what the shows are actually like (instead of merely relying on plot synopses or photographs). It is an interpretive record, featuring not only dates and names but also the stories behind the statistics. Opening night title pages illustrate each show discussion. Appendices include a roundup of the season's major awards, memorable performances of the year, obituaries, long run leaders, shows still running from prior seasons, scheduled shows that never reached Broadway, and a comprehensive index. Steven Suskin has provided a relevant and irreverent record of the year's memorable high points (and low points). Written from an insider's perspective, the book is knowledgeable, intriguing, provocative, and entertaining.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-G3nCwAAQBAJ&dq=Broadway+Yearbook,+1999-2000:+A+Relevant+and+Irreverent+Record&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pets Stained Glass Coloring Book (Dover Stained Glass Coloring Book)","description":"Fetching portraits of canine companions range from a lively Lab to a snoozing bulldog.

Many organizations are searching for innovative strategies that will counter the mounting pressures felt by communities and corporations alike. Common Interest, Common Good argues that forward-looking businesses and social sector organizations (both nonprofit and government) can solve many of their problems by working together-while serving the common good in the process. According to Shirley Sagawa and Eli Segal, alliances between for-profit and the not-for-profit industries yield enormous benefits for both. Businesses can boost their bottom line by leveraging a nonprofit partnership to enhance their image, reach new markets, increase consumer loyalty, and build a positive reputation with current and prospective employees. The upside is just as powerful for nonprofits, because an alliance with a corporation can provide crucial funds and visibility while helping to attract new volunteers and donors. Common Interest, Common Good showcases many such successful partnerships, from corporate sponsorships and cause-related marketing to employee volunteer programs and school-to-work initiatives. The authors also offer some much-needed guidance for avoiding many of the pitfalls that can undermine even the best alliances. A convincing, deeply felt book by two authors who have devoted much of their careers to helping public and private sectors find profitable new ways of working together, Common Interest, Common Good is a guided tour of the progressive new strategies that can contribute to the purpose of our businesses and the prosperity of our communities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GNKWaFlQtxgC&dq=Common+Interest,+Common+Good:+Creating+Value+Through+Business+and+Social+Sector+Partnerships&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Truth About Breast Cancer: A 7-Step Prevention Plan","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IxMDAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Truth+About+Breast+Cancer:+A+7-Step+Prevention+Plan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Desperado (Charisma, Inc.

Out of the mists of the country's most violent age, he merged to lead his people to the peak of their golden era. His women were as remarkable as his adventures: Fiona, the druidess with mystical powers; Deirdre, beautiful victim of a Norse invader's brutal lust; Gormlaith, six-foot, read-haired goddess of sensuality. Set against the barbaric splendors of the tenth century, Lion of Ireland is a story rich in truth and legend-in which friends become deadly enemies, bedrooms turn into battlefields, and dreams of glory are finally fulfilled.

There, for nearly eight decades from the 1890s to the 1960s, thrived the New York Booksellers  Row, or Book Row. This richly anecdotal memoir features historical photographs and the rags-to-riches tale of the Strand, which began its life as a book stall on Eighth Street and today houses 2.5 million volumes (or sixteen miles of books) in twelve miles of space. It s a story cast with characters as legendary and colorful as the horse-betting, poker-playing, go-getter of a book dealer George D. Smith; the irascible Russian-born book hunter Peter Stammer; the visionary Theodore C. Schulte; Lou Cohen, founder of the still-surviving Argosy Book Store; and gentleman bookseller George Rubinowitz and his formidably shrewd wife, Jenny. Book Row remembers places that all lovers of books should never forget, like Biblo & Tamen, the shop that defied book-banning laws; the Green Book Shop, favored by John Dickson Carr; Ellenor Lowenstein s world-renowned gastronomical Corner Book Shop (which was not on a corner); and the Abbey Bookshop, the last of the Fourth Avenue bookstores to close its doors. Rising rents, street crime, urban redevelopment, and television are many of the reasons for the demise of Book Row, but in this volume, based on interviews with dozens of the people who bought, sold, collected, and breathed in its rare, bibliodiferous air, it lives again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ho2SDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Right to Life: And 2 New Stories","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P-A6AF7actgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"It Isn't Easy Being Johnny Style","description":"Join this generation's most unlikely private eye heroas he faces a past he thought he'd left just there.It isn't easy being Johnny Style.Find out for yourself.Go ahead.He'll tell you all about it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aUACAAAACAAJ&dq=It+Isn%27t+Easy+Being+Johnny+Style&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jerry Brown's judicial legacy: The destruction of the California judiciary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FMRJAQAAIAAJ&dq=Jerry+Brown%27s+judicial+legacy:+The+destruction+of+the+California+judiciary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Porque Algunos Pensadores Positivos Obtienen (Spanish Edition)","description":"Kahneman neemt de lezer mee op een ontdekkingsreis door de krochten van ons brein in dit zeer toegankelijke boek (...).

In The Ethics of Capital Punishment, Matthew Kramer takes a fresh look at the philosophical arguments on which the legitimacy of the death penalty stands or falls, and he develops a novel justification of that penalty for a limited range of cases. The book pursues both a project of critical debunking of the familiar rationales for capital punishment and a project of partial vindication. The critical part presents some accessible and engaging critiques of major arguments that have been offered in support of the death penalty. These chapters, suitable for use in teaching courses on capital punishment, valuably take issue with positions at the heart of contemporary debates over the morality of such punishment. The book then presents an original justification for executing truly terrible criminals, a justification that is free-standing rather than an aspect or offshoot of a general theory of punishment. Its purgative rationale, which has not heretofore been propounded in any current philosophical and practical debates over the death penalty, derives from a philosophical reconception of the nature of evil and the nature of defilement. As the book contributes to philosophical discussions of those phenomena, it also contributes importantly to general normative ethics with sustained reflections on the differences between consequentialist approaches to punishment and deontological approaches. Above all, the volume contributes to the philosophy of criminal law with a fresh rationale for the use of the death penalty and with probing assessments of all the major theories of punishment that have been broached by jurists and philosophers for centuries. Although the book is a work of philosophy by a professional philosopher, it is readily accessible to readers who have not studied philosophy. It will stir both philosophers and anyone engaged with the death penalty to reconsider whether the institution of capital punishment can be an appropriate response to extreme evil.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RNHQAgAAQBAJ&dq=Capitol+Punishment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knowledge Management and Organizational Design (Resources for the Knowledge-Based Economy)","description":"The first in the readers' series called Resources for the Knowledge-Based Economy, Knowledge Management and Organizational Design is a unique compilation of articles and book excerpts that describe how the management of an organization shapes the levels of knowledge transfer, innovation and learning.

In highly readable, first-person style, Mason's writing stimulates readers' thoughts and prayers and propels couples to deeper intimacy. \\"A marriage is not a joining of two worlds,\\" says the author, \\"but an abandoning of two worlds in order that one new one might be formed.\\" Rich chapters on \\"Otherness,\\" \\"Vows,\\" \\"Intimacy,\\" \\"Sex,\\" \\"Submission,\\" and an all-new chapter on \\"Oneness\\" lift readers to view the eternal, spiritual nature of this faith-filled, \\"impossible,\\" wild-yet wonderful-frontier. \\"The two shall become one flesh. This is a great mystery.\\" Ephesians 5:3132 Beautifully written and filled with life-transforming insights, the 20th anniversary edition of Mike Mason's unparalleled Gold Medallion winner explores the mystical and holy nature of marriage with a depth that will forever alter how a couple relates to each other-and to God. The Mystery of Marriage stands out from how-to manuals on marriage as a refreshing how-come book-a brilliant celebration of the God-ordained union between man and wife. \\"An outstanding achievement. Rarely has a book aroused in me so much enthusiasm as has the combination of wisdom, depth, dignity, and glow that I find in these chapters.\\" -J.I. Packer \\"Absolutely exquisite. It reaches down deep into our innermost being, revealing, revitalizing, rewarding. A real classic.\\" -Gigi Graham Tchividjian \\"A drop everything book.

This always amazes me and gives me great joy. I'm also amazed that many single people have read it. Either way, my goal is for hearts to be warmed by the mystery of divine love. I want couples to enter into deeper intimacy by thinking together about the mystery of marriage -about how their love, besides being a gift of God, reflects the very love He has for Himself in the Trinity. For God is not a bachelor, and throughout the Bible marriage is a supreme picture of the nature of God's love and of His kingdom.

While he clarifies the views of each and how they can be related, his aim is not to proselytize either anarchists into Christianity or Christians into anarchy. On the one hand, suggests Ellul, anarchists need to understand that much of their criticism of Christianity applies only to the form of religion that developed, not to biblical faith. Christians, on the other hand, need to look at the biblical texts and not reject anarchy as a political option, for it seems closest to biblical thinking. After charting the background of his own interest in the subject, Ellul defines what he means by anarchy: the nonviolent repudiation of authority. He goes on to look at the Bible as the source of anarchy (in the sense of nondomination, not disorder), working through Old Testament history, Jesus' ministry, and finally the early church's view of power as reflected in the New Testament writings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_0xMAwAAQBAJ&dq=Anarchy+and+Christianity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Avram's Gift","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8-OFzQEACAAJ&dq=Avram%27s+Gift&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elizabeth I: The Competition for Representation","description":"Elizabeth I is perhaps the most visible woman in early modern Europe, yet little attention has been paid to what she said about the difficulties of constructing her power in a patriarchal society. This revisionist study examines her struggle for authority through the representation of her female body. Based on a variety of extant historical and literary materials, Frye's interpretation focuses on three representational crises spaced fifteen years apart: the London coronation of 1559, the Kenilworth entertainments of 1575, and the publication of The Faerie Queene in 1590. In ways which varied with social class and historical circumstance, the London merchants, the members of the Protestant faction, courtly artists, and artful courtiers all sought to stabilize their own gendered identities by constructing the queen within the \\"natural\\" definitions of the feminine as passive and weak. Elizabeth fought back, acting as a discursive agent by crossing, and thus disrupting, these definitions. She and those closely identified with her interests evolved a number of strategies through which to express her political control in terms of the ownership of her body, including her elaborate iconography and a mythic biography upon which most accounts of Elizabeth's life have been based. The more authoritative her image became, the more vigorously it was contested in a process which this study examines and consciously perpetuates.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dNjE5Xs2UnoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CARVED IN STONE (Civil War Georgia)","description":"In 1915 the United Daughters of the Confederacy leased the land and commissioned Gutzon Borglum, later the sculptor of Mount Rushmore, to carve the Lost Cause memorial on the mountain where the second Ku Klux Klan was resurrected by William J. Simmons. Proceeding intermittently over six decades, the project was given added impetus in the wake of the South's massive resistance to racial integration. Capitalizing on this impulse, the state of Georgia funded the completion of the project in 1958 for use as a tourist attraction. Opening as a theme park in 1970, Stone Mountain now draws some five million visitors a year, exceeded only by the Disney theme parks in Orlando, Florida.

Forty-three years later, in 1941, it was a large modern army ready to wage global war against the Germans and the Japanese. In this definitive social history of America's standing army, military historian Edward Coffman tells how that critical transformation was accomplished. Coffman has spent years immersed in the official records, personal papers, memoirs, and biographies of regular army men, including such famous leaders as George Marshall, George Patton, and Douglas MacArthur. He weaves their stories, and those of others he has interviewed, into the story of an army which grew from a small community of posts in China and the Philippines to a highly effective mechanized ground and air force. During these years, the U.S. Army conquered and controlled a colonial empire, military staff lived in exotic locales with their families, and soldiers engaged in combat in Cuba and the Pacific. In the twentieth century, the United States entered into alliances to fight the German army in World War I, and then again to meet the challenge of the Axis Powers in World War II. Coffman explains how a managerial revolution in the early 1900s provided the organizational framework and educational foundation for change, and how the combination of inspired leadership, technological advances, and a supportive society made it successful. In a stirring account of all aspects of garrison life, including race relations, we meet the men and women who helped reconfigure America's frontier army into a modern global force.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PvlhREEJRzAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mister Johnson","description":"THE STORY: Johnson, a young native in the British civil service, is a clerk to Rudbeck, Assistant District Officer in Nigeria, and imagines himself to be a very important cog of the King's government.

Brimming with witty, erudite essays on troublesome words and phrases, GMAU authoritatively shows how to avoid the countless pitfalls that await unwary writers and speakers whether the issues relate to grammar, punctuation, word choice, or pronunciation. An exciting new feature of this third edition is Garner's Language-Change Index, which registers where each disputed usage in modern English falls on a five-stage continuum from nonacceptability (to the language community as a whole) to acceptability, giving the book a consistent standard throughout. GMAU is the first usage guide ever to incorporate such a language-change index. The judgments are based both on Garner's own original research in linguistic corpora and on his analysis of hundreds of earlier studies. Another first in this edition is the panel of critical readers: 120-plus commentators who have helped Garner reassess and update the text, so that every page has been improved. Bryan A. Garner is a writer, grammarian, lexicographer, teacher, and lawyer. He has written professionally about English usage for more than 28 years, and his work has achieved widespread renown. David Foster Wallace proclaimed that Bryan Garner is a genius and William Safire called the book excellent. In fact, due to the strength of his work on GMAU, Garner was the grammarian asked to write the grammar-and-usage chapter for the venerable Chicago Manual of Style. His advice on language matters is second to none.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Sd3byNeBdR4C&dq=Modern+American+usage:+A+guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment (2nd Edition)","description":"For more than twenty years, serious C programmers have relied on one book for practical, in-depth knowledge of the programming interfaces that drive the UNIX and Linux kernels: W.

The new third edition supports today s leading platforms, reflects new technical advances and best practices, and aligns with Version 4 of the Single UNIX Specification. Steve carefully retains the spirit and approach that have made this book so valuable. Building on Rich s pioneering work, he begins with files, directories, and processes, carefully laying the groundwork for more advanced techniques, such as signal handling and terminal I/O. He also thoroughly covers threads and multithreaded programming, and socket-based IPC. This edition covers more than seventy new interfaces, including POSIX asynchronous I/O, spin locks, barriers, and POSIX semaphores. Most obsolete interfaces have been removed, except for a few that are ubiquitous. Nearly all examples have been tested on four modern platforms: Solaris 10, Mac OS X version 10.6.8 (Darwin 10.8.0), FreeBSD 8.0, and Ubuntu version 12.04 (based on Linux 3.2). As in previous editions, you ll learn through examples, including more than ten thousand lines of downloadable, ISO C source code. More than four hundred system calls and functions are demonstrated with concise, complete programs that clearly illustrate their usage, arguments, and return values. To tie together what you ve learned, the book presents several chapter-length case studies, each reflecting contemporary environments. Advanced Programming in the UNIX? Environment has helped generations of programmers write code with exceptional power, performance, and reliability.

The book is not a textbook, but rather a daily reference tool to supplement a bona-fide course of study along with an appropriate amount of clinical training. It is expected that practicing MRI technologists can use this handbook well after a training program is completed. The approach is quite practical in that an individual with appropriate clinical experience can perform scans of any anatomy. It is comprehensive in that it takes into account virtually every MRI examination performed. The handbook depends on illustrations to convey the subject matter. The images used are actual images from MRI examinations which demonstrate anatomy and illustrate the desired outcome of an MRI examination. Color illustrations are provided for diagrams. The main feature of the handbook is in its approach to the material. The handbook begins with preliminary sections. Sections on scanning using a step-by-step \\"Cook Book\\" approach, from the tools to use, the landmarks to identify and the protocols to be used follow, and are the crux of the handbook.

This inaugural edition defines country music in a broad sense and reflects the marvelous complexities of what has often been called a simple cultural form. The articles look at old-time music, Western swing, honky-tonk, Bluegrass, Cajun, country rock, and the many other incarnations country music has taken. Contributors explore country music in Hollywood and Nashville, humor, country's complex relationship with religion, music careers, sound mixing, and teaching country music in the classroom.

Since its original publication in 1972, no book has done as much as Strike! to bring U.S. labor history to a wide audience. Now this fiftieth anniversary edition brings the story up to date with chapters covering the  mini-revolts of the twenty-first century,  including Occupy Wall Street and the Fight for Fifteen. The new edition contains over a hundred pages of new materials and concludes by examining a wide range of current struggles, ranging from #BlackLivesMatter, to the great wave of teachers  strikes  for the soul of public education,  to the global  Student Strike for Climate  that may be harbingers of mass strikes to come.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=c7RHEAAAQBAJ&dq=September+Strike&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Day Kennedy Was Shot","description":"A minute-by-minute narrative account of President John F.

Why? How can we keep them? How can we win them back? This book is the culmination of a magnificent obsession. For more than ten years Roger Dudley traced the lives of 1500 teenagers as they grew up and, often, grew disillusioned. Refusing to let them leave in peace, Dudley bombarded them with questionnaires. Many of them answered. This is their story. Dudley puts faces on the statistics by focusing in on individual case studies. He cites the heart-wrenching testimony of desperately lonely people surrounded by uncaring members. They want to belong, to be needed, to be heard, to be loved. They made some mistakes. We share their pain and their dreams, and feel the dissonant cadences of their troubled hearts. Some who never left explain what kept them in the church. Many who left want to return. \\"Without God, life is hell,\\" wrote one. If you want to know what the youth of your church are not telling you, read this book. It includes the responses of a group of kids who were asked to design the ideal church, and an appendix explaining the causes of \\"adolescent heresy,\\" the conflict spawned by the teenage struggle for autonomy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TQQP9KNtzLgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mastering Blocking And Stuttering: A Cognitive Approach to Achieving Fluency","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=e2pKAQAACAAJ&dq=Mastering+Blocking+And+Stuttering:+A+Cognitive+Approach+to+Achieving+Fluency&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jane and the Dragon","description":"Everyone laughs at Jane for wanting to be a knight, except the court jester, who loans her his small suit of armor, and she spends her days practicing knightly duties. When a dragon steals the prince, Jane sets out to rescue him. After a long, wearisome battle, they sit down and talk about what's expected of dragons (stealing the prince) and knights (being men). In the end, she turns an enemy into a friend, returns the prince to his parents, becomes a proper knight with Saturdays off to visit a friend, and dances with the jester at the royal ball.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tu3Zduqz84oC&dq=Jane+and+the+Dragon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All About Tropical Fish Keeping","description":"A highly practical guide packed with easy pictorial stages.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NtI2rgEACAAJ&dq=All+About+Tropical+Fish+Keeping&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cookware Cookbook: Great Recipes for Broiling, Steaming, Boiling, Poaching, Braising, Deglazing, Frying, Simmering, and Saut&eacute;ing","description":"Medische en praktische informatie voor pati?nten.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2EM_UkpjlHcC&dq=The+Cookware+Cookbook:+Great+Recipes+for+Broiling,+Steaming,+Boiling,+Poaching,+Braising,+Deglazing,+Frying,+Simmering,+and+Saut&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gifts from the Broken Jar: Rediscovering Hope, Beauty, and Joy","description":"Everyone, at some time, learns how life can change in a moment: with the crossing of the center line on a highway or the reading of a blood test; a telephone's knell in the still of night or a spouse's hesitation before the unspeakable is spoken. Occasionally, out of the turmoil emerges a work of exceptional wisdom and beauty. Gifts from the Broken Jar is one such work. Psychotherapist PJ Long's life-altering moment came when the bolt of a terrified horse left her brain-injured. She became a stranger to herself, unable to drive a car, prepare a meal, or carry on a conversation. But when PJ began to write, pen and ink acted as needle and thread, mending her torn mind and stitching together a new life. Lessons she had gleaned over years of helping others returned to guide her. And as PJ wrote, she gained profound insight into the resilience of the spirit and the unexpected joys of everyday life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=15A6s-hQdiEC&dq=Gifts+from+the+Broken+Jar:+Rediscovering+Hope,+Beauty,+and+Joy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Billy Whiskers' adventures","description":"A favorite of children since the early 20th century, here are the escapades of that mischievous goat, Billy Whiskers.

In this comprehensive treatment of the relation of knowledge to action, which he calls planning, he traces the major intellectual traditions of planning thought and practice. Three of these--social reform, policy analysis, and social learning--are primarily concerned with public management. The fourth, social mobilization, draws on utopianism, anarchism, historical materialism, and other radical thought and looks to the structural transformation of society \\"from below.\\" After developing a basic vocabulary in Part One, the author proceeds in Part Two to a critical history of each of the four planning traditions. The story begins with the prophetic visions of Saint-Simon and assesses the contributions of such diverse thinkers as Comte, Marx, Dewey, Mannheim, Tugwell, Mumford, Simon, and Habermas. It is carried forward in Part Three by Friedmann's own nontechnocratic, dialectical approach to planning as a method for recovering political community.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fWvdDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sufferings of Young Werther","description":"The Sorrows of Young Werther is the story of a sensitive, artistic young man who demonstrates the fatal effects of a predilection for absolutes whether those of love, art, society, or thought.

By contrasting the two systems, the Western and the Middle Eastern, this book serves to highlight the characteristics of two very different systems and thus stimulate new ideas about the history of linguistics.

The pieces gathered in Unconventions are drawn from a long career spent loosening the creative strictures on writing. Including articles, public addresses, essays, interviews, and even a eulogy, these writings vary greatly in form but are unified in addressing the many technical and artistic issues that face all writers, particularly those interested in experimental and nontraditional modes and forms. Martone s approach has always been to synthesize, to understand and use any technique, formula, or style available.  I find myself, then,  he writes,  self-identifying as a formalist, both and neither an experimenter and/or a traditionalist.  In  I Love a Parade: An Afterword,  Martone writes about not fitting in--and loving it--as he recalls the time he marched alone in a local Labor Day parade, as a one-person delegation from the National Writers Union. Elsewhere, in writings formally, stylistically, purposely at odds with themselves, Martone s expansive curiosity is on full display. We learn about camouflage techniques, how a baby acquires language, how to  read  a WPA-era post office mural, and why Martone sold his stock in the New Yorker and reinvested his money in the company that makes Etch A Sketch?. Unconventions, then, is Martone s  Frankensteinian monster,  a kind of unruly, hybrid spawn of the mainstream writing enterprise.  Writing seems to me an intrinsic pleasure, an end in itself first,  says Martone.  The question for me is not whether my writing, or any piece of writing, is good or bad but what the writing is and what it is doing and how finally it is used or can be used by others.

This volume presents the real life moral dilemmas of people with AIDS, and their resolution, involving such issues as relationships, sexuality, discrimination and death.

It's the tool for learning how to use other tools. It's the bones that give a clenched fist its structure (and knuckles). With that in mind, we have painstakingly designed Introductory Logic for everyday students, teachers, and parents who've never tackled syllogisms or fallacies before, but who know just how important learning logic is. In Introductory Logic, you'll get the benefit of James B. Nance's twenty years of teaching experience as you learn the fundamentals you need to think well wherever you are, including: How to properly define terms for maximum precision and accuracy -- and thus win the debate, How to form and interpret statements, the building blocks of logical thought, How to compose valid syllogisms, and -- just as importantly -- expose the invalid fakes using counterexamples, How to analyze arguments in norm","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=op3pjgEACAAJ&dq=An+introductory+logic,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hildegarde E Peplau: Interpersonal Nursing Theory (Notes on Nursing Theories)","description":"Hildegard E. Peplau is one of the first nurse theorists. Thus cognizance of her theory is necessary to a complete understanding of subsequent developments in nursing theory. In her interpersonal nursing theory, Peplau identifies the therapeutic nurse-client relationship as the crux of nursing and describes nursing as \\"doing with\\" clients rather than \\"doing to\\" clients. Moreover, Peplau views nursing as an educative profession that promotes health in the individual. This informative volume begins with a discussion of Peplau's theory, including its origin, and examines the assumptions underlying her theory. It also explores the major concepts of the meta-paradigm of nursing and provides examples for its application to practice and research. Hildegard E. Peplau is essential reading for all nursing and allied health professionals and students.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ks0QAQAAMAAJ&dq=Hildegarde+E+Peplau:+Interpersonal+Nursing+Theory+(Notes+on+Nursing+Theories)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jA8iyQEACAAJ&dq=Practical+Magic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angelina's Baby Sister","description":"Angelina's excitement over the arrival of a new baby turns to jealousy when her little sister becomes the center of attention.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=88onEAAAQBAJ&dq=Angelina%27s+Baby+Sister&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Crowded Hour (Oe): Neil Davis, Combat Cameraman","description":"The war in Afghanistan is now the longest and, arguably, worst reported conflict in Australian history. In Don t Mention the War, Kevin Foster explores why this is so and considers who engineered and who has benefitted from its impoverished coverage. He examines how and why the Australian Defence Force restricted the media s access to and freedom of movement among its troops in Afghanistan and what we can learn about their motives and methods from the more liberal media policies of the Dutch and Canadian militaries. He analyses how the ADF ensured positive coverage of its endeavours by bringing many aspects of the reporting of the war in-house and why some among the fourth estate were only too happy to hand over responsibility for newsgathering to the military. The book also investigates how political responses to the conflict, and the discourse that framed them, served to conceal the facts and neuter public debate about the war. After more than a decade of evasion and obstruction, half-truths and hype, Don t Mention the War reveals how politicians, the military and the media failed the public over the Afghan conflict.

He was bound, gagged, blindfolded, stabbed more than fifty times, and robbed of over $5,000. Ten months later, after one of the most extensive manhunts in nineteenth-century Louisiana, public shock and outrage reemerged when two teenage brothers from France, Ernest and Alexis Blanc, were arrested for the crime. William Arceneaux sets the story of Begnaud's murder, the Blanc brothers' trial, and the media circus surrounding it all against the backdrop of Acadian history -- from the 1604 establishment of a French colony in the Canadian maritime provinces to the eventual creation of a \\"New Acadia\\"in South Louisiana. By intertwining a suspenseful account of this heinous crime with an exploration of the citizens it affected, No Spark of Malice provides insight into a fascinating people, place, and era.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=e4XepMJR2oIC&dq=No+Spark+Of+Malice+-&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw","description":"Mrs. McGillicuddy has trouble convincing anyone that she has seen a man strangle a woman on a passing train and turns to Miss Jane Marple for help in proving her story","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sZpBsdYJPRoC&dq=What+Mrs.+McGillicuddy+Saw&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mercenary Prince","description":"When international conflicts begin to chip away at the world order of CoDominium--the alliance keeping an American-Soviet war at bay--mercenary commanders John Christian Falkenberg and Lysander, Prince of Sparta must respond","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jghKAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Mercenary+Prince&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fodor's Exploring South Africa, 4th Edition (Exploring Guides)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5mxYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Fodor%27s+Exploring+South+Africa,+4th+Edition+(Exploring+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Edgar Allan Poe, Volume II: The Masque of the Red Death, The Cask of Amontillado, and Silence","description":"Edgar Allan Poe was a master of tales of the mysterious and macabre.

With the super-rich setting the pace, everyone spent furiously in a desperate attempt to keep up. As cars and houses grew larger and more expensive, the costs were enormous--not only monetarily but also socially. Consumers spent more time at work and less time with their family and friends; they saved less money and borrowed more. In this book, Robert Frank presents the first comprehensive and accessible account of these financial choices. Frank uses scientific evidence to demonstrate how these spending patterns have not made us happier or healthier. Luxury Fever offers an exit from the rat race, suggesting ways to curb the culture of excess and restore true value to our lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AufIQgAACAAJ&dq=Luxury+Fever+Money+and+Happiness+in+an+Era+of+Excess&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Turret","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6kFzQVWz-88C&dq=The+Turret&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blessings","description":"Blessings and Miracles in the perspective of a relationship with God and His divine intervention in our lives, we learn how different factors contribute consequently to the quality of life we live. The actions, choices, and attitudes we have and express every day affect how the blessings and miracles accomplish their purpose in our lives. Blessings and Miracles have been and are still a medium for God to work in our lives. God performs miracles for us to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and through having faith in Him, we experience eternal life by the power of His Name (John 20:30-31). Blessings are, in most cases, conditional and received through a process. A blessing can also be a resource, a resource is a source of supply or support, and it is again an available means or productive factor required to accomplish a given activity. Therefore, blessings are supposed to help us achieve the purpose of our life in this world. It is the Father s good pleasure to have a relationship with you, to bless you, to heal you, and give you a complete restoration. A miracle is applicable in a crisis or in a problem that we can avoid, or that is unavoidable. While with God s blessings, we can avoid a position that would put us in a crisis in the first place when we apply godly principles, take the right actions, and have the right choices. God wants us to live a life full of blessings (Barak).

His assessment of the German experiment with democracy challenges many long-held assumptions about the course and character of German history. Mommsen argues persuasively that the rise of totalitarianism in Germany was not inevitable but was the result of a confluence of specific domestic and international forces. As long as France and Britain exerted pressure on the new Germany after World War I, the radical Right hesitated to overthrow the constitution. But as international scrutiny decreased with the recognition of the legitimacy of the Weimar regime, totalitarian elements were able to gain the upper hand. At the same time, the world economic crisis of the early 1930s, with its social and political ramifications, further destabilized German democracy. This translation of the original German edition (published in 1989) brings the work to an English-speaking audience for the first time.

V. Morton is more than a travel book: it is a sensitive interpretation of a country's people and their history. The success of his first book on England, established the popularity of something new and refreshing in this type of literature. Mr Morton's travels have gained him thousands of readers in all parts of the world. The author has frequently been requested to define the secret of writing a travel book. He always replies: 'There is no secret. You either enjoy yourself or you do not. If you do, say so; if you do not - say so!'

Each debate has four principal speakers: one to propose the motion, another to oppose it, and two seconders. The first debate addresses the disciplinary character of social anthropology: can it be regarded as a science, and if so, is it able to establish general propositions about human culture and social life? The second examines the concept of society, and in the third debate the spotlight is turned on the role of culture in people's perception of their environments. The fourth debate focuses on the place of language in the formation of culture. The fifth takes up the question of how we view the past in relation to the present. Finally, in the sixth debate, the concern is with the cross-cultural applicability of the concept of aesthetics. With its unique debate format, Key Debates in Anthropology addresses issues that are currently at the top of the theoretical agenda, which register the pulse of contemporary thinking in social anthropology. It will be of value to students who are not only introduced to the different sides of every argument, but are challenged to join in and to develop informed positions of their own.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=L--GAgAAQBAJ&dq=Key+Debates+in+Anthropology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Passing the baton: Church planting that empowers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UtYFAAAACAAJ&dq=Passing+the+baton:+Church+planting+that+empowers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sanford Meisner Approach: Workbook Three, Tackling the Text (Career Development Series)","description":"\\"..we will have the most vital experience of avoiding the traps and clich s of performing preconceived notion of the character.\\" MIDWEST \\"Silverberg's writing is concise and insightful throughout and makes the technique accessible to any commited student.\\" LIBRARY JOURNAL Larry Silverberg, author of the revolutionary four book series The Sanford Meisner Approach: An Actor's Workbook now brings to you Workbook Three: Tackling the Text.

When a terrorist put an end to his life in 1990, he was in the process of completing this major work. The fundamentals of Jewish faith which he set forth in this volume, such as humility, faith and trust, kindness, revenge, self-sacrifice, and sanctifying G-d's name, were not abstract theories but the day-to-day guidelines of his life.While most widely known for his Jewish activism and controversial beliefs, The Jewish Idea reveals the erudite scholarship and mastery of Torah which was the source of Rabbi Kahane's untiring activities.The novelty of The Jewish Idea is not in the newness of the topics discussed, but rather in the unique manner in which they are presented. The total, unreserved compliance to G-d's will without any personal considerations, and the willingness to sacrifice for the Jewish People, permeate each and every chapter of the book.

The right of neutrality; to live in peace from the imperial wars waged between France and England; had been one of the founding values of Acadia; its settlers traded and intermarried freely with native Mikmaq Indians and English Protestants alike. But the Acadians' refusal to swear unconditional allegiance to the British Crown in the mid-eighteenth century gave New Englanders, who had long coveted Nova Scotia's fertile farmland, pretense enough to launch a campaign of ethnic cleansing on a massive scale.

Thirty-four sailors were killed and more than 170 wounded, many critically injured. Israel claimed mistaken identity, which a U.S. naval court of inquiry confirmed, but that explanation is contradicted by the facts of the case. ? Based on new revelations: James Scott has interviewed Liberty survivors, senior u.S. political and intelligence officials, and examined newly declassified documents in Israel and the united States to write this comprehensive, dramatic account. He reveals that officers in Israel s chain of command were aware of the Liberty s identity and shows how events in Vietnam prompted the American government to deemphasize the attack despite widespread disbelief of Israel s story. ? Journalist and son of an attack survivor: Scott s father, John, was an officer and engineer aboard the Liberty who was awarded the Silver Star for helping to save the ship from sinking.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=72cI13uPqGMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Portable World Bible","description":"Explains the spiritual essence of the 8 major religions of the world","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=N1MqAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Portable+World+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A fable","description":"Knowing different genres is an important part of the ELA standards.

Everything in Russia the land, the climate, the distances and above all the people were harder, harsher, more unforgiving and more deadly than anything the German soldier had ever faced before. One panzer-grenadier who fought in the West and in Russia summed it up: In the West war was the same honourable old game; nobody went out of his way to be vicious, and fighting stopped often by five in the afternoon. But in the East, the Russians were trying to kill you all the time.The four detailed reports of campaigning in Russia included in this invaluable book (Russian Combat Methods in WWII, Effects of Climate on Combat in European Russia, Combat in Russian Forests and Swamps and Warfare in the Far North) were written in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as part of the US Army programme to record the German strategies and tactics of World War II directly from the commanders. The authors were all veterans of the fighting they described, and frankly admitted that the soldiers sent to Russia were neither trained nor equipped to withstand the full fury of the elements there. The German high command had been under the impression that the Red Army could be destroyed west of the Dnepr, and there would be no need for conducting operations in cold, snow and mud. Fighting in Hell shows what really happened, through first-hand accounts of the commanders who were there.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DNTLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maybe a second spring: The story of the Missionary Sisters of St. Columban in China","description":"Map of China with position of missions marked________","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hVf6pOvb2SwC&dq=Maybe+a+second+spring:+The+story+of+the+Missionary+Sisters+of+St.+Columban+in+China&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death's Gray Land (Destiny Makers)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wbVaAAAACAAJ&dq=Death%27s+Gray+Land+(Destiny+Makers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Muktuk Wolfsbreath, hard-boiled shaman (Vertigo)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eHJQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Muktuk+Wolfsbreath,+hard-boiled+shaman+(Vertigo)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Liberating Paul: The Justice of God and the Politics of the Apostle (Bible & Liberation)","description":"Publisher description: Challenges the way the Epistles of Saint Paul have been misread historically to justify everything from slavery to the marginalization of women.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DN4gnwEACAAJ&dq=Liberating+Paul:+The+Justice+of+God+and+the+Politics+of+the+Apostle+(Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The naked society","description":"Examines the invasion of privacy in the United States by government, business, and education.

An insightful and eye-opening look into a brilliant creative mind, perfect for Moore devotees and fiction writers of all literary forms looking to hone their craft.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QH0GAAAACAAJ&dq=Alan+Moore%27s+Writing+For+Comics+Volume+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A dweller on two planets, or, The dividing of the way","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UJxOAQAAMAAJ&dq=A+dweller+on+two+planets,+or,+The+dividing+of+the+way&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook for Brunner and Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing","description":"Trusted by nursing fraternity for more than 50 years, Brunner and Suddarth's textbook of Medical-Surgical nursing layers essential patient care information, engaging critical thinking exercises and diverse features to help students learn critical content.

Whether you re a corporate executive, business owner, policymaker, or moving into the later season of your career, the stakes for America s aging population are high. People 65 and older will account for 20 percent of the population in 2030, up from 13 percent in 2000. Many prognosticators blame the aging population for the stagnating economy, citing that as more and more people retire, they will stop working as relatively fewer working people have to support growing numbers of dependent elderly. Purpose and a Paycheck debunks this line of thought by showing how a growing movement of elderly entrepreneurs and part time workers are creating conditions for a stronger and more vibrant economy. Growing numbers of Americans are no longer retiring in the traditional sense. The numbers are striking and largely unappreciated. The labor force participation rate of men 60 years and over has risen nearly one-third from a low of 26 percent in 1996 to 35 percent in 2014. The comparable rate for women is from 15 percent to 25 percent. Even more impressive, 25.5 percent of new business ventures in 2016 were started by the 55-to-64-year-old age group, up from 14.8 percent in 1996. People in their 50s and 60s are launching new businesses at nearly twice the rate of people in their 20s. America s aging society and workforce is redefining work for all generations and is among the most significant long-term forces shaping the U.S. economy and society, alongside globalization, automation and climate change. Instead of an economic deadweight, America s aging population holds the promise of getting back the economy mojo. Reframing aging will result in faster rates of economic growth and higher living standards for all of us in addition to a more fulfilling and financially secure second half of life for our aging population.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XqJbDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The sea lady,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LW53DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fort Davis National Historic Site, Texas, (National Park Service historical handbook series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JOsdwQEACAAJ&dq=Fort+Davis+National+Historic+Site,+Texas,+(National+Park+Service+historical+handbook+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"D.l.

Like all caricatures, those of the exhausted wife and frustrated old maid carry some truth: the underlying message of the sterotypes is that missionary women were perceived as marginal to the central tasks of mission. Rather than being remembered for preaching the gospel, the quintessential male task, missionary women were noted for meeting human needs and helping others, sacrificing themselves without plan or reason, all for the sake of bringing the world to Jesus Christ.Historical evidence, however, gives lie to the truism that women missionaries were and are doers but not thinkers, reactive secondary figures rather than proactive primary ones. The first American women to serve as foreign missionaries in 1812 were among the best-educated women of their time. Although barred from obtaining the college education or ministerial credentials of their husbands, the early missionary wives had read their Jonathan Edwards and Samuel Hopkins. Not only did they go abroad with particular theologies to share, but their identities as women caused them to develop gender-based mission theories. Early nineteenth-century women seldom wrote theologies of mission, but they wrote letters and kept journals that reveal a thought world and set of assumptions about women's roles in the missionary task. The activities of missionary wives were not random: they were part of a mission strategy that gave women a particular role inthe advancement of the reign of God.By moving from mission field to mission field in chronological order of missionary presence, Robert charts missiological developments as they took place in dialogue with the urgent context of the day. Each case study marks the beginning of the mission theory. Baptist women in Burma, for example, are only considered in their first decades there and are not traced into the present. Robert believes that at this early stage of research into women's mission theory, integrity and analysis lies more in a succession of contextualized case studies than in gross generalizations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=98eI044RjlwC&dq=American+Women+in+Mission:+The+Modern+Mission+Era+1792-1992&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Viking Gods","description":"The great Norse Myths are among the most dramatic and unforgettable stories in all human history.

Bringing to life the magical world of monsters and mythical creatures, this also introduces the adventures of humankind: folk heroes and tricksters; Sigmund's great battle in the Volsung Saga; the exploits of Kings and Princes; and Viking exploration and settlement of new lands including Iceland, Greenland, America, and Viking life in the Mediterranean and the East.

When we re convinced of the gracious simplicity in acquiring the free gift of eternal life, it impacts how we share our faith. When we re confident this free gift can t be lost, it calms us down. When we re certain Christ will repay and recompense us for what we do with this free gift, we re motivated to  be holy  as He is holy. In looking at the biblical text, Christians will be reminded that justification is provided at no cost to them. They ll see there s room for failure in the Christian life. But they ll also learn where there s great grace, there s great accountability--and great reward. It is wonderful to see this fresh look at many of the grace issues at a popular level. Mark Spencer has given us an insightful look into the implications of grace in the task of evangelism and discipleship.

Zij schreef haar brieven alleen voor zichzelf, tot ze in de lente van 1944 op radio Oranje de minister van Onderwijs, Kunsten en Wetenschappen in ballingschap, Bolkestein, hoorde spreken. Hij zei dat na de oorlog alle getuigenissen van het lijden van het Nederlandse volk onder de Duitse bezetting verzameld en openbaar moesten worden gemaakt. Als voorbeeld noemde hij onder andere dagboeken. Onder de indruk van deze redevoering besloot Anne Frank na de oorlog een boek te publiceren. Haar dagboek zou daarvoor als basis dienen. In maart 1945 stierf Anne Frank op vijftienjarige leeftijd in het concentratiekamp Bergen-Belsen. De enige overlevende van de familie, Otto Frank, zorgde ervoor dat het dagboek van zijn dochter toch gepubliceerd werd. In 1947 verscheen Het Achterhuis. Het is sindsdien een van de meest gelezen boeken ter wereld. Het is in meer dan dertig landen verschenen en er zijn meer dan zestien miljoen exemplaren van verkocht. \\"E n enkele Anne Frank ontroert ons meer dan de ontelbaren die net zo leden als zij, maar wier beeld in de schaduw is gebleven. Misschien moet dat ook zo zijn: als we het leed van alle mensen moesten en konden meelijden, zouden we niet kunnen leven.\\" Primo Levi","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ouD9Ifi8WQUC&dq=The+Diary+of+A.N&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rick Steves' Spanish & Portuguese Phrasebook & Dictionary (Rick Steves Language Series)","description":"Savor authentic paella, run with the bulls in Pamplona, or relax on Barcelona's beaches: experience Spain with the most up-to-date 2021 guide from Rick Steves!

You know that whether accidental or deliberate, you can point to the man who brought you to this world. Having a daddy is better because it makes you feel loved, cared for and cared about. I happen to belong to the first group and I'm grateful that at no time did I ever doubt who my earthly father was. But as time went on, feelings of anger and resentment pushed me to hate my father because, till the day he died, he was never available to be my daddy. I never enjoyed that thing called \\"Daddy's Love.\\" But today, I can honestly tell you that while it is good to have an earthly father, and while it is even better to have a daddy, nothing compares to having God and His Son Jesus as Lord and Savior. He's the only One who not only bears like a Father but also cares like a Daddy. And looking back over the years of pain and heartache that I experienced because of my father's failure to be my daddy, I now realize that my life was never and will never be about the man who brought me to this world. But it will always be about the Lord who, IN SPITE OF MY FATHER, has brought me thus far and filled my heart with His everlasting love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BJ3DwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Memoirs+of+Spider+Jack+Yates:+And+Other+Strange+Tales&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaplan/Newsweek Medical School Admissions Adviser, Fourth Edition (Get Into Medical School)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SrUzAQAAIAAJ&dq=Kaplan/Newsweek+Medical+School+Admissions+Adviser,+Fourth+Edition+(Get+Into+Medical+School)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raising Real People: A Guide to Parents","description":"Potty training.

Instead, there s a preference for relying on our intuitions about what s best for learning. But relying on intuition may be a bad idea for teachers and learners alike. This accessible guide helps teachers to integrate effective, research-backed strategies for learning into their classroom practice. The book explores exactly what constitutes good evidence for effective learning and teaching strategies, how to make evidence-based judgments instead of relying on intuition, and how to apply findings from cognitive psychology directly to the classroom. Including real-life examples and case studies, FAQs, and a wealth of engaging illustrations to explain complex concepts and emphasize key points, the book is divided into four parts: Evidence-based education and the science of learning Basics of human cognitive processes Strategies for effective learning Tips for students, teachers, and parents. Written by \\"The Learning Scientists\\" and fully illustrated by Oliver Caviglioli, Understanding How We Learn is a rejuvenating and fresh examination of cognitive psychology's application to education.

Yet Kings County enjoyed over two centuries of farming prosperity. Even as late as 1880 it was one of the nation's leading vegetable producers, second only to neighboring Queens County. In Of Cabbages and Kings County, Marc Linder and Lawrence Zacharias reconstruct the history of a lost agricultural community. Their study focuses on rural Kings County, the site of Brooklyn's tremendous expansion during the latter part of the nineteenth century. In particular, they question whether sprawl was a necessary condition of American industrialization: could the agricultural base that preceded and surrounded the city have survived the onrush of residential real estate speculation with a bit of foresight and public policies that the politically outnumbered farmers could not have secured on their own? The first part of the book reviews the county's Dutch American agricultural tradition, in particular its conversion after 1850 from extensive farming (e.g., wheat, corn) to intensive farming of market garden crops. The authors examine the growing competition between local farmers and their southern counterparts for a share of the huge New York City market, comparing farming conditions and factors such as labor and transportation. In the second part of the book, the authors turn their attention to the forces that eventually destroyed Kings County's farming--ranging from the political and ideological pressures to modernize the city's rural surroundings to unplanned, market-driven attempts to facilitate transportation for more affluent city dwellers to recreational outlets on Coney Island and, once transportation was at hand, to replace farms with residential housing for the city's congested population. Drawing on a vast range of archival sources, the authors refocus the history of Brooklyn to uncover what was lost with the expansion of the city. For today, as urban planners, ecologists, and agricultural developers reevaluate urban sprawl and the need for greenbelts or agricultural-urban balance, the lost opportunities of the past loom larger.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zuFSUZqQaiIC&dq=OF+CABBAGES+AND+KINGS+COUNTY:+AGRICULTURE+AND+THE+FORMATION+OF+MODERN+BROOKLYN.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exit the Milkman","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8DwjngAACAAJ&dq=Exit+the+Milkman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The cowboy ;: His characteristics, his equipment, and his part in the development of the West","description":"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Russell argues that after the experience of the Great War the individualistic approach of traditional liberalism has reached its limits. Political theory must be based on the motivated forces of creativity and impulse rather than on competition. Both are best fostered in the family, in education, and in religion - each of which Russell proceeds to discuss. The ideas expressed in Principles of Social Reconstruction have greatly contributed to Russell's fame as a social critic and anti-war activist. The new introduction by Richard Rempel locates them in the context of Russell's other writings and show that neither his ideas nor his language have lost their force and topicality over the years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i8-DJT6fS5gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oil Sands Scientist: The Letters of Karl A.

They were the principal model for Virgil in the Eclogues, and their influence can be seen in the work of Petrarch and Milton. Although it is the pastoral poems for which he is chiefly famous, Theocritus also wrote hymns to the gods, brilliant mime depictions of everyday life, short narrative epics, epigrams, and encomia of the powerful.

Standish s careful critique shows the necessity of a depoliticised geography curriculum the irony of which would be that it would ensure that every child could point to Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan on a map.  Prof. Dennis Hayes  Oxford Brookes University, UK 'A prescient and critical analysis of the changing face of geography teaching. This book deserves to be widely read and debated. Alex Standish's book puts current trends in geography teaching in historical and critical context. It comprises a forthright and timely defence of geographical education for its own sake.' Dr Jim Butcher, FRSA, Department of Sport Science, Tourism and Leisure, Canterbury Christ Church University. Since the early 1990s, educational policy makers and some subject leaders have been seeking to fundamentally change the teaching of geography in UK and US schools, from a subject which encourages students to explore spatial concepts, ideas and skills, to a more ethics based subject concerned with the promotion of environmentalism, cultural diversity and social justice. In this book the new approach is critically examined, within a historical and ideological context, addressing a number of fundamental questions: Should geography be used as a tool for the delivery of citizenship ideals? How does this affect the intellectual and moral value of geographical education for young people? If the state and teachers are taking more responsibility for the values, attitudes and emotional responses of students, how will they learn to develop these qualities for themselves? If global perspectives shift the focus of education from learning about the outside world to learning about the self, what is its vision of social progress and conception of social change? This book advocates a return to liberal models of education, arguing that the new approach to geography currently being promoted for schools fundamentally undermines the educational value of the subject, and the freedom of young people to shape the world in which they live. A vital resource for teachers and student teachers alike, Global Perspectives in the Geography Curriculum makes a significant contribution to the growing debate about the future direction of the discipline itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5jB8AgAAQBAJ&dq=World+Geography+(People+in+time+and+place)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mystical Marriage of Science and Spirit","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GatmAAAACAAJ&dq=Mystical+Marriage+of+Science+and+Spirit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enterprise Integration: The Essential Guide to Integration Solutions","description":" The book s use of real-world case study vignettes really does go to the heart of the subject matter. This stuff is real, it has real applicability to real problems, and, as with most things in life, it shows how it all comes down to real money in the final analysis. This book shows you what your peers are doing to drive costs out of integration projects and to build new applications without re-inventing the entire wheel just a few new spokes and off you go. This is a good book. Read it.   Peter Rhys Jenkins, Complex Systems Architect, Candle Corporation  When you get two long-term, acknowledged experts on integration and interoperability together to lay out the current state of the IT universe you expect an immediate return on investment and this book delivers. It s common knowledge that 90% of total software lifecycle cost is in maintenance and integration, and that needs to drive IT decision-making. With comprehensive coverage of the integration technology landscape, and clear case studies presented at every turn, this book belongs on every IT manager s, every system architect s, and every software developer s bookshelf.   Richard Mark Soley, chairman and CEO, Object Management Group  Today s myriad of integration technologies and alternatives can be daunting. This book presents a framework and process for the evaluation, design, and selection of the appropriate integration technologies to meet your strategic business needs. You will find the templates a particularly useful mechanism to jump-start documentation and drive your decision-making process.   Ron Zahavi, CIO, Global Business Transformation, Unisys Global Transformation Team; author of Enterprise Application Integration with CORBA  It is refreshing to read a book that presents a good business approach to the integration challenge facing most business leaders today, while at the same time educating them about the major components of the required technologies and management practices changes required. The narrative, examples, and templates establish a common reference point between the business and the technology organizations. A must-read for senior business leaders challenged with the complexities of business integration, as well as Senior IT Leaders challenged with shrinking budgets and lower tolerances for failures.   Chuck Papageorgiou, managing partner, Ideasphere  Integration has, and will continue to be, one of the success indicators of any enterprise project. Failing to understand the nuances of integration is a critical mistake managers cannot afford to make.   Marcia Robinson, author of Services Blueprint: Roadmap for Execution  A much-needed book; it ties together the business and technology aspects of information system implementation, emphasizing best practices for really getting things done. I believe that both the technical and business communities will benefit from the in-depth material provided in this book.   Dr. Barry Horowitz, professor of systems and information engineering, University of Virginia (former CEO, Mitre Corporation) Integration of applications, information, and business process has become today s #1 IT investment priority. Most enterprise integration books simply explain the technology. This one shows exactly how to apply it. It s a step-by-step roadmap for your entire project from the earliest exploratory stages through analysis, design, architecture, and implementation. Renowned enterprise integration experts Beth Gold-Bernstein and William Ruh present best practices and case studies that bring their methodology to life. They address every stage from the decision-maker s and implementer s point of view showing how to align business requirements to specific solutions, systematically reduce risk, and maximize ROI throughout the entire lifecycle. Coverage includes: Supporting strategies, tactics, and business planning: enterprise integration from the business perspective Defining realistic project success indicators and metrics Establishing integration architectures: supporting near-term needs while building reusable infrastructure services for the long-term Adopting metadata architecture and standards Implementing four essential implementation patterns: application, information, composite, and process integration Understanding service integration and implementing service-oriented architectures Providing organizational structure and governance to support effective integration The authors provide detailed plans and specification templates for application integration projects both in the book and on the CD-ROM. These projects include identifying business drivers and requirements; establishing strategy; and integrating services, information, process, and applications. Enterprise Integration was written for every member of the integration team: business and IT leaders, strategists, architects, project managers, and technical staff. Regardless of your role, you ll discover where you fit, what to do, and how to drive maximum business value from your next integration project.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0fjFQgAACAAJ&dq=Enterprise+Integration:+The+Essential+Guide+to+Integration+Solutions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Israeli Cook Book: What's Cooking In Israel's Melting Pot","description":"Low in fat and cholesterol, poultry has become the meat of choice for millions of health-conscious Americans.

In this second volume of his authoritative, anthroposophical commentary on the Bible, Edward Reaugh Smith shows that there is no difference between true science and the divine intelligence sought by true religion. The model for such a union of science and religion is the spiritual science developed by Rudolf Steiner. In this union, what the senses show us about the physical world--when keenly observed and allowed to speak for itself instead of being abstracted into theories--become images of the spiritual world: \\"As above, so below.\\" Drawing on his extensive knowledge of the Bible, the author shows us that anthroposophy provides unique insights into the biblical account. Included are essays on: Evolution Creation and Apocalypse The Four Elements As Above, So Below Fire (where Earth and Heaven meet) Light (the first form of corporeality from which all else follows) Blood (the meeting point of inner and outer worlds) What Is Man (how beings of the higher worlds work in forming the earthly vehicle for the human being) Plus Numerous Charts & Tables, an extensive bibliography, and an index of scriptures cited.

He told his students,  I'm not here to make you adopt the ideas I will give you as your own, but to teach you a method for judging the things I will say.  Throughout his life, education was one of Giussani's primary intellectual interests. He believed that effective education required an adequate background in the Christian tradition, presented within a lived experience that underscored the capacity of the faith to answer universal questions. What he proposed was a process that allowed one to sift through tradition, critically examining it and comparing it against the ultimate criteria for judgment: the desires of the heart. In Giussani's view, the primary concern was to  educate the human heart as God made it.  In The Risk of Education he states that fear leads students to associate this process of criticism with negativity or doubt. Yet, without an education in criticism, students cannot develop conviction. At a time when young people are abandoning the church and questioning the value of faith, Giussani's method of judging and verifying Christianity as an experience seems a necessary intervention. In The Risk of Education he argues that, ultimately, education and the Christian message reveal themselves through human freedom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=y9qCDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Risk+of+Education:+Discovering+Our+Ultimate+Destiny&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treasury of Christmas Tales","description":"Includes A Christmas Carol; The Wishing Star; Little Match Girl; Christmas Mouse; Jingle Bells; Magic Toy Shop; Littlest Angel; Twelve Days of Christmas; Christmas Bear; \\"Twas the Night Before Christmas; The Nutcracker; Santa Claus Is Coming to Town; Tiny Elf; O Christmas Tree; Elves and the Shoemaker; Little Drummer Boy; Christmas Carols; Happy Snowman; Rudolph's Adventure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xJAI2euFUCcC&dq=Treasury+of+Christmas+Tales&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death In The Olive Groves - American Volunteers In The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939","description":"Comprehensive account of the three thousand Americans who volunteered to defend the Spanish Republic between 1936 and 1939","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=roMjAQAAIAAJ&dq=Death+In+The+Olive+Groves+-+American+Volunteers+In+The+Spanish+Civil+War,+1936-1939&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Path","description":"De weg biedt een geheel nieuwe kijk op het dagelijks leven. Michael Puett, Harvards populairste docent, laat zien hoe Chinese denkers ons inspireren tot grote en kleine veranderingen.

Mede door de waarde die zij aan kleine gebaren, rituelen en goede gewoontes hechten, bieden zij een totaal ander wereldbeeld dan westerse denkers of boeddhistische leraren. De weg daagt ons uit onze diepgewortelde overtuigingen te herzien. Volgens Puett betekent  het goede leven  niet een groots programma of doel uitvoeren, maar een weg bewandelen. Aan de hand van voorbeelden uit het alledaagse leven, legt Puett de denkbeelden van de oude Chinese filosofen uit. Hij inspireert tot kleine, haalbare veranderingen in onze manier van werken, opvoeden, politiek bedrijven en relaties aangaan, met mogelijk verstrekkende gevolgen voor onszelf en de wereld.

It is for this reason that John R. Campbell came to the Klamath marshes, a wetland in southern Oregon formed by three ancient, shallow lakes, a vast emptiness that is paradoxically home to an amazing diversity of life, of untold thousands of birds both migratory and resident, of all the interconnected life forms that make up one of North America's richest natural environments. Absence and Light is Campbell's account of his exploration of the marshes and a meditation on the world he found there, on his growing understanding of the physical, emotional, moral, and aesthetic meaning of that world, on his own growth as a man. Through Campbell's eyes, we observe the stirring and astonishing beauty of the marshes and their creatures, and the utter poignancy of their fragility before the heedless ambitions of humankind. This is nature writing at its most profound and moving, writing that in examining and defining the world of nature helps us to understand the very complicated and contradictory realities of being human. Campbell's luminous descriptions and mystical insights will long linger in the reader's memory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OC9pzAEACAAJ&dq=Absence+And+Light:+Meditations+From+The+Klamath+Marshes+(Environmental+Arts+and+Humanities)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Branded Spy Murders","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ERgInwEACAAJ&dq=The+Branded+Spy+Murders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Vampyre's Almanac, 1998-1999 Edition","description":"This four-volume work provides a detailed, multicultural survey of established as well as \\"new\\" American religions and investigates the fascinating interactions between religion and ethnicity, gender, politics, regionalism, ethics, and popular culture. ?

He came back from the war to a young son he d barely met and proceeded to bully and browbeat him for his own good, he thought. In the course of puzzling out almost fifty years of intermittent conflict, Mathews came to understand that their problems were not simply personal, they were generational and widely shared by millions of other baby boomer sons. And so, to write this powerful book, which traces the kinetic effect of the war on the men who fought it, their sons, and their grandsons, Mathews has uncovered nine other dramatic and telling father-son tales of veterans in some ways missing in action and how internal war wounds shaped their lives as fathers. These include a combat infantryman whose life was saved by the fabled Audie Murphy, and a black member of the storied Tuskegee Airmen corps. In a moving final chapter, he and his father return together to Italy to revisit scenes from the war and attempt, at long last, to forge their own separate peace. In a very real sense, Our Fathers  War tells the secret history of World War II and its echoes down the years and generations. In the course of doing so, it offers a portrait of evolving styles of American manhood that many, many fathers and sons have been needing and awaiting.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c1KPx8fXGPwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Kid from Courage - Touchdown Edition (Dream Series)","description":"Awakening Courage: Stories of Grit, Resilience, and Toughness depicts the gifts and talents of people residing in a rural southeastern Ohio community nestled in the Appalachian foothills.

It is estimated that impacts have occurred of a magnitude equivalent to the atomic bomb detonated at Hiroshima. Not all such space voyagers meet their end in the atmosphere, however; huge craters attest to the bombardment of earth over millions of years, and a major impact may have resulted in the extinction of dinosaurs. An impact in Siberia near the beginning of this century proves that such events are not confined to geologic time. Hazards Due to Comets and Asteroids marks a significant step in the attempt to come to grips with the threats posed by such phenomena. It brings together more than one hundred scientists from around the world, who draw on observational and theoretical research to focus on the technical problems related to all aspects of dealing with these hazards: searching for and identifying hazardous comets and asteroids; describing their statistics and characteristics; intercepting and altering the orbits of dangerous objects; and applying existent technologies rocket boosters, rendezvous and soft-landing techniques, instrumentation to such missions. The book considers defensive options for diverting or disrupting an approaching body, including solar sails, kinetic-energy impacts, nuclear explosives, robotic mass drivers, and various propulsion systems. A cataclysmic impact posing a threat to life on Earth is a possibility that tomorrow's technology is capable of averting. This book examines in depth the reality of the threat and proposes practical measures that can be initiated now should we ever need to deal with it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xXWZolI9NkUC&dq=Hazards+Due+to+Comets+and+Asteroids+(Space+Science+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield","description":"Oliver Goldsmith's hugely successful novel of 1766 remained for generations one of the most highly regarded and beloved works of eighteenth-century fiction. It depicts the fall and rise of the Primrose family, presided over by the benevolent vicar, the narrator of a fairy-tale plot of impersonation and deception, the abduction of a beautiful heroine and the machinations of an aristocratic villain. By turns comic and sentimental, the novel's popularity owes much to its recognizable depiction of domestic life and loving family relationships. New to this edition is an introduction by Robert L. Mack that examines the reasons for the novels enduring popularity, as well as the critical debates over whether it is a straightforward novel of sentiment or a satire on the social and economic inequalities of the period and the very literary conventions and morality it seems to embody. This edition also includes a new, up-to-date bibliography and expanded notes, and contains reprints of Arthur Friedman's authoritative Oxford English Novels text of the corrected first edition of 1766. About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

In MONEY AS SACRAMENT, Adele Azar-Rucquoi examines how money affects women's outlook on life, relationships, confidence, independence, and inner peace. As a former nun who grew up running the cash register at her immigrant father's grocery, the wife of a formerly homeless man, and the unsuspecting heir to a substantial inheritance later in life, Azar-Rucquoi's defining life experiences have transformed how she relates to money and helped her develop keen perspective and uncommon wisdom on how money impacts lives. In MONEY AS SACRAMENT, Azar-Rucquoi looks at how women are deeply conflicted by wealth or the lack thereof and encourages us to recognize its inherently multifaceted meaning.

Our aim is to provide readers with the highest quality reproductions of fiction and non-fiction literature that has stood the test of time. The many thousands of books in our collection have been sourced from libraries and private collections around the world.The titles that Trieste Publishing has chosen to be part of the collection have been scanned to simulate the original. Our readers see the books the same way that their first readers did decades or a hundred or more years ago. Books from that period are often spoiled by imperfections that did not exist in the original. Imperfections could be in the form of blurred text, photographs, or missing pages. It is highly unlikely that this would occur with one of our books. Our extensive quality control ensures that the readers of Trieste Publishing's books will be delighted with their purchase. Our staff has thoroughly reviewed every page of all the books in the collection, repairing, or if necessary, rejecting titles that are not of the highest quality. This process ensures that the reader of one of Trieste Publishing's titles receives a volume that faithfully reproduces the original, and to the maximum degree possible, gives them the experience of owning the original work.We pride ourselves on not only creating a pathway to an extensive reservoir of books of the finest quality, but also providing value to every one of our readers.

Hillis Miller s essays on seven major twentieth-century authors: Lawrence, Kafka, Stevens, Williams, Woolf, Hardy, and Conrad. For all their evident differences, these essays from early to late explore a single intuition about literature, which may be framed by three words:  trope,   parable,  and  performative.  Throughout these essays Miller is fascinated with the tropological dimension of literary language, with the way figures of speech turn aside the telling of a story or the presentation of a literary theme. The exploration of this turning leads to the recognition that all works of literature are parabolic,  thrown beside  their real meaning. They tell one story but call forth something else. Miller further agrees that all parables are fundamentally performative. They do not merely name something or give knowledge, but rather use words to make something happen, to get the reader from here to there. Each essay here attempts to formulate what, in a given case, the reader perfomatively enters by way of parabolic trope.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_RUlJQ8rJoMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The snake and the sword, a tale of india","description":"\\"The Earlier India Novels Part B\\" contains the revised versions of the third and fourth novels written by Wren. Of the four novels comprising \\"The Earlier India Novels\\" by Wren, these novels are the closest to what Wren is most famous for: adventure stories. \\"The Snake and the Sword\\" is a tightly plotted novel and not a loose knit collection of stories. The major conflict results from the theory that a strong mental shock to a pregnant woman being trapped in a dark room with a snake trapped under her foot would influence the unborn child. This influence would be so strong the child would go into a seizure whenever he encounters a snake in his life. This child, Damocles de Warrenne, grows up the typical all around British empire builder, except for that he collapses at the sight of any snake (dead or alive!). \\"Driftwood Spars\\" is the last of the early India novels. It is the story, as the subtitle states \\"of a man, a boy, and a woman, and certain other people who strangely met upon the sea of life.\\" The principal character is John Robin Ross-Ellison, a son of a Pathan chief and a Scots woman. Ross-Ellison, also known as Mir Jan in his Pathan persona is the connecting link for the other various characters in the novel. There are appendices in this volume that provide details on the significant differences between the first editions published by Longmans, Green, and the reprint editions published by John Murray after the success of \\"Beau Geste\\" in 1924.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Dl7EuAEACAAJ&dq=The+snake+and+the+sword,+a+tale+of+india&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fifty soups","description":"Thomas Jefferson Murrey's 1884 work provides recipes for the soups that were popular at the time, with directions on how to prepare basic stocks and then build on those stocks to create a range of soups, from simple to elegant.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=U_8ZGe5TQ8IC&dq=Fifty+soups&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The ocean of theosophy","description":"\\"The Ocean of Theosophy\\" by William Quan Judge.

However, Britain and Ireland have developed at a tectonic crossroads, on crust once traversed by subduction zones and volcanic arcs, continental rifts and mountain belts. The resulting complexity is instructive, fascinating and perplexing. Geological History of Britain and Ireland tells the region's story at a level accessible to undergraduate geologists, as well as to postgraduates, professionals or informed amateurs. This second edition is fully revised and updated, reflecting our continually developing knowledge of the region's geology. Full coverage is again given to the rich Precambrian and Early Palaeozoic history, as well as to later events more relevant to hydrocarbon exploration. The book is an essential starting point for more detailed studies of the regional geology.

Daarbij ging de aandacht vooral uit naar funeraire objecten zoals dodenmaskers, en in wijdere zin naar \\"kunst.\\" De opzet van deze nieuwe tentoonstelling is heel anders. Het is de bedoeling, een beeld te scheppen van het leven in Romeins Egypte, zoals dat uit papyri en ostraca, uit nederzettingsopgravingen en uit tempels naar voren komt. Hoe leefden de Egyptenaren? Hoe verdienden ze hun geld en aan wat voor belastingen raakten ze het voor een deel weer kwijt? Hoe kleedden ze zich en met wat voor voorwerpen omringden ze zich in hun huizen? Welke invloed hadden de Grieken en Romeinen op de traditionele Egyptische cultuur? Hoe probeerde men de toekomst te voorspellen, en wat voor rol speelden de tempels in de steden? Zulke vragen stonden centraal bij het voorbereiden van de tentoonstelling en het schrijven van de catalogus. Het gaat, met andere woorden, om het leven van alledag in de steden en op het platteland. Deze catalogus omvat twee delen. Het eerste geeft een algemeen overzicht van de geschiedenis, het bestuur, de economie, de alledaagse leefomstandigheden en de religie van het Romeinse Egypte. In het tweede deel volgt de eigenlijke tentoonstellingscatalogus, met uitvoerige besprekingen van alle getoonde voorwerpen, waarbij dezelfde themata aan bod komen, in een licht gewijzigde orde. Na elke objectbeschrijving volgt een bibliografie, waarin eerst wordt verwezen naar oudere publicaties over hetzelfde onderwerp, en vervolgens naar achtergrondliteratuur over de objectsoort.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oEoiAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Hindu+Tradition:+Readings+in+Oriental+Thought+(Modern+Library,+364.1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Young Man With a Horn","description":"Rick Martin loved music and the music loved him. He could pick up a tune so quickly that it didn t matter to the Cotton Club boss that he was underage, or to the guys in the band that he was just a white kid. He started out in the slums of LA with nothing, and he ended up on top of the game in the speakeasies and nightclubs of New York. But while talent and drive are all you need to make it in music, they aren t enough to make it through a life. Dorothy Baker s Young Man with a Horn is widely regarded as the first jazz novel, and it pulses with the music that defined an era. Baker took her inspiration from the artistry though not the life of legendary horn player Bix Beiderbecke, and the novel went on to be adapted into a successful movie starring Kirk Douglas, Lauren Bacall, and Doris Day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cO61kENZbUkC&dq=Young+Man+With+a+Horn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The castle of the otter","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gNqRGAAACAAJ&dq=The+castle+of+the+otter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Corporate Fraud: The Danger from within","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oQPwtAEACAAJ&dq=Corporate+Fraud:+The+Danger+from+within&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kansas City Jazz: From Ragtime to Bebop--A History","description":"Ranging from ragtime to bebop and from Bennie Moten to Charlie Parker, this work aims to capture the golden age of Kansas City jazz.

Now we can examine them in the spotlight for the gifts that they are memorable monuments to style and keys to understanding Wilder s genius.   Penelope Niven, Thornton Wilder Biographer Featuring a foreword by Penelope Niven and a revealing afterword by Wilder s nephew, Tappan, this reissue reintroduces the reader to the Thornton Wilder s first novel, The Cabala, and to The Woman of Andros, one of the inspirations for his Pulitzer Prize-winning play Our Town. A young American student spends a year in the exotic world of post-World War I Rome. While there, he experiences firsthand the waning days of a secret community (a \\"cabala\\") of decaying royalty, a great cardinal of the Roman Church, and an assortment of memorable American ex-pats. The Cabala, a semiautobiographical novel of unforgettable characters and human passions, launched Wilder's career as a celebrated storyteller and dramatist. The Woman of Andros, set on the obscure Greek island of Brynos before the birth of Christ, explores universal questions of what is precious about life and how we live, love, and die. Eight years later, Wilder would pose the same questions on the stage in a play titled Our Town, also set in an obscure location, this time a village in New Hampshire. The Woman of Andros is celebrated for some of the most beautiful writing in American literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CTVEEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manic By Midnight","description":"The remarkable story of the author's recovery from Manic-Depressive illness, and her discovery that she can still have a happy and fulfilling life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GnAGAAAACAAJ&dq=Manic+By+Midnight&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"English Eccentrics 1ST Edition","description":"Reproduction of the original: English Eccentrics by John Timbs","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oYZRDwAAQBAJ&dq=English+Eccentrics+1ST+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mastering Arabic Grammar (Palgrave Masters Series (Languages)) (English and Arabic Edition)","description":"Conversatiegids voor het Modern Standaard Arabisch; met audio-cd.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hSJgZJ9I9HYC&dq=Mastering+Arabic+Grammar+(Palgrave+Masters+Series+(Languages))+(English+and+Arabic+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Russian Journey","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=drNKAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The development of seership: The science of knowing the future : Hindoo and oriental methods","description":"Like all of the Swami Bhakta Vishita titles by William Walker Atkinson, The Development of Seership presents an occult subject and idea to the masses, attempting to teach the reader to reach higher planes, search the inner eye, and attempt to become clairvoyant.

I remember the day summer started.\\" So begins Lee Smith's disarming first novel, written while she was an undergraduate at Hollins College and a winner in 1968 of the Book-of-the-Month Club Writing Fellowship Contest. The Last Day the Dogbushes Bloomed, set in a small southern town at midcentury, tells the story of nine-year-old Susan, for whom the first bright, carefree, promise-filled days of summer slowly evolve into a time of innocence lost and childhood illusions shattered. Susan's mother is vain and frivolous, her father loving but distracted, and her sister, several years her senior, is coping with the first stirrings of serious love. Susan's circle of young friends is joined for the summer by Eugene, the frail, strange nephew of a neighbor. As the months pass, Susan witnesses the disintegration of her parents' marriage and learns from Eugene the cruelty people sometimes resort to. Lyrical and fanciful in spite of its dark moments, The Last Day the Dogbushes Bloomed puts on ample display the remarkable talent that has made Lee Smith one of our most popular writers of fiction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Fe_QDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Last+Day+The+Dogbushes+Bloomed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cherokee Original Recipes; Cooking Tips and Lore","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OzVTAgAAQBAJ&dq=Cherokee+Original+Recipes%3B+Cooking+Tips+and+Lore&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Second Stage Lensman","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oF9NPgAACAAJ&dq=Second+Stage+Lensman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UB25zQEACAAJ&dq=Lust+for+life:+A+novel+of+Vincent+van+Gogh+(The+Collector%27s+library+of+the+world%27s+best-loved+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Color of Privilege: Three Blasphemies on Race and Feminism (Critical Perspectives on Women and Gender)","description":"Sheds new light on women's differing responses to feminism according to factors of ethnicity and race","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XlrAzvJuqRIC&dq=The+Color+of+Privilege:+Three+Blasphemies+on+Race+and+Feminism+(Critical+Perspectives+on+Women+and+Gender)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Symmetries and reflections;: Scientific essays of Eugene P.

Though McDermott and her family had to endure Nathaniel s harrowing surgeries and the stares and comments of strangers and well-meaning friends, they were also transformed by the boy s amazing strength and exuberant personality.

That is to say, the leadership of the church-group of which they are a part is dominating, controlling, manipulating, and exploiting their followers for personal gain and private kingdom-building. Through systematic indoctrination, victims are duped into accepting as biblical and beneficial the oppressive and abusive predominance imposed upon them by unscrupulous, tyrannical church-leaders.Without realizing the spiritual effect of what they are doing, myriads of sincere, faithful believers, in submitting themselves and surrendering unto their spiritual leaders their God-given right to self-governance, have become what God explicitly admonished against: \\"DO NOT BECOME SLAVES OF MEN!\\" (1 Cor. 7:23).Authoritarian abuse (aka, \\"spiritual abuse\\") is one of the most widespread and troubling problems facing the Church today. Indeed, the truth is that ecclesiastical enslavement and exploitation is pandemic in many sectors of 21st Century Christendom, though those churches and ministries employing it go to great lengths to disguise and conceal it.Though religious predomination is certainly nothing new, and hyper-authoritarianism is by no means limited to the Neo-Pentecostal branch of the Church, it has especially flourished in Charismatic and other Neo-Pentecostal groups since it was infused into the fabric, foundation, and functions of that branch of the Church in the early- to mid-seventies through what became known as the \\"Discipleship or Shepherding Movement.\\" The doctrines and practices spawned in that false movement remain an integral part of the operations of many churches and groups yet today!Written from an \\"insider's\\" perspective by a noted and respected Charismatic minister, Charismatic Captivation, has been appraised and praised by ministers, scholars, theologians, church leaders, and laymen as one of the most comprehensive and convincing volumes written to date on the prevalent problem of authoritarian abuse, yet without the \\"Charismatic-bashing\\" characteristic of other books citing Neo-Pentecostal abuses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JE5UvgAACAAJ&dq=Charismatic+Captivation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","description":" Wonderfully incendiary and right-headed . . .Huffington is mad as hell, and rightly so.  Esquire The scathing and insightful New York Times bestseller, now updated to include the current economic crisis Pigs at the Trough is Arianna Huffington s eerily prescient expos  of the financial meltdownand the flagrant greed that triggered it. Once again, Huffington takes on the nexus of corporate highfliers, lobbyists, and Washington insiders who have created and zealously protected a culture of corruption in America. Hearkening back to the days of Enron and WorldCom, she draws a line connecting those accounting frauds to the much larger and more sophisticated corruption that drove the latest financial crisis. The list of new culprits is long, and in this updated version of Pigs at the Trough, Huffington calls them outincluding AIG, Citigroup, and Merrill Lynchand asks the probing questions of how things went so wrong and how we can rebuild our free market capitalist system on a sounder moral foundation. Wickedly amusing yet powerfully indicting, Pigs at the Trough will once again stir up heated discussion among Americans outraged by the bailout of corporate swine.  With a passion for the truth and an eye for detail, Arianna Huffington reports on the hijacking of democracy. Read it and weepthen head for the barricades. Bill Moyers  Huffington indicts with precision, verve, and sparkling wit.

With her wit, social precision, and unerring ability to create some of literature's most charismatic and believable heroines, she mesmerises her readers as much today as when her novels were first published. Whether it is her sharp, ironic gaze at the Gothic genre invoked by the adventures of Catherine Morland in Northanger Abbey; the diffident and much put-upon Fanny Price struggling to cope with her emotions in Mansfield Park; her delightfully paced comedy of manners and the machinations of the sisters Elinor and Marianne in Sense and Sensibility; the quiet strength of Anne Elliot in Persuasion succeeding in a world designed to subjugate her very existence; and Emma - 'a heroine whom no one but myself will like' teased Austen - yet another irresistible character on fire with imagination and foresight. Indeed not unlike her renowned creator.

In Jewish Scholarship and Culture in the Nineteenth Century, Nils Roemer challenges this assumption, finding that religious sentiments, concepts, and rhetoric found expression through a newly emerging theological historicism at the center of modern German Jewish culture. Modern German Jewish identity developed during the struggle for emancipation, debates about religious and cultural renewal, and battles against anti-Semitism. A key component of this identity was historical memory, which Jewish scholars had begun to infuse with theological perspectives beginning in the 1850s. After German reunification in the early 1870s, Jewish intellectuals reevaluated their enthusiastic embrace of liberalism and secularism. Without abandoning the ideal of tolerance, they asserted a right to cultural religious difference for themselves--an ideal they held to even more tightly in the face of growing anti-Semitism. This newly re-theologized Jewish history, Roemer argues, helped German Jews fend off anti-Semitic attacks by strengthening their own sense of their culture and tradition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vmYniIlddAAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secrets of Ancient Geometryand its uses, 2-Volume Set","description":"Every age and every culture has relied on the incorporation of mathematics in their works of architecture to imbue the built environment with meaning and order. Mathematics is also central to the production of architecture, to its methods of measurement, fabrication and analysis.

Over almost 100 chapters it illustrates and examines the relationship between architecture and mathematics. Contributors of these chapters come from a wide range of disciplines and backgrounds: architects, mathematicians, historians, theoreticians, scientists and educators. Through this work, architecture may be seen and understood in a new light, by professionals as well as non-professionals. Volume I covers architecture from antiquity through Egyptian, Mayan, Greek, Roman, Medieval, Inkan, Gothic and early Renaissance eras and styles.

The essays are organized around the four conceptual figures widely considered Schrag's most significant and original philosophical achievements: transversal rationality, the self after post-modernity, the fourth cultural value sphere, and communication praxis. The authors focus on topics ranging from Cartesian rationality to Foucauldian rational relativism; from transcendence in relation to the self to the Schragean self's connections with discourse, action, and community; from religion's disruptive presence in contemporary philosophy to recent developments in the philosophy of language.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0NvWAAAAMAAJ&dq=Calvin+O.+Schrag+and+the+Task+of+Philosophy+After+Postmodernity+(Studies+in+Phenomenology+and+Existential+Philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The white cat","description":"White Cat introduces Holly Black's new world!

The beguiling and alienated narrator-who finds nearly everything interesting and almost nothing clear-has set herself the never-ending goal of photographing a world-renowned reproductive surgeon, Walden Pond, the ponds of Nantucket, and all the houses Anne Sexton ever lived in.

Twee jonge kinderen verdwijnen op bijna hetzelfde moment. Hoewel de politie met man en macht onderzoek doet, kan dat niet voorkomen dat er de volgende dagen meer kinderen ontvoerd worden. Er is geen enkele connectie tussen de verdwijningen: ze vinden overal in West-Nederland plaats, de kinderen zijn tussen de acht en twaalf jaar oud en er wordt geen losgeld ge?ist. Diverse Amber Alerts leveren niets op. Hoe meer kinderen verdwijnen, hoe groter de onrust in het land wordt. Voor Mertens vormen de verdwijningen een onwelkome herinnering aan een oude zaak waarin een jong meisje slachtoffer werd. Toch maakt dit juist dat ze verbeten achter de ontvoerders aan gaat. Kyra weet wat het is als een familielid wordt weggerukt en je vol vragen achterblijft: ontvoerd, vermist, vermoord? De zaak spoort haar nog meer aan haar eigen vermiste zus te vinden: vier jaar geleden verdween Sarina, zonder spoor of bericht. Tot Kyra ineens een briefkaart van Sarina ontvangt.

Although Darwin identified inherited variation as the creative force in evolution, he never formally speculated where it comes from. His successors thought that new species arise from the gradual accumulation of random mutations of DNA. But despite its acceptance in every major textbook, there is no documented instance of it. Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan take a radically new approach to this question. They show that speciation events are not, in fact, rare or hard to observe. Genomes are acquired by infection, by feeding, and by other ecological associations, and then inherited. Acquiring Genomes is the first work to integrate and analyze the overwhelming mass of evidence for the role of bacterial and other symbioses in the creation of plant and animal diversity. It provides the most powerful explanation of speciation yet given.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-iKVtAEACAAJ&dq=Acquiring+Genomes:+A+Theory+Of+The+Origins+Of+Species&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Alps of King-Kern Divide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gH8wAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Alps+of+King-Kern+Divide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life and Death in Nanking","description":"Story of life in Nanking during the years before Mao Rze Tung claimed China as his prize in 1949.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ah04lBJY0A0C&dq=Life+and+Death+in+Nanking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Going Up in a Parachute : A Powered Parachute Manual & Sourcebook for the Beginner","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WsJRAAAACAAJ&dq=Going+Up+in+a+Parachute+:+A+Powered+Parachute+Manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time of the Singing of Birds","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=u_CDnQAACAAJ&dq=Time+of+the+Singing+of+Birds&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Monsieur Maulseene Au Theatre (French Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Block printing in the school","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jsA8AQAAIAAJ&dq=Block+printing+in+the+school&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Small Thing","description":"One small thing is een meeslepend verhaal van de auteur van De Royals.

Drawing on his memories of the real inhabitants of Monterey, California, including longtime friend Ed Ricketts, Steinbeck interweaves the stories of Doc, Dora, Mack and his boys, Lee Chong, and the other characters in this world where only the fittest survive, to create a novel that is at once one of his most humorous and poignant works. In her introduction, Susan Shillinglaw shows how the novel expresses, both in style and theme, much that is essentially Steinbeck:  scientific detachment, empathy toward the lonely and depressed and, at the darkest level the terror of isolation and nothingness.

But all that changed with the untimely death of her son Karl, a champion jockey. During a long period of grieving, Nan, as fate would have it, met some people who communicated with their loved ones in the spirit world. Soon, she also started communicating with her lost son and began to receive 'messages' from him that would alter the course of her life forever.

Was there really a higher energy force- angels, guides, guardians and a God? As Nan delved deeper, building a bridge across two worlds, she decided to share her experience with others. This led her to writing a book in which she detailed how Karl showed her the way out of grief towards happiness, and how she came to believe in Meher Baba- her sons Spiritual Master.

We love to snorkel, swim, kayak, explore and just sit and admire the view. We learned with the cookbooks we both had aboard, and wished for information that wasn't available--like when Jan ended up with a frozen chicken complete with head and feet and no instructions on how to cut it up. When we couldn't get foods such as sour cream, English muffins, spaghetti sauce or yogurt, we adapted recipes to make our own. Other times, we experimented with substituting ingredients--maybe the result wasn t identical, but it was still tasty. We ended up with over 150 substitutions and dozens of  make it yourself  options. As we traded recipes and knowledge with each other, we realized we were compiling information that became The Boat Galley Cookbook: 800+ recipes made from readily-obtainable ingredients with hand utensils, including numerous choices to suit every taste: not just one cake but 20, 16 ways to prepare fish, 10 regional barbeque sauces, and so on. Step-by-step directions to give even  non-cooks  the confidence they can turn out tasty meals without prepared foods. Detailed instructions on unfamiliar things like making yogurt and bread, grilling virtually every food imaginable, preparing and cooking freshly-caught fish and seafood, cutting up and boning meat, cooking in a Thermos and baking on the stove top, as well as lots of tips on how to do things more easily in a tiny, moving kitchen.

The Penguin Modern Classics edition of includes an introduction by Seamus Deane 'riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs' Joyce's final work, Finnegan's Wake is his masterpiece of the night as Ulysses is of the day. Supreme linguistic virtuosity conjures up the dark underground worlds of sexuality and dream. Joyce undermines traditional storytelling and all official forms of English and confronts the different kinds of betrayal - cultural, political and sexual - that he saw at the heart of Irish history. Dazzlingly inventive, with passages of great lyrical beauty and humour, Finnegans Wake remains one of the most remarkable works of the twentieth century. James Joyce (1882-1941), the eldest of ten children, was born in Dublin, but exiled himself to Paris at twenty as a rebellion against his upbringing. He only returned to Ireland briefly from the continent but Dublin was at heart of his greatest works, Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. He lived in poverty until the last ten years of his life and was plagued by near blindness and the grief of his daughter's mental illness. If you enjoyed Finnegans Wake, you might like Virginia Woolf's The Waves, also available in Penguin Classics.

Krishnamurti","description":"For nearly half a century the charismatic, strikingly handsome spiritual teacher J. Krishnamurti gathered an enormous following throughout Europe, India, Australia and North America. From the age of eighteen he was the forerunner of the type of iconoclasm that would bring immediate fame to cult figures in the late twentieth century. Yet recent biographies have left large areas of his life in mystifying darkness. This, however, is no ordinary study of Krishnamurti, for it is written by one whose earliest memories are dominated by his presence as a doting second father tolerant of pranks and pets, playful and diligent. For over two decades in their Ojai California haven, where Aldous Huxley and other pacifists found respite during the war years, Krinsh  developed his philosophical message. He also placed himself at the centre of her parents  Rosalind and Rajagopal s marriage. In a spirit of tenderness, fairness, objective inquiry, and no little remorse, the author traces the rise of Krishnamurti from obscurity in India by selection of the Theosophical Society to be the vehicle of a new incarnation of their world teacher. Breaking from Theosophy, Krishnamurti inspired his own following, retaining the dedication of his longtime friend Rajagopal, himself highly educated, to oversee all practicalities and the editing and publication of his writings. How this bond of trust was breached and became clouded in confusion with a new wave of devoteeism lies at the heart of this extraordinary story. So does a portrait of intense romantic intimacy and the conundrum of Krishnamurti s own complex character.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vfK4flsWy6gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Grow a Young Music Lover","description":"How to Grow a Young Music Lover is the ideal guide for parents who want to boost their children s education through music; parents who want to aid in their children s cognitive, motor, and creative development; parents who love music and want their children to do the same; and parents who wish they knew more about music and want their children to have advantages and instruction they did not.

In a probing analysis that has broad implications for theories of reading, Bernard J. Paris explores how personal needs and changes in his own psychology have affected his responses to George Eliot over the years. Having lost his earlier enthusiasm for her \\"Religion of Humanity,\\" he now appreciates the psychological intuitions that are embodied in her brilliant portraits of characters and relationships. Concentrating on Eliot's most impressive psychological novels, Middlemarch and Daniel Deronda, Paris focuses on her detailed portrayals of major characters in an effort to recover her intuitions and appreciate her mimetic achievement. He argues that although she intended for her characters to provide confirmation of her views, she was instead led to deeper, more enduring truths, although she did not consciously comprehend the discoveries she had made. Like her characters, Paris argues, these truths must be disengaged from her rhetoric in order to be perceived.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kvS9_-Z-DUAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pictorial Encyclopaedia of Scientific Knowledge","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8hytmgEACAAJ&dq=The+Pictorial+Encyclopaedia+of+Scientific+Knowledge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baby Plays Around: A Love Affair, with Music","description":"The author describes how, at the age of thirty, an interview with the leader of a rock band led to her becoming their drummer, and how, as her relationship with her fellow bandmates deepened, her marriage hit the rocks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RrYDEm1vUicC&dq=Baby+Plays+Around:+A+Love+Affair,+with+Music&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"END OF ANTIQUITY","description":"Plague was a key factor in the waning of Antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. Eight centuries before the Black Death, a pandemic of plague engulfed the lands surrounding the Mediterranean Sea and eventually extended as far east as Persia and as far north as the British Isles. Its persisted sporadically from 541 to 750, the same period that witnessed the distinctive shaping of the Byzantine Empire, a new prominence of the Roman papacy and of monasticism, the beginnings of Islam and the meteoric expansion of the Arabic Empire, the ascent of the Carolingian dynasty in Frankish Gaul and, not coincidentally, the beginnings of a positive work ethic in the Latin West. In this volume, the first on the subject, twelve scholars from a variety of disciplines-history, archaeology, epidemiology, and molecular biology- have produced a comprehensive account of the pandemic's origins, spread, and mortality, as well as its economic, social, political, and religious effects. The historians examine written sources in a range of languages, including Arabic, Syriac, Greek, Latin, and Old Irish. Archaeologists analyze burial pits, abandoned villages, and aborted building projects. The epidemiologists use the written sources to track the disease's means and speed of transmission, the mix of vulnerability and resistance it encountered, and the patterns of reappearence over time. Finally, molecular biologists, newcomers to this kind of investigation, have become pioneers of paleopathology, seeking ways to identity pathogens in human remains from the remote past.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=y3s7PgAACAAJ&dq=END+OF+ANTIQUITY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collecting African American History","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JSTJzQEACAAJ&dq=Collecting+African+American+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"USMLE Step 2 Mock Exam, 1e","description":"NOTE:","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OyXJugEACAAJ&dq=USMLE+Step+2+Mock+Exam,+1e&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Flag Captain","description":"It is April 1797, Falmouth Bay, and returning home after 18 months' continuous service, Flag Captain Richard Bolitho finds himself at the centre of the Great Mutiny crisis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jCOhuAAACAAJ&dq=The+Flag+Captain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Goethe's Way of Science (Suny Series, Environmental & Architectural Phenomenology)","description":"Examines Goethe's neglected but sizable body of scientific work, considers the philosophical foundations of his approach, and applies his method to the real world of nature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JoZFgJ0gVN8C&dq=Goethe%27s+Way+of+Science+(Suny+Series,+Environmental&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Logic; or, The right use of reason in the inquiry after truth,: With a variety of rules to guard against error in the affairs of religion and human life, as well as in the sciences","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=usgAAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zymurgy for the Homebrewer and Beer Lover: The Best Articles and Advice","description":"Institutions and ownership play a central role in the transformation and development of the beer market and brewing industry.

On the other hand, owners and managers adapt to these external challenges while following their own strategic agenda. This book explores the implications of this dynamic for the breweries, discussing how changes in institutions have contributed to the restructuring of the industry and the ways in which breweries have responded, including a craft beer revolution with a surge in demand of special flowered hops, a globalization strategy from the macro breweries, outsourcing by contract brewing, and knowledge exchange for small sized breweries.

In a day when people increasingly view the church as a relic of the past, this may be the most important question Christians can ask themselves. The logical starting point is Scripture. In this thorough and engaging study of the church in the New Testament, Kevin Giles concludes that the church is first and foremost a Christian community. No other category offers greater breadth and depth of insight into its nature. No other category offers such a challenge to Western individualism, nor such promise for the revitalization of the church in the postmodern world. 'What on Earth Is the Church?' is an exploration in New Testament theology, a careful study of the ecclesial community from Jesus to Paul and on through to Revelation. Each category of New Testament writings is carefully assessed, with attention given to the early, middle, and late Pauline letters, and to the theology of each Gospel. Giles finds in the New Testament a community in transition -- never perfect, always provisional, and forever living in the tension between its present imperfection and its eschatological ideal. The New Testament does not promise an original community to be recaptured but a variety of perspectives on being the community of God in changing social environments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ynVLAwAAQBAJ&dq=What+Is+The+Church%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vampyre Almanac & Codex Eternal Package","description":"Grab a stake, a fistful of garlic, a crucifix and holy water as you enter the dark, blood-curdling world of the original pain in the neck in this ultimate collection of vampire facts and fiction! What accounts for the undying fascination people have for vampires? How did encounters with death create centuries-old myths and folklore in virtually every culture in the world? When did the early literary vampires as pictured by Goethe, Coleridge, Shelly, Polidori, Byron, and Nodier as the personifications of man s darker side transform from villains into today s cultural rebels? Showing how vampire-like creatures organically formed in virtually every part of the world, The Vampire Almanac: The Complete History by renowned religion expert and fearless vampire authority J. Gordon Melton, Ph.D., examines the historic, societal, and psychological role the vampire has played and continues to play in understanding death, man s deepest desires, and human pathologies. It analyzes humanity s lusts, fears, and longing for power and the forbidden! Today, the vampire serves as a powerful symbol for the darker parts of the human condition, touching on death, immortality, forbidden sexuality, sexual power and surrender, intimacy, alienation, rebellion, violence, and a fascination with the mysterious. The vampire is often portrayed as a symbolic leader advocating an outrageous alternative to the demands of conformity. Vampires can also be tools for scapegoating such as when women are called  vamps  and bosses are described as  bloodsuckers.  Meet all of the villains, anti-heroes, and heroes of myths, legends, books, films, and television series across cultures and today s pop culture in The Vampire Almanac. It assembles and analyzes hundreds of vampiric characters, people, and creatures, including Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Vlad the Impaler, Edward Cullen and The Twilight Saga, Bram Stoker, Lestat De Lioncourt and The Vampire Chronicles, Lon Chaney, True Blood, Bela Lugosi, Dracula, Dark Shadows, Lilith, Vampire Weekend, Batman, Nosferatu, and so many more.

Rather, Childs maps out an approach that reflects on the whole Christian Bible with its two very different voices, each of which retains continuing integrity and is heard on its own terms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tbLYAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Biblical+Theology+of+the+Old+Testament&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","description":"Winner of both the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize, Oscar Wilde is the definitive biography of the tortured poet and playwright and the last book by renowned biographer and literary critic Richard Ellmann. Ellmann dedicated two decades to the research and writing of this biography, resulting in a complex and richly detailed portrait of Oscar Wilde. Ellman captures the wit, creativity, and charm of the psychologically and sexually complicated writer, as well as the darker aspects of his personality and life. Covering everything from Wilde's rise as a young literary talent to his eventual imprisonment and death in exile with exquisite detail, Ellmann's fascinating account of Wilde's life and work is a resounding triumph.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FVNwAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The magic flute","description":"A comprehensive guide to Mozart's THE MAGIC FLUTE, featuring insightful and in depth Commentary and Analysis, a complete, newly translated Libretto with German/English translation side-by side, and over 30 music highlight examples.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oaZDn3-7L24C&dq=The+magic+flute&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","description":"\\"Every [Aubrey-Maturin] book is packed to absolute straining with erudition, wit, history, and thunderous action.\\"  Joe Hill All Patrick O'Brian's strengths are on parade in this novel of action and intrigue, set partly in Malta, partly in the treacherous, pirate-infested waters of the Red Sea.

Oddball cases are James Pibble s specialty. But the brutal bludgeoning of the revered elder of a New Guinea tribesman may be his strangest yet. The corpse, in striped pajamas, lies in the middle of a room completely absent of furniture. Seven women squat on the floorboards. One knits. Another sits cross-legged at his feet. They all chant incantations in a strange language. The murder weapon, a wooden balustrade ornament in the shape of an owl, could have been wielded by any of the myriad suspects Pibble meets at Flagg Terrace, the London residence where the Ku family currently lives. And the only clue seems to be an Edwardian penny. So who killed bearded, four-foot-tall Aaron Ku? Everyone seems to have an alibi, including a local real estate agent, a professional escort, and an anthropologist whose marriage into the tribe was forbidden. In a house where men and women live in separate quarters, Pibble must follow a hierarchy of primitive rituals and gender-role reversals to unmask a surprising killer. The Glass-Sided Ants  Nest is the 1st book in the James Pibble Mysteries, but you may enjoy reading the series in any order.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yiSDBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Goethe's Faust","description":"The story of a man's wager with the Devil.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7GcPAQAAIAAJ&dq=Goethe%27s+Faust&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Novell Open Enterprise Server Administrator's Handbook, SUSE LINUX Edition","description":"Provides information on deploying and administering Novell Open Enterprise Server in a SUSE Linux environment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xVA1AAAACAAJ&dq=Novell+Open+Enterprise+Server+Administrator%27s+Handbook,+SUSE+LINUX+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Any Shot You Want: The A-Square Handloading and Rifle Manual","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GMG8PAAACAAJ&dq=Any+Shot+You+Want:+The+A-Square+Handloading+and+Rifle+Manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Perils of Love (Left Behind: The Kids, No. 38)","description":"Nicolae Carpathia, de Antichrist, ontheiligt de herbouwde tempel en roept zichzelf tot god uit.

Directors like Margarethe von Trotta, Helma Sanders-Brahms, Ulrike Ottinger and Helke Sander have made a huge contribution to feminist film culture, but until now critical consideration of New German Cinema in Britain and the United States has focused almost exclusively on male directors such as Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Wim Wenders. In Women and the New German Cinema Julia Knight examines how restrictive social, economic and institutional conditions have compounded the neglect of the new women directors. Rejecting the traditional auteur approach, she explores the principal characteristics of women s film-making in the 1970s and 1980s, in particular the role of the women s movement, the concern with the notion of a  feminine aesthetic , women s entry into the mainstream, and the emergence of a so-called post-feminist cinema.

Edwin Hoyt, World War II scholar and author, argues against the U. S. justification of the bombing. In his new book, Inferno, Hoyt shows how the U. S. bombed without discrimination, hurting Japanese civilians far more than the Japanese military. Hoyt accuses Major General Curtis LeMay, the Air Force leader who helped plan the destruction of Dresden, of committing a war crime through his plan to burn Japan's major cities to the ground. The firebombing raids conducted by LeMay's squadrons caused far more death than the two atomic blasts. Throughout cities built largely from wood, incendiary bombs started raging fires that consumed houses and killed hundreds of thousands of men, women and children. The survivors of the raids recount their stories in Inferno, remembering their terror as they fled to shelter through burning cities, escaping smoke, panicked crowds, and collapsing buildings. Hoyt's descriptions of the widespread death and destruction of Japan depicts a war machine operating without restraint. Inferno offers a provocative look at what may have been America's most brutal policy during the years of World War II.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7jsYAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","description":"The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Friday Nights Lights chronicles a three-game series between baseball rivals Cardinals and Cubs, focusing particular attention on the stars of the game, Albert Pujols, Sammy Sosa, Mark Prior, and Scott Rolen.

Despite this, there has been until now a lack of information outside of the professional medical literature for use by individuals with this disorder and their families. This book provides comprehensive information on the disorder for people with spasmodic torticollis and those close to them. Medical terms and concepts are introduced sequentially and then used as building blocks for the later discussion. Beginning with a clear definition of the disorder, opening chapters categorize this neurologic disease as one of the broader category of movement disorders, and differentiate it from other conditions with which it is often confused. The authors then present a stepwise introduction to the relevant anatomy and physiology of the nervous system and neck. They draw on the experiences of their patients to build a progressive depiction of the experiences an individual might have as he or she goes through the initial onset of symptoms, progression of the disorder, seeking medical care, diagnosis, treatment, and subsequent outcome. Personal vignettes from the experiences of selected patients are provided where they illustrate particular points in the discussion. Subsequent chapters discuss various modes of treatment for spasmodic torticollis. Prior to the mid-1980?s, there were no specific treatments for this disorder. Nearly all treatment consisted of using oral medications that were primarily intended for other medical conditions. Since most of these medications are still in use, and a few new ones have been added, a chapter is devoted to detailing them and discussing the general principles of medication therapy. During the past decade, chemodenervation using botulinum toxin has become the primary and most effective treatment for spasmodic torticollis. For those few patients who require surgery, a description is provided of the neurosurgical techniques developed during the last twenty years specifically for its treatment. The final chapter is a manual of therapeutic rehabilitation exercises designed to alleviate the symptoms of spasmodic torticollis. These exercises can be performed by most patients with no assistance and a bare minimum of equipment. Since each person?s case of spasmodic torticollis is different, only certain of the exercises may be appropriate for any given individual. They should be undertaken only after discussion with your physician. These exercises are accompanied by detailed illustrations that emphasize the particular muscles relevant to each posture or movement. About the Authors: Dr. Pathak is a neurologist with a special interest in the neurologic rehabilitation of movement disorders, especially spasmodic torticollis. Dr. Frei is a neurologist specialized in the field of neurogenetics, and has conducted clinical trials on a number of movement disorders, including spasmodic torticollis. Dr. Truong is a neurologist and movement disorders specialist. He has conducted active research in the management of movement disorders, including spasmodic torticollus. He was one of the pioneers in the use of botulinum toxin to manage this condition, and has lectured worldwide on the management of movement disorders.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9pnSCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"the man who never was","description":"In the early hours of 30 April 1943, a corpse wearing the uniform of an officer in the Royal Marines was slipped into the waters off the south-west coast of Spain. With it was a briefcase, in which were papers detailing an imminent Allied invasion of Greece. As the British had anticipated, the supposedly neutral government of Fascist Spain turned the papers over to the Nazi High Command, who swallowed the story whole. It was perhaps the most decisive bluff of all time, for the Allies had no such plan: the purpose of  Operation Mincemeat  was to blind the German High Command to their true objective  an attack on Southern Europe through Sicily. Though officially shrouded in secrecy, the operation soon became legendary (in part owing to Churchill s habit of telling the story at dinner). Ewen Montagu was the operation s mastermind, and in his celebrated post-war memoir, The Man who Never Was, he reveals the incredible true story behind  Operation Mincemeat .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hVg-EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jihad: World War in 2036","description":"Imaginings...

In A Celtic Model of Ministry Jerry Doherty, experienced clergyman and Celtic scholar, shows that the decline is caused by a crisis of individualism, a crisis of faith, and a crisis of lifestyle. Doherty responds to these crises by providing a Celtic spirituality by way of ministry of early Celtic Christians in Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Brittany, and the Isle of Man. He provides a model for ministry today in the local congregation and a guideline for the successful future of the Church modeled after the early Celtic communities. Doherty applies the model in congregational development studies and ministry. He explores the problems that have caused the decline of the Church and how paradigms of ministry in current use are no longer adequate. In A Celtic Model of Ministry Doherty proposes that a new model for thinking and building ministry today, especially in the local congregation, may be found in early Celtic Christian communities. Churches need to be a spiritual center, a learning center, and a community center.A Celtic Model of Ministry uses Celtic spirituality in a practical way for ministry in the local congregation and is written primarily for professionals, clergy, and church workers but can be easily read by lay people.Chapters are ?A Crisis of Individualism,? ?The Solution: Community,? ?Celtic Spirituality and Community,? ?Creating Community,? ?A Crisis of Faith,? and ?A Crisis of Lifestyle.??A sensitive pastor, operating out of a rich parochial ministry, shaped by his Episcopal heritage, offers his diagnosis of the sickness affecting the Christian Church today. In the light of that diagnosis, he prescribes a potential cure. Drawing on his study of Celtic Christianity, he plumbs the past to find clues for the future.

While much critical attention has been focused on experimental and radical theater of the period, the essays confirm that mainstream performances not only merit more scholarly attention than they have received, but through serious examination provide an important key to understanding the 1960s as a period. The introduction provides a broad overview of the social, political, and cultural contexts of artistic practices in mainstream theater from the mid-fifties to mid-seventies. Readers will find detailed examinations of the mainstream s surprising attention to craft and innovation; to the rich exchange between European and American theatres; to the rise of regional theaters; and finally, to popular cultural performances that pushed the conceptual boundaries of mainstream institutions.

The feminism of equal rights, which called for freedom through equality, emerged during the Jacksonian era to counter those opposed to women's public participation in antislavery reform.

From duels on Wimbledon Common and attempted suicides in Hyde Park, to public brawls and arrests in Shropshire and the sexual adventures of a princess who rescued Freud from the Nazis and brought him to Britain, this book exposes the curious events surrounding the family s exploits in England, Scotland and Ireland. Originally an island family themselves, the Bonapartes have had a surprisingly good relationship with the British Isles. In just two generations, the Bonapartes went from being Britain s worst enemy to one of Queen Victoria s closest of friends. Far from another mere history of Napoleon Bonaparte, this book is divided into different branches of the Bonaparte family, detailing  in an anecdotal and amusing way  their rather scandalous lives in Britain. For example, few will know that Napoleon III was once a volunteer constable in London and arrested a drunk woman; or that Princess Marie Bonaparte sponsored Prince Philip s education as well as conducted her own research into the clitoris in her quest to achieve an orgasm; or that Napoleon IV fought for the British army and was killed by the Zulus; or that one Bonaparte was even made a High Sheriff in a British town. Today, the head of the family is London-based and works in finance. The Bonapartes are known to most as the enemies of Britain, but the truth is quite the opposite, and far more entertaining.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qfZ6EAAAQBAJ&dq=Napoleon%27s+Family&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Muscle for the Wing","description":"A hard-hitting, critically acclaimed trilogy of crime novels from an author about whom New York magazine has written, \\"What people say about Cormac McCarthy . . . goes double for [Woodrell].

Kim Hubbard, auteur van People Heb je dat wel eens  dat je na een zenuwslopende uitdaging meteen verlangt naar een herkansing? Misschien na een sollicitatiegesprek, een optreden of een lastige presentatie? Juist op momenten die authenticiteit en kracht van je vragen, kun je je onecht en krachteloos voelen. En kun je daarna jezelf allerlei verwijten maken en er nog jarenlang met spijt op terugkijken. Amy Cuddy heeft miljoenen kijkers in vervoering gebracht met haar TED-talk over  power poses . Nu geeft ze ons de intrigerende wetenschappelijke feiten. Ze leert ons eenvoudige technieken die ons helpen om los te komen van angst op spannende momenten en het beste uit onszelf te halen. Presence kenmerkt zich door een stevige wetenschappelijke onderbouwing die op een toegankelijke manier wordt gebracht door een gepassioneerde auteur. Het boek staat vol persoonlijke verhalen van mensen die ooit in de greep waren van angst maar dankzij de adviezen van Cuddy tijdens spannende momenten (weer) een beroep kunnen doen op hun persoonlijke kracht. Amy Cuddy liep op 19-jarige leeftijd ernstig hoofdletsel op. Medici betwijfelden of ze ooit haar mentale capaciteit terug zou krijgen en haar opleiding af zou kunnen maken. Inmiddels is zij sociaal psycholoog, professor en onderzoeker op Harvard Business School. Zij imponeerde in 2012 kijkers over de hele wereld met haar ted-talk over  power poses , die nog steeds in de top-drie van meest bekeken ted-talks aller tijden staat. 'Cuddy legt een hartverwarmende bescheidenheid aan de dag. Haar eigen \\"presence\\"  haar hartsverlangen om de onzekeren en twijfelaars onder ons te helpen in dit tijdperk van angst  is voelbaar op iedere bladzijde. Presence is concreet  n inspirerend, eenvoudig  n ambitieus. Maar boven alles: heel krachtig.'   New York Times 'Amy Cuddy maakt de wereld moediger met haar boek. Moed is op een goede manier besmettelijk en presentie zet aan tot presentie. Ze wisselt wetenschap, praktijkvoorbeelden en individuele verhalen af om duidelijk te maken hoe we in uitdagende situaties ons moedigste, meest authentieke zelf kunnen aanspreken en anderen kunnen uitnodigen om hetzelfde te doen.

During that span, he personally executed more than 350 people while keeping a journal throughout his career. A Hangman s Diary is not only a collection of detailed writings by Schmidt about his work, but also an account of criminal procedure in Germany during the Middle Ages. With analysis and explanation, editor Albrecht Keller and translators C. Calvert and A. W. Gruner have put together a masterful tome that sets the scene of execution day and puts you in Master Franz Schmidt s shoes as he does his duty for his country. Originally published more than eighty years ago, A Hangman s Diary gives a year-by-year breakdown on all of Master Schmidt s executions, which include hangings, beheadings, and other methods of murder, as well as explanations of each crime and the reason for the punishment. An incredible classic, A Hangman s Diary is more than a history lesson; it shows the true anarchy that inhabited our world only a few hundred years ago.

The common view of American economic history suggests that in the years between the end of World War I and the start of the New Deal, the business system operated within a largely laissez-faire environment characterized by irresponsible practices detrimental to the broader interests of American society. Shaffer offers an entirely different interpretation of the period. In the years preceding World War I, American industries had experienced intense and troublesome competition. During the war years, however, much of the American business system was brought under the control of the War Industries Board, a governmental agency that was under the effective control of business leaders. This board had the power to direct production, pricing, allocation of resources and finished products, and other basic decisions within the business sector. Such wartime experiences with government regulation of practices that were normally left to the informal disciplines of the marketplace inspired many business leaders to look for an effective way to restrain and regularize the intensely competitive trade practices prevailing within their industries. What emerges from this book is an awareness that the relationship between government and business has been far more symbiotic than adversarial in the years following World War I, and that government regulatory practices have served the needs of the business community far more than the interests of the public.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yUwLwl6yWy0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Menace to Society: Political-Criminal Collaboration Around the World","description":"One of the more dangerous contemporary threats to the quality of life is the collaboration of the political establishment with the criminal underworld - the political-criminal nexus (PCN). This active partnership increasingly undermines the rule of law, human rights, and economic development in many parts of the world. States in transition are especially at risk. Despite the magnitude of the threat, there is little understanding of the security threats by the PCNs and how and why political-criminal relationships are formed and maintained. Menace to Society is the first attempt to develop an analytical framework for making generalizations about this contemporary scourge. Case studies of Colombia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Italy, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia and Ukraine, and the United States by leading scholars and practitioners included here answer such key questions as: How do PCNs get established? How is a PCN maintained, and destroyed? What do the participants want from each other in a PCN? What can be learned from those who have successfully countered the PCN? The findings indicate that political, economic, and cultural factors play a significant role in the formation and evolution of PCNs. When the institutions of the state are weak, as in Nigeria and Colombia, it is difficult for the state to prevent political-criminal collaboration. A lack of checks and balances, either from civil society or opposition political parties such as described in the cases of Mexico and Russia, is a key factor. Cultural patterns tend to facilitate this kind of collaboration. Markets and economics, too, bear on the PCN issue. The supply and demand for illegal goods and services, not only drugs, in many countries creates a market controlled by criminals who need political help to \\"run\\" their business. Menance to Society will be critical reading for security planners, foreign and military policymakers, and political scientists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aiRBDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Official Autograph Collector Price Guide: Over 60,000 Values to Autographs in All Fields!","description":"This book is quicly becoming the Bible of the industry, with over 60,000 values of world's top personalities from all fields.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6b0MkgEACAAJ&dq=The+Official+Autograph+Collector+Price+Guide:+Over+60,000+Values+to+Autographs+in+All+Fields!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letters from Wupatki","description":"When David and Courtney Reeder Jones moved into two rooms reached by ladder in a northern Arizona Indian ruin, they had been married only two weeks. Except for the ruin's cement floors, which were originally hardened mud, and skylights instead of smokeholes, the rooms were exactly as they had been 800 years before. The year was 1938, and the newlyweds had come to Wupatki National Monument as full-time National Park Service caretakers for the ruin. Remote in time and place, their story as described in Courtney's letters will take readers into a dramatic landscape of red rocks, purple volcanoes, and endless blue sky. Here, some 60 years ago, two young people came to terms with their new life together and with their nearly total reliance upon each other and their Navajo neighbors. \\"They helped us in any way that a neighbor would, and we helped them as we could,\\" wrote Courtney in her memoirs years later. Vivid and engaging, her letters home spill over with descriptions of their friendship with local Navajo families, their sings and celebrations, and her good luck in being able to be a part of it all. Letters from Wupatki captures a more innocent era in southwestern archaeology and the history of the National Park Service before the post-war years brought paved roads, expanded park facilities, and ever-increasing crowds of visitors. Courtney's letters to her family and friends reflect all the charm of the earlier time as they convey the sense of rapid transition that came after the war.

Its uniqueness was demonstrated in various ways. Centuries before it occurred it was foretold with an amazing fullness of detail, by those men whom God raised up in the midst of Israel to direct their thoughts and expectations to a fuller and more glorious revelation of Himself. The prophets of Jehovah described the promised Messiah, not only as a person of high dignity and as one who should perform wondrous and blessed miracles, but also as one who should be \\"despised and rejected of men,\\" and whose labors and sorrows should be terminated by a death of shame and violence. In addition, they affirmed that He should die not only under human sentence of execution, but that \\"it pleased the Lord to bruise Him; HE hath put Him to grief\\" (Isa. 53:10), yea, that Jehovah should cry, \\"Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, and against the man that is My Fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the Shepherd\\" (Zech. 13:7). Arthur Walkington Pink was an English Christian evangelist and Biblical scholar known for his staunchly Calvinist and Puritan-like teachings. Though born to Christian parents, prior to conversion he migrated into a Theosophical society (an occult gnostic group popular in England during that time), and quickly rose in prominence within their ranks. His conversion came from his father's patient admonitions from Scripture. It was the verse, Proverbs 14:12, 'there is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death, ' which particularly struck his heart and compelled him to renounce Theosophy and follow Jesus.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RmN7pwAACAAJ&dq=The+Satisfaction+of+Christ:+Studies+in+the+Atonement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Defining the Really Great Boss","description":"Five essential characteristics of great bosses are elucidated, showing what sets these bosses apart from mere managers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gMJJbawFeCIC&dq=Defining+the+Really+Great+Boss&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Consumer Boycotts","description":"First published in 1999.

By the next day, hundreds of Federals were dead, over 60 black soldiers had been captured and re-enslaved, and over 100 white soldiers had been marched off to their doom at Andersonville. Confederates called this bloody battle and its aftermath a hard-won victory. Northerners deemed it premeditated slaughter. To this day, Fort Pillow remains one of the most controversial battles in American history. River Run Red vividly depicts the incompetence and corruption of Union occupation in Tennessee, the horrors of guerrilla warfare, the legacy of slavery, and the pent-up bigotry and rage that found its release at Fort Pillow. Andrew Ward brings to life the garrison s black soldiers and their ambivalent white comrades, and the former slave trader Nathan Bedford Forrest and his ferocious cavalry, in a fast-paced narrative that hurtles toward that fateful April day and beyond. Destined to become as controversial as the battle itself, River Run Red establishes Fort Pillow s true significance in the annals of American history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LLZ3KboxDBwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hidden Rules of Class at Work","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9a1-YgEACAAJ&dq=Hidden+Rules+of+Class+at+Work&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A road to self-knowledge and The threshold of the spiritual world","description":" A Road to Self Knowledge and the Threshold of the Spiritual World  is a vintage self-help book written by Rudolf Steiner and first published in 1918.

Aubrey, now a considerable though impoverished landowner, has dimmed his prospects at the Admiralty by his erratic voting as a Member of Parliament; he is feuding with his neighbor, a man with strong Navy connections who wants to enclose the common land between their estates; he is on even worse terms with his wife, Sophie, whose mother has ferreted out a most damaging trove of old personal letters. Even Jack's exploits at sea turn sour: in the storm waters off Brest he captures a French privateer laden with gold and ivory, but this at the expense of missing a signal and deserting his post. Worst of all, in the spring of 1814, peace breaks out, and this feeds into Jack's private fears for his career. Fortunately, Jack is not left to his own devices. Stephen Maturin returns from a mission in France with the news that the Chileans, to secure their independence, require a navy, and the service of English officers.

He examines the Reichsbahn's role in German rearmament, its own lack of preparations for war, and its participation in Germany's military operations. He shows that despite successfully resisting Nazi efforts to politicize its internal functions, the Reichsbahn cooperated with the government's anti-Semitic policies.

Applying a rigorous methodology, this profusely illustrated study with interpretative text and catalogue raisonn  embeds Gentileschi's pictorially and emotionally compelling pictures within the actual sociocultural contexts in and for which they were created. The interpretive text analyzes key pictures and primary literary evidence to reveal the sweep of Artemisia's oeuvre, chart her travels, define her standing with artists and patrons of the period, investigate the links between her financial situations and the artistic decisions that she made, and assess the validity of proposals regarding her activity as a still-life painter, her access to professional organizations, her level of literacy, and the nature of her subject matter. Exploring the question of the interrelationships among Gentileschi's gender and experiences as a woman, the state of her psyche, and her art, the text also confronts--and often challenges--the widely embraced feminist interpretation of her pictures. Many of the conclusions in the text are supported by an extensive register of archival documents and by the very core of the study: the first and only catalogue raisonn  of Artemisia's autograph works, each of the fifty-seven pictures exhaustively investigated as to basic factual information, condition and color, iconography, history, documentation and dating, existing copies, and bibliography.

She then shows how to practice the wisdom of Kabbalah in everyday life through meditation and exercises for calming the mind and sharpening awareness. As we gradually absorb this ancient form of knowledge, we see how it affects every aspect of our lives, from attitudes about work and the environment to our social and personal interactions. Despite its popularity at cocktail parties and in the media, few people genuinely understand what Kabbalah is. Unlike traditional Judaism, Kabbalah views God as a divine source of light, energy, and love, ever present in the physical world, rather than a patriarchal diety. Kabbalah practitioners look beyond a literal interpretation of the Hebrew Bible for information about the soul; the nature of God, Creation, and the spiritual world; and humans' relationship to God and to each other.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QouMsSGO7CIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","description":"More than 100 well-loved stories from the Old and New Testaments are featured in lively, full-color illustrations, easy-to-understand text, maps, photos, and more--designed to draw young readers to Christian scripture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_F73-Dwlfg4C&dq=The+Children%27s+Illustrated+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Security: Building Secure J2EE Applications","description":"A definitive guide to Java security explains how to incorporate J2SE and J2EE security technologies into the construction of a secure enterprise infrastructure composed primarily of Java-based enterprise applications, offering comprehensive coverage of the J2SE and J2EE security architectures, as well as practical solutions to ensure security.

For the site where this most civilized city of mortals now stood had once been a dread place indeed, a citadel of evil ruled by the Lord of the Hells. Only through the greatest of sacrifices had he been contained and cast back into his own dimension. And though the passing centuries had all but obliterated the memories of that terrible time, trouble was once again stirring in the hidden byways of Averalaan. The first warning that the Dark Lord s minions were at work came from a pack of street rats led by a young woman gifted with the ability to see the truth even when it was hidden behind carefully spell-crafted illusions. And as she carried her warning to The Terafin, head of one of the most powerful families in the land, others, too, were rallying to Averalaan s aid. Blessed or cursed by their Hunter God and gifted with his most unique creation, the Hunter Lord Gilliam and his huntbrother Stephen were about to do the unthinkable. Guided by the seer Evayne, they would journey beyond the borders of their kingdom, something no Hunter Lord had ever done. For only in Averalaan could they find their true destiny, even if it meant facing the Dark Lord himself ","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V3yyP1aGtswC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bound for Glory","description":"First published in 1943, this autobiography is also a superb portrait of America's Depression years, by the folk singer, activist, and man who saw it all.

Poetry History & Criticism. Lorine Niedecker lived most of her life (1903-1970) on Blackhawk Island, Wisconsin. Her poetry was formed by her early encounter with Surrealism and the Objectivist issue of Poetry magazine. In the mid-1960s she recalled for Kenneth Cox that \\"there was an influence from transition and from surrealistes that has always seemed to want to ride right along with the direct, hard, objective kind of writing. The subconscious and the presence of the folk, always there.\\" LORINE NIEDECKER: WOMAN AND POET addresses the ambition of Niedecker's poetry and poetics. The volume includes letters, memoirs, and essays, covering all four decades of her writing career. Among the letters, those Niedecker wrote to Mary Hoard and Harriet Monroe define her early poetics. Memoirs by Jerry Reisman, Edwin Honig, and Vivien Hone extend our understanding of her life in the 1930s and 1940s.

Tales of legendary lock-keepers and long-vanished weirs evoke the distant past of a river which evolved into a prime commercial artery linking the heart of England with the ports of Europe. In Victorian times, the Thames hosted regattas galore, its new bridges and tunnels were celebrated as marvels of their time, and London s river was transformed from sewer to centrepiece of the British Empire. Talk of the Thames Gateway and the effectiveness of the Thames Barrier keeps the river in the news today, while the lengthening Thames Path makes the waterway more accessible than ever before. Through quiet meadows, rolling hills, leafy suburbia, industrial sites and a changing London riverside, Mick Sinclair tracks the Thames from source to sea, documenting internationally-known landmarks such as Tower Bridge and Windsor Castle and revealing lesser known features such as Godstow Abbey, Canvey Island, the Sandford Lasher, and George Orwell s tranquil grave.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Orq_BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","description":" Once an Eagle is simply the best work of fiction on leadership in print.

Therefore, it might be reasonably argued that there is little room for another volume. Nonetheless, this vast outpouring of literature has usually dealt with major leaders, specific battles or campaigns, and with certain branches of the service. Moreover, at least in English, the literature tends to concentrate primarily on the French or British armies. There appears to be a lack of works combining a description of the major changes and trends in the art of war, especially at the cutting edge of events, with a discussion of the French military establishment and the armies of the major opponents, British as well as continental. And while this book is only a brief survey, I do believe that it may serve as a contribution towards filling this gap in our historical knowledge of military institutions and fighting men.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jxqdnKQrAmEC&dq=ART+OF+WARFARE+IN+THE+AGE+OF+NAPOLEON&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Malinche","description":"Historical novel that retells the story of Hernaan Cortaes and Do?na Marina, his interpreter and mistress during the conquest of Mexico.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=d6xi-9O5DaAC&dq=Malinche&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Indian Lover: A Novel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-6aMDAEACAAJ&dq=The+Indian+Lover:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mixed: An Anthology of Short Fiction on the Multiracial Experience","description":"A volume of short fictional works about the meaning and significance of what it means to be multiracial in today's America includes tales about Peter Ho Davies's confused minotaur, Ruth Ozeki's young biracial detectives, and Wayde Compton's college junkie.

Further, when Senator Bayh introduced Senate Joint Resolution 139 in December 1963, the nation had a various times been without a Vice President for a total of more than 36 years since April 1789, when Washington was inaugurated in New York City. On November 22, 1963, the junior Senator from Indiana, like most Americans, was stunned by the tragedy of President Kennedy's assassination. As the nation mourned, urgent questions were raised concerning the future stability of the country. What if the Vice President also had been felled by an assassin's bullet? What if the President had been critically or permanently disabled? This book is the intimate story of what Senator Bayh did to help protect the nation from the disastrous effects of such possibilities. It is not only the story of Senator Bayh's successful efforts, but also it is a day-by-day account of how our democracy works.

Margins are collapsing and customization is rapidly increasing. The automotive industry turned to quality and its no coincidence that in the money management industry many of the spectacular failures have been due largely to problems in quality control. The financial industry in on the verge of a quality revolution. New and old firms alike are creating new investment vehicles and new strategies that are radically changing the nature of the industry. To compete, mutual funds, hedge fund industries, banks and proprietary trading firms are being forced to quicklyy research, test and implement trade selection and execution systems. And, just as in the early stages of factory automation, quality suffers and leads to defects. Many financial firms fall short of quality, lacking processes and methodologies for proper development and evaluation of trading and investment systems. Authors Kumiega and Van Vliet present a new step-by-step methodology for such development. Their methodology (called K|V) has been presented in numerous journal articles and at academic and industry conferences and is rapidly being accepted as the preferred business process for the institutional trading and hedge fund industries for development, presentation, and evaluation of trading and investment systems. The K|V model for trading system development combines new product development, project management and software development methodologies into one robust system. After four stages, the methodology requires repeating the entire waterfall for continuous improvement. The discussion quality and its applications to the front office is presented using lessons learned by the authors after using the methodology in the real world. As a result, it is flexible and modifiable to fit various projects in finance in different types of firms. Their methodology works equally well for short-term trading systems, longer-term portfolio management or mutual fund style investment strategies as well as more sophisticated ones employing derivative instruments in hedge funds. Additionally, readers will be able to quickly modify the standard K|V methodology to meet their unique needs and to quickly build other quantitatively drive applications for finance. At the beginning and the end of Quality Money Management the authors pose a key question: Are you willing to change and embrace quality for the 21st century or are willing to accept extinction? The real gem in this book is that the concepts give the reader a road map to avoid extinction. Presents a robust process engineering framework for developing and evaluating trading and investment systems Best practices along the step-by-step process will mitigate project risk, model risk, and ensure data quality Includes a quality model for backtesting and managing market risk of working systems","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mjd96ayZ98kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selling Real Estate without Paying Taxes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WVJ7AAAACAAJ&dq=Selling+Real+Estate+without+Paying+Taxes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Verbal Penetration","description":"With the wide range of jobs currently on the market, it is often difficult for job seekers to pinpoint exactly what they want to do.

Zo vonden onder meer tomaten, aardappelen, ma?s, zilver en rubber hun weg naar Eurazi?, en omgekeerd zijde, paarden, graan, koffie, appels - en slaven niet te vergeten - naar Noord- en Zuid-Amerika. Een minder welkome uitwisseling was uiteraard die van insecten, bacteri?n en virussen. Charles Mann laat zien dat deze zogeheten Columbian Exchange heeft gezorgd voor de opkomst van Europa, de ondergang van het Chinese keizerrijk en de verstoring van de ecologie in Afrika. Met 1493 heeft bestsellerauteur Charles Mann de belangrijkste biologische gebeurtenis sinds het uitsterven van de dinosauri?rs onder de aandacht van een groot publiek weten te brengen.

Montgomery's Heroines and the Pursuit of Romance","description":"When it originally appeared, Elizabeth Rollins Epperly's The Fragrance of Sweet-Grass was one of the first challenges to the idea that L.M. Montgomery's books were unworthy of serious study. Examining all of Montgomery's fiction, Epperly argues that Montgomery was much more than a master of the romance genre and that, through her use of literary allusions, repetitions, irony, and comic inversions, she deftly manipulated the normal conventions of romance novels. Focusing on Montgomery's memorable heroines, from Anne Shirley to Emily Byrd Starr, Valancy Stirling, and Pat Gardiner, Epperly demonstrates that Montgomery deserves a place in the literary canon not just as the creator of Anne of Green Gables but as an artist in her chosen profession. Since its publication more than twenty years ago, The Fragrance of Sweet-Grass has become a favourite of scholars, writers, and Montgomery fans. This new edition adds a preface in which Epperly discusses the book's contribution to the ongoing research on the life and writing of L.M. Montgomery, reflects on how Montgomery studies have flourished over the past two decades, and suggests new ways to approach and explore the Canadian writer's work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9baFAwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Fragrance+of+Sweet-Grass:+L.M.+Montgomery%27s+Heroines+and+the+Pursuit+of+Romance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shangri-La: The Return to the World of Lost Horizon","description":"An epic sequel to James Hilton's classic 1933 novel finds Hugh Conway back in Tibet during China's Cultural Revolution, marshalling his forces to forestall a Chinese general who is determined to plunder the riches of Shangri-La.

Drawing on a course the editors teach at Harvard Law School, the book traces the rise and evolution of a distinctly American form of legal reasoning. These are the articles that have made these authors--from Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., to Ronald Coase, from Ronald Dworkin to Catherine MacKinnon--among the most recognized names in American legal history. These authors proposed answers to the classic question: \\"What does it mean to think like a lawyer--an American lawyer?\\" Their answers differed, but taken together they form a powerful brief for the existence of a distinct and powerful style of reasoning--and of rulership. The legal mind is as often critical as constructive, however, and these texts form a canon of critical thinking, a toolbox for resisting and unravelling the arguments of the best legal minds. Each article is preceded by a short introduction highlighting the article's main ideas and situating it in the context of its author's broader intellectual projects, the scholarly debates of his or her time, and the reception the article received. Law students and their teachers will benefit from seeing these classic writings, in full, in the context of their original development. For lawyers, the collection will take them back to their best days in law school. All readers will be struck by the richness, the subtlety, and the sophistication with which so many of what have become the clich s of everyday legal argument were originally formulated.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=boNaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hidden Hand: Britain, America and Cold War Secret Intelligence","description":"A noted scholar lifts the lid on the \\"religion of secrecy\\" that marked the Cold War, using recently uncovered files to shed light on the British and American intelligence efforts during this period. 20,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Y-IPAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Hidden+Hand:+Britain,+America+and+Cold+War+Secret+Intelligence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Comparative History of World Philosophy: From the Upanishads to Kant","description":"Breaks through the cultural barriers between Western, Indian, and Chinese philosophy and demonstrates that despite considerable differences between these three great philosophical traditions, there are fundamental resemblances in their abstract principles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iZQy2lu70bwC&dq=A+Comparative+History+of+World+Philosophy:+From+the+Upanishads+to+Kant&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Basics of Mortgage-Backed Securities (Frank J.

She demonstrates that, in the American crucible of cultures, contact and conflict among Europeans, native Americans, and Africans gave particular significance and complexity to the uses of the spoken word. Gustafson develops what she calls the performance semiotic of speech and text as a tool for comprehending the rich traditions of early American oratory. Embodied in the delivery of speeches, she argues, were complex projections of power and authenticity that were rooted in or challenged text-based claims of authority. Examining oratorical performances as varied as treaty negotiations between native and British Americans, the eloquence of evangelical women during the Great Awakening, and the founding fathers' debates over the Constitution, Gustafson explores how orators employed the shifting symbolism of speech and text to imbue their voices with power.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2qPqCQAAQBAJ&dq=Eloquence+Is+Power:+Oratory+and+Performance+in+Early+America+(Omohundro+Institute+of+Early+American+History+and+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"After the Clockwork Universe","description":"New York Times bestselling author Edward Dolnick brings to light the true story of one of the most pivotal moments in modern intellectual history when a group of strange, tormented geniuses invented science as we know it, and remade our understanding of the world.

Indeed, the writing and rewriting of this endlessly intriguing icon's life has produced more than six hundred books, from the long procession of \\"authoritative\\" biographies to the memoirs and plays by ex-husband Arthur Miller and the works by Norman Mailer and Joyce Carol Oates. But even as the books have multiplied, myth, reality, fact, fiction, and gossip have become only more intertwined; there is still no agreement about such fundamental questions as Marilyn's given name, the identity of her father, whether she was molested as a child, and how and why she died. The Many Lives of Marilyn Monroe reviews the unreliable and unverifiable-but highly significant-stories that have framed the greatest Hollywood legend. All the while, cultural critic Sarah Churchwell reveals us to ourselves: our conflicted views on women, our tormented sexual attitudes, our ambivalence about success, our fascination with self-destruction. In incisive and passionate prose, Churchwell uncovers the shame, belittlement, and anxiety that we bring to the story of a woman we supposedly adore. In the process, she rescues a Marilyn Monroe who is far more complicated and credible than the one we think we know.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L2I9wyYrMNkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Betrayal in April","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4YoAAAAACAAJ&dq=Betrayal+in+April&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creating the High Performance Team","description":"Creating High Performance Teams is an accessible and thorough new introduction to this key area of business education.

This is an intense drama of love, deception, jealousy and destruction, written in 1603. Dramatic and powerful in its scope, Othello explores the perils of suspicion and jealousy and the ensuing breakdown of relationships and disaster that can arise from such emotions. Othello, a revered soldier, secretly marries Desdemona, the daughter of a Venetian senator, but is led to believe that she has been unfaithful to him by his ensign, Iago, leading to tragic events. Desdemona's love for Othello, the Moor, transcends racial prejudice; but the envious Iago conspires to devastate their lives. In its vivid rendering of racism, sexism, contested identities, and the savagery lurking within civilization, Othello is arguably the most topical and accessible tragedy from Shakespeare's major phase as a dramatist.

Manny Lawton was a twenty-three-year-old army captain on April 8, 1942, when orders to surrender to the Japanese forces invading the Philippines arrived. The next day, he and his fellow American and Filipino prisoners set out on the infamous Bataan Death March a forced six-day, sixty-mile trek under a broiling tropical sun during which approximately eleven thousand men died or were bayoneted, clubbed, or shot to death by the Japanese. As terrible as the Death March was, for Manny Lawton and his comrades it was only the beginning. When the war ended in August 1945, it is estimated that some fifty-seven percent of the American troops who had surrendered on Bataan had perished. Yet this is not a chronicle of despair. It is, instead, the story of how men can suffer even the most desperate conditions and, in their will to retain their humanity, triumph over appalling adversity. An epic of quiet heroism with an introduction by historian John Toland, Some Survived is a harrowing and inspiring tale and  an honorable and absorbing testament to the courage of many  (The State).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fzb08VXovkAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern Hebrew Literature","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6NtiAAAAMAAJ&dq=Modern+Hebrew+Literature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rain Doesn't Fall Straight Down: A Positive Slant on Marriage Relationships","description":"Most of the people who get divorced have never been to a marriage counselor. This collection of creative essays on the complex dynamics between men and women is meant to take the marriage counselor to them and numerous others who could do with a little preventive medicine. What he writes applies equally to persons who are in second or subsequent marriages, because the problems are similar, even if the desire for solutions is a bit more urgent. Most of what he has written applies to couples who have been together long enough to realize that relationships take some thought and some maintenance. Morrow, a career Marriage and Family Therapist, writes with enough clinical expertise to be taken seriously and with enough humor to engage the most hardened couples. He takes up the eternal battle of the sexes with the notion that, if couples will give their relationship a little conscious thought, it will keep them safe from the storms that beset all marriages. Just as the rain doesn't fall straight down, marriage problems do not occur suddenly, without warning. As he says in the lead essay, he addresses a couple's reasoning ability here and in all the subsequent essays. Indeed, it is why he writes. As Morrow states, along with the marital problems, there is time; that is, there is always a period of time between the first hint of trouble and the actual deluge of crisis to call time-out, sit down, and talk things over. Each piece in The Rain Doesn't Fall Straight Down was originally written during a recent four-year period for a local newspaper column entitled simply \\"Relationships.\\" Each essay provided an opportunity for spouses to take up an issue while being mildly entertained. The therapist in him wanted the readers to reflect and reason about the issue for the sake of increasing awareness. To read and reflect on a typical family event offers its own kind of healing without depending on the usual direct advice. Now that these essays appear in collected form, Morrow's optimism shows through as a pattern. From several points of view Dr. Morrow demonstrates confidence about a couple's ability to seek and find direction from within, and his background as a Presbyterian minister is evidenced by his suggestion that each person has available an inner spiritual force to help solve problems. That force fans a flame of unconditional love in each marital partner. What s more, individual inner balance is required for truly intimate relationships. The book is divided into five parts. In Part One, Dr. Morrow has gathered those essays that give some insight into how therapy and therapists work. These chapters focus more on the process of marriage therapy rather than on the content. In an answer to the rhetorical question, \\"What do marriage counselors do?\\", he offers an imaginary look inside the head of the therapist-on-the-job. Clearly, therapists face a challenge in confronting a counseling situation in which the spouses are obviously at odds with each other. Therapists must have enough presence of mind not to get drawn into a conflict that would diminish their ability to be objective. These chapters make one realize that the therapist has to have perspective as well as a sense of humor. In Part Two, Morrow includes essays about those family relationships that take place for the most part outside the core of the marital dyad: relationships with young children and adolescents. There is an advocacy here for the needs of children. Those needs, for which most family units were formed to serve, can get neglected while mom and dad work out their lives. Part Three comprises the largest group of essays. Here the focus is on the couple, with a trip through the marriage life-cycle. In this part, Morrow emphasizes the normalization of the temporary departures from couple satisfaction. In addition to reflecting on the vast assortment of relationships he has seen over the years of his practice, Morrow also comments on some of the","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_mRVNgAACAAJ&dq=The+Rain+Doesn%27t+Fall+Straight+Down:+A+Positive+Slant+on+Marriage+Relationships&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marketing and Pricing of Milk and Dairy Products in the United States","description":"How will the U.S. dairy industry look under deregulation?

On the brink of far-reaching changes in federal dairy policy, it gives a much-needed account of how market forces and government intervention drive the most regulated and complicated agricultural industry in the United States. The first comprehensive book on the topic,Marketing and Pricing of Milk and Dairy Products in the U.S. considers every aspect of this complicated puzzle. Looking at dairy products from milk and yogurt to butter, cheese, and ice cream, it explains supply and demand, dairy cooperatives, federal milk marketing orders and price supports, local and state regulations, and international trade. Finally, in a clear and compelling manner, the author proposes reforms that would benefit the dairy industry, especially a move toward less regulation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BhsxNP9Rw4AC&dq=Marketing+and+Pricing+of+Milk+and+Dairy+Products+in+the+United+States&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cure: Songwords, 1978-1989","description":"Lyrics to over 120 songs written and recorded during the first decade of their career.

At the same time, numerous Jews from the Reich began to be deported to the ghetto of Riga. Ca. 20,000 German, Austrian, and Czech Jews arrived there during the winter of 1941-42; 800 of them survived the war, which is much greater than the numbers of German Jewish survivors from the ghettos of ? d?, Minsk, Kaunas, etc. Presents a story of life and death in the ghetto, focusing mainly on the \\"German\\" part of it; the story is largely based on testimonies of survivors, including Schneider's own (she was deported to the Riga ghetto from Vienna in February 1942). Many of the Jews were sent to the Jungfernhof camp near the city, rather than to the ghetto. Later, some were transferred from the ghetto to the Salaspils camp, and in August 1943, 7,874 Jews were sent from the ghetto to the Kaiserwald camp. The rest of the ghetto was liquidated in October 1943, and ca. 60 people were left to remove all traces of the former inhabitants, after which they were also transferred to Kaiserwald.

He ruled England with Stalinist ruthlessness, executing (at a conservative estimate) 150,000 people from a population of less than 3 million souls. But after 35 years in power, he was a bloated, hideously obese, black-humoured old man, rarely seen in public. He had striven all his life to ensure the survival of his dynasty by siring legitimate sons, yet his only male heir was eight-year-old Prince Edward. It was increasingly obvious that when Henry died, real power in England would be exercised by a regent. The prospect of that prize spurred the rival court factions into deadly conflict.

This study systematically considers the major issues of the book, and argues for the fundamental importance of Physics VII in our understanding of Aristotelian cosmology and natural science. Physics VII is extant in two versions, and therefore poses special editorial problems. For this reason one of the features of Dr. Wardy's study is the provision of an improved text and translation in both versions. The author's comprehensive comparison of their merits, philosophical and philological, has a significant bearing on our understanding of the nature and evolution of the Aristotelian corpus. The second part of the book is devoted to critical examination of the argument, including one of the most elaborate and challenging in the entire Aristotelian corpus. Throughout, the author concentrates on those points where Aristotle diverges most sharply and provocatively from contemporary presumptions in philosophy and natural science.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qC67XUKWWNYC&dq=Aristotle%27s+Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hidden Gifts of the Introverted Child","description":"Introverted children are often misunderstood, even by their parents, who worry about them. Engaged by their interior world, they re often regarded as aloof. Easily overwhelmed by too much stimulation, they can be seen as unmotivated. Content with just one or two close friends, they may be perceived as unpopular. Parents fret that they are unhappy and maladjusted. But the truth is quite different: Introverted children are creative problem solvers. Introverted children love to learn. Introverted children have a high EQ (emotional IQ) and are in touch with their feelings. They take time to stop and smell the roses, and they enjoy their own company. They are dependable, persistent, flexible, and lack vanity. How can parents help their introverted children discover and cultivate these wonderful gifts? Help is here. Written by Dr. Marti Olsen Laney, author of The Introvert Advantage with 74,000 copies in print, The Hidden Gifts of the Introverted Child fully explains introversion as a hardwired temperament, not a disability, and tells just what parents need to do to help their child become the person he or she is meant to be and succeed in an extroverted world. Beginning with a 30-question quiz that places a child on the introvert/extrovert continuum, The Hidden Gifts shows parents how to foster a climate that allows introverted kids to discover their inner strengths; schedule ways for a very young innie to recharge those batteries and teach an older child to do it for him- or herself; create a harmonious household with siblings, and parents, of different temperaments; help innies find success at school, sports, parties, and other group activities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rQQf_j6bEPUC&dq=The+Hidden+Gifts+of+the+Introverted+Child&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mutts: America's Dogs","description":"A reference guide to mutts provides detailed information on mixed-breed types of canines, shares stories from dog owners, and recommends the best mutts for children, families, and singles","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Gwa_GwAACAAJ&dq=Mutts:+America%27s+Dogs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Causes of the Civil War","description":"\\"The causes of the Civil War brings into sharp focus the major issues, real or imaginied, that divided northerners and southerners in a disastrous national crisis.

Bishop makes the case that a lot of what passes as \\"public opinion\\" in mass media today is an illusion, an artifact of measurement created by vague or misleading survey questions presented to respondents who typically construct their opinions on the spot. Using evidence from a wide variety of data sources, Bishop shows that widespread public ignorance and poorly informed opinions are the norm rather than definitive public opinion on key political, social, and cultural issues of the day. The Illusion of Public Opinion presents a number of cautionary tales about how American public opinion has supposedly changed since 9/11, amplified by additional examples on other occasions drawn from the American National Election Studies. Bishop's analysis of the pitfalls of asking survey questions and interpreting poll results leads the reader to a more skeptical appreciation of the art and science of public opinion polling as it is practiced today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fpzrs-bSD3gC&dq=The+Illusion+of+Public+Opinion:+Fact+and+Artifact+in+American+Public+Opinion+Polls&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Empire of the Steppes A History of Central Asia","description":".","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CHzGvqRbV_IC&dq=The+Empire+of+the+Steppes+A+History+of+Central+Asia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Montana, Wyoming, & Idaho: Travel Smart (Montana, Wyoming & Idaho Travel-Smart, 1st ed)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UoCsHpYvU5UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miles Ahead: Devotions from Older Adults","description":"\\"...

S. Constitution focused intently on the difficulties of achieving a workable middle ground between national and local authority. They located that middle ground in a new form of federalism that James Madison called the \\"compound republic.\\" The term conveys the complicated and ambiguous intent of the framing generation and helps to make comprehensible what otherwise is bewildering to the modern citizenry: a form of government that divides and disperses official power between majorities of two different kinds one composed of individual voters, and the other, of the distinct political societies we call states. America's federalism is the subject of this collection of essays by Martha Derthick, a leading scholar of American government. She explores the nature of the compound republic, with attention both to its enduring features and to the changes wrought in the twentieth century by Progressivism, the New Deal, and the civil rights revolution. Interest in federalism is likely to increase in the wake of the 2000 presidential election. There are demands for reform of the electoral college, given heightened awareness that it does not strictly reflect the popular vote. The U. S. Supreme Court, under Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, has mounted an explicit and controversial defense of federalism, and new nominees to the Court are likely to be questioned on that subject and appraised in part by their responses. Derthick's essays invite readers to join the Court in weighing the contemporary importance of federalism as an institution of government.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UbyzCImsVzsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crying: A Natural and Cultural History of Tears","description":"A natural and cultural history of crying probes this phenomenon from every angle, using the work of philosophers, poets, scholars, scientists, anthropologists, and sociologists to trace the changing meaning of tears throughout the years.

Twee jonge kinderen verdwijnen op bijna hetzelfde moment. Hoewel de politie met man en macht onderzoek doet, kan dat niet voorkomen dat er de volgende dagen meer kinderen ontvoerd worden. Er is geen enkele connectie tussen de verdwijningen: ze vinden overal in West-Nederland plaats, de kinderen zijn tussen de acht en twaalf jaar oud en er wordt geen losgeld ge?ist. Diverse Amber Alerts leveren niets op. Hoe meer kinderen verdwijnen, hoe groter de onrust in het land wordt. Voor Mertens vormen de verdwijningen een onwelkome herinnering aan een oude zaak waarin een jong meisje slachtoffer werd. Toch maakt dit juist dat ze verbeten achter de ontvoerders aan gaat. Kyra weet wat het is als een familielid wordt weggerukt en je vol vragen achterblijft: ontvoerd, vermist, vermoord?

It is Nicolay's firsthand knowledge and personal observations of the key figures that imbue The Outbreak of Rebellion (1881) with immediacy and thrust. Here is the secession fever that swept the South; Lincoln's shrewd and desperate maneuverings to hold the border states; the behind-the-scenes debates about how to respond to the crisis; the attack on Fort Sumter and the call to arms; and the hard-fought battle along Bull Run creek that resulted in a chaotic Federal defeat and the first appalling casualties of the war.
