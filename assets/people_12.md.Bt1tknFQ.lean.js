This story rates very high not quite as high as most of the others but still very high. In this story Ms.Howard uses a more light hearted approach to her normal murder and sensual appoach. If you were looking for another Mackenzie series or Kill and Tell than this was not it. However it was still an enjoyable book. How many of us are/were stuck in a rut and needed a change or a little adventure? Well that's what the character Daisy gets in spades. The heroine was enjoyable and helped you laugh a little at and with yourself as well as herself. The hero, a police chief from a large city transplanted into small town America made you go a little soft and mushy when he finds out what a catch &quot;Miss Daisy&quot; is and was even before things got out of hand.If you like feeling soft,fuzzy,anxious,sexy and amused give this on a chance."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I found the main character to be toooooooo stererotypical - this book was too focused on appearances but I did find myself laughing aloud. If you like Linda Howard, you will overlook some of the problems with this book - All in all, it was a good read!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I think Linda Howard has outdone herself this time. This book is totally fantastic. I just got mine and it took me almost 24 hours to get it completed. I have always loved her and this one is definitely being added to my bookshelf. I haven't stopped laughing at some of the outrageousness of &quot;Miss Daisy&quot; and Jack. I will look forward to anything Linda Howard writes. If I could give this book 10 stars it would defnitely have them."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I am a lover of Linda Howard's novels and this one is just another example of her great works. I absolutely loved it - I laughed so many times over the situations that Daisy gets herself into, especially with Jack. They are both believable characters and the mystery surrounding their lives only adds to the anticipation. Job well done, Mrs. Howard! And I loved hearing about Midas. :) If you want another recommendation of one of Linda Howard's books, then I would suggest Shades of Twilight."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"If you want to know the plot of a book, look at the editorial reviews; if you want to know how enjoyable or readable a book is, go to the customer reviews. Having said that, this is a highly enjoyable book. Ms. Howard is well known for creating funny and plucky heriones, and Daisy is no exception. What differentiates Daisy Minor from alot of her heroines is that once she's had a badly needed make-over, she is considered attractive, but still no &quot;ravishing beauty&quot; (doesn't that describe many of us out there?) When she discovers the &quot;joys&quot; of applying make-up I had to sit up and wipe my eyes I laughed so hard. I discovered make-up late in life too (when I was in my mid-twenties and not mid thirties, thank God!) and the kernel of truth in that scene may really be the whole ear of corn!!Jack Russo is the alpha-male that we love to love and buy Linda Howard books looking for. No way this guy ever heard of the color puce! He's an ex-SWAT team guy, police chief, and slightly GRAYING!!! (Nice to see mature men!!!) He isn't too domineering, though, and Daisy gets to win an argument involving a dog and the police station. The secondary characters are fleshed out enough for us to care about, and the gay or not-so-gay Todd gives the story a great drive (in both of his roles.)As for readability, I sucked this puppy down and finished it in the wee hours of the night following the day I bought it. The second day I reread it more slowly to pick up the subtleties. If you're thinking of buying this book solely on the strength of Linda Howard's name--go ahead, you won't be disappointed. If you've never read anything by Linda Howard I recommend buying it, and after you read it get your credit card handy. She has plenty more where this came from. : )"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I always enjoy Linda Howard's books and her latest offering is not a disappointment. It is also not her best or her least best book. I say least best because Ms Howard at her worst is better than many author's best.I liked Daisy and watching her transformation from dull to not dull was entertaining and true to life for many of us. I wish there had been more time spent developing the reader's connection to Jack. We get a glimpse of his life before he became a transplanted Yankee, but very little of his current life outside the realm of Daisy. We know what a typical evening would have been like for Daisy, but what does a transplanted Yankee do on his night off?The story is original and absorbing. This plot had a much darker feeling to me and ,for the first time, I felt like some of her villains were truly evil. The secondary characters are varied and colorful. I truly enjoyed the mauve vs. puce debate and I hope we meet Todd again. I would also like to know more about the original Buffalo Club.This book may not feel as seamless or have as much depth as some of her previous work, but I will definitely read it again."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This \\"novel\\" made me laugh out loud and I thought it was great. Lite reading, yes, enjoyable, yes. Not all \\"novels\\" need to draw you to the dark places. Sometimes a lighter story is just as good. I think people forget why they are reading, it is for enjoyment period. So to those who gripe, you need to get a grip and maybe select a different author."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Open Season by Linda Howard is one of my favorites books of all time. So funny. I have read it many times and never get tired of it."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This is the first of her books that I've been exposed to, but it won't be the last. I like mysteries (actually, I only indulge in audiobooks)and it's nice to finally find one that has a little 'spice' in it as well. If her other books are like this one, she's got a fan."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I liked Daisy and Jack. The storyline had potential but there was no suspense. I kept waiting for it, but there was none. It was a pretty straightforward book. No sudden twists or turns. The book was cute and the dialogue was funny. I was expecting a little more suspense. All in all, I did enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This had to be one of the funniest books by Linda Howard that I have ever read. If you have read this, you know what scenes I may mean, (flavored/colored condoms, puce...) and if you haven't read this yet you really have something to look forward to! This is a book that I re-read at least once a year. It never gets boring or too familiar for me.Daisy Minor is tired of her life. At thirty-four she is still living with her mom and her aunt, she is still a virgin and she still knows nothing about fashion or make-up! Now her Mom and her Aunt know that Daisy needs to find herself and enlists the help of what they think is a gay guy with very good taste. He has fabulous taste and soon Daisy has been transformed into a man catching babe. Meanwhile the newest /Chief of police has found himself intrigued by Daisy even before her makeover.To add interest and mystery to this story there is something horrible going on in this town. Women are being taken from Mexico thinking they are going to a new job so they can support their families. They aren't...they are being taken for nefarious purposes Who is involved? Well that's the scary part.Have fun reading or for me re-reading!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I have been a fan of Linda Howard books for a long time. I love this book. I read it in paperback and I am so glad they created the kindle version. It is funny and sweet with the right amount of intrigue. I hope they put more of her older books on kindle."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I can't believe the negative reviews on this. I loved ALL the characters. Loved the gent who helped Daisy's make-over. Loved the romance. LMAO at the colored condom scenes and at the mauve vs. puce color tests for homosexuality. This was a laugh-a-minute. How could anyone NOT like this book? I'm a recent fan of Ms. Howard's (recent being about 2 years) and I'm gradually finding and purchasing all her earlier books. I haven't yet read Dream Man so I can't compare this book to that one, as one reader did. For those of you who didn't care for it, may I suggest some popular male mystery writers. You won't have to worry about romance or hilarity with those."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This is my favorite Linda Howard novel; it has a little of everything--romance, suspense and humor, and it has it all in just the right amounts. Even though it's formula, the characters are real and quirky, and the suspense is there but will not keep you awake at night. I've kept this paperback to re-read over the years. Would love to have it on my Kindle for the same reason."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I love Linda Howard books and this is a fun filled and heart warming story about a woman who finally realizes that life is passing her by and decides to do something about it. Wonderful. I bought the audiobook, and unfortunately it was abridged. Since I had already read the book before listening to it on tape, I was disappointed. You just cannot truly enjoy this story in an abridged format."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Setting: Modern TimesDaisy Minor is a naive old fashioned southern gal who turns 34 yrs. old and gets a transformation from a mousy brunette to a fetchy blonde, attracting the alpha male cheif, Jack.Spoilers: One amusing moment is when Daisy buys a pack of condoms and learns that Jack is behind her. This is a sweet light love story. Not much danger at all to the heroine or hero.This book is a \\"MUST have\\" to add to your romance book collection."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Daisy Minor, a southern small town plain jane librarian, wakes up on her 34th birthday and decides she needs to get a life, get a man, and get laid. She makes herself over and hits the local club scene, unwittingly placing herself in the crosshairs of a date-rape drug using predator. There's a parallel story involving a dirty mayor, a sadistic wealthy local businessman, and innocent foreign women sold into a sex slave ring.Somehow all the ends don't tie together just right. I kept waiting for the suspense in this romantic suspense to kick in. It never did. I never felt Daisy was ever really in peril. I kept waiting for the characteristic Linda Howard heat between Daisy and Chief Jack Russo, but it never materialized. Sure, there are steamy sex scenes, but the build up of attraction and sexual tension just didn't happen. I began to wonder.... did Linda Howard even WRITE this story?Don't get me wrong. I am a DIE-HARD Linda Howard fan (I even loved Kill & Tell which many of her fans hated). But there was definitely something missing in Open Season. One really annoying thing I must mention... the puppy. Why in the world did Howard dedicate so many pages to that puppy??? While most folks seemed to enjoy this story, I keep looking for the Linda Howard who wrote Shades of Twilight, After the Night, Diamond Bay, Midnight Rainbow, and Touch of Fire (historical - my FAVORITE). Look for this one in the library. It isn't worth the [money] I paid for it (pb).Still a Howard fan, but wondering if I should remain so..."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I like Linda Howard and have read all her books but Open Season is bad. The book cover reads \`Seamlessly blending heart-pounding romance and breathless intrigue'. Seamlessly blending it was not. It took Ms. Howard twelve chapters to remember there was suppose to be some intrigue in this book. And calling it intrigue is really stretching it. The ending was also a disappointment. It's as though Linda Howard knew how bad the book was and just wanted to get is over with. There is no comparison between Mr. Perfect and Open Season. Mr. Perfect I recommend, Open Season - forget it."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Linda Howard's &quot;romantic suspense&quot; series is one of extremes: either it is very good (Son of the Morning, All the Queen's Men) or astoundingly bad (An Independent Wife, Dream Man). So it is sort of surprising to find a totally banal, mediocre story. Daisy Minor is a small-town Southern girl on the hunt for a husband. While at a local bar (drinking soda only, of course! No LH heroine drinks too much, smokes, is messy or a bad cook), she witnesses something she shouldn't. You can probably figure out the rest of the story... New &quot;Yankee&quot; police chief steps in to save her, and of course they fall in love and marry. There is absolutely nada in terms of suspense in this book - if you have more than three brain cells you know that Daisy and the chief will wind up together, and LH makes no attempt at all to make the &quot;suspense&quot; portion of the book a surprise. This book tries too hard to be too many things to too many different audiences. The semi-slapstick humor for Janet Evanovich fans - LH just doesn't have the sense of timing to pull this off without seeming contrived, although she's getting better. The prissy virginal heroine (who at age 34 doesn't know anything about makeup, despite growing up in the deep South????) meets big alpha male for the traditional romance fans. The small attempts at police procedurals for the mystery fans. Had this book concentrated more on any of these elements, it would have been more interesting. Bottom line: this is a screenplay for a chick flick summer movie. Nothing deep or compelling, but interesting enough to spend a few hours with."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this, but just couldn't help thinking it belonged as a [price] paperback instead of the hardcover treatment. Incredibly simple book, written on about a fourth grade level, no depth or realism to it. Also, it was incredibly short....large print, and just not worth the $."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Linda Howard's writing strength is strong, take charge women who take action when faced with adversity. Mr. Perfect was great, it made me laugh out loud and I even read parts of the novel to my husband (who definitely doesn't read romance) but he laughed too. She has written characters who move us quickly through the story and we really care about.In this character, I just couldn't care. She looked to others to solve her problems , someone to do her makeup, someone to answer her questions, and even her mother and Aunt told her it was about &quot;time&quot; she did something with herself. I felt the same way. She seemed out of her depth with clothes and just the simple &quot;girl&quot; things. It didn't seem like she even had close girlfriends even though she grew up in the town and had never left. I kept wondering if no one else cares why should I."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I&#65533;ve been utterly mislead by some ad and/or review in buying this book. I don&#65533;t know anything else by this author, but Open Season, in spite of Linda Howards skilful craftmanship as a writer, to me has been an absolute flop. As it is written in the back-cover, it defied me as a reader to put it down... but only because I was eager to find whether and whenever the story would become something close to a thriller, how and where I would eventually face the &#65533;blending heart-pounding romance and breathless intrigue&#65533; its back-cover is talking about. I found rather hard to believe that the author is a woman: to me the psychology of her main character is very like the caricature of feminine psychology that one would expect from a terribly outdated, oldfashioned man. Here and there depictions of petty details totally irrelevant to the story are dealt with for an unbelievable number of long paragraphs or even whole pages, that in fact I&#65533;ve skipped altogether. The best evidence are all the pages spent about Daisy&#65533;s pet - pages, moreover, full of the most obvious... common places concerning puppies. Finally, the quick evolution of the relationship between the two main characters from an... affair to a dedicated, everlasting, family growing love is simply ridiculous. My opinion is that this book is best epitomized by the following quotations: &#65533;She had a lover and a dog: could life get any better?&#65533; (p.196) to be matched later on by her mate statement: &#65533;...A naked woman and a fuzzy puppy: what more can a man want?...&#65533;"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Firstly, Linda Howard is my favorite romance writer. Secondly, I was very disapointed with this last book. There was no meat on the bones of the story, everything seemed rushed, almost like an outline was written then words were filled in to connect the dots. I noticed the same trend with Mr. Perfect. Although I liked that one better than Open Season. The characters were okay but not interesting enough or developed enough for me to care about the story. I only hope any future releases are more worth my money."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"When I picked up Linda Howard's new book, &quot;Open Season,&quot; I expected a novel full of suspense, humor, and romance. Unfortunately, it had little suspense, mediocre humor, and less-than-steamy romance.The first chapter begins with Daisy Minor waking up on her thirty-fourth birthday. She drags herself out of bed and looks in the mirror: she's living with her mom, has mousy looks, and has no prospective husband. So she decides to become a party girl. She cuts and dyes her hair, gets some new clothes, and starts going out to clubs. Everything is going good until she unknowingly witnesses a murder. Now people are out to kill her, and, Chief of Police, Jack Russo, is out to save her--and make her fall in love.There were a few laugh-out-loud moments in this book, but not nearly as many as Howard's last &quot;Mr. Perfect.&quot; There was little chemistry between Daisy and Jack, making for out-of-place romance scenes. The suspense was nonexistant; the reader knows what is going on from the beginning.If you are a tried and true Linda Howard fan, you may be disappointed with her latest; but if you want a fun read that requires no thought, check out &quot;Open Season.&quot;"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I was really hoping for a lot with Open Season. I loved Mr. Perfect. It was my first Linda Howard novel. Anyway, Open Season was not quite a Mr. Perfect, but it definitely wasn't An Independent Wife book. In other words, it didn't totally stink. I thought Daisy was a cute character and I did like Jack. The plot was good too. It is definitely worth a read. There were some cute scenes, like the condom part, which I thought was funny. Anyway, if you like Linda Howard, check it out."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"While I'm a huge Linda Howard fan and have all of her books, I was disappointed with Open Season. The story is unfocused and Howard has all of these tiny subplots that are never developed. For example, the ending has nothing to do with the two main characters; instead, it's another tiny subplot that's just sort of thrown in there. After finishing the book you're left with a feeling of confusion. If you are a Linda Howard fan I would say go ahead and buy the paperback, but it's not worth the money to buy it hardback."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This book is about a woman that thinks she is so plain. Her name is Daisy Minor and she is so boring. She just turned 34 and wants to spice up her life. She gets a make over and is totally sexy now. Her first time in a night was a blast until she got thrown out by Jack, chief police of the town. He is handsome for his age and is very annoying to Daisy. He loves bugging her and realizes that he wants her for himself.This book is also about a killer that uses the date rape drug to get women or teens. Daisy finds herself in the middle of things. I love this book. It is funny and very romantic. I really suggest it that you read this book. If it [wasn't very good], I wouldn't had recommended it to you.Please take your time and read this. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I am a BIG fan of Linda Howard's writing and I loved this book! I think this book is vintage Linda Howard, with moments where you literally laughed out loud to moments that tugged at your heart. I think most women will find a little bit of Daisy in themselves that they can relate to. Also in this book I think the hero, like all of the men in her books, was sexy. I will buy any book that has Linda Howards name on the cover, I haven't been sorry yet!!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Linda Howard does a great job showing both the innocence of Daisy, as well as the strength of her character. Jack makes a good contrast with his background as a SWAT team member. Looking at the relationship between the two, readers will laugh out loud at the way these characters interact. Howard's plot that Daisy unwittingly see's a murder without realizing it fits right in with her character. There are some extrememly funny moments when Daisy and Jack come together. However, while Howard does a good job with the characters and their interaction with each other, the development of the plot isn't as well done as her other novels and the climax was a little disappointing. Despite this, it was still a good novel, intertaining, and for Linda Howard lovers, I definately recommend the novel."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I already like Linda Howard, but with this book, there are some down right LOL moments (literally)--wait til the condom box scene. Hee! Yes, there is the romance aspect, but it's also a thriller and suspense. It will keep you on your toes and you'll fall in love with the main characters (including the main woman's aunt and mom). You won't regret getting this book. I listened to it on audio (I like audiobooks while I run or do weights) and the narrator is wonderful. You won't regret giving this book a chance. If you like this one, check out her Medina series."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Dacinda(Daisy) Ann Minor, a character who can only exist in a little southern town, is the archetypal small town spinster librarian. But this particular old fashioned, next thing to a virgin, wants to get married and have babies. On her thirty fourth birthday, she decides to do something about it, and that's where the fun starts. She gets a makeover, moves out of her mother's house, witnesses a murder (unintentionally), buys a puppy, and starts something up with the town's hunky sheriff, who is far from a \\"good\\" ole boy. Now the romance in this book is more of the slam-bam-thanks and lets get married-ma'am variety than a Grand Romance, and the action is very secondary. What drives this story forward is Daisy, and then eventually Jack, and how Daisy's evolution changes them both. This is a very fast paced book- everything takes place in less than a month, but it's definitely worth reading if you enjoy a character-driven plot and laughing."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I really like Linda Howard's books. You never know what you're going to get with each one. I missed this book when it first came out, so I thought I'd give it a try now as the mood struck :) This was a neatly (disregard a few typos and pre-Apple iPod techno speak) written romantic-suspense story. It was a very funny, cute and satisfying read. The hero and heroine were an oddly paired couple that worked out really great. I really enjoyed reading this book for it's light-heartedness and easy flow.***Possible Spoiler***I was expecting the suspense part to have a really exciting end(the buildup was definitely interesting), though. The players were all well thought out. But, in my opinion, I knew too much of what they were all thinking. The villains (all very bad people) in this piece over-analyzed everything and beat it down to the ground. And I read all of their thoughts, so nothing jumped out from left field that would get my heart racing, waiting for the climax. There was one mystery I'd have like solved (in another book maybe? Great! Now, I'd have to research that one...). The mystery of what happened to good ole gay/(not gay) Todd Lawrence's love. It sounded so tragic. His story needs telling. That was a loose end. Anyway, it was a bit lackluster as far as suspense went. But a GREAT romance story. I laughed alot and I now want to own a golden retriever puppy. It all ended as neat and tidy as you please. No big bang, so to speak. But, hey, I like stories that don't rip out my guts in an emotional roller coaster. I like that the story kept me laughing, snickering, and smiling all throughout. Even the sex scenes (note: party pak) were more giggle worthy than hot blushes. All-in-all...it was enough."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This book should have been published by Mills & Boon. Just a romantic supposed \\"thriller\\" that just doesn't quite make it. It did have some good parts but not enough to save it. Boring, boring and how anyone could give this five stars is beyond me."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Old-fashioned & drab 34yo librarian wants a makeover so she can attract a man to marry & have a family with. Her changed appearance attracts several men in the singles bar she goes to, including a serial rapist who drugs his would-be victims with GHB in their drinks. Fortunately, the new chief of police in their small town is often in the same places heroine is at & keeps rescuing her from mishaps around her. Hero makes his attraction to heroine known, which heroine is surprised to return given their tumultuous interactions. Their affair gives fodder for gossip as well as unknowingly protects heroine from danger.This was a funny & somewhat suspenseful Howard book. The writing was engaging, well-paced, & emotionally-involving. Dialogue was funny. Sexual chemistry & sex scenes were good. Heroine had a good combination of primness, naivete, inner strength, & passion. I liked that alpha-male Hero saw through heroine's drab appearance & was attracted to her fire & old-fashioned ways. One thing I didn't care too much for was how contrived the suspense element was pulled together towards the end. There were too many coincidences in such a short time period to be realistic.Recommended."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This is a book that you'll want to read again and again and again. I first read it many years ago. I had since lost my original copy, but still wanted to reread it. So I bought another copy. Linda Howard has several books that tell stories that are timeless this is one of them. Enjoy your read!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I just loved Open Season. I have read most of Linda Howards books and I adore pretty much all of them. But Open Season was a delight! I loved the character, Daisy Minor. I laughed throughout the whole book. Mind you, I don't usually go for the humorous books. In fact, I wasn't thrilled with Mr. Perfect. I found it too silly for my taste. However, Open Season was wonderful! I loved Daisy. I loved everything about her. Daisy's make over was so much fun to experience and you just couldn't help but falling in love with her personality.If you are looking for a good book and a very good time - try Open Season. I promise you won't be disappointed!Another very good one that I just finished from Linda Howard was Dying to Please. Order that too! These are two books that you just can't go wrong with.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"When I first picked up this book, I thought it would pack the same kick as some of Howard's others; boy was I disappointed. Although it was entertaining to see the machinations of small-town America, the two main characters were so clueless as to be from completely different books. I never got the sense they had much chemistry, and the way the main character went from not liking anything about the man to loving him seemed a little too far-fetched. The plot was also cliche, dating back past all of the thousands of reincarnations of the plot of Pygmalion. All in all, I'd suggest skipping this one and wait for the next Howard book."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Well, finally, I've read a Linda Howard book that doesn't make me squirm in (pick one of the following negative emotions); embarrassment for an impotent woman; indignation at the cold hearted nature of the hero; contempt at the insistence that sex should contain an element of pain for the woman; and anger at frequent sexual intimidation and humiliation. Can you tell I had a bag full of Howard books to read in an isolated cabin on Memorial Day Weekend? Well, of them all, Open Season was the only one that did not contain any of the above elements. It was fast paced and fun. Howard is not usually strong on character development (maybe she did it once for her first book, but then figued, why re-invent the wheel?), but you do have to like Daisy. She's bold, funny and strong in spite of the kind of naivete I usually find unforgivable. The hero is sexy and responds to Daisy's quirkiness in a funny way. All in all, it was very entertaining. That's not to say I won't approach Linda Howard with all caution in the future."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This book is a total disappointment. The synopsis on the book jacket was more interesting than the actual book. I have read a large number of Ms. Howard's books, and for the most part enjoyed them, but this book was a total snooze. This is one book that I wanted to return to the store after I had read only 10 pages, but I kept going hoping it would get better--it didn't. The book jacket implies that there is going be a great mystery and romance, you get neither one. If you still want to read this book, wait for the paperback, save yourself some money!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I was thoroughly dissapointed. This book failed to keep me engaged. The last book I read was Prey and was equally dissapointing but was slightly better than OP. I hope soon Ms Howard will dish out a mind blowing thriller romance as she had done in the past...this one really didn't possess her usual signature."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I picked up this book a couple of times before actually buying it. From the blurb on the back, I just wasn't all that interested. But as I had ran out of Howard books to read (recently begun buying them), I decided to buy it. Umm...I was a little disappointed. There is absolutely no suspense. The \\"suspense\\" factor is weak and kind of lame. If Howard's main focus was on Daisy and Jack, then she could have left the whole women smuggling factor out. But I guess she did need a reason for Jack and Daisy to be forced together. I guess the whole women smuggling plot is just sooo incredibly far-fetched and ill conceived in this book that it comes across as dumb. I'm sorry, but the whole book comes across as dumb. It's a nice quick read, but definitely not Howard's best."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This was a great read. The love scenes were really steamy!! It will get your blood pumping!!

This was one of those books I simply couldn't put down. Her characters are strong and well-defined, easy to relate to, and the story was fast-paced and interesting.

I loved it!The actual suspense part was ok- predictable but ok- but the relationship between Daisy and the sherrif! It was sooooo funny and her experiences made me reflect to my teenage years.If the remainder of her novels are this good- she has a new fan!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I expected a little more suspense and was surprised that this was a hardcover. \\"A Game of Chance\\" had more suspense and a better romance.

This book sits proudly on my keeper shelf and every once in a while I pull it down and read it all over again. And every time, I end up laughing as if it were my first time reading it. I love the sensuality. I love the humor. Daisy and Jack are so perfect together, I swear I can so easily see this couple walking down Main St. Holding hands, Daisy laughing while Jack whispers naughty suggestions in her ear. I feel like I know these two characters personally. Yeah, it's that good! Read it and see for yourself... I dare ya!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"After this story, I will take Linda Howard off my &quot;read&quot; list. This was truly a ridiculous story. Ugly ducking at age 34 turns into swan and falls in love. And along the way, there is a supposedly a mystery going on. Mr Perfect was quite good. Too bad this wasn't also."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I've enjoyed several of Linda Howard's previous efforts, but this one lacked the detail and mystery I'd come to expect. The premise of a women approaching 35 and spinsterhood wanting to let go of her inhibitions and find a mate was excellent. Her efforts to become someone new were comical. The ending fell flat. It seemed as if Howard just wanted to finish the book."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I think of Linda Howard's career as an inverted U curve because it seems to me that she has come way up, chugged along at a very high level of popular fiction for several years, only to fall in the last couple of years. Many of her books of the 1980's were unbearable: domineering male and female doormat who thinks his kind of tyranny and borderline abuse is evidence of love. Then Howard really hit her stride in the 1990's (roughly) with the Mackenzie series, romantic suspense such as Shades of Twilight, Kill and Tell, and Now You See Her, and the one-of-a-kind, fabulous Son of the Morning. Now she appears to be in something of a decline, with relatively weak romantic suspense such as Mr. Perfect and Open Season. (Even All the Queen's Men was unsatisfying: While I don't identify with a doormat, I find it equally hard to identify with a woman who wants to be a counterterrorism agent, living a life of deception and impermanence.) Open Season, while enjoyable because Ms. Howard is always a competent writer, lacks something. The romance and any conflict around it is brought to a somewhat premature conclusion, and the crime is solved with a whimper, not a bang. And one of the earlier reviewers is right: What's with the murdering sidekick and the abused wife? Has he had some sort of redemption offscreen that we never saw? Is she nuts?If you're new to Linda Howard, here's my recommendation: Read every one of Howard's books from the late 80's to the late 90's; you'll find several gems. And let's hope Howard hits those kinds of peaks again in the future."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Daisy Minor wakes up on the morning of her 34th birthday and realizes that she's had enough. Enough of being the small-town, plain-Jane librarian. Enough of living with her widowed Mom and spinster Aunt. Most of all she's had enough of her perpetually dateless, man-free existence. Her biological clock is ticking away like a time bomb and some changes are in order. With a little help in the hair, make-up and wardrobe departments, Daisy decides she's ready to make her mark on the singles scene...resulting in all sorts of mayhem. Good thing Police Chief Jack Russo is good at dealing with mayhem. Too bad Jack isn't Daisy's \\"type\\" - or could she be wrong about that?This book reminded me of why I started reading Contemporary Romance in the first place! Daisy and Jack have great chemistry and their scenes together sizzle with snappy dialogue that doesn't sound scripted. The story is tightly written and flows beautifully. There's a lot of humor and I found myself smiling through most of the book and actually laughing out loud in a few places.The author did insert a sub-plot involving young women and girls being smuggled into the States and forced to work in the sex trade. It felt a little out of place in this otherwise light and funny story and never quite reaches any believable level of suspense. I really enjoyed this book, but you might be disappointed if you are looking for a real Romantic Suspense read. Highly recommended if you want a well-written, sexy Contemporary Romance.Contains little (if any) strong language and a couple of sex scenes that fall in the mild/moderate range."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"With ten Linda Howard novels currently residing in my personal library, I guess I can officially consider myself a fan. As with many authors there are always some commonalities, especially in regards to the male/female dynamic. However, Linda Howard's major themes (romance, psychic/paranormal phenomena, spy/espionage, depraved serial killers) make her novels more varied overall. \\"Open Season\\" is one of my favorites. I love Daisy the librarian, and I am always a sucker for an ugly duckling story line. There is some very funny dialogue, and the reluctant attraction between Jack and Daisy is presented in a believable manner.\\"Dream Man\\" and \\"Kill and Tell\\" would round out my top 3 Linda Howard picks so far (plus \\"Almost Forever\\" if you like plain romance - no killings or paranormal activity). If I had to choose just one, I would probably still choose \\"Open Season\\"."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"What a fun, refreshing book! It's my second Linda Howard book, and in only two days. When something's good, you tend to get quickly addicted!I loved Daisy: her innocence, her transformation, and her intelligence. Police chief Jack Russo, who looks like he \\"eats rocks\\" is sexy, dedicated, raw, and relentless in his teasing pursuit of the wholesome Miss Daisy. And of course, I loved the condom scene and was literally laughing out loud.Daisy, in her naive state, witnesses a murder and becomes a target for a truly disturbed bucketful of sleazeballs. Jack is intelligent enough to sense the danger and goes out of his way to protect her from the evil while gently shoving his way into Daisy's heart.I have already noticed (and appreciate!) Linda Howard's tendency toward making her heroes/heroines slightly \\"less than perfect\\" in their looks and personalities. It makes them all the more credible and charming on the page, and you're even happier for them when they come out on top!Great, and at least a four-star read. My only complaint is that it was so good that I read it too fast! I gave an extra star to make up for the reviewer who rated the quality of Amazon's delivery service rather than the book...but this one almost deserves the full five anyway!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"On the morning of her thirty-fourth birthday, Daisy Minor resolves to turn a new leaf. Sick of being alone and never having been on a date for years, she decides that a new makeover is just what she needs. So after a complete \\"overhaul\\", she braves the night and walks into a club. Surprised and exhilarated by the attention she gets, she decides that it's definitely open season for finding a man. But when she unwittingly sees something and becomes the target of a murderer, she is left with no choice but to accept the protection of the one man she finds most infuriating - the local town's chief of police who is oh so sexy and very single.An ex-SWAT, Jack Russo knows how nave the mousy librarian turned party-girl is. At first, he thought he'd just keep an eye on her seeing as he was doing undercover work at the club she visits anyway. But as his attraction grows, he decides he'll just pursue her himself and this is when all hell breaks loose - in the most fun way!Jack and Daisy together are simply hysterical! The verbal spats and battle of wits are some of the funniest I've read. Daisy is such a charming heroine - nave in some ways, but utterly clever in some. Her desperate attempt to join the dating scene provides much amusement, and the way she tries to brush off Jack's attention is just delightful. And Jack knows exactly how to make her squirm (in the most amusing ways). I enjoyed how he teased her and the way Daisy let him get the better of her was fun to read. I tell you, sparks truly fly each time they meet. And I swear that you will never look at colored condoms in the same way after you've read this book. That scene was so well-depicted that I was laughing out loud.OPEN SEASON is my fourth Linda Howard book to date and I can't wait to read her others. I am surprised that this only averaged 3.5 stars, but since I have already read it, I wouldn't even bother reading the reviews. I must say though that I expected more mystery because of what was written on the back cover, therefore I was surprised to find myself laughing so much. But, hey, I'm not complaining. After all, what better way to spend a lazy afternoon than with a really enjoyable book with such fun characters?"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Daisy starts off being any prissy small town librarian, but when she looks in the mirror at the eternal frump she's about to become, things get a lot better fast. I liked that Daisy kept her good girl personality (without being a total stick in the mud) in her quest to liven up her life. I thought she was charming, though a bit old to come to her senses.There was a good balance between the relationship and the mystery, and the supporting characters were also great.All in all a very satisfying read."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Open Season - Linda Howard is one of my favorite authors. This story to me was a little different than her usual writing style. I found myself smiling and even laughing outright while reading the antics of Ms. Daisy Miner. This is a heroine you can't help but adore!Meet Ms. Daisy Miner, the librarian in a small town. She's in her late thirties, lives with her mom and aunt, dresses like an old maid, and is pretty much considered \\"on the shelf\\" in her mind and in the town's mind too. Daisy has finally decided that instead of giving up, she is going after what she wants, and what she wants is a man, and not just any man, but the marrying kind. Daisy is on the hunt for a husband! First Daisy has to figure out how to accomplish this. She realizes that first she needs to change her image, her \\"old fashioned\\" clothes are not going to cut it. With the advice of her mom and aunt, Daisy obtains the help of a friend who helps to whip her into shape in terms of her hair, makeup and clothes. Now, the hunt and the fun begins. Daisy decides that if you want to meet a man you have to go where the men will be, and that's the neighborhood bars and dance clubs. Now throw into this mix, tough ex city cop Chief Russo who is now the small time sheriff in this town. These two keep bumping into each other in town and the results are hilarious. All of Chief Russo's city experience has not prepared him for the small town innocence of Daisy. The dialogue is witty, and you can't help but fall in love with Daisy's innocence, and Chief Russo's interaction with her. I do not want to give this story away, but it truly is a cute fun novel that will keep you chuckling until the end. I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Loved it! This was my first LH book, and it got me hooked. She has a great ability to mix sharp action scenes with sweet, bantering romance. Daisy and Jack remain one of my favorite couples in print - he gets such a kick out of teasing the good-girl librarian and helping her find her sexy side. I can't tell you how many times I laughed out loud while reading it (especially during one scene involving a package of condoms and the nosy people at the small town pharmacy). Classic! The thriller as aspects of the story are pretty intense, but I think they balance with the heartwarming romance of Jack and Daisy. Definitely worth buying - I've reread it several times."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I agree with the comparisons that fans might make between \\"Open Season\\" and \\"Mr. Perfect\\" or the Blair books - there's obviously a lot of great chemistry, great bantering, and a lot of action from a crazed assassin. I'm not usually a fan of a suspense-romance that spends whole chapters in the mind of the villain (I like a little suspense with my romance, not the other way around,thank you very much), but I felt like this story balanced it out pretty well. The chapters with the villain only serve to explain the plot and build suspense, and the chapters with the protagonists are simply delicious and delightful and make up for any unpleasantness.I truly loved Daisy and her innocent and spunky nature, and I love how Jack gets such a kick out of her. All the scenes where Jack is trying to undermine her senses are so fun and sexy, and they lead to a very believable connection. The fun they have together really balances the darkness of the other aspects of the plot.This was one of the first Linda Howard books I ever read, and it's definitely the one that got me hooked! I can't count how many times I've reread Daisy and Jack's scenes. They ALWAYS make me laugh, smile, and cheer for them."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I like most Linda Howard books, but I enjoyed this one even more than most. It has fun characters and a lively plot, nothing heavy or dramatic. It is a fun, easy read. The cover looks a bit more intense than the story line calls for.For those who have read the LH books about Blair Mallory, you will probably like this book too. It has the same fun attitude. However, this lead character is the anti-Blair, very different from Blair. So if you hated the Blair character, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"There were a few times I was hysterical with laughter at the way the prim librarian interacted with the macho police chief. I definitely recommend it as an enjoyable romance novel. Story brief: Daisy the small town librarian is 34 and still lives with her mother. She decides to get a makeover, new hair and new clothes and to start going to night clubs. Her goal is to get married and have babies. The police chief Jack goes to clubs to watch for bad guys putting date rape drugs in girls' drinks. Daisy unknowingly interacts with bad guys. She ends up being a target. Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: six. Setting: 1990s Hillsboro, Alabama. Copyright: 2001. Genre: contemporary romance with suspense."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I have been a fan of Linda Howard for a long time, even way back during her Silhouette novel years. Open Season is one of the funniest. I highly recommend all her novels. Suspenseful and very romantic."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Ok, I admit it, although I come off as intellectual and high brow, I read popular fiction and trashy books every once in a while. Just don't tell my peers, ok? Ha ha ha ... I picked this up sometime during my neverending quest for entertainment during the workday, as I had joined the Books On Tape revolution 10 years ago with my first office job. This was a good story, albiet a little unbelievable.Daisy Minor wakes up on the morning of her 34th birthday in a fit of depression. She's a small town, startchy old maid librarian, who lives with her elderly widowed mother and aunt, and she's not getting any younger. She decides that she wants to find a man, get married and have babies before it's too late. Thanks to her mother, aunt, and sassy gay man friend, she makes herself over and starts hitting the scene looking for a man. Unknown to her, the new chief of police, Jack, who likes coming in and razzing her at every turn, has his eyes on her for more than just a sparring partner. And since their first meeting they can't stand each other, they will inevitably get together and live happily ever after.Daisy's bumbling antics are along the lines of Bridget Jones and Cathy from the comics, happily attempting new things, sometimes stepping in one disaster after another, and drowning in one neurosis after another. It speaks to all of us, trying to put on a brave face and trying to be one of the crowd when we're really scared to death. So Daisy has mass appeal, we're rooting for the underdog a la Cinderella.Why not 5 stars? There is a backstory under this one which is a little unbelievable, and they worked a little too hard to interlock her with the seemy underbelly of their small town. Even in small towns, date rape drugs are no doubt a problem. But an underground sex trade railroad? It happens, but I would be more apt to believe something like that would be through the bigger cities. Then again, if they're doing it right they're trafficing them through the smaller towns and law enforcement never finds them. There is a little twist, as the sassy gay man friend is actually a federal agent deep undercover. And Daisy sees something she shouldn't have in the parking lot of a bar and that's how she gets connected to the sex trade ring. It's a little unbelievable, but that's ok. It's light entertainment not heavy epics."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This is one of my favorite books. The story of a librarian frump who makes the choice to change her image and in doing so catches the man mixed with some mystery and adventure plus Howard's sense of humor makes for a great story!!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I liked this short, easy story by Linda Howard. Thirty-four year old, librarian, Daisy is on the hunt for a husband and has decided that she will make changes in her appearance and personal life to make sure that she accomplishes her goal. With friends and loved ones lending a helping hand, she has decided to start going to clubs to meet people. From the beginning, we see Chief Jack Russo (a big time city cop, who has semi-retired and become the Chief of Police in this small town) bully his way into Daisy's life and heart. And for a minute, Daisy did reminded me a lot of Blair in \\"Drop Dead Gorgeous\\", because she seems to be adding up Chief Russo's transgressions on a long list to be used against him at a later date. Anyway, while Daisy attempts to navigate the dating scene she sees something she shouldn't, and although she doesn't realize it, someone else does. However,it is my opinion that romance is secondary to the plot in the story. The other storyline is more interesting and creative. I won't tell you the plot, I will only tell you that for a small town a lot is going on. Corruption, human trafficking, undercover agents, drugs (GHB), and a list of other crimes that make this small town seem like the big city.The criticisms that I have about this story is simple, some of the storylines were not developed. Although we saw the romance bloom between Daisy and Jack, her fire dies down midway through and is overshadowed by other people. There were also other characters, like Todd or the Mayor's wife, who could have been enhanced. But I guess for a short, fast paced novel (although some considered it from the reviews slow in the beginning)you can't strengthen each storyline, and as long as the integrity of the story remains strong, it is ok."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I laughed and grinned all the way through. These two will stay with me for a long while."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"*Stands and applaudes* Excellent book by Linda Howard. She brings together steamy romance and mystery once again in this funny book. Daisy is a caracter than most women about 30 can relate to. Her transformation, although awkward also gives cause for laughter. It also brings to light a real problem we are facing in this country; date-rape drugs and smuggling of young women into the country to be sold. This book is an excellent read, and I had a hard time putting it down; it ranks right up there with \\"To Die For\\". Way to go Linda!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I loved this book. I thought it was hilarious. I love all of Linda Howard's books. She is awesome. But was anyone as confused about the last couple of pages as I was? Where did that come from?

I could not force myself to go beyond 80 pages before I threw it against the wall...pure drivel. At times the dialog was so corny and silly I squirmed. This was my first Linda Howard book and my last. I am truly amazed that someone actually published this."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This book is a total disappointment. The synopsis on the book jacket was more interesting than the actual book. I have read a large number of Ms. Howard's books, and for the most part enjoyed them, but this book was a total snooze. This is one book that I wanted to return to the store after I had read only 10 pages, but I kept going hoping it would get better--it didn't. The book jacket implies that there is going be a great mystery and romance, you get neither one. If you still want to read this book, wait for the paperback, save yourself some money!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Definitely worth the hardback cover price. Jack was a delight, teasing his lady love with a quip or jibe meant to bring a blush or flustered reply. Despite the danger, this is a humorous book. Doesn't every woman want to find a man who loved her for herself before her makeover? And the key questions to test a man's sexual preference was hilarious!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I have read almost all of Linda Howard's books and have found them to be quite enjoyable--with the exception of this one! The book jacket implies that there is a great mystery and romance in the book--you get no mystery and a mediocre romance. You know who did what after the first chapter. Take my advice and avoid this book!!! If you choose to ignore my advice wait until the book comes out in paperback and save the money!!!!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I'm a fan of Linda Howard, and I loved Mr. Perfect and After the Night. After reading the summary for this book, I expected it to be good, but I found the story slow and the main character boring.

I enjoy the books that revolve around the hero being a cop the most. she is able to write them to a degree you feel you know them. In her last few books they seem to revolve less around a love story or romance and more around a mystry but she is such a gifted writer that they are never boring or dry. this book like 99% of her other books was a page turner for me."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"After reading &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot; not to long ago, I was alittle disappointed in &quot;Open Season&quot;. This book could have been better, I thought the plot was alittle shallow and kind of silly. The romance between Daisy and the town Sheriff keeps you laughing and the love scenes are well....I won't go there! If Ms. Howard would have stayed with the girl in the first chapter of the book, this would have been a much better book, I was very interested in her story more than Daisy's.

I was not sure that she could top Mr. Perfect, but Open Season is laugh-out-loud funny. I sat down after dinner and did not stop until I was done in the wee hours of the morning.

Thank-you, Ms. Howard for a wonderful summer read. It's good to have you back in control of your writing."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Linda Howard manages to sandwich laughs into a fairly good mystery and a great romance. The fun is in how Daisy, the plain librarian, turns into a Southern femme-fatale. I'm not sure the &quot;mauve-puce&quot; test would even be beleivable in the rural South but it is a funny bit. Her thinking process, like most of Howard's heroines, is a bit convoluted, but at least she has logical (to her) reasons for doing things to move the plot along. The hero is interesting and there is fairly fun bit about a box of condoms. There is some question about which peolpe are the bad guys, two groups or only one, but the end does not involve the heroine getting in trouble by doing excatly what everyone has told her not to do! If you like Howard's &quot;Dream Lover&quot; or &quot;And Now You See Her&quot;, you'll like this one."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I was expecting, like other readers, more suspense, violence, gorry details. What I got was a good love story with a slight detective angle to it. I put this book on the list of one of my favorites because I like to see relationships grow, know more of the characters and less blow by blow violence. Daisy and Jack are good together, as are all of the secondary players in the book. Sleepy little town, nothing changes, then the main characters take over and wham! A very good read and I recommend to all."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This is a very nice book to settle down with. Although not as entertaining as Mr. Perfect, Open Season does offer the spicy romance that is Linda Howard's signature. Open season also introduces some characters that we will probably be seeing again, like Todd and Howard. Overall, Open Season is a romance book with a little twist."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I can't believe this is the same author who wrote \\"Son of the Morning\\", Kill and Tell\\" and \\"Heart of Fire\\". I wish she had spent less time with the make-up tips and gone more deeply into some of the other charcters (especially Todd, Sykes and Jennifer). Do not waste your money on this."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This story is a very typical &quot;makeover and get the guy&quot; romance. The characters I could have really cared less about and the author spends more time talking about shopping sprees and interior decorating than she does on who these people really are. I was expecting more from Howard, but didn't get it. I recommend this book if you have nothing else left on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Couldn't put it down. Well written with suspense, humor and love. Some places I lauged till I cried. Big thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Linda Howard books are always great. I read them all. This is one of the best."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Despite a few moments that were honest-to-god funny or entertaining, overall the suspense aspect of the plot was horribly lame. Not to mention I hate the plot line of makeover makes an otherwise spinster into a beautiful, confident woman.. please spare, me! Like i've said with other books by Linda Howard, this seems to be nowhere in the league of her better books. I will give her that the book has some good parts, but overall I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"In the past few years - since I purchased this book in 2005, really, Linda Howard's writing has become increasingly stilted and action-driven, rather than character driven. This book was the first of her more recent titles that I took issue with.The premise of this book has been compared to LH's Dream Man, but there are quite a few differences. The story begins with Daisy Minor, 34-year-old spinster librarian who lives with her aunt and mother in small-town Alabama. On her 34th birthday, Daisy decides that she needs to change her life so she can get married and have children. She changes her hair, learns how to apply makeup and dress properly, and begins going out to bars. One obstacle, however, is Police Chief Jack Russo - a man who is not her type, but one she can't ignore. He's brash, arrogant, commanding and - gasp! - a Yankee. As Jack becomes involved in a case from a nearby town regarding date rape drugs, he also becomes involved in Daisy's life. The two parts of his life inevitably become intertwined.First of all, this is an okay book, not nearly as bad as LH's recent stuff, but there is very little interaction between Jack and Daisy that explains just why they fell in love with each other. And I really hate the fact that Daisy had to change her whole look before Jack pursued her, even though it is mentioned at one part that he was knocked out by her smile even before she changed herself. Had they had some type of relationship, even if it was adversarial prior to her transformation, then maybe I could have bought that, but all in all it seemed a cover-up. Also, how in the world in the 21st century is a 34-year old woman so naive? In certain cases, Daisy almost fell into the dreaded trap of being TSTL (too stupid to live).All in all, not a bad read, but certainly not at the top of the list in Ms. Howard's backlist."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"i love this book. it ranks as one of my favorite linda howards. too bad she doesn't write a book like this anymore."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Another winner from Ms. Howard! Hilarious outlook on a woman turned 34 and living with her mother and aunt with no life. I was in tears reading this gem. Funny, funny, funny is about what sums this up! Right on caliber with her infamous novel 'Mr. Perfect', the right mix of humor, tension and romance to make this one another favorite for me...It's not much of a thriller like her others, but what it lacks in suspense, it more than makes up for in pure humor and romance. Although, I don't think Ms. Howard intended it to be suspenseful anyway.Daisy Minor just woke up on her 34th birthday with an epiphany. She needs a man. Living with her mother and aunt for her entire life didn't leave her much in the romance department. She was going to change this...and a whole lot more, given the right little touches of course. Like a new wardrobe...how about some flattering makeup for starters? Maybe she'd even go as far as turning her mousy plain brown hair into something sexy? Would this attract a man? She needed to go one step farther...barhopping...yup, that'll do it. Not to mention she'd NEVER stepped foot into one, but she was about to change all that...it was open season on manhunting...the only thing she doesn't expect is to be caught up in some murder she'd unwittingly witnessed. Why couldn't she just have a normal life?Chief of Police Jack Russo just wanted some relaxing work after transfering from SWAT in NYPD to this tiny town that more resembled Mayberry in Alabama when some uptight spinster librarian decides to go off the deep end suddenly and change her life by barhopping and dancing with rowdy guys.He does not need to complications derived from this. Now the niave woman has witnessed a murder and someone wants her dead! Sworn to protect and serve, Jack takes on the job, but lets the old fashioned Miss Priss gone Mayberry Lolita know where he stands...at least he tries to.Hysterical and so much fun, this one is a sure keeper! Daisy will have you in tears! She is so much fun and so different that the usual heroine, that I wish I knew her personally. The things she does and gets into will make you laugh for days!Jack was equally as much fun and thinks its funny to push her buttons and make her blush. Tons of witty dialog and many sexy moments, this is a winner!!! Keep up the wonderful work Ms Howard!Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I nearly threw the book in frustration if I read the word &quot;Goodness!&quot; one more time. I dont know whats going on with Ms Howard, what happened to the standard she set in books like &quot;After the Night&quot;, &quot;Shade of Twilight&quot; and &quot;Heart of Fire&quot;? It seems as if her books lately are being written so fast that she glosses over the great character development that is usual to her style of writing. However it was an o.k. book so thats why I gave it 3 stars, but if Ms Howard doesnt produce better soon then Im afraid I wont bother buying her again."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I'm a fairly avid reader and really enjoy books by Jennifer Crusie and Susan Andersen. I thought this book was going to be along the same lines. While it had some occasional humor and mildly steamy scenes, overall it lacked suspense, had several underdeveloped characters and a completely boring ending. I kept waiting for a big climax, but it never happened. This is my first Susan Howard - I may try Mr. Perfect since the reviews seem better, but if that doesn't live up to my other favorites, then good-bye Linda Howard."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"On the morning of her thirty-fourth birthday, Daisy Minor decided to face reality. She was bored and her life was boring. She was a plain, small-town librarian who hadn't been on a date in years. She still lived with her mother and aunt, both widowed. Her closet was filled with plain and unattractive clothes. Most of her friends were married with families and Daisy always wanted a husband and children. She would never achieve this goal if she didn't make some major changes. So with the help of a friend, she commits to a complete makeover, looks for an apartment and decides to go &quot;man-hunting&quot;. She encounters one problem though and his name is Jack Russo. He isn't her type but he shows up everywhere she does! Jack Russo held his position as Chief of Police in Hillsboro, Alabama for the past three years. Recently divorced and tired of the stress caused by his SWAT team job with the NYPD, he decided to move to Hillsboro after his great-aunt Bessie passed away and willed Jack her old Victorian home. Jack spent many summers as a child with Aunt Bessie and he was delighted to have the opportunity to live and work in Hillsboro. He loved the area and was always in a good mood when he left the town's library. Librarian Daisy Minor was a lot of fun. When he sparred with her, she didn't back down. In that respect, she reminded him of his Aunt Bessie. Daisy was mousy and plain but she had a great smile and beautiful skin and if she ever let her hair down he knew she would be dynamite. Jack liked Daisy and when her life was threatened, he pulled out all the stops to protect her. Little did he know at the time he was falling in love with her. Once again Linda Howard has written a novel containing just the right mix of romance/comedy/suspense. Jack, of course, is another of Linda's alpha-male characters and Daisy is the perfect match for him. She is intelligent and sassy and a bit naive. Her naivety in this story works well because it provides the source for many hilarious scenes. The relationship between Jack and Daisy is modern and intimately sizzles. On a more serious note, the author provides some invaluable information about date-rape drugs. I thoroughly enjoyed Linda's &quot;Open Season&quot; and I suspect she may have plans for a sequel since there seemed to be a few loose ends."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"While Open Season may not have been as suspensful as some of her other books, I found it a pleasant change. The conversant between Jack and Daisy about the colors mauve and puce was hillarious. Also the bits about Daisy learning to apply makeup and dress sexy were funny, any woman should be able to see the humor. I agree that the ending was anti-climactic,however I saw nothing wrong with Sykes taking up with the Jennifer. I read alot of mystery and suspense and perfer strong women in the stories, Howards women are always strong and her men always men you'd want to meet."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I'm a Linda Howard buff and liked the book. It's full of her sense of humor, romance, good guy wins, as well as good story line. I had no idea how necessary it was to address the &quot;date rape drug&quot; and I'm glad it was Linda Howard to do it. WE ALL, men &amp; women, need to take heed. I got quite an education. Thanks Ms. Howard."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Linda Howard can write five star books, but this is not one of them. Did you ever get the feeling that an author was killing time? Howard does in Open Season. I agree with the reviewers who said that this should have been a paperback. I want to like Linda Howard's books, but I will never again buy one of her hardbound books without looking it over very carefully first."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Daisy Minor is tenacious to change her monotonous life and it's long time she decides to revamp with a makeover at an age of 34. She dresses up, goes to the Baffalo Club to attract amorous offers and invites... murder. Stumbling upon a murder, she becomes the prime target of local mayor Temple Nolan, who went on a foiled plan to silence Mitchell after his mistake in drugging a girl to death, is afraid that his syndicate will be exposed. His reputation will be shattered. But as always, there is a protector - and it manifests in the form of Chief Jack Russo, who with his protective instincts, makes Daisy feel secured. Love comes crashing on both of them in the midst of the arguments and sexy seductions.OPEN SEASON as Linda Howard's eagerly-anticpated vehicle this year pales in comparison to her previous efforts (Mr. Perfect and ALL THE QUEEN'S MEN). No doubt she is one author who fuses sensuality and laughter in her antics on sexuality and the couple Jack and Daisy is one hot sizzling match. She brings in her contemporary novels with relevance to the society's problems like date rapes but without much insight. Daisy's transformation is indeed a parody and shrieking delight - the condom incident and scandal is a hoot and Jack is as usual a wry hero with strong sexual urges.OPEN SEASON opens well but ended in a rush hour with a disappointing 300 pages. The suspense builds up and surprises after it enlightens on Todd's identity but enervates when all is revealed - with the rest all predictible and fast-forwarded. The story doesn't have a mystery element to bolster as in Mr. Perfect, and it loses its appeal with an anti-climax and simple storyline. All I can say is after her boisterous Mr. Perfect, OPEN SEASON seems like mild Miss Congeniality in comparison."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Linda Howard is a master at putting pen to paper. In my book, she is right up there with Nora Roberts and Judith McNaught as one of those authors whose books you rush right out and buy the book, sigh unseen. I did enjoy Open Season, it was cute and as is always the case with Linda Howard, very [....] Daisy and Jack as the two main characters were good characters. But the \\"grey\\" characters such as Sykes, Todd and even Jennifer, the mayor's wife, were more interesting. The problem with this book (and that is why it is only 3 stars rather than 5) is the fact that nothing and no one is delved into deeply. This book would have been great as say, a Silhouette Special Edition, because you don't really expect deep characters in those books (although I will point out that Linda Howard's exceptional Mackenzie's Mountain which was a Silhouette has some of the most wonderfully defined characters in any book ever written).I would have liked a deeper exploration of Daisy and Jack's relationship. I would have liked to have seen more of the home life of the Mayor and Jennifer to see why their marriage deteriorated so. I would have liked to know more about Sykes' background. And of course, I would have liked to have gotten in Todd's head a bit more. Linda Howard has created the beginnings of some great characters in these people, yet we never really get to see them. They become pieces moved about for the purpose of the plot too much.This was a cute, fluffy book and it would have been so much more interesting and satisfying if it had a little bit more meat to it."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"My copy of this book arrived yesterday and I finished it late last night. I haven't had this much fun reading in a long time. While I have always liked Linda's books (especially the MacKenzie's - I was so sorry that series ended!)but this one was very special. The characters reached out and grabbed you right away (will Todd be in the next book?)and again, the humor was wonderful. If you read Janet Evanovich, I'm sure you'll like this book.My only complaint is now that I've finished this book I have to wait a long time before the next one comes out!Many thanks for a great book Linda. This one is a keeper that I will reread many times. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I have read all of Ms. Howard's books and this is one of her best. She combines humor, romance, and mystery and I read this book over a weeekend. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I loved this book.. so much so I read it in one sitting.. unable to put down. The story was humerous in places Daisy's effort at becoming a new woman were really very funny together with the Sheriff who decides he wants her. The suspense part of the book was very good and some parts made me sick.. the Exploitation of young girls from other countries and what was intended for them.. prostitution rape violation..I laughed at the funny antics had tears in my eyes in some places and felt sick in other.. I found it a very compelling read... and I for one recon this will be yet another long line of BEST SELLERS for Linda. Thank you for several hours of great entertainment."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I read this novel as a lovely modern-day homage to L. M.. Montgomery's &#34;The Blue Castle&#34;. The heroine wakes up on her thirtieth birthday and realises that she has become a strereotypical old maid. She decides to make changes which lead to mirth, romance and danger. This is a lovely story and Daisy Minor is just one of the funniest most likable characters in any modern romance. Her romantic interest is the local police chief and the combination of the two characters is equally sweet and funny. One of the things that I love about Linda Howard is her versatility. This is like none of her other books, and yet it bears the hallmarks of her writing, suspenseful plot, exciting romance and hot, tasteful sex scenes."},{"Title":"All-American Car-i-oke","review":"bought this book because my grandchildren and I enjoy singing together. we weren't in a car; we were in my house. we sang all of the songs and had a rollicking good time. it was all very jolly; buy it!"},{"Title":"All-American Car-i-oke","review":"I road tested this item with my three children on a long car ride a couple of years ago. It was a huge hit with my family, so I highly recommend it at my website [...]. Even after two years, we still use it frequently on trips, so it has given us more than our money's worth.It comes with a CD for the music and several extra copies of the lyrics in smaller booklets for everyone in the car (no fighting!). The CD does a great job of giving \\"musical cues\\" when you are supposed to start singing, and there is such a variety that there is sure to be something that everyone will like - including the adults!One of our favorites is the \\"make your own blues\\" song. My kids loved making up their own lines for that song in addition to the suggested lyrics. They also really love \\"Big Rock Candy Mountain\\" which was full of hilarious kid humor. The backseat drumming is also very popular. One thing we also love to do with this is to practice singing the Star Spangled Banner together. It can be a hard song to sing sometimes, but my kids are now pros and can belt out our National Anthem with pride.We never go on a road trip without this item. I'll be buying the Christmas version of this next."},{"Title":"All-American Car-i-oke","review":"I wasn't sure how this would go over with my 7 and 9 year old girls, but we had a lot of fun with it on a l-o-n-g car ride home from vacation this summer.

It isn't \\"kiddie\\" music, so it's entertaining for the adults, as well. Several extra copies of the lyrics mean you can lose one without harm. The cover and binding are durable, to put up with the abuses of living in a family vehicle. I'm looking at the holiday version next."},{"Title":"All-American Car-i-oke","review":"The songs weren't as up beat as I expected them to be and no one really got into the singing along part.

Although they joked at first...they have requested that I keep it handy for our next trip. Thanks Car-i-oke!"},{"Title":"All-American Car-i-oke","review":"A long roadtrip can be hard on kids no matter what they're ages. This had something for everyone. We sang along to some classic songs that most of us had forgotten the words to. Whenever we were going thru somewhere we couldn't pick up a station we used this. Also it came with extra books so noone had to share."},{"Title":"All-American Car-i-oke","review":"This was a great idea and I bought it for a road trip with the kids last summer. We enjoyed parts of it. But most of it, unless you know every single song by heart, is hard to follow. It would be nice to have the singers singing back up through more of the songs, or at least have better intrances cues. I am fairly comfortable with music and singing with my kids, but I have never learned 'Cielita Linda' well enough to sing it with only the words.All in all, not worth the money for me, though my kids do love the drum solo song where all they have to do is bang on stuff to a cool beat."},{"Title":"Customs & Etiquette of India (Simple Guides Customs & Etiquette)","review":"... but does not contain enough detail to be truly useful to someone getting ready to travel to India. About half the book is taken up with geography and history information that is readily available in other sources.

This book is probably best suited for armchair travelers."},{"Title":"Customs & Etiquette of India (Simple Guides Customs & Etiquette)","review":"This book left me more confused than when I started. It makes very broad statements about things that may or may not be offensive without taking region or class into account.

We get the story of The Old Man. He is the gangster and bootlegger who started out dirt poor on the banks of the Ohio River and left home for adventure and fortune. He settles in New Orleans and builds an empire.He has 2 daughters- one the perfect debutante, one a hell-raiser.He marries his eldest daughter the man of his choice- a man in his image- a poor Cajun he has mentored in his business to suceed him.Looking over everyone and caring for the Old Man is his black butler who sees all and makes sure things go the way the Old Man wants. Seeing and listening and never getting in the way.From the beginning to the end this story of the 20th century is fascinating. Far better written than the other sagas of the time yet every bit as compelling as the Harold Robbins and Taylor Caldwell potboilers that were so popular in the 60s and 70s.The Condor Passes is great entertainment- not one to be missed!"},{"Title":"The Condor Passes","review":"The Condor Passes is the epic saga of a wealthy but troubled Louisiana family. In it, the lives of key family members are laid bare as the years and decades go by.Ninety-five year old Thomas Henry Oliver is the patriarch of the clan. Known simply as Oliver or, at times, The Old Man, he manages to overcome his hardscrabble origins in rural Ohio to accrue great wealth in the New Orleans of the early 20th century. With little formal education, Oliver achieves remarkable success in business seemingly through sheer willpower and a dogged brand of toughness.Oliver's two daughters Anna and Margaret both display a sense of entitlement when it comes to their father's money. But in other aspects of their lives they couldn't be more different. Anna believes in the importance of hearth and home and later on in the book becomes hyper-religous in very disturbing ways. Margaret is wild and promiscuous, seemingly incapable of bringing focus to her own life.The fourth of the major characters in The Condor Passes is Robert Caillet, a poor Cajun youth Oliver takes on as his protege. He eventually marries Anna and thereby becomes Oliver's heir apparent. Quite pathetically, Robert's personal life becomes defined by his insatiable need for sexual encounters with many women.The Condor Passes is a 4 star effort. There's much to enjoy in this powerful tale of one family's triumphs and tragedies. A provocative, engaging read."},{"Title":"The Condor Passes","review":"The Condor Passes...The ruthless accumulation, the spending, and the ultimate disposition of a great New Orleans fortune furnish the motive force in Grau's huge, brilliant novel of three American generations whose lives are caught up in and shaped by the currents of money and power."},{"Title":"The Condor Passes","review":"I found this book lacking the historic sweep and richness of Ms. Grau's Keepers of the House - which completely took me in - though it certainly sweeps the downside of some rich New Orleans characters' lives! I never was invested in what happened to the characters, except for the child. Beautifully written, but not going on my list of favorites.I will be reading some of this author's other works, with expectations still high."},{"Title":"Herding Dogs: Progressive Training (Howell Reference Books)","review":"This book covers the basics of herding. It presents the concepts clearly and provides some good trouble shooting sections. The diagrams could be improved and I could do without the cartoons. They were very hard to understand. The author obviously knows herding dogs and conveys very well what it takes to make a good &quot;working&quot; dog. I would recommend this book for anyone who is beginning to work a herding dog or who is considering purchasing a Border collie."},{"Title":"Herding Dogs: Progressive Training (Howell Reference Books)","review":"Was a good book, if your into border collies and sheep trials. They make the book out to be a manual for all types of herding. All it really told about was sheep herding and told little about working cattle, and the author compared everything to border collies."},{"Title":"Herding Dogs: Progressive Training (Howell Reference Books)","review":"An excellent job of detailing often complicated and difficult scenarios encountered when training. I have purchased several copies to give novice handlers for a good introduction to the world of livestock and herding. I reference the book repeatedly for tips on problem solving.

Different types of dogs and their approach to stock are beeing mentioned which is very helpfull to make your own trainingprogram. Text is explained by funny pictures and photographs. A special chapter is dedicated to the specific problems you can experience during your program and clear solutions in excercises are given. This book is a great help in reaching your goal: Work the stock with your dog!"},{"Title":"Herding Dogs: Progressive Training (Howell Reference Books)","review":"The author obviously loves Borders..and so do I. There is a bias in the book toward explaining Borders (over other breeds) but there is also worthwhile knowledge that other herder owners can learn from. In short \\"learn from your dog\\" and adapt is the primary message. What \\"makes a dog stress out and react\\" positively or negatively is worthwhile reading. In the end it is about the dog and training the handler.The cartoons are sweet and make it fun for my grandkids to understand why I do these crazy things and why they should too! Still...this is a book not written for 10 year olds...it is written for me to get in the mind of my herder so we can both get the job done, intelligently and calmly and not stress out my sheep....and with as little help from me as possible!A worthwhile book on my shelf and one I will refer to again and again."},{"Title":"Herding Dogs: Progressive Training (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I first read this book when my first Aussie was about three months old. Frankly, I did not get it. I think it is difficult for the average person to learn how to work with a herding dog. Vergil Holland has not only put down all of the steps one might need to become successful at this activity, he has a lot of great advice in the book including very useful exercises and as the subtitle suggests, a progressive training method.However, the reason I did not get it when I first read the book was that the meaning of much of what he says is dependent on having the actual experience of herding. After many years of training stock dogs, I went back and re-read this book. It was very revealing in that I found myself agreeing with almost everything he said about training. I also found it helpful to get a clear picture of exactly what I wanted to do in a training session to read the portion of the book-- usually fewer than two pages at a time-- that was relevant to what I wanted to acheive in the session. So for me, this has become a valuable hands on training tool.I still recommend it to beginners and I think it would really help anyone getting ready for their first exposure to stock to have read the preliminary sections on getting started and basic commands. It would help the beginner become familiar with common training techniques and concepts so that a clinic experience would be more valuable than going in without the insights that are offered in this book.But this is not just a book for beginners. It can be useful at several levels. For the more experienced trainer/handler, the troubleshooting section provides very useful exercises for solving common problems that are likely to be encountered.I do think the section on herding breeds is a bit simplistic and in the case of Aussies not really accurate. But I think it is only there as a summary of what one might expect from herding breeds and therefore does not take into account the variance of different lines within a breed. I would not recommend the traits listed in this chapter to select your dog. However it does contain some very good advice such as basing your decision in part on the parents' abilities and characteristics.The diagrams could be improved as was mentioned elsewhere, but they are accurate. The pictures are not very clear and they could be improved to actually demonstrate better the points they are intended to make.Overall I give this book high marks and recommend it to anyone who is building up a stockdog library. But remember that there is a lot more information in this book than there appears to be at first reading. Go back to it often as your skills develop to really get the full potential of the book which really does offer a progressive training method."},{"Title":"Herding Dogs: Progressive Training (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I suppose a person can learn to remove an appendix, fly a plane, or conduct a defense by reading a book; but I know I would prefer my surgeon, pilot, and attorney to have had some hands-on experience before practicing on me. Same thing goes for herding livestock - there just is no substitute for a good trainer who knows what they are doing. Having a background in obedience, tracking, and agility gave me no headstart in herding - and no amount of bookreading changed that. When I found a trainer who was able to read me and my dogs, communicate with us, and be fair but firm, we made great progress.With that said, I think this book is very helpful as a supplement to practice sessions. Learning to read stock and dogs, understanding pressure and release, draws, balance points - all those concepts have to be learned by the human and there is no substitute for learning in the field, in actual practice. If a friend wanted a basic herding book to look at to see if it is something they might want to do, this would be the one book I would probably recommend. Better yet, though, would be to have this person actually come out and watch dogs working stock.If you are doomed to be an armchair shepherd, then this book is fine. Otherwise, your money is better invested in a herding instinct test, a stock handling class, or a day spent observing at a herding training facility. Books are an adjunct, at best, to learning to work with your dog in herding."},{"Title":"Herding Dogs: Progressive Training (Howell Reference Books)","review":"an excellent book for a novice herder with a border collie; clear, and as the title says, it takes you one step at a time toward more advanced work. However, it is has little to offer those with other herding breeds with different herding styles and different common problems. My own breed (working-bred australian shepherd) is one of the scant few besides the border collie still in common use as a stock dog; it is described by the author as a \\"driving\\" dog, i.e. a breed which does not instinctively bring the group of stock to the handler, as a \\"fetching\\" dog does, but takes them in any direction. This is completely false, as any competent aussie trainer will tell you; aussies are as much fetch dogs as borders are. Perhaps the other breeds are more accurately described, but they are all given extremely short shrift. For example, the section on teaching a dog to come in close is pointless if you have the naturally close-working aussie (or almost any other breed except borders), but is useful for many border collies which are wide workers and lose their heads in close quarters.In response to another reviewer who found the diagrams hard to follow--once you start working stock it all makes sense. Before that, it makes no sense at all."},{"Title":"Herding Dogs: Progressive Training (Howell Reference Books)","review":"This book contains some really great information. The author gives details about all of the herding breeds, including many that I didn't expect. He gives insights about what each breed has been specifically bred for, i.e. driving, gathering, etc., that is very helpful in understanding your dog. A careful study of the personality types of dogs as it affects their approach to stock is also extremely helpful. He also gives several progressive excercizes that that seem very useful. Also, I appreciated the calm, quiet, but firm training style emphasized in this book.Despite that, I was disappointed with the lack of explanation and clarity. If you are just getting started in herding, as I am, this might not be the book for you. I was often confused and feel that this book lacks enough details about the training process to be useful for beginners. Also, the author's clear preference for Border Collies as the ultimate herding dog was emphasized at points in such a way that made me a bit defensive about my \\"inferior\\" non-border collie."},{"Title":"Herding Dogs: Progressive Training (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I have always had an interest in herding dogs and have owned them and been around them most of my life; however I have never known anyone that had any real knowledge of training for herding, or had a dog that was trained for that matter.

We live in the city but I grew up on a farm. I read this book mostly out of curiosity. Though this is probably more than most people reading merely out of curiosity would want, it gave me a good taste of what's involved to train a herding dog. This is a skill that is obviously developed in the doing, not just in the reading. I especially appreciated the author's knowledge of dog behavior and obvious experience with different breeds and personalities of dog (and stock) and how to adjust the training so the dog can succeed and build confidence.We've been doing obedience training. It told me how the commands are similar and different from the obedience commands we've learned. He seems to have a strong sense of balancing instinct and command, always mindful of the dog. I felt that the book was a handler-directed, dog-centric, work-oriented book. That's was I was hoping for! The author's chapter on trials will help me better understand what I'm seeing when I watch.

I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to start a dog into herding or is having problems with a dog that is herding. This book helps lay down a great foundation. It reminds me a lot of how I train horses. You do a little at a time and build off of success. If you have issues, you go back and correct them. It's not a race but a partnership.

I think even a child could understand the precepts laid forth in this book! I would definitely recommend."},{"Title":"Vathek","review":"Beckford's &quot;Vathek&quot; is the tale of Vathek, a Caliph from the near east, for whom gluttony is a way of life. He partakes of everything to extremes in his marvelous palace - food, wine, women, and most importantly, knowledge. His mother Catharis encourages and fosters his love of the dark arts, by which he comes to summon a Giaour, a foul demon.The Giaour promises the voracious Vathek to grant him access to the realm of Eblis and Soliman, where he will command all demonic forces and be privy to enough knowledge to satisfy his curiosity. To this end, Vathek engages in wanton and reckless murders, seductions, and blasphemies against the patient divinity 'Mahomet' and his benificent spirits.One sees in &quot;Vathek&quot; a comparable theme with Montesquieu's &quot;Persian Letters&quot;. In both, we have a tyrant, (Montesquieu's Usbek is a domestic tyrant) who abandons, and ultimately relinquishes all capacity to control their dominions or themselves - All for the pursuit of knowledge.Vathek can thus be seen as a critique of the Enlightenment and of enlightened despotism, so much the rage in Europe in the late 18th century. Beckford seems to rail at knowledge being held above respect for a common humanity. Overall a very interesting novel in many respects and aside from Beckford's unnecessary authorial interruptions, a solid read."},{"Title":"Vathek","review":"The tale of Vathek is undeniably a wonderful oriental fable, where enlightenment ethics are presented and critiqued. If read in conjunction with Samuel Johnson \\"Rasselas\\", Montesquieu's Persian Letters and \\"Arabian Nights\\" one may be able to better understand the landscape upon which orientalism (a term used by Beckford himself to illuminate the period's infatuation with the orient, not to be confused with Said's) and enlightenment values where divulged. Beckford's tale however speaks of a more prescient sphere where the author's inner struggles and thwarted tragic desultoriness devolves. As with all literature this compact gem stands on her own; however many have tried to extract a moral import and some have even described a mystique of knowledge and a system of ethics with undue fastidiousness. In a more likely scenario we have a wonton fable whimsical and indulgent, crafted as a parody of \\"orientalism\\". Knowledge of Beckford's life may serve the reader well but should not hinder her enjoyment. The author's disquietude trumps an increasing distance from the absurd drive and hedonistic tendencies of the protagonist, while we feel a sympathetic kinship laxed the more into the novella we proceed. The author wrote this fable in French and supervised the translation as best he could. The grotesque and the sublime are here married insolubly but tend to find a balance suspended over a void that derides and insinuates the emptiness of a spiritual fantasy in turmoil.The ending paragraphs are singed with a sad glow that seems to recriminate as much as it moralizes: much like a father that punishes a child only to feel remorse over the fact that his own blood cannot enjoy what is most enjoyable. He is not convinced and Beckford created a wonderful fable where much is exposed, but the simplicity, the arrogance and the conviction are to be regaled with the same comic grotesque sprightliness with which he infuses his narrative.A quick fun read that demands little of us, but in degrees can disclose a sensibility we may be dismissive of if we are to package it as a tale where orientalism meets enlightenment values."},{"Title":"Vathek","review":"Leaving aside the question of whether this book is a 'gothic' novel or not, it is a dark fantasy. It shares with its more conventionally gothic brethren a tale of dark deeds in an exotic setting, where an alien and exciting religion is practised.In the standard Gothic tale, allusions to Roman Catholicism, thought of by respectable Englishmen as a dark, oppressive, and half-pagan faith, were part of the conventional apparatus. Beckford chose instead to imagine the world of Islam, an even more exotic milieu that added some flashes of bright colours to the dark and sorcerous background of his book. His choice of an even more exotic setting allowed him greater freedom in portraying characters who defied social convention and fell into exotic habits of mind.My understanding is that it is a matter of some debate to what extent the English text of -Vathek- is a translation from the French, or an original English composition. I do not have the French text in front of me, but it has been represented to me that Beckford's &quot;original&quot; French is rather like the French of Oscar Wilde's -Salome-, and needed extensive editing to be acceptable to a French readership.At any rate, -Vathek- is a prime example of early dark fantasy. The description, of course, will be richer than you are used to, but Beckford's prose actually seems to move quite quickly. Fans of H. P. Lovecraft or Clark Ashton Smith will find that it is quite easy to slip into. And the tale is indeed a vivid one, right up to the exceptional ending when Vathek and Carathis are damned to the halls of Eblis, their hearts seared with unquenchable fire.This is a good edition of the story, and the notes and maps are helpful."},{"Title":"Vathek","review":"Vathek is another work in an endless series with the Faust myth as its backbone. Except here, instead of being set in Germany, the setting is the ancient middle east in which genies and devils inhabit the land.Vathek is a caliph who is loved but also feared by his people. In fact, if he really loses his temper, just the sight of his gaze can cause death. His court makes The Satyricon look like a sunday school with its voluptuousness and excess. There are even five wings of his palace, with each one dedicated to a sense with names such as \\"The Delight of the Eyes\\" and \\"The Palace of Perfumes\\". Oh, the decadence! Of course someone as attached to physical gratification as Vathek is sure to stomp on the moral and religious boundaries of Allah and get in trouble.Much like God and Yahweh in the Book of Job, Allah allows Vathek to be tempted and tried by demons as a bizarre test of his faith. Actually, maybe in both cases it was a test of God's faith in man. The faith that man will do the right thing in the end. That he will turn away from evil. That he will have an epiphany which will redeem him. Vathek isn't so lucky.An evil being in the disguise of a man, called the Gaiour, comes to Vathek's court with all sorts of magical artifacts which seem to give their bearer otherworldy powers. Vathek becomes entranced by the thought of having powers over spirits and other men and begins to follow a direct line to eternal hell. In order to court evil spirits, Vathek becomes a mass murderer, a blasphemer, a betrayer, a killer of his own people. He is helped in this by his mother, Carathis, who hasn't even heard the word goodness. She constructs a tower much like the Tower of Babel, in order to reach to the gods and to serve as storage for her arcane items.The book, much like Dante's Inferno, becomes a little much at times. I mean, how many deeds of evil can we experience before we go, \\"ok, he's going to Hell now!\\" Sometimes you sense that some of this is intentional and tongue in cheek. At other times, you're horrified at the evil that most of the characters do. Any characters that are good are trampled upon by the evil. The last couple of pages are truly disturbing. I liked this book and would recommend it to anyone that keeps an open mind about fantasy or who is interested in the question of how much knowledge is too much knowledge."},{"Title":"Vathek","review":"Vathek was Caliph in the area of approximately present-day Iraq, at some unknown time in the past. He was generally a fair person, but woe unto him who got Vathek angry. He lived in an immense castle, with the absolute finest of everything. One day, a very strange, and very ugly, man stood before his throne. He had a hideous laugh, but didn't speak. He showed Vathek all manner of rare and exotic items, including sabers inscribed in an unknown language, inscriptions which kept changing from day to day. The stranger was thrown in prison for his unwillingness to speak. The next morning, finding the stranger gone, Vathek totally blows his top.Finding himself outside the castle, at the foot of the nearby mountains, Vathek hears a voice coming out of a huge crevasse. It is the stranger, called a giaour, who promises Vathek all the powers of heaven in exchange for the blood of fifty young boys. Vathek provides the boys, through the guise of a sporting competition, then the giaour reneges on its part of the deal. When the people, especially the parents, understand what's happened, Vathek has to get back to the castle and lock the doors, until the anger subsides.Later, Vathek commands the creation of a great caravan to a place called Rocnabad, home of famous springs. For various reasons, he needs to get away from the castle for a while. This is going to be the biggest, and grandest, caravan ever. On the journey, the caravan is attacked by wild animals, with a number of casualties. Vathek, his wives and senior advisers, can no longer be carried the rest of the way, because of lack of personnel, but actually have to walk to Rocnabad.At Rocnabad, there is a castle as big or bigger than the one that Vathek left behind. He meets a young woman named Nouronihar, who he wants as one of his wives (as Caliph, what Vathek wants, Vathek gets). She is promised to a man named Gulchenrouz. The lovers drink a potion that will make them look dead for several days, then, the idea is that they go and live somewhere else, away from Vathek.This is one of the very few novels set in the world of the Arabian Nights, a world of eunuchs, slaves and harem girls. It was first published over 200 years ago (in the 1780s), so the style of writing is very different than what is normal for a modern reader. Therefore, it will take some patience on the part of the reader. If you can find a copy, it is time, and money, very well spent."},{"Title":"Vathek","review":"The tale of the caliph Vathek is certainly the strangest thing I've read lately, and that is an accomplishment since it had to beat outThe Blind Owl: no mean feat, that.I think I would be doing anyone a disservice to spoil the plot, especially since it doesn't make much sense anyway. I will give away that it is basically a variation of the Faust legend, with huge helpings of oriental exoticism. The story's mood is sometimes dark and moralistic, sometimes light and fantastic, sometimes ironic. Sometimes the narrator seems to sympathize, or to want us to sympathize, with the anti-hero; other times we are clearly to be repulsed or, at the least, startled.Who should read this book?First of all, any fan of early gothic. Its mood is less consistently dark than the genuinely gothic novels, but I'm sure the relations are obvious. The deepest sympathy, I think, between Vathek and more famous gothic stories, is in the mingling of attraction and disgust at the superstition and cosmic moral drama found outside the orthodox Protestant or rationalistic Enlightenment worldviews. The reader should indulge in a Catholic or orientalist fantasy for awhile, come to appreciate its danger, and return gratefully to the supposedly well-ordered English society. Escapist literature at its best! Beyond that, however, the similarities pretty much end.If you are a fan of early gothic novels, of course you should read whatever you feel like, but I would gently recommend readingThe Castle of Otranto: A Gothic Story,The Monk (Penguin Classics),The Romance of the Forest, and of courseFrankenstein (Norton Critical Editions), maybe even (for some lighter fun)Northanger Abbey (Penguin Classics)before turning to Vathek. They are each more famous, more coherent and arguably more entertaining.Fans of H. P. Lovecraft might enjoy Vathek as well.Secondly, anyone interested in the later stages of the Enlightenment, or early romanticism. Here again I would suggestFaust: A Tragedy (Norton Critical Editions), and I agree with the reviewer who suggestedThe History of Rasselas: Prince of Abissinia (Oxford World's Classics)as works that you might like to read along with, and probably before, Vathek.Thirdly, anyone interested in orientalism. Here of course the key thing to read first isThe Arabian Nights, Volume I: The Marvels and Wonders of The Thousand and One Nights (Signet Classics)is the place to start, and Johnson's Rasselas would be a good follow-up, and then Vathek's place will be well appreciated.The connections to gothic, romanticism and orientalism are obvious, but I'll go out on a limb that may surprise: Kafka fans will probably enjoy this. Now Kafka's stories have brilliant subtleties that Vathek lacks, but I believe there is a definite affinity here in spirit, if not in technical execution. Kafka couldn't have written the way he did in the 18th century, but if he'd been there to try, perhaps he would have come up with something like Vathek.So, in sum, there are a number of works with a greater claim to most people's time and attention than Vathek; however, there are a large number of readers out there who are unfortunately missing a work that they would certainly relish. By all means, give this fascinating little book a shot."},{"Title":"Vathek","review":"Those are the three categories that I've seen this story put in. Vathek tells the tale about a man with an exceedingly high tower. This man named Vathek is very greedy. The reading can be a little rough at times, which is why I took off one star, but there are some very memorable scenes. Two that really stick out in my mind are: When the stranger in the dungeon escapes. And when Vathek ascends his tall tower, thinking how tall he stands over his minions--then he looks up at the stars and grimaces, because the stars are still the same distance away. Both of these scenes are towards the beginning, which I think is the best part of the book. The middle details Vathek's journey to some far off place. But then it picks up again towards the end. I don't normally read Gothics--if this IS a Gothic, opinions vary--but it is a very good book and definitely one I plan on adding to my permanent collection. Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges gave enthusiastic mention to this book in one of his works."},{"Title":"Vathek","review":"Beckford's story is what is known as an Oriental tale; it falls into the sub-division known as 'Satanic.' The reader will easily see why. Vathek kills casually, his mother Carathis positively gleefully; they hold traffic with evil spirits, Carathis raising them up when necessary. What they do, they do to gain access to the Palace of Subterranean Fire. This story moves along well, with plenty of darkly humourous comments. The translation process does not seem to have impaired the book's readability; if so, it was probably due to the fact that Beckford and a colleague only worked on it sporadically--Beckford kept on having to remove himself from England to prevent unpleasantness. His tastes are reflected in his fiction."},{"Title":"Vathek","review":"The book itself is absolutely wonderful, and I'd reccomend it to anyone. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the readability (if that's actually a word) is somewhat damaged by the fact that it's a translation from French. I also would warn anybody who is attracted to 'gothic' novels (i.e. The Monk, The Castle of Otranto). It's set in the Middle East and, although there are certain moments of gothic quality horror, over all, the setting somewhat ruined the classification under which it was reccomended to me, and, as any true gothic fan will know, setting is crucial to such novels."},{"Title":"PowerSculpt For Women: The Complete Body Sculpting & Weight Training Workout Using the Exercise Ball (Includes Bonus DVD)","review":"This book is great for the price.

This is a great book in every way, except.... my only complaint is that the 4 routines at the back of the book list the exercises by name, but do not give a thumb-nail picture to remind you of what it is, nor is a page number given. This is a real drawback, in my opinion, because who wants to search through the book to find the exercises while you are working out? That is why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5. The book Weights on the Ball Workbook, by Steven Stiefel, gives very nice concise routines with little pictures and the page number, which makes working out according to the recommended routines stress-free (no flipping through the book in search of the exercise).

Paul Strathern did a great job of introducing the character of Franz Kafka, setting the historical context, and walking the reader throughout the key points of his development: personal and professional. The chosen excerpts from Kafka's writing were fantastic, and I am looking forward to reading the full-length versions soon."},{"Title":"Kafka In 90 Minutes [UNABRIDGED]","review":"An insightful and comprehensive overview of Kafka's life, his significance in literature and history, and a detailed and brilliant discussion - with extended readings - of many of Kafka's most important works. And unlike many other discussions of significant literary, philosophical, and historical figures, Strathern's discussion of Kafka illuminates and emphasizes Kafka's Jewish identity as central to understanding Kafka. Strathern shows great honesty, understanding, and deep sensitivity in his analysis of the historical period in which Kafka lived, and especially of the position of the Jews in Germany and Central Europe at this time. After reading this book you will want to read everything that Kafka has written. It is an excellent introduction to Kafka."},{"Title":"Kafka In 90 Minutes [UNABRIDGED]","review":"I have read most of Kafka's major works (The Castle, The Trial, The Metamorphosis and Other Stories in the Muir translations), and was looking for a brief biography and writing summary to further broaden my knowledge of this interesting writer. I am happy to say that I was quite impressed with the content of this small book, despite the hokey sounding title (makes it sound like one of those 'Learn French in One Week' kind of gimmicks). But this book packs a lot of information into a few pages.In reality it took about an hour for me to read the book. It might take longer for those unfamiliar with Kafka's works. The book is a brief biography of important events that in Kafka's life that influenced his writing. It is not date heavy, which is nice, and most of the influences on his work relate to family and other long term influences on his life. We really get a feel for Max Brod, his best friend, and the man mainly responsible for getting Kafka's works out in the world at large.There are several excerpts from various writings but often these are put into Strathern's own words. And it works. Strathern is obviously very well educated on philosophy and I cannot be happier with his approach to Kafka's works. One of the best aspects of his writing here is that he does not extrapolate and push his own interpretations. In fact, later in the book, he admonishes other academics and writers for over interpreting Kafka's works. There is a fine listing of books for further reading at the end of this book and I like that Strathern points out those that help to unravel the mystery of Kafka's writing without pushing their beliefs or their agendas at the reader. Strathern writes in an honest style, and this book is uncluttered and has a nice flow.I highly recommend this short book for anyone more interested in Kafka's works. It will not give you too much insight as to the actual works, but the reader will be able to grasp more of the reasoning and influences behind his writing. I would say that it is a good introduction to Kafka, but I highly recommend those reading this to at least have read one or two Kafka works, Metamorphosis most of all."},{"Title":"Kafka In 90 Minutes [UNABRIDGED]","review":"I love all of Strathem's 90 minute books., especially the philosophy series. This gives a human insight into this complex man ans is a useful priemer for his works. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Little Book of Golf Slang: From Fried Eggs to Frog Hairs, Words to Help You Pass as a Golfer","review":"I am always looking for reference material related to slang and jargons. For my current novel I needed to feed a character with some golf speak and this little book is what they had in the stacks of my Public Library, for some reason. There is no cross referencing or etymology or terminology that will help you learn about the game. It is not a dictionary of golf, it is a novelty book. It might help people pass time in the lobby of the dentist office or make a good gift for the fourth night of Chanukah. I found some interesting entries on betting games I never heard like \\"Nassau\\" and \\"Wolf.\\" But entries like \\"A-Game\\", \\"that dog will hunt\\", \\"ugly\\", and \\"the zone\\" are pretty widespread words in other sports and American English that are not going to strike you as golfy. For writers and researchers there is nothing in this short book you can't find in amateur glossaries on the internet. I surely don't play golf but I also don't recommend hitting the ball twice and telling the golf boys you hit a \\"double Chen because you were leaking oil.\\" I suspect using this slang as a tool to improve your social credibility with other players, as the subtitle suggests, will mostly help you sound like as ass.RF BrownProvidence, RI"},{"Title":"The Little Book of Golf Slang: From Fried Eggs to Frog Hairs, Words to Help You Pass as a Golfer","review":"Some of the jokes in this book are hilarious, I read it in bed and whenever I burst out laughing my wife would ask me what was so funny. When I read the joke to her, the level of her amusement matched mine. While I have never played a round of golf and most likely never will, I can appreciate a good joke and this book contains many of them."},{"Title":"Red-Eyed Tree Frogs and Leaf Frogs (Reptile Keeper's Guides)","review":"First of all it is a very short book about 40 pages, paper-back, and most of it is covered with pictures, also the book size is about 5\\"x6\\"; it's more like a brochure. That's fine if you want pictures, but it leaves little room for information. I certainly didn't expect to have the first half of the book giving pictures and descriptions of all of these different tree frogs, I bought it for the Red-eyes.The second half of the book (20 pages) gives little information. It doesn't even show cage setups.My advice, save your money and do a search on the internet, you will get more information."},{"Title":"Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors: This Is Ours","review":"I read this book hoping it would be interesting, and for the first chapter it was, but it was the following chapters that bored me to death, the reason I say this is due to the fact that every chapter is a repeat of the previous chapter, you learn how Tim did things his way over and over and over again. Fortunately, this book did leave out for the most part, the I love Faith, I love Faith syndrome that Tim has been going through over the past. The book is a nice have if you want it just to have it, if you're looking for a good read on country music, try one of the older books on Waylon, Willie, Merle, or anyone that has actually had something to say."},{"Title":"Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors: This Is Ours","review":"This book is totally awesome. Tim and the band put their hearts and souls into this book. They all had great things to say about Tim and the pictures are incredible!!! I can't wait until the next book comes out."},{"Title":"Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors: This Is Ours","review":"I couldn't help it, when I heard Tim McGraw had a book published I had to laugh, and laugh hard. Yes ol' Timmy's doing pretty good for himself. His CMT sheep will buy whatever they are lead to. Tim doesn't write songs or play an instrument, so I doubt he had anything to do with this book. Much like Gene Simmons, he'll sell himself out with whatever junk producers decide to put his face on. He'll sit back and laugh at how a talentless man became a celebrity in America. Only in America."},{"Title":"Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors: This Is Ours","review":"I love Tim McGraw and I love reading anything about him! He is wild, sexy, a great entertainer, and one of the best country artists of all time!

Overall a good book and great pics! lilkooi"},{"Title":"Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors: This Is Ours","review":"Well The first time I read Tim's Book I was at Barns &amp; Noble. I picked the book up and started reading it. I didn't even get through the first chapter before I decided that I had to have this book. Unfortuanatly I didn't have enough Money to get it so I told my parents that I wanted it for Christmas. I was sure that my dad would get it for me but needless to say he didn't. It didn't think I had until I opened my last gift Christmas morning form my brother and his fiance. There it was on top of a pale yellow sweater. I was so excited! As soon as I got ready to go to my grandmother's house for Christmas dinner I sat down and started reading it while waiting on my parents to get ready.The book was so great that I finished it in three days. It told all about his life as a singer as well as his band. The main thing that I liked was how he kept saying that his style and ways of creating his music is different from anyone elses. I have never heard of an artist turn down a song for them but suggest it for another artist. I just think that is awesome of him. It shows that he's not all about him. Yeah he wants to make good music for all his fans but it has to be something that he would listen to too.Another thing I liked about the book was the part that he talked about recording his new album. It was really great how he created the gift boxes for all the guys in the band. He just wanted them to feel comfortable away from home. And all the pictures they have of them recording up there shows that it was hard work but they still had fun. I don't know it was just a great book and I would recommend it to anyone to read."},{"Title":"Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors: This Is Ours","review":"This is a great book about country singer Tim McGraw, his band: the Dancehall Doctors, and how their new CD came together.Throughout the book there are many picture of Tim and his band; both from in the studio, and from on the road over the past several years. There are also a lot of quotes and stories told by Tim, his band members, and by other people involved in making his albums and his live shows.The books starts out by telling why Tim decided to record this album with his band, instead of the studio musicians that play on most country albums. There are also pages on each of his band members, who have all been with him for many years. They tell how they met Tim and how they came to work with him, and how they became involved with music. Also the book tells where they decided to record the CD, and what it was like making the record.Before I read the book I thought it might include a lot of information that I probably already knew. However, as I was reading it, I found that it included a lot of new pictures, and a lot of stories about recording the new CD that I had not read anywhere else. As a McGraw fan for many years I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors: This Is Ours","review":"I just love This is OURS! Tim really is such a humble entertainer and it is so nice to read what feels a little at times like a diary... or a personal note from Tim. I totally love all the pictures... there are truly some awesome ones in there that are great just for browsing. However, when I received mine - I was totally absorbed in the reading. I did not even look ahead at pictures (didn't want to spoil any of the moments prior to reading what accompanied it all... I have been a fan of Tim from the beginning, but I just LOVED learning more and more about the DHDs and hearing people thoughts through the process. It has a real intimate feel to me... TRUE TIM fans must have this book... and anyone else should have one to learn more about this extraordinary entertainer. He is such a humble man yet a really smart business man. He is not too insecure to share the enormous spotlight with his friends - his extension of his family - his band!"},{"Title":"Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors: This Is Ours","review":"To all of you country fans out there who have not read this book (both of you!) go and buy it now!!

He is honest and doesn't care what anyone else thinks or what everyone else is doing. He is his own man. The stories were funny and real! Not like most super stars.

I even had my picture taken with him backstage at a route 66 concert in Springfield, Missouri. I would say on all the songs that i have heard him sing he puts his whole self into his songs and more. That is what the other singers need to do is take a couple of lessons from our man Tim here to get a little bit of them there pointers,everyone is so crazy about,but most of all he cares alot about his wife and family, but the band and the fans are important to.All I know is Tim is so great and the most awesome guy I have ever heard singing in person."},{"Title":"Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors: This Is Ours","review":"I found Tim McGraw's book \\"This Is Ours\\" extremely exciting.

You can't help enjoying his music. It's catchy and great to dance to and there is never a shortage of goodlooking girls waiting to dance to his songs. Most of all though, you have to admire Tim for his dedication to his music, the Dancehall Doctors, Faith and the kids, and his fans.

Tim is my favorite artist and I went out the day his cd went on sale and bought it. I have never been disappointed by anyhting that he has come out with and this cd is no exception. This cd is his best one ever, and I believe it's because his real band is playing on it. It has everything from a soulful \\"Comfort Me\\", a heartfelt \\"I Know How To Love You Well\\", to a fun \\"Who Are They\\". This cd covers it all, right down to a remake of Elton John's \\"Tiny Dancer\\". This cd is also home to Tim's new controversy...\\"Red Ragtop\\" which talks about teen pregnancy and the affects of abortion. I also love \\"All We Ever Find\\" which talks about saying your true feelings and not taking any time you have for granted. \\"Who Are They\\" is a song questioning what people consider 'normal'. It asks the question everyone wants the answer to, who are they to tell me what to do? Tim's band, The Dancehall Doctors also do a wonder job on this album. From the war drums in the begging of \\"Comfort Me\\" to the heavy guitar playing in \\"Illegal\\" right down to their background vocals. An in session band could never have done justice to this project. I encourage any country listener to purchase this cd. Whether you are a die hard fan or just stop flipping radio stations when you hear a catchy tune you will love this cd."},{"Title":"Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors: This Is Ours","review":"I loved the book love the album.

This book makes a great matching gift to the CD. It is a fun read and nice to see that even though McGraw has reached a high level of success he has not forgotten the band that helped him to get there. There are quotes from his band and some candid shots of McGraw and his band. The new record is excellent and it is hard to believe that McGraw did not write his own songs when he is a master at their delivery and takes complete ownership. By far this is the best musical display of his talent and the book adds just another dimension to that music."},{"Title":"Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors: This Is Ours","review":"I HAVE BECOME A TIM MCGRAW FAN, THROUGH HIS RENDITION OF SHES MY KIND OF RAIN VIDEO.

And, I'm an avowed fiction reader (for the most part.) But I loved it. It is wise and very funny and I must remember to thank my friend who recommended it to me. It can be read all at once, as I did, or in little bits. The chapters may seem to be rather arbitrarily organized. but it works. I certainly learned things, but more importantly I got to know a whole bunch of people I wouldn't have otherwise and see the world through their eyes for a little bit. It was fun. Certainly poignant and even tragic, but one of the all around best books I've read in a while."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Reading this book was like taking a walk down memory lane. I grew up in a small rural community, and was a member of the local voluteer fire department for several years. It was almost scary how much of this book could have been written about my experiences.Here we get an honest look at what life in a rural community is like. Everyone in town knows everybody else, secrets are hard to keep, and changes come slowly. In this environment, firefighters are taking care of friends and family, rather than strangers, which makes the work all the more rewarding.Perry's writing is easy to read, and includes a healthy dose of humor that offsets the inevitable tragedy that goes hand-in-hand with being a firefighter. Well done."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"From describing interactions between feuding high school sweethearts in the middle of Main Street to Kodiak-chewing characters that make you say, &quot;I know that guy,&quot; the picture of small town living Michael Perry creates for readers is dead on. I couldn't stop reading, laughing, sighing, shaking my head - this book has it all. Because I was raised small town Abrams, Wisconsin, I can honestly say that Perry captures the bittersweet life people live there and, he made me a little homesick. Please read this book!"},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"POPULATION: 485 is a patchwork of stories, history &amp; memories written from the perspective of a native son's return to his home town as a First Responder. Michael Perry writes with an unerring eye for community, nostalgia, tragedy, comedy &amp; self-reflection. Tears &amp; laughter are the spices which make this as welcome a read as a hot toddy on a cold night.Rebeccasreads highly recommends POPULATION: 485 for anyone who relishes the humor &amp; drama of everyday life in a small American town hanging on to life by the roots of its families."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Michael Perry's lively descriptive bent shows itself in the very first sentence of \\"Population: 485\\": \\"Summer here comes on like a zaftig hippie chick, jazzed on chlorophyll and flinging fistfuls of butterflies to the sun.\\" Such unexpected similes and metaphors, many of them humorous, appear regularly as the book progresses, and given the author's considerable wit and the colorful characters he brings to life so well, Perry might have settled for a simply humorous book.But he didn't. Instead he delivers a potent, often surprising account of his return after twelve years to the small, northern Wisconsin town of New Auburn (population 485) and of his difficult work as a volunteer fireman and first responder for the local ambulance corps. There is a natural comparison between Perry's hardworking, no-nonsense, salt-of-the-earth townsfolk-One-Eyed Beagle, the butcher; Tricky Jackson; Uncle Shotsy-and Garrison Keillor's stories of Lake Wobegon, but Perry's tales aren't fiction, and given his work in emergency response, they are often tainted with tragedy.The author's sometimes silly anecdotes of small-town life, combined with the pain, loss and grief that he witnesses (and feels himself) on a regular basis, makes for an odd fusion, but Perry pulls it off with considerable dexterity. His voice is steady and sure, and part of the pleasure of \\"Population: 485\\" comes from the author's razor-sharp observational skills. He watches closely, listens intently, and reports back with careful precision.On trying to detect a heartbeat in a cardiac patient: \\"You are hoping to hear audible hydraulics from a fist's-worth of muscle. You are scanning for life's backbeat. The lup-dup groove. A little heavier on the dup.\\"On the weight of his responsibility: \\"You never know when the call will come. Somewhere out of sight someone is blowing up a balloon, and you will be alerted only when it explodes. There are times late at night, when I'm one of two people on ambulance duty, that I am haunted by a vision of the thousands of hearts beating out there in our assigned patch of darkness . . . [and] the idea that if one of those hearts fails, someone will call for help . . . and out of all those hearts, and all those twisted addresses, we will have to narrow it down, get there as fast as we can . . .\\"On the terrible situations he must regularly face: \\"At a small farmhouse deep in the country, a small woman meets us at the door. \`My husband shot himself,' she says. I put my hand on her shoulder, look straight into her eyes, and ask a terrible question. \`Are you sure he is dead?' I am groping for the tone of voice that will allow me to ask this cosmically insulting question and yet convey concern and regret and sympathy and respect, and I am feeling mightily inadequate. I am only asking because it will not do if the coroner arrives to a heartbeat, with us standing around. \`I think so,' she says. \`He is in the granary.'\\"One additional element that makes this memoir so interesting is that Perry resides concurrently in two disparate cultural realms. He is literate, educated, given to liberal leanings and urban sensibilities. He not only reads Esquire and Salon but occasionally writes for them, as well. Yet he is also part and parcel of the rural, \\"hick\\" life he describes with such depth and affection. Perry is not just pretending-not some big-city writer settling briefly into New Auburn for \\"a season of inspiration.\\" Perry lives in this world, is deeply rooted with friends and family, and his day-to-day witnessing of the region's struggles, misfortunes, calamities and heartbreak clearly draws him in even closer.In short no one else could have written this unique meditation on life and death in small-town America, which makes me all the more thankful that Perry took the time."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously. The writing is insightful, humorous, truthful and breathtakingly beautiful. I found myself marking passages to return to again and again. The book is by turns hysterical and heartbreaking. A few of the passages were somewhat too grim and explicit, and I'm not a fan of hunting. But the writing was so compelling, so compassionate and, ultimately uplifting, that I highly recommend this lovely, funny book to everyone."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Read Michael Perry's book for the acuity of his perceptions, the deep beauty of his language and the humor and compassion of his stories. Your intellectual ivy league educated cousin, your Catholic/Agnostic/Homemaker/Neurosurgeon mother, your weird Uncle Lou and your sister will all enjoy this book. For those women who fantasize about the perfect stevedore/poet lover -take a gander at the dust jacket photo!"},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"To give this book the rating it deserves, I'd need more than 5 stars. It was, quite simply, a great read. He was &quot;right on&quot; about so many of his observations; I'd often laugh out loud or mentally do a &quot;high five&quot; with Perry when he'd nail something I'd not be able to put into words. The subjects he writes about -- people and events -- could easily have slipped into stereotyped characterizations and situations. You have to read this book yourself to see how skillfully he uses words to rise above any such contrivances. I agree with one of the former reviewers -- I'm going to have to get another book I can mark up. So many of the things he wrote about bear re-reading."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Michael Perry's novel is an accessible book that tugs at the heart of its readers. While it looks at the foibles and follies of country folk, it has a universal quality to it. His sensitivity to the human spirit is shown and felt in this delightful piece. Readers will find themselves both laughing and crying at characters who are real because their source and substance are real. Perry is Wisconsin's version of Garrison Keillor and Jon Hassler."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"I lived the first 30 years of my life less than 30 miles from New Auburn, Wisconsin. So when I fortuitously discovered that the author hailed from the same neck of the woods, I promptly purchased the book from Amazon.When it comes to reading for pleasure I read at a snail's pace. A John Grisham novel typically takes me several weeks to read. By comparison, I actually read this book at record breaking speed. It was impossible for me to set this book down for long.There were times when I was nearly rolling on the floor laughing but there were even more times when I literally shed a tear or two. Most books don't engage me emotionally to this depth but then again most books are not written by such an insightful person,Especially when it comes to matters of human nature and mortality.And yes, mortality is an issue that this author brings to the fore on many occasions. In fact, if I had to sum up a central reoccurring theme it would be this. We humans are on this planet for a very short time and are balancing on a very thin and precarious wire each and every day that we rise from our beds.I never felt that the author was an especially cynical person but rather a realistic one who chose to contemplate death as he continued to learn how to help others to live. His choice of an altruistic occupation simply confirms the lesson that many wise persons have learned, that \\"there is more happiness in giving than in receiving.\\"This book moves quickly with plenty of realistic and graphic imagery of his experiences in the rescue field interacting with scores of colorful characters. The author is an excellent wordsmith and is incredibly introspective in the matters of the human psyche. I am hooked and intend on reading his other offerings."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"I am almost finished with this book...

It was a short read, but a fun one."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"At Christmas every year, my book group exchanges books. We each buy one copy for everyone of a selection that we read after the first of the year. This was my choice in December 2010 and we are reading it for our May meeting. I tend to enjoy memoirs and depictions of small town life - anything by Bill Bryson usually makes me happy and \\"If You Lived Here I'd Know Your Name\\" by Heather Lende is another favorite of mine. I'm not sure how I ran across this book (probably an Amazon recommendation based upon other books I had liked) but it seemed to be something I would enjoy so took a chance. Not only was I going to read it, I was going to make a group of women read an unknown author to me - crossed my fingers it would be all right. I knew I was in good shape when one of my friends called to tell me she took it on vacation and LOVED it. I just finished it myself a couple of days ago and I have to agree - it was really good.Michael Perry returns to small town Wisconsin after being away for twelve years. Knowing that he needs to find his place in the community after being gone and having worked as a first responder, he decides to join the town's fire and rescue department. This book is one of the results of that decision. A series of essays by Mr. Perry are glimpses of small town life, and all its characters, viewed through the lens of someone who has held injured, ill, and dying neighbors (and some who aren't really in need of services but are lonely and make the emergency call to get some company). The reader rides along with the author as he responds to calls for help and deals with the death and destruction faced by first responders.I was expecting something very humorous and there are moments of laugh-out-loud funny, but it's more poignant than hilarious and more introspective than slapstick. His mother and brothers are part of the squad so family relationships are explored as well as understanding the sense of community felt by people helping others in their time of panic and grief. A truly enjoyable read that inspires me to find his next book, \\"Truck: A Love Story\\" to find out how his life continues to unfold. Not for the faint of heart (medical procedures are portrayed accurately), it's still worth the time to read and give the reader a glimpse into a world not inhabited by most of us."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"I enjoyed reading Poulation: 485 by Michael Perry. I have been a paramedic for 25 years and thought it would be interesting to read aout rural EMS in Wisconsin. Michael Perry showed me that many EMS experiences are universal. This book is for the thinking EMT or paramedic who wants a good read.I personally liked the chapter where Michael described treating a trauma patient and waiting for the helicopter as \\"kneeling in the dirt and lookiing to the heaven's.\\" Very deep. A book worth reading if you are a student of life and EMS."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Michael Perry returns back to his home town, New Auburn, Wisconsin. A town in Northwestern Wisconsin, Population 485. He left 10 years ago and landed in Wyoming were he worked as a cowboy and put himself through nursing school.Now he is home, has bought a house on Main Street and is happy to be closer to his mother and brothers. Both his brothers belong to the fire department and his mother is a first responder for the area. Michael decides the best way to reconnect with the community is to join the fire department and use his nursing training to study to become an EMT and his mother joins him in the class.This is your typical small town, everyone knows everything about everybody, and Michael thinks it's the perfect place to write. Using the emergency calls, grass and chimney fires, accidents and dinners as background for his stories he brings the little town to life on the pages of this book. Humor and tragedy, heartbreak and devastating heartache we meet Michael's neighbors one siren at a time.I LIKED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I had several reasons for wanting to read this book. First, when I started this blog I challenged myself to read books written by Wisconsin authors or that used Wisconsin as the setting for the story. This books meets both those requirements.Secondly, I am from a small town in Wisconsin, a little bigger than New Auburn, but growing up there was pure joy and at that time, everyone knew everything about everybody. That town has changed and grown and is no longer the town of my memories.Also while growing up in that small town, my father was a fireman, later the fire chief, and when the fire department was in charge of the ambulance service he was the equivalent of what is now an EMT or First Responder. He even had the Fire Training School at Madison Area Technical College dedicated to him just 2 weeks after he died.The stories in this book were wonderfully told and brought back so many memories. It prompted a call to my sister who had also read the book some time ago and we spent an hour reminiscing about our dad, who passed away in 1988, some of the stories were so funny, we wish we could write a book. Thank you Michael Perry for writing this book and giving us our Dad back for a few minutes.Michael Perry has the gift of storytelling and anyone who likes to read about life in a small town, firefighters, EMTs, or anyone who believes in giving back will appreciate and truly enjoy this book. If you would just like to read a good story told by a fresh voice you will like this book.Note: This book was published in 2002 and new copies of this book may be hard to find but there are plenty used copies available at both [...] and Amazon.com.This book was from my private collection. No compensation was received."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"The cover and description made this book seem like it would be only quirky vignettes about small town red-necks. While it was that to a degree, it was so much more thoughtful, intelligent, exciting, funny, and poignant than that, without being maudlin. Perry faces his characters with respect, without looking down on them for being country folk, as many writers returning to their home towns might be tempted to do. Being from a small town myself (and my stepfather a volunteer firefighter), I could relate to a lot of what he said, but he brought a lot of depth, history, and humor to it all. I teared up several times and laughed aloud several times too. I highly recommend this diamond in the hay..."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Michael Perry's \\"Population 485\\" is a wonderful reminisce in the life of a volunteer firefighter and EMT in a small rural Wisconsin town.The stories are many while performing these vital duties and responsibilities. From the people Perry meets and interfaces with, to the events he witnesses, it's as good as it gets from an insider's viewpoint. Perceptive and insightful.Several emotions surface while reading the book. Perry is humorous, heartfelt, genuine and pensive. His ponderings on place and space in time reach deep into the realms of being.Hearing these stories from Perry's spin of writing and viewpoint was a pleasure."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Michael Perry is quite clearly a writer - a very good one and well traveled. In what must rank as a rather peculiar career decision, Perry goes home to the small northwestern Wisconsin town in which he was raised to write, live, and work as a volunteer firefighter. Population 485 is a collection of essays more or less responding to these experiences. There is no clear narrative thread and the themes of the essays vary widely. Each, however, explains in a small way why the small town lifestyle is appealing to many and in a large way the debt we owe as a society to our emergency personnel. He covers everything from the initial panic of receiving a call to the grim decision to cease lifesaving efforts, and everything from the disappearance of small town main streets to the camaraderie of the volunteer firefighter picnic - deftly mixing deep thinking with the lowest of brows.Too often, in my opinion, books that dwell on small towns are either bitter or saccharine - rarely hitting quite the right spot. Michael Perry clearly tends toward the sweet end of the spectrum, focusing on the compassionate characters of his small town, often at their best. He does not, however, write a caricature. Coming from a small town, though my memories are not so halcyonic, I recognize Perry's characters, their desire to do right and their concern for their neighbor. And I recognize the worrisome signs of decay - the indications that our small towns are not long for the world, at least in their current form. Perry has done more good deeds than I can count in his role as an emergency responder, and has done another with his book. Population 485 is fine writing about regular good guys in a place that's fading. Population 485 won't change anyone's life, but it's definitely worth the few hours it takes to read."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Michael Perry is a really good writer. He knows how to make you laugh and he knows how to make you cry, and both skills are on display in this well received look into small town America. Perry is a firefighter/first responder/EMT who is on call twenty four hours a day. You get to meet some of his buddies in the fire department, and you will go with as he tends to the needs of hurting people. Sometimes, the people he tries to save make it, sometimes they don't. Through it all, he learns about community, love, life, death, and the search for meaning and significance. The story is bookended by two terrible car accidents, each one ending with the death of a young woman in her early twenties.I minister in a Wisconsin town even smaller than New Auburn, so I readily connected with the stories and with the people. Some stories will make you laugh (The one about the cross eyed man getting his eyes fixed by having skin from his scrotum applied to his eye was classic. He was cockeyed ever since :)Some stories will gross you out (the fat woman who pukes all over, on the toilet, in the ambulance and in the hospital). But every story is real and reflects the lives of real people. It's fun read and you will feel like you are a part of the New Auburn community."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Michael Perry has a great way of explaining and writing the simple things. When I read his books it feels like we are sitting around the kitchen table listening to the day's events. It just happens that Perry is better at getting those stories across than most of us. There were times in this book that I felt he had expanded his story a little far to places I didn't need to go to understand his meaning, but I knew right around the corner there would be something that would have my full attention. I was surprised by the sad ending and loved it."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"I have passed this book along to many and recommended it to even more- it is well written, interesting and touching. The author is an EMT in his small town of New Auburn WI- pop 485 and the town's folk - his neighbors and friends -are portrayed with true warmth and humor. There are passages in this book that are so evocative of the human experience I cried - and so did my husband who read it upon my recommendation. It was passed to me a friend and I have given a number of copies and have to keep buying one \\"for myself.\\" Well worth the time and money- a little gem of a book."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Population: 485 was an interesting novel, and I think that it was a very enjoyable book to read. While reading the book, I felt a connection with Perry as he explains his motives for being a fire fighter, and his feelings towards volunteer work. I think that his book accurately portrays life in a small town, and the work of a volunteer fire fighter, whoes calls range from saving a dying man, or moving a goose to a cooler location. Perry's style of writing was also very interesting. I thought that he used a lot of detail which helped to create a picture in my mind. I think the opening sentence of the novel expresses that idea, \\"Summer here comes on like a zaftig hippie chick, jazzed on chlorophyll and flinging fistfulls of butterflies to the sun.\\" I thought that Perry was able to mend humor and tragedy very well together for a hearting warming story!"},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my sister. She is an EMT in Tioga County in the wilderness of Pennsylvania where we both grew up. I thought she would enjoy reading the stories of a fellow small town EMT. Like the author I grew up in a small town then left for the job opportunities and cultural attractions of living in the big city. Unlike the author I have never returned but my sister and our family still live there. The night I purchased the book I skimmed through the pages, was interested and started from the beginning. The stories and narrative said a lot about living in a small town that is slowly dying, and the closeness of a family trying to make a difference. The joy and sorrow of survival and death made the book an emotional experience and I was thoroughly hooked. I stayed up all night and finished the book over breakfast. The ending of the book is especially well done and left me craving for what happened after. I hope the author writes a sequel as I really want to know how his life faired. There is a made for TV movie in here if not a feature. How did my sister like it? She also stayed up all night reading it and it is now circulating through her volunteer fire department in the mountains of Pennsylvania. I bought a copy of my own to read again during a snowy weekend in January."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"I wish that I could share all of the enthusiasm of the other commentators on this page. While I found 2/3rds of the book to be simply wonderful, I did feel that the final third dragged just a bit--and tended to repeat themes already covered. But even that part is saved by the stunning essay entitled \\"Sarah.\\" Like many of the other commentators, I, too, grew up in a community very much like New Auburn--although in Massachusetts. We, too, have a volunteer fire department and a chief of police who had a day job. Many of the people in this book are known to you if you ever have lived in such a place. By all means take the time to read this book. I just wanted to add my caution in the midst of all of this rampant enthusiam."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"A friend recommended this book to me, somewhere around the time I was expressing the fear that the books I was reading were making me dumber. What a difference a download makes.Perry's book, a memoir of strung-together stories and lessons and thought processes, is intelligent, thought-provoking, and - for someone like myself who thinks they have a fair command of the king's English - awe-inspiring.On many occasions, the book took my breath away - by the depth of its poignancy, or by the shear fact that I couldn't breathe for laughing so hard. Once, I read in the car, windows down, in a coffee shop parking lot between meetings. Good thing I didn't go into that coffee shop. It was during the \\"Oops\\" chapter and I was laughing the ugly laugh, replete with tears. I'm afraid if I'd been around humans, 911 would have been called.Sometimes I felt Perry was going too far with his observations, and sometimes I felt he was just plain showing off with his vocabulary (I lost count of the number of times I utilized the Kindle dictionary). But then I'd hit a passage that I'd reread seven times in a row just for how good it made me feel, or I'd call somebody and share a portion of his story, snorting and gasping as I tried to read it through my guffaws, and all was forgiven.I'll read anything I can get my hands on by this man. It may not make me smarter, but that won't be his fault."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"This was a great book.

Perry's prose is melodic, and his descriptions faithfully depict life as it is lived by millions far from our media centers. Among the descriptions of fire and rescue calls, he delves deeply into the human condition, as in the following passage:\\"What a profound thing it is to call for help. How astounding, the number of people fate allows to float through this life never once confronting their own mortality. One of the benefits of the fire and rescue business, if you will have it, is a near-constant sense of vulnerability. A recognition that at the cellular level, or at the speeding freight train level, we are but a particle removed from chaos. I have carried my kit in to find tattooed tavern-clearing monsters weeping in bed, hairless from radiation, leaking soupy feces from a colostomy, skin like mottled pat&egrave;, and on the walls beer mirrors and bellicose biker tchotchkes, and I think, how do we ever forget this sort of possibility? How do we lapse into what you might call ignortality? In part, I guess, because you simply can't function if you are always feeling the scythe pressed to your neck. \\"Both for those involved in emergency and fire fighting work and for those who seek to better understand the lives of these rescuers, this book will be both thought-provoking and entertaining."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"The author reads the book on CD, which adds the spin the author wants you to hear in each chapter. What a heartwarming book about neighbors & kindness, which isn't seen in our communities often enough these days. We enjoyed you from Mississippi to Tennessee this summer...Thanks!!"},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Perry is masterful in introducing the reader to life in small town America through the residents of New Auburn, Wisconsin and the surrounding area. He is particularly effective at managing that small town paradox where everyone knows everyone, but still allows for privacy. There's much of every character that remains an unknown, and that's part of the allure.In and around the eccentricity and stark reality of life in a small town, Perry provides some sometimes interesting discussion of the history of fire, firefighting and related topics. Though some are worth reading, Perry sometimes wanders in and out of these discussions, which are treated at great length. A little less focus here, and this would be a perfect read. If you find yourself getting bogged down in these sections, skip ahead and keep reading--they shouldn't distract you from what Perry does best: introducing you to rural America one unique individual at a time."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"POPULATION: 485 - MEETING YOUR NEIGHBORS ONE SIREN AT A TIME is a collection of essays written by Michael Perry, an EMT and nurse whose reflections on life and death in a small Wisconsin town are, at turns, both hilarious and heartbreaking. The cast of characters is about as eclectic and eccentric as they come and though Perry does indulge in some cockeyed and occasionally dark humor, it's always balanced out by his obvious empathy for his fellow man. In a voice that is refreshingly honest and painfully real, Perry weaves a heartwarming tapestry using story threads that represent some of the highest and lowest (and occasionally final) moments in his neighbors' lives. His literary style and introspective observations are both distinctive and disarming, creating a reading experience that is satisfying on many levels. Perry may be a small-town boy at heart but his tales about the sometimes tragic and often quirky ebb and flow of life in this tiny rural community will resonate within the hearts of even the biggest city dwellers."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"It was one of the most interesting and humerous books that I have read in a really long time.I so enjoyed 'riding along' with him as he followed his Mom to the scene of an accident."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"I'd been wanting to get this book for a very long time as I used to stop in New Auburn frequently back when I worked as a government consultant for the telephone cooperatives in WI.

I am from WI and can relate to the book and the author. Kept waiting for the story to develop but then realized all the people he was describing was the story"},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"This is a molecular level view of rural Wisconsin, written by a native son, and it will change your own molecules in the reading of it. It is an exploration of life, then mortality (\\"sometimes I go to the forest and prepare to die\\"), then life again, and as such, it is something of a comeback story (we collect those). So wide-ranging it is a bit impossible to categorize because the author takes as his subject life and death. Perry is some kind of old soul who is open to experience of every kind, yet he does not ever let it make him bitter, hard or cold, and he never loses the wonder of it all. And his experiences are vast, elemental, and terrifying, for he is a volunteer firefighter and rescue medic. He meets with all of humanity --- hands-on --- at their most vulnerable hour, he truly does see it all, things you and I, dear reader, never see, at least not up close (unless you are in the business of saving lives). And it \\"all\\" makes him broader, wiser, more centered, even the tragedies that he must face on a 24-hour call basis. This, alone, is a remarkable accomplishment; that he can convey so compactly, so accurately - all the more so. (He has no TV; that opens up some time.) He is a runner, ex-bodybuilder, cyclist (who ran into a concrete abutment), who can knock them back with his fellow firefighters, yet takes delight in a rural dance theater operated by a pair of flamboyant elders. (In this book, you just don't know what is coming down the road next because Perry doesn't either; the ending will flatten you, but you will recover, as did the author and his subjects.) Most of all, Michael Perry is his own man. There aren't too many like that anymore who aren't self-grafted onto various \`ism's,' or drugged by drugs or television, or mislead by any number of things that can take us down the wrong path. An original voice. We will seek out and read other of his titles; what better compliment to a writer than that?Excerpts\\"There are times when rescue is nothing more than organized physical assault. Sometimes I wish we would just leave people be, let them slip quietly over the vale. Sometimes life is not ours to save. Driving east one day, I passed an abandoned farmstead glittering in the winter sun, and thinking of the hands that built the tumbled wooden buildings, I suddenly saw death as a peaceful thing, an opportunity to check out of the game, to dispense with toil and trouble, an inky comfort in the unknown. No more appointments, no more petty recriminations, no phones, no more hurry or worry. Gonna be easy from now on, as the song goes.\\" P 141\\"My secret weapon has always been being too dumb to quit....\\" P 205\\"...

As such, I was certain Michael Perry's memoir Population 485: Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren At A Time was ripe for some good stories.I was not disappointed. Perry's essays about returning to his hometown in Wisconsin and volunteering for the local fire department are excellent and thought-provoking reading.The essays in the beginning are laugh-out-loud funny as Perry makes fun of himself and his hometown in the way only someone who knows and loves it can. The memoir is really about community, as he says \\"I am becoming fixed on what it means to live deeply in a place, to move about in it, as opposed to pass through it.\\"Drawn together by the sounding of the fire alarm, the people of New Auburn are treated with dignity by first responders and Perry's writing. The funny stories are interspersed with tragedy, just like the calls the fire fighters answer. There are gritty tales of death and the guys who have to clean it up. The final essay was a powerful story of life, death and community. The writing was amazing, strong and descriptive and I used my Kindle dictionary a lot, but it was never pretentious."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Michael Perry tells an interesting tale of his little town in the back parts of Wisconsin.

The stories Perry relates are by turns poignant, tragic, amusing, and ironic, while being a sympathetic but honest portrayal of those he writes about. Three of the review excerpts quoted in my copy compare Perry to Garrison Keillor, but this does Perry a disservice: the people he writes about are not caricatures or stereotypes, set in an idyllically quirky town, but rather are real people whom Perry respects as such while acknowledging their struggles, quirks, shortcomings, and virtues. This is perhaps most true in Perry's periodic commentaries on himself, which show some of the most honest, self-aware insights I've ever read from an author. There are factual truths; and there are those Truths of being, the ones that get equated with Beauty. \\"Population: 485\\" isn't about the Truths epic in scale, but is often about smaller Truths of a personal scale. Perry handles these with humility and without being at all maudlin. The writing is excellent -- clear and unpretentious -- and the book is an easy read, written such that one can read it in bits and pieces. On a few occasions it might send you to the dictionary, but that's a good thing for all of us. So often in reading this book I strongly felt, \\"This is GOOD...\\", that I made a point to recommending it to many people I know will appreciate it."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Many beautiful things in life also tend to be the most dangerous. Michael Perry's writing can be placed into this category - beautiful, yet dangerous. His writing rhythm is poetic, his mastery of the English language in tremendous, but his words, they are dangerous. Seriously - dangerous.

I double-dog dare you."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"It might be best to read Perry's Wisconsin books in the order in which he wrote them. This was the first. I read TRUCK: A LOVE STORY first. POPULATION: 485 is wonderfully written and engaging, but has darker moments due to the passages about Perry's volunteer fire department calls. TRUCK is softer and funnier although there are plenty of funny moments in this book, too. I laughed out loud at the scene in which he is using a sewer snake for the first time!Perry's Wisconsin books are about everyday life, but he never \\"dumbs down\\" the vocabulary. He has a musical command of the English language and gives descriptions that make me wish I could see things like he does.Humor is awfully hard to write. Michael Perry does it very well while simultaneously telling good stories."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"I stumbled across this book while searching for firefighting stories.

The author tells a great story."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"I thought after reading Michael Perry's essays, this would reflect life in his small town of New Auburn.

Being in a (somewhat larger town) volunteer fire department myself, I could put a face to every character and relate to my own stories with our own members. The last chapter in particular is a great show of the twist that our lives often take at the blink of an eye, the beep of a pager...Population: 485 is not just a book about being a firefighter/EMT; in a far deeper sense it is a tale of self-discovery and finding out just where home really is. Having lived in &quot;the big city&quot; and now being in the process of forming my own hometown experience, Population: 485 really does make one think about what life in a small town really is like.Mike Perry's writing is conversational enough to be a quick, fun read but yet reflective of his truly literary character.

He or she states that this book lacked a central crisis or theme or pole to wrap itself around. I would argue that the land--New Auburn is the central character that ties every story in this book together, even more than Mike Perry himself does. Perhaps this is because this reviewer has never lived in Northwestern Wisconsin...I recently moved from Eau Claire, WI to Boulder, CO and though the land here is majestic with its rising beautifully snow-topped crests, it pales in comparison to the beauty of Wisconsin. Wisconsin's land tells its own story and we simply interact with it and tells it our stories."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Mike Perry's contemporary memoir, Population: 485 - Meeting Your Neighbor's One Siren at a Time, is essential reading for our time. Perry's prose is engaging, vivid and compelling, sophisticated, yet not over-wrought. In addition to the the author's enviably-rendered prose, the subject matter - small town life in rural Wisconsin - as viewed from the perspective of a volunteer fire department paramedic poet - is fascinating. I grew up in a larger Wisconsin city, which has since \\"gone to seed,\\" to put it politely. The ways in which a changing economy that favors a minority elite and tests the wills of the majority, who struggle - often with astonishingly commendable grace, to carry on, to survive conflagrations both real and figurative, is truly inspiring. Perry's world is ours, in all its seemingly oxymoronic complex simplicity, beauty, humor and sorrow."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"In many ways this book deserves the highest praise: well written, thought provoking, and in some cases very funny. Yet at times seemed justified for an average rating because it did seem to drag and Mr. Perry chose to wordsmith just a bit too much for me. However, I believe the book can offer every reader something of value and would recommend you take the time to visit Mr. Perry and the town of New Auburn.It should be pointed out that the book isn't intended for the weak. Perry's story's are graphic and hard hitting and if death bothers you; enter cautiously. From a personal perspectives this made the book for me and the authors ability to make me feel a part of each scenario added to my enjoyment.I travel on occasion on Route 53 heading North to Duluth.... I plan on stopping to take a look and catch me some food at the local diner. Thanks Michael for sharing your stories."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Michael Perry's every page drips with humor, intrigue, and dexterity. He is truly a master of words! His simple country bumpkin way of life stands juxtaposed to his extreme intellect--a beautiful combination that makes his writing style quite unique and thoroughly enjoyable. Even if the story seems at times a monotonous New Auburn history lesson, one should read it for the sheer joy of watching Perry turn a phrase."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Since reading this book, Michael Perry has quickly become one of my favorite authors. His writing style is humorous but at the same time heartfelt and sincere. Population 485 is about Michael's return to his hometown and his adventures on the volunteer fire department. The people in the town are the characters and by the end of the book, you feel as if you've know them yourself."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"From the little I'd read about this book, I expected some warm, perhaps funny vignettes about life in a rural town. This book is much more! It's laugh-out-loud funny: I read several passages to my family. It also gives an insider's view of the world of volunteer firefighting and EMT/ambulance work. The author uses an impressive range of voices--from \\"local yokel\\" to knowledgeable medical professional, essay writer, and lover of poetry. My favorite book of the year so far!"},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"MIchael Perry is a good writer. Any reader will feel instantly at home and comfortable reading one of his books. Population 485 accurately describes life in a small town. People know and care for each other. This emotion comes through in Population 485. If you want to feel good about the spirit of America, read this book."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Mike Perry is one of the best new authors to come along in a while. We started off reading/listening to this book (audiobook), and now my entire friends and family can't get enough of him. I recently saw him at a reading in Seattle, and he's just as great in person.Funny, real, honest - if you can understand the beauty of old cars, relationships, loving people that aren't perfect (who is?), and can still be open-minded to people of all beliefs, then Mike's your kinda guy."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"You know that small, faded town you pass through on your way to Somewhere Else? These are the folks who live there. Having grown up in New Auburn, Wisconsin, but moving away to make his way in the world, writer Michael Perry returns home some years later and joins the local fire department as a way of reconnecting with his community. In the book he alternates between relating his experiences as a small-town volunteer firefighter and first-responder and giving fleeting glimpses into the lives and personalities of some of his teammates and fellow residents. The detailed emergency calls were fun to read about, but more than once I made the mistake of reading while having lunch! I generally don't pick up many non-fiction books, but I read this as part of the \\"Eden Prairie Reads\\" community program (www.epreads.org)."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"This was an excellent read, by all accounts. The author's ability to articulately convey time, imagery, flavor, and life was superb.As a fellow volunteer in fire and rescue, it was wonderful to read his accounts of life and death as presented with humanistic grace.Would be a great book for an upper-level high school or college english class."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"I live in a town of 18,000 in Wisconin and work in healthcare. This is a remarkably well written work from the heart. It is a delight to have found a book that so eloquently captures many of the sentiments that are generated by the privledges and difficulties inherent in caring for ones neighbors. Very touching - without being maudlin."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"A really enjoyable book. Perry is an excellent writer--a style that captures you. The book gives a great look into what volunteer firefighters do on an everyday basis, and he throws in some humor as well."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"I live in a small N.E. town, but no I am not a member of the volunteer FD or an EMT. I do own a scanner (like a good many people in town) and rely on the services of my neighbors who answer their pagers! I feel secure knowing who they are and that they carry pagers. I do breath a sigh of relief when they show at a scene and I can turn a situation over to them.Perry is an amazing observer and who paints his people, especially himself and his family, and their landscape with a fine hand. The last chapter of the book &quot;Sarah&quot; I found poignant, but not maudelin, and reread several times. Finishingthe book was like finishing a cup of coffee and natter with a good friend.The layout of the book within each chapter is simply a series of humerous vignettes, or parts of one, alternating with Perry's take on life whether in a small town or in the general scheme.Unfortunately, I found some of Perry's alternate &quot;takes&quot; and similes a bit too erudite, and at times, the vocabulary, even sophomoric. The writing, in these instances, could have been a bit more &quot;lean and mean.&quot;However, what kept me going through the book was that Perry, in my opinion, gets the &quot;takes&quot; good most of the time. The one on &quot;sense of place&quot; is almost Benedictan in its outlook, while &quot;sleeping in the woods&quot; could be Buddist in its outlook.While I am not going to rush out and buy several dozen copies of this book to distribute to my firefighter friends, I will look forward to hearing more about and reading more of Michael Perry's writings."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"I read the first chapter of Population 485 in Rosebud magazine a few months back. Immediately, I recognized it as being one of the best pieces of writing I'd ever had the priviledge to read. Before purchasing the book, I noticed that Michael Perry was coming through Denver on his book tour...so I held back from making my purchase, so that I could meet him and get a copy signed.What can I say about this beautiful treasure? Actually, there's quite a bit. I want to quote twice from the book (first from the first chapter, second from the final chapter). These are two of my favorite passages:1. &quot;She is crying out, and we are doing what we can, but she feels death pressing at her chest. She tells us this, and we deny it, tell her no, no, help is on the way.&quot;2. &quot;Somewhere on I-80, still in Iowa, west-bound, mile marker 13, a little overpass, a blackbird teeters on a wire, flutters against the crosswind, and just as we pass beneath, he allows himself to be swept aloft and I think, these are the moments that fine-tune the spin of the earth.&quot;Thematically, Perry writes of the intimacies evident in all relationships between humans. Be that neighborly, romantically, professionally. In the end, we are all willing and able to help those in need because...in the end, we just might need their help when our time comes."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"This is a memoir and a darned good one. You become part of a small town named New Auburn, WI as Mr. Perry invites you into his world and .... you want to come. He returns to the area of his childhood and expresses his love of the area in many ways. There are many wonderful tales of small town life and touching words by the author. The whole book is very good, but the last 3 chapters are the best: Oops - Penultimate- and Sarah. The last chapter is sad and winds the story up in a satisfying manner."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Despite the rather rough appearance of the author in the book's photo of him, don't be deceived -- this man is a poet -- as well as someone with a heart and a wonderful sense of humor. Having grown up in Atlanta, my experience with small towns is limited and only as I've grown older does their appeal reach out to me. Mr. Perry tells stories that made me laugh out loud -- and yes, made me cry a little, too. They are touching, funny, warm -- what else can I say? Read this little treasure -- you'll love it."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"I recently completed Population: 485 and found that it hit very close to home. I grew up in a town smaller that New Auburn, helped with the VFD and then moved away for a while only to recently return. Reading the book reminded me of why I came back.The characters are the type that are readily noticed in a small town because you are more likely to know everyone. The spirit of community when someone is in need is indeed true. From my own experience, the person that cusses you the louded everyday may very well be the first to offer help when needed. You may not have a lot of common most of the time, but you pull together in the darkest hours.I would recommend this book for anyone who has ever lived in a small town, ever served in fire/EMS service or ever wanted to do do either.The stories are compelling. The writing, while fanciful at times is well adapted to the subject. It was a quick read, partially because I couldn't put it down.All in all a ... good book"},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"I picked-up this book after hearing him on the radio and I thought it was fabulous! His writing style is easy to read, yet not simplistic. I was continually amazed at the humor and clarity he brought to each situation. As a mid-westernern I could relate to the sights and sounds, but anyone can enjoy and appreciate his humor and wisdom. I am so glad to have found this author!"},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Perry has the feel of a small town, from the point of view of a volunteer, down pat. I know, I live in the same small town in Tennessee, and am an active member of the Pine Grove Volunteer Fire Department. His details are technically correct, and presented from my own point of view! It drags and wanders a little in places, but was so much fun that I attribute the transgressions to one more quirky member of the VFD. If I ever have an accident in Cheesetown, I hope it's in Nabburn!"},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"The reviews above have covered the content pretty well, but I would like to point out that this book has a far wider range of interest than those who are EMTs or volunteer firefighters (though I certainly see why they would love it.) Perry's perceptions, whether about a dramatic fire or about a small-town Saturday night down at the fish supper, are infused with insight, interesting descriptions, a rare take on people, and wit (at times the &quot;laugh out loud&quot; variety). Perry's writing style is at times a little manic (I don't mean that in a bad way) and his mind seems to be racing, allowing you to be hit with some of the same mile-a-minute perceptions that he's faced with in the interesting town of New Auburn, WI (or &quot;Nobbern,&quot; as pronounced by the old-timers.) In short, a tremendously satisfying book."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Hilarious Book!! I love it because it's exactly like my hometown!! So I can relate to the story :)"},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"What a treat to find this great new book! This is a memoir by the most interesting character you could imagine. Michael Perry is a poet, a registered nurse, a trained EMT and a volunteer fire fighter. After years away from his small home town in rural Wisconsin, he returns and writes about the things that happen to him there. The result is a funny and often moving account of the things that are really important in life - with insights that can be gained only from a man faced daily with life and death situations. Perry has a beautiful cadence to his storytelling and makes the transition from laugh out loud storytelling to heart-wrenching tragedies seamlessly. I swallowed the book whole and marked up my copy with underlined quotations and margins full of stars of agreement. A definite must-read."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"I am a former resident of the small town in Mike Perry's new book, Population 485. Thinking the book would be a humorous depiction of life in the midwest, I settled down for a light-hearted story. Though there was indeed some laughter, there was also tears and wisdom gained through Mike's insights on the meaning of life. This ranks as one of my favorite books and highly recommend it to everyone. I am now looking forward to his next book!"},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Lyrical, sometimes funny, often meditative observations on small-town life. This book is similar in flavor to Thomas Lynch's The Undertaking. The author's ruminations about his life, past and present, arise out of the emergency calls he responds to as a part his town's volunteer fire department and EMS response unit. While the subject matter may seem depressing, it certainly is much more about life, especially the well lived life, rather than death. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Author Michael Perry is a poet, registered nurse, EMT (emergency medical technician) and volunteer firefighter in northern Wisconsin. Perry grew up on the family farm and rarely went to town for anything but school activities. Now, 20 years later, he's been away and moved back. He lives in a weather-worn-house on Main Street in this town of 485 where good-paying jobs are 30- or 40-miles away.Perry's memoirs, Population: 485, Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time, is a breathtaking account of life in small-town America where weirdoes and oddballs, the upscale and the downtrodden, the fast lane and the slow pace all merge as the fabric of community life.After years away he returns and writes about being a townie and foreigner at the same time. The result is funny and moving, an account of things that are truly important in life with insights that can only be provided by one who faces moments of life and death daily. Rarely but occasionally childbirth occurs in the arms of the rescue squad. One of Perry's ambulances carries the insignia of a stork, departmental recognition of its delivery on-board. More frequently and without regard to religious preference, income status, political belief or necessarily age, rescue squads see life at its other end, and Perry takes you on a ride that shifts between laugh-out-loud storytelling and delicate description of heart-stopping tragedy.Population: 485 could be about this town or any other small town. Once through this book will not be enough. I find myself turning again and again to the description of the farmer's wife armed with a pistol and a Bible or that of the senior member of the fire department, a cross-eyed butcher with one kidney and two ex-wives (both work at the only gas station in town).Perry made me laugh at myself and smile at more than a few of my neighbors in his discussion of lawn ornaments. (Gosh, he must have spent time in Vermont.) &quot;We threw off the chains of tasteful restraint the day they invented plywood,&quot; he says. &quot;The wooden tulip, the plastic sunflower, the begonia-filled toilet, the duck with the windmill wings and even the grandma with polka-dot bloomers bending over in the garden ... is a celebration of where we are. Fake deer, Green Bay Packer ornaments,&quot; (those are rare in Vermont) &quot;and goofy mailboxes; they tell me I am in a place where, for better or worse, I know the code.&quot; And, I would argue, knowing the code is precisely what makes us feel at home.Perry's landscape is neither steam cleaned nor blow-dried. It is one, I believe, that any small town aficionado will take to heart.His stories are great ones about everyday people. I guarantee that if you're familiar with a small town anywhere you'll recognize his characters and find yourself thinking that sounds like someone I know.What I found most remarkable is not just that they are great stories, but that they are true and that Perry layers this collection to a conclusion (this is my warning) that is more powerful than fiction.Michael Perry is an appreciator of people, and Population: 485 will make you one, too."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Population: 485 is starting to take off in volunteer fire and EMS circles. There are two reasons for this. First, it's always great to see a book that glorifies what you do. Second, Perry's experience and way with words allows him to nail many of the details of the work. His passages on emergencies he has dealt with had me nodding my head in recognition, and even sometimes -- as in his section about EMS's obsession with overcomplicated mnemonic devices -- exclaiming my agreement aloud in empty rooms. In these parts of the book, Perry comes closer than any writer I can think of to imparting what it feels like to be an EMT or firefighter in the situations he describes.However, not all the book is about that. To prove his erudition, Perry salts his book with historical information he cannot make interesting compared to his central subject. These end up looking like he's marking time through this short book because he doesn't have anecdotes enough to fill it. (One of his asides about Emperor Trajan, however, was trenchant.) Also, little redundancies from chapter to chapter reveal how this book was stitched together out of separate articles or essays -- either it should have stayed an essay collection, or the editing should have been done more carefully. And occasionally Perry's &quot;macho poet&quot; stylings can be a bit precious.All in all, though, Perry's book is worth a look. It is a quick read, and Perry can turn a phrase well. Most importantly, nothing else I have seen captures the feeling of being a small town volunteer like Population: 485. Writing from Population: 633, I salute the book."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"In one short paragraph, Michael Perry can summon the power to make you laugh, cry and think deeply about the human condition. His considerable powers of observation and description bring his town and his people to life - you find yourself looking for their pickups in the lane next to you. And you find them - because his people are your neighbors, your friends and strangers with the sound turned up too loud - you just never looked at them through Perry's volunteer fireman's goggles before. Buy two copies - one to read and one to save for that day, not too far off, when a first edition Michael Perry will be a thing to treasure."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"This is a beautiful book. When you consider the subject matter, the tragedies of everyday life in a small town, this book risked being dark and depressing. I found it to be quite the opposite. Mike Perry finds the grace that can come from senseless accidents. Buy multiple copies and start handing them out to your friends.(I already wrote a review of this book but it never got posted, so if it ever turns up, I apologize for repeating myself.)"},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"\\"Summer comes on like a zaftig hippie chick, jazzed on chlorophyll and flinging fistfuls of butterflies at the sun.\\"If you're past a certain age, that opening line should remind you of the books that you read in your impressionable years; the ones that made you a reader for life. Think Richard Brautigan. Think Thomas Pynchon. Think Ken Kesey or Hunter S. Thompson.Michael Perry has a sensibility and a style that assimilate the best that these guys had to offer: Brautigan's sweet, sad quirkiness, Pynchon's God's-eye view of his characters' worlds, Kesey's brawny prose and close observational skills, Thompson's prickly - and very funny - clarity of vision and expression. He goes on to outdo them, however, in a book so small and unassuming - and so tender - that you forgive him for knocking your old literary gods into the hog trough.Framed by two stories of such pathos - something lacking in our daily lives as a rule, thank God - that we don't have a premeditated response to it, are a wealth of slice-of-life stories about the little town of New Auburn, Wisconsin, (population 485) that are so lovingly and meticulously rendered that you'll recognize your own town. Your own neighbors. Your own self.The opening piece - \\"Jabowski's Corner\\" - tells the story of a hardworking farm family with a deadly piece of road bisecting their land. Part encomium to the farmer and his wife who raised seven girls and five boys on a rockpatch farm, part euology to the girl so terribly injured on the sharp curve known as Jabowski's Corner, and finally, part tale of Perry's attempt - by joining the local volunteer fire department and EMS squad - to weave his life back into that of the community in the hometown that he left years ago, this is a harrowing tale of faith and loss and love.About the girl, Perry tells us, \\"Seven years since the accident, and this is what freezes me late at night: There was a moment - a still, horrible moment - when the car came squalling to a halt, the violent kinetics spent, and the girl was pinned in silence... The meadowlark sings, the land drops away south to the hazy tamarack bowl of the Big Swamp... all around the land is rank with life... The girl is terribly, terribly alone in a beautiful, beautiful world.\\"Between this horrible, lovely story and the end piece - an equally lachrymose one about Perry's sister-in-law of seven weeks' death under similar circumstances - are a series of meditations and just plain wacky yarns about everything from the semiotics of lawn tchachkes to the night Tricky Jackson wiped out the laundromat. My favorite is the one about the big, boozy, bearded logger who thinks he's having a heart attack. He and his fellow Budmeisters are out in the middle of nowhere, and when the EMS team shows up, and the woodsy mirthmakers hear the words \\"cardiac arrest\\", they surround their downed friend like protective, demented musk oxen - \\"arrest\\" being the only word that penetrates their alcoholic fog.In the final essay, Perry tells us about Sarah, the young girl who marries his thirty-something brother only to die in a car accident seven weeks later. \\"At the wake,\\" he says, \\"it was her hands that made me cry. I would look at them and think of them touching my brother.\\" Which pretty much says all that need be said about the unspoken love between siblings.It takes a big, strong heart, I think, to join an EMS team or to volunteer as a firefighter - to look at people at their weakest and not turn away. It took that same kind of heart to write these stories."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Population: 485 is a book that makes me want to laugh and cry, generally on the same page. I grew up in a small town, worked the VFD then moved away to return some years later. I can readily identify with what Mr. Perry has written in his book. It hits close to home.If you have ever lived in a small town, served on a small fire department/EMS service, or ever wanted to, this is a book you should read.The story involves characters that are unique to small towns and they will make you smile and chuckle. The coming together of people to help one another will make you beam with pride. And the tragedies involved with his work will make you cry with a hurt that is all too familiar.Well written with enough detail to make the experience real Mike Perry has written a book that will reside forever in the dens and family rooms of small town firefighters and EMS workers. Its humanity and inside along with the characters and stories will make it an enjoyable read for anyone.You cannot go wrong with this book."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Nice adventure. Reminds me of sitting on a deck listening to a good storyteller-real stories. True to life. Honest.

Enlightening and endearing."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"My husband and I are from a small town in Montana, were on the VFD, and love this book. If you can see Michael in person on his tour, do so. Very funny, and sincere when he says thank you for coming to see me. The book will make you laugh and sometimes sad. Great stories about everyday people. If you are from a small town you will relate to this book. We just kept thinking, \\"that's sounds like so and so\\".

Michael Perry captures the depth and the tapestry of relationships fostered in a place where fellow inhabitants know their neighbors on many different levels. And diverse they are!I enjoyed all aspects of this book, from the philosophical observations on the human condition, to the human- connectedness amid joy and tragedy. More than being just a &quot;people-watcher&quot;, Author Michael Perry is a &quot;people-appreciater&quot;.

The author grafts one of the most gratifying writing styles I've every had the pleasure to read onto his experiences as an ambulance EMT and a fireman in his small Wisconsin home town. This creates a text of wonderful simplicity and beauty. The cover understates the case of the book. This book grows from the conflict between what we think and believe, and how life actually works out in the day to day details and dramas. (Now here's the improbable part: One Sunday morning, as I dragged my laundry up the hill to the laundry mat at 6 am - to miss the crowds - I saw this book lying in the middle of the street. There'd been rain the night before and it was soaking wet. On my way back from the laundry two hours later, it was still there, so I picked it up and scanned the cover. Interesting. I'll take it home, dry it out, and toss it on the pile. I read between 30 and 40 books a year, so it's quite a pile. I put it on the heater to dry it out - probably not the wisest choice - and when I smelled something toasting, took it off and flopped its wrinkly pages open. I started reading and was instantly hooked, by both the style and the raw honesty of the author. Everything else could wait; I had to read this book.)"},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"OK, I know, no one will find this review 'helpful' because it is not glowing :) But it is honest. I suppose I expected a little more emergency medicine and a little less prose and deep thoughts, although I know it is the juxtaposition of the two elements that is a unique and sometimes attractive feature about Perry's writing. I just found the work a wee bit too &quot;rhapsodic&quot; to quote the author. Perry can turn a phrase but his homilies about life wear you out after a while. If a major dilemma in his life is that he cannot justify his simple roots (replete with &quot;aw shucks&quot; phrases) with his more heady literary aspirations, neither could I. Sorry, I really, really wanted to like this book!"},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Great stories about a small town and its people.

If you're like me, you'll read on, wondering what this book is really about and if you'll again encounter writing as engaging as that first sentence. You will not be disappointed.What this book is about becomes clear at page 206 (paperback edition):\\"I didn't assume I'd be happy back here. I had been essentially absent for more than a decade, and knew the whole prodigal returned thing was fraught with the potential for disappointment ... I didn't expect to pick up where I left off ...

[and] The fire department has been the indispensable catalyst.\\"Before you get to this point, you learn that \\"here\\" is Perry's birthplace, New Auburn, WI, that his twelve-year absence included summers spent as a ranch hand in Wyoming, graduation from nursing school and training/apprenticing as an EMT and as a firefighter. Perry takes you to fires and on medical emergency calls. There are moments of heroism and painfully recalled goof-ups and the sharply limned portraits of those who accompanied him on these calls.Back in \\"Nobburn\\" he continues his life as firefighter/EMT. His mother and a brother are also members of the volunteer fire department. You are taken on EMT calls (skip if this makes you queasy) and you slide along with Perry in the crawl space of a building that is seriously ablaze. When he isn't doing these things, he is writing (articles and books), going on publisher-sponsored book tours and appearing on NPR.Among the many personalities described in the book, you won't soon forget Bob, the Cross-eyed Beagle, whose two ex-wives work together in the same convenience store. Beagle, who is actually cross-eyed, gives a howl-out-loud and slap-your-knees explanation of why he is cockeyed. This cannot be printed in a family newspaper.You learn that Perry is, in mid-forties, still a bachelor and survivor of a long string of almost-got-there relationships. But claiming \\"I am not a marriage grinch,\\" he launches (p. 221) into a moving, must-read paean to the example of married love set by his parents.Toward the end of the book we are introduced to Sarah who has been chasing Perry's brother, Jed, since she was sixteen. Now of age, we meet her when Jed brings her to a fire department social affair. The romance flowers and the pair marry. Sarah brings a vegetable garden, sunshine and order into the household of a neglectful bachelor. Seven weeks after the wedding, Sarah is killed in an automobile accident.Perry writes (p. 234, last page of book): \\"For my brother, there are dark days ahead. The house [is] suffused with her memory, the most perverse sort of tease ...\\"There is a happy resolution to this sadness and to Perry's bachelorhood told in Perry's next book, TRUCK, a love story."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"I had not heard of Michael Perry until I knew he was coming to the Appleton Book Festival. I read Truck first and enjoyed it, and then read Population: 485 next and really wish I would've done it the other way around. But, after reading the Population: 485 book, I don't know if I would have opened the Truck book. Each is different: Population is a series of vignettes, sometimes doubling back on each other. In other words, I could put the book down for a few days and pick it up again without worrying about what I forgot. Truck was more of a flow, more of an actual story. Michael's style is unlike I've ever read, language a little more high-faluting than I expected, but I love his insight and his philosophy. I am looking forward to reading Coop."},{"Title":"Population: 485 : Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time","review":"Life the way it is in rual midwest United States.

Maybe some insights into how to strike a balance in relationships like that. What I found was quite different.This book delivers a few good annecdotes. The descriptions about being in the fire and EMS services, specifically relating to a small town, are truly enlightening.What I didn't enjoy were the constant intellectual conflicts about being a writer (and somone out of place) in such a place. These are often followed by esoteric, English professor-esque discussions. If you want to write something like that, call it Lake Wobbegon Medics or something like that. I can only guess that the book is lengthend by those passages because there are not enough \\"funny\\" or interesting stories about EMS that everyone hasn't heard before. Save up the funny small town stories and come out with a better book, or just trim the number of pages down.I enjoyed Perry's skill as a writer, and maybe I'll check out the book about his truck. Every previous review seems to celebrate this book because it deals with small town fire/EMS or its take on small town life.

Tons of windowsill sunlight, fresh indigenous flowers, classic patchwork bed quilts, exposed cupboards textured with china patterns from generations past and present, a perfectly positioned telescope, clothes line dried in the fresh air, vintage tablecloths draped over a table offering ice tea and croissants, and porches inviting us to spend a leisurely day enjoying the outdoors--all these things remind us that every cottage has a story worth living! Each cottage in this book is presented as unpretentious and practical, yet bright and beautiful, highlighting the simplicity, comfort, humor, and traditions found there. Particularly unique is the author's note of vibrant color introduced in each cottage room, either through unique fabrics or pieces or furniture. The book demonstrates clearly that the colors around us can have a powerful effect on our feelings and even outlook on life. A touch of vibrant color should be a basic element of any cottage home."},{"Title":"The Cottage Book: Living Simple and Easy","review":"Not so much a how-to book as it is a collection of homes to aspire to, The Cottage Book: Living Simple and Easy's combining of photographic examples and Carol Bass' prose transport the reader right into the cottages and their surroundings, with experiences beyond the visual alone.

The accounts of what was happening are excellent. The one thing that I didn't like about this book was the fact that it took the author so long to get to the point of the chapter. He sets the scene but rambles on about things that don't add to the story. I guess he is telling his story the way that he wants to tell it more so than what readers want.

I was of the impression that the F16 was an air superiority fighter, a roll it was not used for at all in the Gulf War. The technical details are good but the story becomes repetative half way through."},{"Title":"Vipers in the Storm: Diary of a Gulf War Fighter Pilot","review":"Rosenkranz provides plenty of details about exactly what a combat pilot does in a very busy F-16 cockpit, and he also details some of the interesting personal history that led him into this career. Unfortunately, he can't resist frequently venturing off into naive political and historical analyses of the wider questions of the war and the threat Iraq posed to the world, reprinting many speech excerpts from President H.W. Bush as justification for what he and his fellow service men and women were doing, extending them, in the end, to justify the current war in Iraq without ever considering the problems incurred by pursuing policy with force in the Middle East. At times the book reads like an instrument of the Republican National Committee campaign to reelect George W. Bush, or at the very least an apologist for the mistakes of both Bush administrations in the Middle East."},{"Title":"Vipers in the Storm: Diary of a Gulf War Fighter Pilot","review":"This is by far the best account of a fighter pilots experiences I have read.

I wanted to find a book which describes all it is to be an F-16 pilot and I found it. The book is descriptive beyond words and it makes the world outside stop when reading it. The book is real, exciting, intense, scary, intriguing, enthralling, addictive, and honest. Amazing! Well done."},{"Title":"Vipers in the Storm: Diary of a Gulf War Fighter Pilot","review":"If Keith Rosenkranz intended to convey what it's like to toggle your F-16's HUD into CCIP mode then roll onto your target with two 500lb Mk-82 bombs in a warzone, well, he nailed it right on the head.The author meticulously describes start up procedures, in-flight protocol and weapon systems/functions in such vivid detail that you can almost smell the cockpit. Rosenkranz attempts to balance this penchant for detail with honest accounts of his day to day life in the desert, along with some of his personal views regarding the war. Be prepared though, the engrossing detail is the primary draw of the book.I'm not sure this book will be your cup of tea if you aren't already strongly interested in military aviation. The author's writing is unique in that he wasn't afraid to include the highly technical details that most writers--who're presumably more concerned with connecting to a larger reader base--shy away from. I expect this one to be a polarizing read for most folks.With that being said, I've read numerous well regarded books focused on military aviation and none of them even come close to Vipers in the Storm."},{"Title":"Vipers in the Storm: Diary of a Gulf War Fighter Pilot","review":"The best aviation book I have ever read.

Me + This Book = Match Made in Heaven. After all, I am a pilot, an aviation enthusiast, and a HUGE history buff! Let's let 'er rip!Well, maybe the aformentioned personal attributes have actually CONTRIBUTED to my disappointment. This book amounts to a 200+ page detailed information dump about every switch flipped, every button pushed and every word spoken on God-knows-how-many sorties. And beware: each time out it is the same thing.Want to get some pilot's perspective details about the F-16? Haha...Sucker! Did you think you would get a military man's perspective about the operation in general in anything but the most, let's say, &quot;simplistic&quot; terms? Again, you bought the wrong book. How about an inside look at the real interactions between fellow fighter pilots, perhaps after the mission? Uh-uh. Rosenkranz is a good soldier: a simple box on the chain of command that knows what buttons to push and when to eat and sleep. He gets in the cockpit, reads his mission details for the recorder, and when he nears the target he operates his weapons systems, and then comes home, heads to the beer tent, goes to bed, gets up the next morning, and does it again. And again.When you read this book you get the impression that Keith Rosenkrantz is under some sort of pressure to keep everything low key and not expose too much, whether personal or professional, because it might affect his career.The only time when he wrote about his feelings in anything but superficial terms is when he exchanged letters with someone who was against the action in Iraq. &quot;I wish I could have seen his face when he read my letter&quot;, Rosenkranz muses, I guess imagining the devastating effect that the tired old &quot;price of freedom&quot; missive he fired back must have had on its recipient.I would give anything to be able to fly the F-16 and do what Keith did, but only because I don't believe his bland account is all there is to flying such a ship in wartime or any other time, for that matter.Is the author brave and competent and am I proud that he is a fellow American? Sure! But we can separate what we think about the man from his book and its contents."},{"Title":"Vipers in the Storm: Diary of a Gulf War Fighter Pilot","review":"The book, \\"Vipers In the Storm\\" is a real life tale of a modern war hero, Keith Rosenkranz, Captain USAF. The foreward by Vice President Dick Cheney sums it up by saying how fortunate we are as Americans to have dedicated heroes like Keith Rosenkranz fighting for our freedom. This is a must read book for anyone interested in modern air warfare, the real life accounts of the Gulf War, and for those interested in heroism at its best. I understand that several readers of Vipers In The Storm actually joined the USAF and are now flying fighter jets for our country - all inspired by Captian Rosenkranz (Rosey). The Captain writes vivid accounts of both his personal feelings and the combat he was a part of on a daily basis. With more potential conflict ahead of the United States, this is an important book to read and gain a foundation of the United States previous battles in Iraq.The author's website ... is also a must see. The author responds to email which makes this book even a better buy.I enjoyed the book and the accounts of Captain Rosenkranz. This book is worthy of the best seller list!"},{"Title":"Vipers in the Storm: Diary of a Gulf War Fighter Pilot","review":"Boy, I loved this book. As someone who's NOT a pilot and NOT in the military, this book provided a TON of insight into the day-to-day life of a combat pilot.One way to see what it's like to be a fighter pilot is to buy a combat flight sim for your PC. Sometimes I wonder how real these are. However, when reading Rosey's account, I can say, they're pretty real!So many times I've forgone all tasks other than countering a missile threat. So many times I've almost flown into the ground at night. Rosey did these, too, and I can't imagine how it feels to really see a SAM guiding on you, coming out of the clouds.In addition to a lot of things flight sim fans have gone through, Rosey adds a lot of real life perspective. I laughed when he described how F-16 pilots bring 'piddle packs' on long flights and he described how he went about not making a mess with them. I laughed again when he described bringing a granola bar with him on flights, for the ride home after a bombing run. I've often gotten up while playing a flight sim and gone to the fridge for a snack.For flight sim fans, this book should be REQUIRED READING. It gives a great perspective on how missions are planned and carried out. I was surprised by a lot of the real-life aspects of combat flight and was equally surprised by some of the aspects that read the same way an 'after-action' report from a flight sim mission reads. I'm still blown away by a couple of the mission accounts when Rosey went 'downtown'."},{"Title":"Vipers in the Storm: Diary of a Gulf War Fighter Pilot","review":"Rosenkranz is no Hemingway, but he does a good job of telling the entire story of his experience in Desert Storm. One of the things this book has that others about similar experiences lack is the emphasis on the human aspects of war (the moral issues that come from killing people, the toll that being away from one's family takes.) I immensely enjoyed the fact that this book shows that you don't have to be gung-ho all the time to be a good military man, and it in fact has given me more respect for those that serve our country because of the way it relates that one's primary drive to go to war should stem from a strong sense of duty rather than a sense of thrill."},{"Title":"Vipers in the Storm: Diary of a Gulf War Fighter Pilot","review":"Written from a first person point of view, Keith &quot;Rosey&quot; Rosenkranz takes the reader along with him in his F-16C through the exciting and, at times, terrifying combat sequences in the Gulf War. From the air to air combat during a bombing mission in the first chapter through the end of the war over Basra, his descriptions are vivid without becoming mired down in military jargon and acronyms. He presents the F-16C, its maintainers and the men flying the airplane as an entire weapons system, offering many details only available from a first hand account. He shares the commraderie and trials of squadron life and offers a hearty glimpse into the world of a USAF fighter pilot.As if the book weren't enough, the author has an accompanying website ... . This innovative site is a perfect companion to the book and includes a wealth of technical details, lots of photos and an interactive &quot;Viper&quot; cockpit. He even includes actual HUD display tapes from his missions (listed by chapter) in a real player format along with other video sequences. The only thing missing are the G forces!"},{"Title":"Vipers in the Storm: Diary of a Gulf War Fighter Pilot","review":"My son and I read Vipers in the Storm together. We were soon engrossed in Capt. Rosenkranz's training and preparation for action in Desert Shield & Desert Storm.Capt. Rosenkranz's book is not the typical \\"shoot \`em up\\" war story. \\"Rosey,\\" his Viper call sign, first describes his desert training and then gives the reader some background leading up to the Gulf War. I found this invaluable, as my son was not even born when the Storm ended. It's also a great review for us older folks who may have forgotten a thing or two, or maybe didn't know the rest of the story!Throughout the book, Rosey describes his personal feelings, his worries, disappointments, love for family, and sadness and horror. Nothing is left out. His attention to detail and accuracy is outstanding. When you finish this great book you, too, will have a new measure of appreciation for America's Viper drivers, which is personified here by Keith Rosenkranz.Although the book impressed me, it made even a bigger impression on my 10-year-old. With the current situation with Iraq, the book gave him cause to question current events with me and has impressed on him what we are transitioning to in the Gulf today. Rosey's love for his family, and separation from them, as well as the training, downtime, and losses he wrote of, vividly portray the struggles our pilots have faced and are facing today.When the \\"action\\" does start, Rosey pulls no punches and again accurately describes the entire mission from turning on the VTR and titling his tape to munching a granola bar at 36,000 feet on the flight home. In between those times, Rosey recounts some hair-raising incidents, again in great detail. Rosey's account of his 30 combat missions should dispel any doubts that America's fighter pilots \\"just push buttons.\\" What makes Capt. Rozenkran's missions even more amazing is that most of them were flown at night, using LANTIRN!Rosey completed his missions in the finest tradition of the U.S. Air Force, and he does recognize the enemy were human beings doing their job for their nation. With a mixture of fear, exhilaration, sadness, relief, and joy when the ordnance was on target, each mission is professionally accomplished. Errors, when they happen, are not glossed over but spoken of honestly and learned from.For the flight sim pilot, veteran pilot, aviation enthusiast, young person interested in the USAF, or reader wondering what our Air Force did (or may do again) in the Gulf, Capt. Rosenkranz's work will leave you about as breathless as he was when he watched the SAMs launching below him. My thanks to the author, and all Viper drivers, for their dedication, and thanks, Keith, for instilling in my son a desire to fly with the best someday."},{"Title":"Vipers in the Storm: Diary of a Gulf War Fighter Pilot","review":"First-hand reports are always the best, and this book is certainly one of the top raters that I have read.

I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in military aviation."},{"Title":"Vipers in the Storm: Diary of a Gulf War Fighter Pilot","review":"This is a brilliant book.For anyone interested in military aviation or modern warfare I can only recommend reading Keith Rosenkrantz's excellent account of his part in the first Gulf War.This book is well written, easy to read, detailed and personal in a way many of these books fail to be.As a pilot myself (commercial) and having always dreamed of flying such aviation exotica as the F-16, this book is the key for us mere mortals to step into the world of the modern fighter pilot. It gives you a taste of the discipline, courage and commitment required.For all this and much more you should definitely check out Vipers in the Storm.When you're finished reading it drop Rosey a line, like I did to thank him for sharing his experiences. His email address is at the back of the book and he was gracious enough to reply to my message too. An officer and a gentleman not to mention hero."},{"Title":"Vipers in the Storm: Diary of a Gulf War Fighter Pilot","review":"Keith Rosenkranz has shown the human side to the awesome warrior that sits at the controls of the F-16 'Viper'. The bond that exists amongst squadron mates is there but also, and more importantly, his devotion to his family. His realistic and pragmatic call to duty was supported by his loving wife and unknowingly by his two young daughters. He heeded the call to arms like a lion out for the hunt: with dedication to his duty but at the same time concerned for his family. Mr. Rosenkranz's prose is excellent and makes from some excellent reading. The book was extremely difficult to put down and offered a close look at what a fighterpilot's life is like overseas. The technical jargon is there but accessible to everyone. The patriotism and devotion to God and Country abound with honor and humbleness. To many who could not be there in person, Keith Rosenkranz instills patriotism and love for one's country. This book is a must read for anyone interesting in the Air War over the Gulf or anyone interested in an &quot;I was there&quot; unbiased view about aerial combat. Thank you Keith and the rest of the Spiders!"},{"Title":"Vipers in the Storm: Diary of a Gulf War Fighter Pilot","review":"Based on my experience as a 15-year veteran of the Air Force and Air National Guard this is the most accurate account of military operations I've read yet.

The ups and downs of being stationed in a remote air force base in the UAE are chronicled in personal detail. The kind of detail you could not even get if you were there. The emotional ups and down, the internal conflict of war, as well as the pride of Freedom and the moral certainly of doing the right thing. The contradictory nature of emotions is not glossed over. This is not AIr Force propaganda, but on the other hand, this is not a Vendetta against the Air Force. This is a real life look behind the eyes of one of the proud american fighter pilots. Keith Rosenkranz has the right stuff."},{"Title":"Vipers in the Storm: Diary of a Gulf War Fighter Pilot","review":"I gave this book as a gift to my husband and he's really enjoying it.

It represents the Apotheosis of Wavell's attempt to turn ordinary line regiments into independent, air supported brigades, ranging freely behind the lines to disrupt Japanese communication in Northern Burma, rolling up the Japanese flank from underneath whilst American-led Chinese forces pressed from the North on Myitkyina and its vital airfield.The detail is tense and personal, Calvert was the youngest Brigadier in the British Army and this type of fighting meant that he personally participated in many of the unit actions. From the initial landing of the gliders at \\"Broadway\\" to their final withdrawal this was an epic of major proportions:* Wavell reckoned on an average soldier fighting behind the lines without rest as having, at most, a three month capability before ultimately becoming ineffective. In reality they spent 6 months behing enemy lines in appaling conditions.* From the initial blocking action of the railway, the action is intense. Calvert describes the actions of his East African, Gurkha and English County regiments troops in exquisite detail. We feel the quickening of the pace and our hearts beat faster as we come to realise that they are alone and there is really only one way to come out dead or wounded or alive --- the Japanese would be unlikely to take prisoners.* Calvert covers the actions up the line as the brigade moves up towards the Myitkyina and their gradual wasting due to bad food, jungle diseases and incessent combat with Japanese troops. It is depressing to see these human skeletons that emerged at the end. In Calvert's brigade he emerged with less than 5% effectives when they were finally linked up with the Americans and Vinegar Joe Stillwell.* Stillwell, although a tough US commander, really lets his Anglophobia cloud his judgement. His berating of Calvert and his Chindits betrays a gross ignorance about the real hell that Calvert and his men faced. Not to diminish the actions of Stillwell, but it really was beyond anything that Stillwell and his men, directly supplied and linked with base resources, ever underwent. My esteem for Stillwell, suffered severely. Calvert with typical British understatment offers us a good example of the stoic qualities of his race. Forbearance even after suffering horribly, is a lesson we can all learn.Some may find Calvert's visceral hatred of the Japanese unappealing. But that to is an aspect of history and one that, given the circumstances, we may be able to understand.This is one of the better personal accounts of the Burma War I have read."},{"Title":"I Live in the City ABC","review":"Lovely, loving, homey text for city-dwelling children and their parents.

The message Maharaji brought when he was 13 is the same message he brings now: \\"What you are looking for is within you.\\""},{"Title":"Who is Guru Maharaj Ji?","review":"Some reviewers would like you to believe that THIS book is the \\"true\\" story of Prem Rawat. They would have you believe his following is \\"dwindling\\" in the West. I lived through the \\"Who is Gugu Majaraji\\" era and am here to tell you about it. Mr. Rawat (I will refer to him from here on out as 'Maharaji') made a definite decision in the late '70's, early 80's to disentangle himself from this Lord of the Universe stuff from the '70's. He made it plain to his students (of which I was one and contine to be) that he was \\"just a human being\\". It should be noted that his father (who had been the master before Maharji) had ALSO been labeled as god incarnate and all this stuff and had ALSO made similar protestations and denials to HIS followers.It must be remembered that all these ideas come from India and Indian culture. It's perfectly natural to consider your guru as god in India. It's part of the culture. And calling your guru 'god' sounds a whole lot different in India than it does when you say it in the monothestic West.It also has to be remembered that the first people to introduce Maharaji and his message to the West were Indians -- they told us American kids that Maharaji was Lord of the Universe and all. Plus, the message, itself, was deeply encrusted with Indian cultural mores and notions. As Maharaji spent more and more time in the West, he apparently saw the shortcomings of having everything he stands for being seen through an Indian cultural prism. Over the course of a couple of years back in the late 70's and early '80's, he methodically began stripping away the trappings of India that many of his students (me included) had come to trust, depend on and -- in our American kind of way -- \\"believe\\" in.The four techniques Maharaji teaches used to have descriptive names, derived from Indian scripture primarily -- he told us to drop the names; the techniques now became simply number 1, 2, 3, and 4.Indian words and phrases had crept into the vocabulary of his students, many of us had actual alters in our homes like you'd see in India. Mahraji started mocking these cultural adaptations when he would address us -- it was clear he wanted us to give up these Indian affectations of ours and be . . . well, Americans. We complied, for the most part.Also, in the \\"old days\\", Maharaji would talk about God and finding God within you and all this stuff. Gradually, all those references faded away for the most part to be replaced with more and more references to 'peace within' and/or 'happiness'. The whole bent of his exertions was to de-spiritualize every aspect of both his message and the actual techniques themselves.He'd always from his first days in the West said the techniques (collectively known as 'Knowledge') were practical and that Knowledge was not a religion. As time went by, and he made fewer and fewer references to God or scriptures in his addresses -- and as he decidedly put the kabosh on all the little Indian ritualistic guru-worship stuff that had become a part of our expression of graditude to him . . . such as us lustily singing a little ditty called 'Lord of the Universe' to him . . . he finally got his way. The techniques of Knowledge and its presentation, our interactions with Maharaji -- it all became more and more streamlined, simple, stripped of the baroque little flourishes which had once defined and elaborated our expression of the practice of Knowledge.Today? Knowledge's presentation is now so generic, in a sense, that it is difficult to see how it could offend anybody no matter where they live. But all the changes I've seen over the years . . . all surface stuff. The essence has remained unchanged, Lord of the Universe or not.The book, \\"Who is Guru Maharaji\\" recounts many so-called miracles that Maharaji supposedly performed as a boy. But the writing is over-heated and a little giddy . . . anyone familiar with these type of things can recognize not miracles but rather products of a gifted practitioner of chi manipulation (as the term would be used in Chinese Traditional Medicine). That a boy would have these abilities is most unusual, but it is not the stuff of supernaturalism or a qualification for \\"deity\\" status. Do these stories of Maharaji's boyhood have relevance today -- or to the practice of Knowledge? True or not, he has turned his back on them; he has voluntarily stepped down from the pedestal we had begged him to occupy.For whatever reason, Maharaji has stoutly denied that practicing Knowledge has any medical benefits whatsoever. He has steadily proclaimed that if it's miracles we're interested in, understand that this breath of ours is a true miracle. But do we see that? Do we truly understand that? Does he have something to teach us?You have to decide for yourself. One hint, though: your answer won't ultimately come from books."},{"Title":"Who is Guru Maharaj Ji?","review":"The book \\"Who Is Guru Maharaji\\" is as relevant today as \\"Steal This Book\\", by Abbie Hoffman, or \\"The Psychedelic Experience\\" by Timothy Leary. Although these books have little in common except that they are remnants of a culture largely forgotten, the same can be said about them all: they were signposts for lost souls on a mountain that no longer exists.Whether you're rioting on the streets to protest wars, imbibing mild-altering substances, or sitting with your legs crossed in meditation, you'll be a whacked-out anachronism if you present the image portrayed in these books to your family gathering or corporate picnic.Today, people are protesting environmental atrocities, imbibing new and improved mind-altering substances and still searching for inner peace, but they're looking for guidelines written by contemporary people in a language and milieu that contemporary people can relate to. Of these three, only Maharaji (now known as Prem Rawat) has changed his tune so that his message can be understood and digested by people in rapidly changing times - unless of course you're still wearing your headband and bangles.To those trying to resurrect lost manuscripts of the '70's: get a life. To those intent on finding inner peace: try Prem Rawat's current message on for size."},{"Title":"Who is Guru Maharaj Ji?","review":"In the early 80s, Prem Rawat (aka Maharaji, aka Guru Maharaj Ji) and his organization directed that members of his cult destroy material like this book, which clearly reveal that Mr. Rawat considers himself to be the Lord of the Universe, and the Perfect Master of Our Time, a kind of messiah, equivalent to Jesus Christ, Krishna and Buddha. The fact that so many copies of this particular book remain in circulation, along with the closely related video \\"Lord of the Universe,\\" a documentary of the \\"Millennium\\" event Prem Rawat/Maharaji held at the Houston Astrodome in 1973, is very inconvenient with Mr. Rawat's highly paid PR campaign, which is trying to revise the past and pretend that the events and teachings outlined in this book, never occurred. Note that unlike his book \\"Clarity\\" that is available also on Amazon.com, this book is not being marketed by Mr. Rawat's organization, because I'm sure they find it highly embarrassing.What is especially interesting about this book are the stories of various devotees of Mr. Rawat in which they explain how they came to his \\"lotus feet.\\" Unabashedly proclaiming their belief in his divinity, supernatural powers, and over-flowing wisdom despite his young age, they reveal a lot about the power of self and group delusion, and how a Guru coming from a family long in the Guru business, was able to take advantage of people who, for the most part, sincerely wanted to believe in him and his \\"divine plan\\" to bring peace to the world.That Mr. Rawat currently has dwindling numbers of followers in the West, and seems to have done not much more since this book was published in 1973 than accumulate vast wealth for himself, bears witness to what that \\"divine plan\\" actually consisted of and how misdirected those devotees were."},{"Title":"Who is Guru Maharaj Ji?","review":"This 1973 book is a must read for anyone looking for information about Prem Rawat's (aka Guru Maharaj Ji's)life and background.

The story of this first book begins with VE day. The end of the war in Europe heralds a newer war with the Soviets. Monopolizing and exploiting German technological breakthroughs will be critical in the new cold war. In \\"Stormbirds\\", a cadre of USAF officers gathers captured German rockets and planes in a remote desert base. They've got captured pilots and scientists as well - but can't trust them much. Instead, using ENIAC, they amass a small number of USAAF pilots with the idea of forming the first of America's jet fighter squadrons. Distrust of the Germans and their planes is only one the problems - our heroes must also contend with an insane chain of command determined to make the cranky planes work and fight in ways they were not designed to be used. Kelleher obviously devoted a lot of time to detail other writers would have glossed over (especially in one unforgettable scene describing a hideous end for the luckless pilot of a rocket plane). If the characters aren't exactly out of Henry James, they're better than the mannequins of other books, and the flight scenes prove the author has an uncommon interest in the adventure of aviation."},{"Title":"Desert Lightning Sto (Stormbirds, No 1)","review":"It's easy to dismiss this book as just another Mack Bolan type action/adventure novel but don't do it! The writing style is pure pulp fiction but somebody did a lot of research for this book. It's a story about some WWII pilots that get coerced into joining a secret government research project developing captured German technology for U.S. use. The author has little liking for government red tape and mismanagement and takes every opportunity possible to showcase the people in charge making idiotic decisions. What makes the book interesting is that many of the thing depicted as fiction in the book actually happened. The airplanes described are authentic. The action/adventure sequences are total fiction but some of the details of the U.S. bring Germans to the U.S. after WWII to work in the U.S. defense industry are true. It seems very odd that someone writing this type of book would get so many details right. If you don't like action/adventure you will not enjoy this book or the other two in the series. You might want to read it though if you are a government conspiracy buff. If any author puts the government (AEC/FBI/State Department etc) in worse light than Brian Kelleher does in his Storm Birds books I haven't run across them."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"In this book, McKibben argues that humanity needs to shut down large chunks of two areas of technology: stemline genetics research and nanotechnology/robotics. In each case, he works through the possible advantages for people of this research and then thinks about the implications if we go down that path.Genetics research is much farther along, and I found McKibben's concerns in this area convincing. His discussion of nanotechnology seemed over the top to me, reminding me of Michael Creighton's \\"Prey\\" - - which may be my least-favorite Creighton book.The concerns about genetics are very real. If parents can influence the intelligence or athletic ability of their offspring, this will set off an arms race among parents that will exclude people who are not wealthy enough to engage in genetic engineering. Even if everyone can participate, the effects on free-will are chilling: are your achievements your own if your parents chose them for you? If you are designed to love the piano, would you do anything other than given your own children a piano-loving gene? What happens to the species and to society in such a world?The bigger question, which he touches on but does not emphasize, is whether the developed world really needs continued technological advance at all. How much is enough?The challenge, as McKibben recognizes, is how to step back from the brink. He spends a chapter discussing societies that have rejecting technology, such as Japan and guns, China and navies, or the Amish people today. I find the Amish the more interesting and relevant example, especially since they coexist with non-Amish people making different choices. (And quite well, I might add, since I live about 30 miles from an Amish community that interacts with my own community economically in all sorts of ways.)This is a provocative book, well worth reading. The material on genetics deserves five stars but the nanotechnology/robotics chapter doesn't work nearly as well. The sections on \\"how much is enough\\" are also thoughtful."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"Well, Bill McKibben is probably not going to join the Ayn Rand workgroup. In this little-noticed but important book, McKibben discusses the potential dark side of advanced technologies such as genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, robotics and nanotechnology. As opposed to some critics, he concentrates not on the physical danger (e.g. robots becoming smarter than us and taking over), but the threat to our humanness and freedom.For example, in the coming years parents may be able to increase the intelligence of their children through germline enhancements. This choice, McKibben asserts, actually reduces choice because all parents will be forced to make these enhancements or have less intelligent children. This illustrates the faulty logic that permeates his thinking. Parents will make this choice - assuming the germline engineering is safe - because it results in a benefit for their child. Isn't that what parents are supposed to do? If McKibben had his way, the government would eliminate this choice. Following his convoluted logic, the elimination of choice actually enhances choice.Although McKibben confuses his passion with logic, he does raise important issues. These technologies have significant risks and benefits; it's critical to have a thorough debate now, because they are emerging so rapidly. Properly managed, we can utilize them safely, even if we bumble from time to time.I recommend this book, even if you are on the other side of this issue. McKibben provides a good overview of the technologies and then explains his concerns. You may disagree, but his ideas get the juices going and make you think."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"I had difficulty taking this book seriously. It seems as though the author has misinterpreted the findings of genetic research. As a result, he doesn't present the whole story. His fears are unfounded. Scientists know full well that life is not governed by genetic specifications. The psychological processes he discusses, such as music ability and intelligence, are influenced by many factors such as upbringing, life experiences, culture, cohort and education. Even in the late seventies, when I went to college, researchers accepted the premise that human traits ..especially psychological ones ..are brought about by the interaction of our genetic nature with our life experiences. Human development is a constant exchange between nature and the socializing influences of family and culture. To think that it is unilaterally determined by genetic makeup is fallacious."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"Throughout the course of this book, I found myself, time and time again, trying to minimize and deny the author's arguments. McKibben argues that humanity is on the verge of changing the meaning of what it is to be human. Through genetic manipulation, nanotechnology, and other scientific breakthroughs, we stand at a point in which we must either finally realize that scientific progress isn't always a good thing or we must say &quot;enough&quot; and agree to limit it. McKibben asks, do we want to live forever? If we do live forever, how will that change our view of ourselves? The questions never stopped making me think harder.My suggestion is that anybody who has not yet read &quot;The End of Nature&quot; should do so prior to reading this book. &quot;The End of Nature&quot; sets the philosophical foundation up which he bases his ideas and beliefs in &quot;Enough.&quot; &quot;Enough&quot; is truly another masterpiece and McKibben should be congratulated for (as always) discussing such a facinating subject."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"McKibben has turned simplicity, primitivism and that universal longing railed against almost every aspect of modern American life - television, marketing, the environment, capitalism, education and now biotechnology with its evil twins, nanotech and artificial intelligence. He continues issuing dire warnings that the race is imperiled if we continue down our current paths. I think he would prefer extinction over transformation, something he sees with every genetic advance or scientific breakthrough. Except, of course, those he deems \\"allowable\\". Here, he is concerned about the genetic haves vs the have-nots - you know, the group with money will outperform those with less, an idea as old as society. In Bill Land folks just accept their fate and never change, accepting their lower status for lack of access to the techy gizmos of the Rich & Famous.Here's the rub - it's a subjective matter of limits and definitions. Which of the following would he reject? Knee, hip, heart or liver replacement, cataract lenses, magnets in the brain to forestall epilepsy, regulators to pump blood, implants to kill cancer cells. The real question is what he thinks about using biotech letting the blind see, the deaf hear and the paralyzed walk. Is removal of pain with replacement joints \\"anti human\\"? Again, this is a matter of opinion (for him, not the poor victims). Lately, he has been warning that immortality may be around the corner in one form or another. He insists that death is a vital part of life, something that gives us our \\"humanity. \\" No, death is the termination of human life, good or bad. As one panelist at a symposium recently told him, he didn't mind if Bill wanted to die - he just didn't want to be told he had to also.His real concern is genetic engineering and again we face the problem of who decides limits. He appears to \\"OK\\" some physical improvements but mental or emotional ones are taboo. We hear the usual red herrings - slippery slope arguments that if this happens then that will follow, designer babies, folks so smart they don't consider themselves human, people who won't know if they or a machine is \\"thinking\\", drugs to keep us happy or make into robots for \\"them\\", that nameless group that tells us to do bad things (probably fat, evil business types smoking cigars).He has expressed dissatisfaction with the Industrial Age. We've become machines instead of frolicking through fields and woods. In better days, neighbors talked and relatives lived together. They would head out daily - mom to spend the day washing, dad & junior to hunt for dinner, sis sewing a new dress by hand. Technology has made our lives qualitatively better and easier, we live twice as long as just a few years ago and yet he has an array of statistics \\"proving\\" that we were happier before all this newfangled techno stuff. Could it be the hysterical unscientific news media with its \\"fear of the week\\"? You know, sharks, bird flue, Ebola, anthrax, mad cow, mad dog, hurricanes, \\"the environment\\", heat, cold, traffic, subliminal advertising....the list is endless as are those who think earlier ages were pastoral and peaceful.

McKibben gives his account of a marathon he participated in. Primarily he writes about his own struggle when he reached the point where his training and his adrenaline push were no longer enough. He writes about the moments in which he had to be totally concentrated in going on, a test of his own human strength, will, courage.He then goes on to imagine what it might be like in the future should it be able to program human beings in such a way as to make them free of suffering from fatigue, and exhaustion. He suggests what certain kinds of technological improvements might do is to not simply provide the individual racer or marathoner with incredible speeds in today's terms but in fact cancel out the whole activity of racing.In a sense this question the question of how technological improvements may deprive the human situation and even human nature and character of its meaning is at the heart of this book.McKibben's main claim is that we must be able to know when we have gone far enough, and not go beyond it to a Pyrrhic victory . McKibben in this sense connects with bio- ethicists one of the most prominent of whom is Leon Kass in suggesting that in order to remain human we may have to limit our own hunger for overcoming our own limitations. We may have to stop ourselves from developing in areas where we have traditionally dreamed of developing.One problem however which may be insurmountable is the competitive character of human beings. Also , human greed may play a part in pushing humans to seek their own advantage and profit at the expense of not simply their own humanity, but humanity as a whole.My own sense is that McKibben has a very wise and important, perhaps even vital message for humanity- but that the likelihood of humanity taking it is truly questionable."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"This is an alarmist polemic about the danger that unrestrained growth in germline engineering, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence poses for the human race. Bill McKibben is terrified (the word is not too strong) that science and technology are on the verge of engineering humans out of existence.I think his fears are justified. However I don't think we should be worried. Unlike McKibben, who seems to view human beings as a fixed endowment (perhaps from a Creator), I think we can view ourselves as ever changing, ever evolving beings, constantly in the process of becoming. I welcome the excitement and prospect of our accelerated evolution. Yes, there are dangers ahead, so it is important to proceed with caution and full deliberation.The main danger that McKibben presents that I find creditable is that the already wide gap between the haves and have nots of the world will simply get greater and greater until the former will view the latter as something less than human, and the latter will feel demoralized, inferior and without hope. The GenRich will spend their resources on upgrading their genetic stock and especially that of their offspring, while the GenPoor, who will not be able to afford the expensive genetic engineering will, relatively speaking, become less skilled, less talented and presumably a lot less happy. This is a very real danger, and from what I know of humanity, and what I can see in our ghettos and in our suburbs, one not likely to be averted.But this is the irony of McKibben's argument. He wants to restrain science and technology so that our humanity will not change, so that we will remain as we are. His arguments sadly give the lie to his thesis. He avers that a child that has had its genome altered in some way, perhaps to improve memory or IQ or appearance or even emotional intelligence, is now \\"a product.\\" He adds, \\"You [as a parent] can take precisely as much pride in her achievements as you take in the achievements of your dishwashing liquid.\\" (p. 59) I disagree, and I think (and hope) the child would too.On page 48 he asserts that the faith of a genetically altered \\"anchorite monk\\" would be \\"utterly meaningless\\" compared to that which \\"his medieval ancestor inherited by birthright.\\" How could McKibben know this, and would the monk agree with him? Frankly, such assertions are just McKibben's preferences, built into his psyche by his genetic composition, his experience and his education. Are such views somehow lacking in meaningfullness because of that?The genetically altered child is NOT going to feel like a product, unless he listens to McKibben. The child is still a child, perhaps a beautiful, intelligent and loving child. But McKibben seems to think because someone's genome may be altered they can no longer take pride in themselves. He gives the example earlier in the book of himself and his running. He writes that it is a great source of pride for him to be able to complete a marathon only an hour or so behind the leaders. But he says he would no longer take pride in such an accomplishment had he been engineered for it. But in fact he has been evolutionarily \\"engineered\\" for it. Most of us cannot, no matter how hard we try, run a marathon in three, four, five or even ten hours. His ancestors chose (consciously or unconsciously) to mate with genes for running rather than say genes for surviving long winters by burning body fat. By his reasoning, his pride in his running accomplishments should be lessen by the knowledge that he was bred for it to some extent.\\"Natural\\" as seen by McKibben is good; man made or induced is bad. His sense that there is something sacred in sexual reproduction (see p. 12) is shared by many and is understandable. However, the people of the future might feel differently, and I wouldn't be surprised to see in the not too distant future a woman's movement toward relieving themselves of the burden, the pain, the relative immobility, and the danger of pregnancy for something less \\"natural.\\" Natural is not necessarily better. Would we like to live with all the natural parasites that burdened our ancestors? Are baby bottles and formula to be condemned because they are unnatural? Should a child whose mother had to resort to their use feel less pride in him or herself?To be fair the changes that we are facing today are greater both in extent and different in kind that we have so far faced. But in principle they are not. We judge from our position of prejudice in what we are now and what we have been, not in what we may be.There is one other danger that I wish McKibben had focused on, that of making sure our genetic choices are adaptive in the Darwinian sense. (Instead of worrying rhetorically, as he does on page 157, about which frozen wife Robert Ettinger will be married to should they be unfrozen. This sort of journalism I think he should save for a Geraldo TV Special should the opportunity arise.) If we always opt for more happiness and serenity in our lives, we may wake up some day and find that we can no longer cope with the contingencies of the environment. On the other hand if we foolishly cling to an unchanged genome we may find that changing circumstances will leave us far behind. In either case there is the danger of becoming exinct.We need to educate ourselves to cope with the growing complexity of our culture. That is the answer to the challenge of science and technology, not any neo-Luddite attempt at stuffing the genie back into the bottle."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"this book definitely helps me see the germline technology from a panoramic angle, so that I realize that we make a rational choice before everything really happens is the responsibility of all of us human beings.

It is not a scientific work, but succeeds as a discussion in bioethics.The book would be very useful for those who are unfamiliar with the subject and those who are only beginning to study bioethics. Some of the information seems too superficial for me, since I am a Family Physician studying for a Master's in Bioethics. I still learned new information and am definitely informed by the author's viewpoint.I disagree with some of his pessimism about the reaction of the subjects of genetic manipulation since all children have struggled with identity and we've done fairly well so far. However, Dr Leon Kass and other more informed minds agree with McKibben. (I wonder how much of our differing opinions and optimism/pessimism are due to *our* genetics and how much due to that very struggle? How much is nature, how much nurture and the specific portion of our environment that includes these discussions?)"},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"This book has a goal: to scare you. That, in itself, doesn't make the book bad. While I am pro-biotech, I appreciate the fact that people are allowed to read and explore a myriad of positioins before they make up their mind. What bothers me, then, is that McKibben is so intent on scaring us into submission that he is either a.) puposely exaggerating and misunderstanding his information and doesn't care, or b.)literally doesn't know 'enough' about what he's writing so as not to notice his caricatures.For instance - amd most troubleing -, well over 2/3rds of his citations are gotten from newspapers, trade magazines, and (a little better but not by a lot) popular science articles. So we get treated to all the exaggerated stories about the nutty little cult-like submovements that treat biotech as an unmitigated utopia while under the impression that this is the mainstream view. Well, the New York TImes is in the business of selling newspapers and reporting stories that can help them do it. If we haven't noticed, they are much less concerned with accuracy. But McKibben's index is not only littered with these types of exaggerated stories, but virtually all are gotten from the newspapers and trade rags. Not very professional.Second (and partly due to the above) Mckibben is wont to grossly overexaggerate fears of genetic determinism. IF we can select genes for success, he says, then children will be comodities!!! But in saying this, he doesn't realisze - or doesn't let on - that a.) there is no gene combo for 'success' (such a blanket phrase), b.) success involeves quite a bit of 'luck' and evironment in addition to genetic factors; c.) a genetic tweek is by no means a gaurentee of superiority in a particular area. McKibben, though, doesn't know this; my guess becasue he is quoting from trade magazines that like to write article on the &quot;gene for x&quot; in order to give us a shocking and juicy cover story. &quot;Beanbag genetics&quot; is dead an someone forgot to tell McKibbon that he is more of a gentic determinist than even most genetic determinist are.Third he writes aobut his fears that biotech will 'dehumanize' us. We get this alot and McKibben swears he is not a luddite. But the argument fits the bill perfectly: Limitations are what makes us human; the better humans are made to perform, the less human they'll be. McKibben says that we should just be happy with the progress we've made so far (after all, eradication of limitions in the past was a good thing; it is only the future doings that are problematic) and cash in our chips content only with the results gotten so far. But how would getting people to live longer, be less prone to obesity, have smarter brains, have better eye-sight, and have various other talnents be immoral? The problem is that McKibben doesn't really ARUGE a point here; he just repeats his emotional appeal about the joys of human limitaitons as they are (you too can die at 70! Woohoo!) like it doesn't require any further argument. But in light of all of the things we COULD be better at with biotech's help, we really deserve an explanation of why it is moral to know that you can improve humans and NOT do it.Long and short: following McKibben's title, reading this book make me say: &quot;Enough!&quot;"},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"As a research scientist, arguments like this, always distinctly American, make me sad. Only America and a few other countries are holding back their scientists with bans on cloning and stem cell research. So far, the best argument to the contrary is the flawed, platitudinous \\"slippery-slope\\" concept presented in this book. The idea that genetic research will inevitably lead to a race of super-people is trite at best. In my opinion its sophomoric and idiotic. I have heard the same point presented in a 2002 documentary by MSNBC, this concept is far from original or compelling. In 2003, scientists developed a brain-machine interface for primates. Has this technology led to, or will it ever lead to, a race of cyborg people that are so vastly superior that us normal-people will never be able to keep up? I don't think so. In reality all this technology will ever do is lead to the development of better artificial limbs for amputees. In the same fashion, all genetic research will ever lead to is a greater understanding genetic diseases.Proclaiming current research as \\"good enough\\" will lead to America being hamstrung in the global race to develop technologies, a race we are already loosing due to globalization and the fact students receive a far better science education in India and Japan. This fear of scientific discovery is a concept better suited for the middle ages. If the author takes even one college level genetic course, I am sure his opinion will change. Please dismiss this book and move on."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"McKibben has some valid points and questions regarding germiline genetic engineering, unfortunately his stong naturist bias diminsh his credibility. He extensibly quotes scientists and experts on the matter, at the end what they say fits his idea that genetics and technlogy will be the apocalyptic executor.Take for example three pages from his book were he uses the research work by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi to demonstrate that genetic enhancement will not make people happier.McKibben's claim that \\"What if you were thinking, in the back of your head, Is it really me doing this? Is it my programming? Am I losing myself, or is that feeling merely an artifact of my engineering? And those are precisely the sorts of thoughts that would rise in your mind because, in some ways, the whole point of flow experiences is to know yourself better\\" is emotional extortion, as if he is trying to scare people away from germline engineering. Either he doesn't understand the neurobiology of flow or he's just using a quote to fit his agenda, or both.Flow is a term coined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi to describe a mental state characterized by lack of self-awareness and sharp concentration on the task at hand, not worried on how things are going or what the outcome will be. People engaged on this state perform at their best. Under flow action and awareness merge into one, lack of self and thinking creates a sense of deep relaxation and joy seems to arise by itself. Flow is also known as \\"the zone\\" by some athletes.Characteristics of flow resemble meditation experiences. Zen meditation is a relaxed attentive state, on which the practitioner clear his or her mind of thinking. \\"Meditation then becomes several things other than a way to relax, physically and mentally. It becomes a way of not thinking, clearly, and then of carrying this clear awareness into everyday living\\" . Meditation is intrinsically rewarding and joyful. The mental state under flow and mediation are equal, the difference is that \\"flow\\" occurs during an activity while meditation is passive. Nevertheless mental clarity and intrinsic joy are the same.In conclusion McKibben is putting thoughts on the head of somebody who doesn't exist and then he claims that these very thoughts will keep this individual from experiencing flow, thus preventing him from getting to know him-self better. Clearly he is projecting and scenario that doesn't exist but fits his purpose to plant the seed of doubt and fear on the minds of potential germline users. As for flow he doesn't understand that the insight arises after the experience not during it.McKibben may have some valid points against germline but his strong naturist bias makes him to force facts to fit his purpose. Even more, he has a pessimistic opinion on the technology that doesn't meet his preferences; treadmills with electronic read-outs are ok. Had he been born fifty years earlier he would' written a book on the evils of running machines that prevent people from breathing fresh air at the risk of lung diseases."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"Very readable. A minor knowledge of genetics and cursory knowledge of robotics will get you through this book without confusion. Nanotechnology is so new that few of us have even a fundamental knowledge of its workings. Fortunately, Mr. McKibben recognizes this and spares us baffling jargon on most all issues. Recommended reading for any parent having more than half a child, or considering having a child.Perhaps I was fortunate to have read Francis Fukuyama's \\"Our Posthuman Future\\" and Greg Stock's \\"Redesigning Humans\\" just prior to reading Mr. McKibben's book. As Mr. McKibben says in his book, Fukuyama used an [unremarkable] style to get the message across that something must be done now to begin to internationally regulate the ethical boundaries of, and path forward for, genetics.Mr. McKibben is clearly well read on a number of subjects and takes a pragmatic yet fatalistic view of the future considering the current trend of science. He talks of the perils and pitfalls that could accompany the genetic revolution, while giving a fair and balanced view of the merits of the field in disease prevention. What he does extremely well in this book, \\"Enough\\", is to draw attention to the paralleling emerging technologies of genetics, nanotechnology and robotics (GNR as he has labeled it), and the confluence of these three fast-paced advancing technologies.Although an interesting and well written book, I cannot refrain from commenting (as Mr. McKibben politely did) on the conclusions drawn in Gregory Stock's book. Mr. Stock takes the view that the momentum is too great now and is unstoppable (heaven forbid that he is correct). Mr. McKibben is thorough and visionary in helping us understand the burning issue at hand in the bioethical decisions we must make in thwarting this burgeoning push towards germinal technology. The burning issue.... the future of our children (or wandering humans without meaning...whatever...) in that they will inevitably bear the consequences of inaction within the coming ten, twenty or fifty years from now if this current generation of commercial decision makers is left to their own devices. The exact timing is debatable. The outcome, if unchecked, is only a question of severity of the consequences, not when.Mr. McKibben's forward thinking scenarios of what the human may evolve to if some or all of this modification occurs paints a stark... no dark, picture of the \\"human\\" of the future. Wandering aimlessly without family ties and wondering if the enhancements bequeathed upon them by their ancestors predisposed them to their calling in life, or if their physical and intellectual successes were of their own ability, or the results of their modifications.He closes with several brief conclusions shared by other academics in that it is a \\"freight train\\" (my words) that could only be stopped by a police state. The choice...Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\", a return to a caste system liking that of India in past years, or George Orwell's \\"1984\\". Take your pick.I admit to be one to worry about what the future holds for my children in any event. That's my job. However, this book helped me to finally draw a clear conclusion that a sad destiny is upon us if something is not done. As Mr. McKibben points out, we are a species that has, in the past, said \\"Enough\\" when the consequences were unmistakably too grave. It can be done again. I am of the mind that we should do it again. That we just say enough, and begin to regulate it in the face of the commercial proponents.I was truly taken aback by Mr. McKibben's simple comment that we may be the last generation to be able to make this choice. The Mother of all choices as it may turn out.For the immediate, the best thing we could do would be to see a few more books realizing the need for a fast track plan to educate our children about the oncoming freight train. This would allow them to at least begin to understand and be aware of the potential danger of the outcome, and hopefully, to choose to oppose it in the coming years.Well done Bill. One of the best books on bioethics I have read to date. It should be mandatory for all parents.

McKibben addresses nanotechnology, genetic engineering (people and food), potential issues between the upper and lower class (GenRICH), advertising, what is good and what is enough. The audience for this book is the general public and the purpose is to persuade people of his view.The book achieved its goal of making people fear for the future of technology. The book suggests possibilities of stalling or curving technology being able to say Enough. It suggests that we are at the edge about to fall forward into the abyss of technology. That human's are so close to having nanotechnology take over our skies and to be able to pick out traits for our children. These technologies may be in the workings but they are far from implementing them in our general public. The book has left out where we actually are in the science race, and if we are progressing as fast as other nations. I am not sure that nanotechnology bots and police bots are very convincing and how they are going to clean our smog problems. I think that it is not really convincing that we would be able to pick out traits for our children to have as far as talents.

Miller, in which Miller quoted none other than Ray Bradbury on the topic of cloning. One might think Bradbury would be all for it. Instead, he says, \\"It's better to go to be and make a baby, isn't it?\\"The issues behind such a statement go far beyond the pleasure aspect, as McKibben-who is no enemy of science or scientists-so aptly and persuasively points out. In \\"Enough,\\" McKibben takes us on a thought-provoking journey of logic, where we examine the issues behind such things as germline engineering, nanotechnology, and robotics. He persuasively explaines the folly of technology for technology's sake, and helps us draw the line between that which is beneficial and that which is not. In other words, that which is enough and that which is over the line.I very much like the way McKibben explodes the myth that folks who develop technology are experts in how it should be used. Many people who provide us with assurances on the value of a given technology is-no matter how far it's taken-aren't qualified. A case in point is television. Heralded in its early days as something that would bring to every citizen a vast knowledge and appreciation of history, the arts, and higher learning-it is, instead, an electronic lobotomizer.McKibben does more than provide several compelling arguments as to why assurances by technologists are unreliable-despite the best of intentions. He goes on to explain the consequences to technology developers, end-users, and society at large, when we don't look at technology from a wider perspective than the assumption our role is to continually develop and employ it.If you like to scratch the surface of important questions, this book is more than enough-without being too much. If you are at the other end of the spectrum and like to deeply ponder complex questions of what makes us human and what our technological limits are in light of that, this book is enough to fuel the flames. One flaw with \\"Enough\\" is it simply is not enough. While it was satisfying on many levels, it left me wanting to read McKibben's other books. I'll read his \\"Then End of Nature,\\" but I will impatiently wait for his next book. If all of McKibben's books are of this caliber, I'm not sure we'll ever have enough of them."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"If you look at man as part of some divine plan then you can suppose that there is something inviolable in the status quo. This is the old argument that says things like if man were meant to fly then he would have been born with wings. McKibben may vehemently deny that this is his stance but in essence that is what it boils down to.On the other hand if you look at the world the way it really is, what you see is an evolutionary process ruled by the law of survival of the fittest. To even call it \\"natural\\" selection is to create a bias that suggests that what took place is in some sense globally optimal. It is not. What takes place at any stage is an incremental improvement. To see the limitations all one has to do is to consider all the genetic defects that people can be born with.What is natural is to use our intelligence to try to make improvements, to build airplanes to allow us to fly and create medicines and surgical procedures to repair and enhance. The one advantage that the ordinary evolutinary process has is that it is gradual. If at some point a defect is introduced, it will be weeded out with minimal damage. The great danger posed by improvements introduced by man is that we could introduce changes that have highly deleterious \\"side effects.\\" But this is simply to provide a word of caution, not to abandon the whole enterprise of technological enhancement."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"Gregory Stock's Resdesigning Humans left me wondering if I had bitten on the hook, and this work screwed up my courage to realize I have been sifting disinfo here. The point: can one trust what one reads on this subject?I cannot cross the line to completely opposing genetic futurism but it seems out of control already and something appears to be going awry in the early innings down in the Frankenstone crypt, thus McKibben's book shows the right stuff as indifference to currently-being-manufactured opinion. His case of the Amish seems wrong, the simplest case of restraint, if it could be called that, of nuclear proliferation, right. It is possible to take the hard road. Thus, the author points out how the theme of twist-your-arm inevitability of technological 'whatever we scientists please'enforces the 'rule of passivity' from our 'expert betters'. Time to take a stance, and call a hitech ayn rand fanatic grokking on The Age of Spiritual Machines a hitech idiot. The fact has to be faced that science currently has no sound definition of man, no theory of evolution to explain him, classifies dissenters as kooks or cranks (Buddhists) and does not tell the truth in scientific media about what it knows or doesn't know. Fortunately, the 'noumenal' side of man must be unknowable, so our geneticists must be in the business of Halloween costumes, cosmetic 'bawds' and 'body suits'.The book is quite convincing in a practical way, and goes through the absurd scenarios of athletic, IQ, and other assorted genetic arms races, and makes its case without moral posturing. Important red light warning. Recommended."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"The only thing new about this book is the author and the printing date. Its premise is as old as recorded history. &quot;Man dare not venture into some areas or he risks waking the demon, being eaten by the sea monster, incurring the wrath of the gods, creating the Frankenstein monster, etc.&quot;First of all, these dire predictions seldom (if ever) come to pass. Nuclear power is an excellent example. In spite of the dire warnings and gloomy scenarios, some how we've managed to avoid annihilation (I can hear the collective &quot;well, not yet&quot; issuing from the Naderites), much to the chagrin of doom-prophets like McKibben, I'm sure. We seem to manage to stay alive and even prosper whatever technologies we happen develop.Most importantly, McKibben's proposal that we ban, cease, outlaw, restrict, move backwards, whatever, is untenable. You cannot stop people from eventually exploring these areas. The technologies will be developed. Pass all the laws you want. Set up all the inquisitions you can muster. Burn all the heretics you can round up. The Bible will still be translated into English. The printing press will still disseminate information to the masses. The world will still revolve around the sun, not vice versa. Even though God didn't give man wings he can still fly. The automobile will replace the horse. It will still be possible to exceed the speed of sound. Man will still be descended from lower life forms, and on and on.McKibben challenges us to face the &quot;fact&quot; that things are as good as we need them to be. He asks us to imagine how life could actually be any better and believes that we must admit that we can't. Well, horse hockey! Ask someone at the end of the 19th century the same question and they would probably not be able to imagine the world we live in. They would probably have agreed with the statement, &quot;Life can't get any better than it is right now.&quot; Point is we can't know what all this will mean for the future of mankind. I, for one, am not willing to abandon possibilities based on the fear mongering of a twenty-first century naysayer.As for his argument that all this is somehow dehumanizing, nothing is more human than improving who we are and how we live. That is exactly how we've survived for the past 3.5 million years. Sorry Bill, but you can take your place with the old wives and leave the rest of us alone.I'm glad McKibben has the ability to say what he says. He needs to thank technological advancement for the opportunity. Other wise, he'd still be plowing a field to put bread on the table instead of cashing a check and going to the store. This book is one of the best examples of cultural lag that I've seen lately. The sad thing is that so many agree with the premise out of ignorance and fear. But, that too has had it evolutionary advantages. Fortunately, it's always been the progressives that adapted and survived.

This is not a scientific treatise or a technical analysis of the subjects raised in the book. Instead, it is a moral tale, not unlike a sermon, and it does not pretend to be something other than that. I found it to be extremely engaging, frightening too. Why not? Not everyone will agree with the points made by Bill McKibben, which is fine. But he deserves much credit for presenting cogently a looming possibility for humanity and discussing it honestly and with foresight. I was fascinated.Is is \\"luddite\\" (if anyone really knows the meaning of that word) to question what the outcome might be of letting the genie out of the bottle? Is it alarmist to suggest that we might need to reconsider the consequences of progress? For most Americans, it seems almost sacriligious to question the infallibility of technology, to say nothing of its ability to constantly improve our lives. But is that necessarily so? Can anyone really say that unleashing the power of the Atom was unequivocally good? Do we really have better lives with nuclear weapons blossoming all over the planet like morning glories? For me, the answer is no, and I applaud the attempt by Bill McKibbon to state his case. Is he absolutely correct, maybe not. Only time will tell. But this is an important book because it poses questions and challenges our thinking on the subject of genertic engineering, nanotechnology and the kind of future we are heading toward. The intensity of the reviews is a testament to that.There are only a few voices out there discussing the possibilities awaiting us down the road. Enough is well worth reading, it may shake you up, and it will provoke some much needed discussion on these subjects."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"Bill McKibben's latest book, \\"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age,\\" raises some fundamental questions about who we are, what we are, and how we may be affected by the biotechnologies which we already possess and those which are just over the horizon. The author takes us on an expedition into the world of genetic research, nanotechnology and robotics.This is a passionate book and a disturbing book and one that presents what we in the \\"argumentation trade\\" might call a \\"persuasive\\" argument, that is, a presentation of facts which are used, not to support a conclusion that may be true or false, but used to support a conclusion promoting a particular policy or course of action.\\"Enough\\" is also a revealing book, a hard and detailed look at our rapid acceleration into technologies which may have permanent and adverse effects on the future of human beings; indeed, these technologies have the potential to affect what it means to be human at all. Because he perceives this to be a threatening situation, McKibben discusses technologies such as germline engineering and therapeutic cloning, warning that they represent a slippery slope that may make more dangerous and harmful technologies possible and even acceptable.\\"[I]f we aggressively pursue any or all of several new technologies now before us,\\" the author says, \\"we may alter our relationship not with the rest of nature but with ourselves. First human genetic engineering and then advanced forms of robotics and nanotechnology will call into question, often quite explicitly, our understanding of what it means to be a human being.\\"McKibben acquaints us with microscopic nanobots cruising our bloodstreams, attacking pathogens within our bodies and building new cells. And with children born so genetically enhanced that they will never be able to believe that they reached success as musicians or artists or athletes or whatever because there was something unique in them and a hunger to reach the pinnacle of their ability through their own choice and desire.The author tackles what it means to be human, pointing out how these new technologies threaten our very identity as human beings. \\"What if we have been programmed,\\" he asks, \\"or at least must suspect each time we choose a path that we have been nudged in that direction by our engineered cells? Who then 'are we'?\\"One of the more interesting arguments that McKibben makes, in my opinion, has to do with the matter of \\"choice,\\" an issue with which libertarians are always concerned. Libertarian-minded thinkers tend to be among the strongest advocates of modern technologies and tend to believe that the free market will police itself in regard to any dangers which may result from their use.More often than not, libertarians accuse those who oppose or may merely question the effects of new technologies of being Luddites, a name attributed to that infamous group of early nineteenth century workers who protested against the introduction of new labor-saving technologies in the factories of that period.But McKibben argues that some of these new biotechnologies are really \\"anti-choice.\\" He points out that \\"In widespread use, they will first rob parents of their liberty, and then strip freedom from every generation that follows. In the end, they will destroy forever the very possibility of meaningful choice.\\"I think that's a point that needs to be thoughtfully and seriously considered, especially by those who are, like I am, more or less on the libertarian side of the socio-political spectrum.McKibben is not a naive thinker. He realizes that there is no limit to human aspirations or desires. And our ability to discover new scientific facts and to invent new technologies seems unlimited. But can we draw a line and say this far and no further? Can we say, this is enough? The author answers yes, and argues that only by staying human can we find true meaning in our lives. What sets a human being apart from other beings in this world of ours? McKibben argues that it is our power of self-limitation. \\"We need to do an unlikely thing,\\" he says. \\"We need to survey the world we now inhabit and proclaim it good. Good enough.\\"While allowing that many of these new technologies may hold the promise to cure disease and provide other benefits, they also offer problematic choices such as the capacity to choose a child's gender, the power to boost human intelligence and, what may be the nightmare of all nightmares, the option of \\"improving\\" or \\"perfecting\\" human beings. And, I have always argued and will continue to do so: just because we can do something does not mean it is something we should do or need to do. I find myself having to agree with McKibben when he concludes, \\"I think the stakes in this argument are absurdly high, nothing less than the meaning of being human. Must we forever grow in reach and power? Or can we, should we, ever say,'Enough'?\\" Maybe so, maybe in this case, maybe at this time.This is a book that should be read by everyone who is concerned about the future of the human species."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"So where to join the fray? I'll just say what I think, I guess. First of all, McKibben has written a highly informative and gripping book. He provides a good overview of some of the developments actually occurring in biotech, robotics, and nanotech right now (well, within the last few years), and then proceeds to outline his viewpoint of opposition to the radically transformative effects of these technologies. This is all well and good. Though I'm not sure how I come down on these issues, I greatly appreciated his viewpoint and thought that he had some compelling arguments against the use, or at least reckless use, of these technologies.First of all, I do not think, as some other reviewers have stated, that his argument is Luddite or in any way antitechnological. He wholeheartedly agrees with, or at least supports, the efforts of biotech researchers, doctors, and roboticists to advance and apply their technologies in ways that do not radically alter the existential landscape. Where he gets nervous is when people start talking about modifying who we are on an extremely basic level. Try as one might, the discoveries of Galileo, Columbus, Einstein, and Bohr cannot be compared to germline engineering and nanotech. These were revelations of the external landscape, knowledge revolutions. The territory McKibben is trying to protect is the internal landscape.Living to be 200 (or 500+), selecting from a catalog of gene upgrades for an unborn child, or becoming host to a swarm of nanomachines that act as immune system kevlar sounds pretty cool on paper, but his contention is that these technologies will ultimately dehumanize by making one of our last givens--our selves--into yet another commodity. Once committed to these technologies, we'll be locked in, forced to get the next upgrade every time there's a new advance (every few years?), forced to keep feeding the hungry corporate behemoths to keep ourselves tuned up. If not, we risk becoming obsolete and disconnected from the world we have allowed to come into being, not just economically or politically, as is the case with the disenfranchised now, but existentially, at our root level of being. If we don't get our kids genetic upgrades, they or their descendents will become second-, third-, or fourth-class human beings, forever relegated to the trashbin of history. And the poor may not even get the choice to procure gene upgrades or nanotech defenders, with the rich giving themselves a carte blanche to write their good fortune into the DNA of their descendants so that the advantages of \\"good blood\\" become literal.Decide for yourselves whether this argument and his others are convincing, or whether the technologies he discusses are dangerous for some other reason. Nanotech and genefixing may make us so prosperous that everyone, all over the world, will become a golden god and begin living a life of ease. Perhaps history is not an accurate precedent when dealing with something so transformative. But even if you are a fervent supporter of gene manipulation or nanotech, you should read the book. Whether it's for the best or no, I do think McKibben is correct in saying that this is the only chance we have to say no. The genie in the bottle is making all sorts of promises, trying to get us to let her/him/it out, and though they may all come true, it will be nigh impossible to get that genie back in if things aren't to our liking.McKibben wants us to say enough. I'm not quite convinced, but he has convinced me that we should step back, as a society, and look long and hard at this technology before we say OK to anything that is going to change who we are. I see nothing in our society to convince me that any of us have more than an extremely dim and immature understanding of who or what we are and are capable of right now, pre-germline engineering. Maybe we should spend some more time understanding ourselves before we pass judgment on \\"stupid,\\" \\"limited\\" man and start trying to upgrade."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"Bill McKibben can cut through the glossy ideals of technology better than anyone. This time he takes on the modification of the human genome, a debate that seems to have broken down between those who want to preserve life vs. those who want to improve life. As McKibben argues, both sides are fighting for the wrong reasons.The true arguments are not the destruction of human embryos (stem cells) or the potential to cure otherwise incurable diseases, but the ramifications of our ability to make changes to our DNA that will be passed on, thereafter, to our offspring. Since this technology is virtually in our hands now, how can we draw a line that will not be crossed? How can we cure a genetic disease without also opening up the opportunity to modify the IQ or physical stamina of our children? And then, is modifying and improving our children really such a bad thing? McKibben argues that this is a bad thing; \\"choices\\" that would turn genetic engineering into a consumer culture product destined by the unregulated free market to set people against one another in a race to stay ahead.Consumer-genetic-engineering would also create a permanent underclass, a group of inferiors who will never be able to afford genetic modification. The rich will not only get richer, they will get smarter and stronger as well. After not-too-many generations of this, a new posthuman species will arise, with the power to demand subservience from Homo sap-and this really isn't science-fiction.McKibben's arguments in \\"Enough\\" are the same as his arguments in \\"The End of Nature\\", \\"The Age of Missing Information\\", and \\"Maybe One\\": that is, why can't we step back to examine what makes us human? How does the unwise and unregulated use of technology steal our authenticity, our sustainability, and our happiness? When can we just say, Enough?McKibben is a little long winded in this book; he makes the same point more than once, so the repetitiveness of his arguments begin to sound like sermonizing. Nevertheless, he is alerting us to a Pandora of problems that are right on our doorstep. Most people probably see genetic engineering as either a challenge to religion or the solution to long-dreaded diseases or inflictions, but without really understanding what is involved. Properly regulated by an educated populace, this technology could probably be reined in and used only as a means to cure disease, but, like that old anti-war saying of the 60s, \\"suppose they gave a war and nobody came\\", now we have a real fight and no one has come to ask the right questions or fight for the right reasons. As we have already wrecked our environment, we may now pass on the unresolved ethics of genetic engineering. History will judge our apathy and ignorance harshly."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"One point that has not been made yet which I feel is pertinent is the question of disease. Namely, what purpose has disease served in directing the adaptation of humans? This needs to be considered by pathologists and geneticists alike. Genetically engineering resistance to known diseases will not protect future humans from all diseases. On the contrary, such a poorly thought-out removal of adaptive processes such as natural immunity is likely to make engineered humans of the future utterly helpless when beset by a new disease. If space colonization is a serious hope for the future, we'd best not engineer ourselves for greater comfort. It's a real shame that multi-generational eugenics programs have been abandoned in favor of a get-it-now attitude similar to that which produced fast food. \\"Fast Evolution.\\""},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"Bill McKibben has written a thoroughly researched book that highlights what kind of developments are now taking place and are expected to take place in the fields of genetics, computer technology, and nanotechnology. He then argues that we should voluntarily put the brakes on this kind of research, when it comes to redefining what it means to be human. McKibben seems genuinely frightened at what is on the horizon.And when I read some of the quotes from highly respected scientists, I'm frightened, too. They seem to have tunnel vision when it comes to their research, just plowing ahead just because they can, without thinking too hard about consequences, intended or otherwise.But I have some problems with the book. First, many of the developments that scientists think they can accomplish will be very difficult, if not impossible, and the fallout may or may not be as bad as McKibben suggests. I can see no way to identify all genes connected with certain personality traits, for example, nor can I see that inserting those genes guarantee that you'll get the desired outcome (environment does play a role in a person's temperment, after all).Second, McKibben's arguments are spurious, at best, based on sort of a gut revulsion to some of this research. I share his revulsion to many of these developments, but I also recognize that to convince most people, you can't just talk about something as squishy as meaning and expect them to give up what seems like a good thing. His statement that things are good enough as they are is almost comical, when you think of all the times through history when people declared that everything that could be invented already has, or that a new technology was dangerous (people once thought riding on \\"fast-moving\\" trains -- 25 mph or so -- would result in death). And thinking that everyone will voluntarily restrain himself from human-altering research is even more comical. As I said, I don't disagree necessarily, but I'd like to have seen him argue more compellingly and offer more feasible solutions.Another problem I had was simply with the way the book was written. Sentence fragments can be very effective, but when overused, they just become annoying. Ditto for ellipses. Comma splices are just inexcusable. And let's not put quotation marks around technical terms, shall we?Nonetheless, I found the information on what scientists are doing and hope to accomplish fascinating (and yes, a little scary). When scientists are speaking to \\"true believers\\" they make some statements that make me want to keep a very close eye on them. And we should."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"Although this book should get 5 stars for imagination and style,I disagree with its premise.We humans already have built into our systems, the trait of curiosity as well as the strong desire to survive as a species.We're going to move forward with genetic research, stem cellresearch and cloning organs in the 21st Century. We're alsoexcited with the prospect of space travel and intelligent lifeelsewhere in the universe.The author thinks that we must stop developing our human-ness, atthis time because we need to stick with what's \\"natural.\\"Is it natural to have the ability to cure all diseases by manipulating genes and stem cells, but NOT do it?...for fear ofnot being \\"natural?\\" Is it natural NOT to live 200 years, if wehave it within our power to do so? As long as we solve theproblems of overpopulation, what's wrong with living 200 years?At this time, we're replacing damaged human parts with new hightech man-made materials? Is it unnatural to have a prostheticarm, leg, hand, etc.? In some cases, we're also using animalcells to cure human brain diseases. Some people have usedtransplanted animal hearts. Is this unnatural...to want to live,no matter what? Would it be better to die then to have ananimal or prosthetic part?Cloning human organs simply refines the above procedures, andnothing more.In the 21st Century we already know that machines are putting many out of work. We know that computers can \\"think\\" faster than most humans, and yet we want them to make our lives moreconvenient. Our desire to choose our own destiny could come toan end if we were NOT to enhance our brain power vis a vie theseexisting machines. What is wrong with that?Is it unnatural to want to have higher intelligence than the machines in our lives?Through the development of machines, computer chips, satellites,space ships, and the e*world in general, we have changed ourenvironment. The \\"medium is the message\\" should be pretty clearhere. Now, we need to adapt to the very environment that wehave wrought. The reason that homo sapiens have come this far, is the ability of our brains to adapt to an assortment of environments. Of course, we need to develop our intelligence sothat we are the masters of the machines and...beyond. Wouldn'tit be grossly unnatural NOT to be smarter than the machines webuild?There's no doubt that most humans who think about space travel,are smart enough, in the present time, to know that we humanswill NOT be able to do this, in our present form. If we ever reach the point of being able to chart a destination...it wouldn't be possible to arrive at that goal, in our present state. No doubt, to send a space ship out into the universe tosome distant planet or moon with humans on board to inhabit thatcelestial place, our Planet Earth ancestors will have to createa nearly new species... a more sophisticated primate. Perhaps,humanoids with highly enhanced brains and no legs will navigatea cargo of suspended fertilized eggs, as well as humans long inhibernation. But how is this not natural? Isn't it very natural to want to explore our universe? Isn't it extremelynatural to want to survive a collision with a meteor or comet, ifit's \\"humanly\\" possible?It would seem that NOT to do all of the above, would hold backour VERY NATURAL human drives of survival and exploration.I applaud the author for pointing out some pitfalls that technology might lead us into. Taking these into consideration,we humans, have no choice but to move forward into graduallyexpanding brave new worlds, which is what we have always done, inorder to make our species stronger and able to survive."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"The Strong point about this book is that it poses thought provoking questions. The author has really thought about this subject and where the field of genetics may lead us. The book provides some good explanations of the terms and types of research currently being carried on. He shows that by the time the nation starts legislating procedures it is generally too late. The author does bring up some pretty good predictions that society may be forced to deal with. The compulsion to fix detrimental hereditary diseases is really a forgone conclusion, Cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy etc, but will Genetic engineering rapidly go the route that plastic surgery traveled, from repairing hideous disfigurements to cosmetic [...] augmentation and facial makeovers. The author makes a very good point, if IQ or athletic ability can be increased by genetic tweaking and everyone is doing it for their kids, do you want your kid to be the only natural kid getting below average grades with below average athletic ability. The book definitely accomplished its purpose with this reader. I appreciate the ideas and societal situations this author has brought into the book and I have thought about it many times since I finished the book. Definitely worth a second read in the short-term future. The title is unfortunate, it sounds as if the author wants no more genetic progress, but the author wants to enjoy his \\"humanness\\" . He asks that society consider the big picture when dealing with limits to genetic engineering"},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"Live forever is near possible. Is that great or has technology taken us too far? Enough?In the days of yore it was believed that a man could live longer if he used a golden bathtub, had sexual intercourse with virgins or received transplants of goat glands. Go figure. A current accepted belief is that lower caloric intact increases life span. That idea is a little more believable. The now approach is to develop genetic engineering which can modify DNA in such a way as to make illness and death old fashioned. Live 800 years or change old body organs for new ones made from your own DNA. So read up on somatic and germ line therapy. Find out what nanotechnology, robotics and genetic engineering are about. They now genetically modify your vegetables and the animals you eat, GMO'S. Are you okay with that? Look up how far away genetic engineers are from being capable of modifying human embryos and slightly older humans like you. If your Google of the above information is not enough then read the book \\"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineering Age\\" by Bill McKibben. This book will inform you and will scare you."},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"Some reviewers give this book five stars because they agree with its arguments, others one star because they consider McKibben a Luddite. Neither of these reactions is well-founded: the book's strongest point is the originality of its argument, an attempt at a thorough takedown of the flood of \\"technotopian\\" prognostications in the last fifteen years. Whether the reasoning is especially deep or whether the sources are of the highest quality is simply overshadowed by the valiant attempt at filling a gaping intellectual void. Fukuyama's work has similarities but McKibben presents arguments based not on political ramifications but shared context and meaning. This is a more direct criticism. McKibben is claiming that these technologies will have negative effects independent of human organization, effects that trivialize human existence at a personal or individual level. It's a valuable contribution and that the book is out of stock at Amazon is a depressing shame.Another original aspect of the book is its criticism of the whole gamut of technologies advocated by the technotopians, namely robotics, genetics and nanotechnology. Fukuyama regards robotics and nanotech as unworthy even of criticism, feeling that they will not become advanced enough to threaten human existence in the foreseeable future. Such skepticism of feasibility is echoed by writers like Bill Gates, though interestingly Gates did express concern about events in the far future. McKibben, however, takes seriously the recent claims about the power of Moore's law by writers like Kurzweil and Vinge. Given our experience with the explosion in computing power over the past fifty years, it seems absurd to simply dismiss claims that it could continue for the next fifty. While we may reach impassable roadblocks before then, predicting the future is extremely difficult. Processing power trends are not at all like, say, the increase in the number of razor blades on a razor, an example The Economist used to mock the concept of extrapolating future growth. We should take the possibility of radical change seriously.The book is not perfect. McKibben repeats many predictions from Kurzweil and Moravec in outlining robotics and nanotech and if you have already read these authors it may get repetitive. Personally I still found it worth reading because of the references and connections that McKibben makes to literature in portraying the possible problems. The outcomes are so grandiose and incredible that every bit of allusion seems helpful in wrapping your mind around them. It is sometimes also difficult to tell the quality of the arguments that McKibben criticizes. There are different strains of \\"transhumanist\\" thinking, ranging from well-respected, universally cited work to wild interviews in hack publications. There were several points when I had to look up and ask myself whether a so-called danger was anything more than a strawman to begin with. But the realm of credibility is blurry here and it's the larger picture that matters most anyway. If I were to use this book as a point of departure for a future work, the real task would be more deeply elaborating on the \\"meaning\\" that McKibben says would be destroyed. This book is still a great start.Lengthier review at: [...]"},{"Title":"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age","review":"Here we go again.

The e-book has thousands of hyperlinks to and from an extensive index, table of contents, glossary, the web as well as links within the content of the book. The author explains how to succeed in a web based venture by following three steps. The first step is the development, positioning and testing of a product. In this case, the author outlines the products with high potential for sales, how to evaluate and re-position products for web-worthiness, product pricing and testing, among other things. The second step is building a website that can be trusted and liked by customers, which is simple to use and easy to navigate and many other aspects which make it really sell. It is necessary to get paid for one's services through the web without problems. The third step is to build a high volume of targeted, motivated traffic timely, ethically and cost effectively.Ken Evoy needs to be applauded for such a comprehensive user-friendly e-book. He is truly a \\"guru\\" for having produced such a high quality, informative and helpful book."},{"Title":"Make Your Site Sell","review":"Make Your Site Sell! (MYSS!) Is far and away one of the strangest/most interesting books I have ever encountered, in terms of format alone. While the content of the book is excellent and virtually timeless despite the constantly evolving world of Internet selling and marketing, the way this book is laid out was extremely off-putting to me as a reader. Not only is Evoy's guide a hefty chunk of material at almost 800 pages, the book itself is an awkward rectangle shape that makes holding and reading it an almost physically challenging (okay, maybe not challenging, but certainly annoying) task. Even worse than that, the writing in this book is not like text in any other book. The content of MYSS! Comes in the form of two screen shots per page, placed side by side (hence the rectangle shape). I found all of this to be extraordinarily disconcerting, and as the reader I really didn't appreciate these odd formatting choices. I feel as if I'm making almost too big of a deal about this aspect of my experience with MYSS!, but it really did shape many of my perceptions about the book. In the end, I found all of these physical/design issues to be very contradictory in nature to the principles that Evoy lays out for successful projects: he stresses simplicity of design, ease of function, and well-edited content that doesn't ramble or repeat, yet it would appear that he ignores all three in the creation of his own how-to guide.Format aside, I will say that I was impressed by the timelessness of the content in MYSS!. This book was published a decade ago, in 1999 (so much has changed in ten years!), but because its principles are based more on making good business choices and smart marketing techniques than on specifics about the web, it remains relevant in a field where very little stays current for much more than six months. I am absolutely willing to give Evoy credit where credit is due for this achievement, as I did gain a fair amount of solid knowledge about Internet Marketing Design from reading MYSS!.The book is divided into three sections, but the second two are supplemental material to the first, which is the main portion, dealing with how to do successful business online. Part two focuses on product development, and part three is a guide for improving one's propensity for traffic-building. While these two supplemental sections are important and valuable, I did not spend much time with them (especially the traffic building portion), because so much of what is discussed therein has become more or less obsolete. Keep in mind, MYSS! Was written in 1999, when the world had yet to be revolutionized by Google. The way that Google finds sites and helps create traffic for web marketers is vastly different from any of its predecessors (which is likely why it has blown them all out of the water and become the new standard for search engine optimization), and so I found very little of this last section to be helpful or relevant on the topic of traffic building. In short, I felt that the extent to which this topic was discussed in the first portion of the book was more than satisfactory for my purposes.As I have already mentioned, while I enjoyed Evoy's colloquial tone and sound marketing advice, I did find MYSS! To be overly long and slightly convoluted. Again, it seems odd to me that an author who stresses the importance of simplicity would create such a HUGE compendium of knowledge that does indeed overwhelm the reader on a topic that is quite frankly a bit overwhelming to begin with. Still, once you manage to wade through the sections and subsections of each chapter, you find that you have, in fact, come away with some really excellent knowledge on the following subjects:* The Most Wanted Response (MWR)* Writing to SELL!* Building Trust and Likeability* Winning Sales With Valuable Content* Making your Site Usable* Enhancing Ease of Navigation* Writing a You-Focused Opener* Critical Sales Builders* The Closer Page* The Backup Response* Traffic Analysis* Using E-mail to Close Sales* Customer Service* How Big and Small Sites Sell* Building Traffic* Etc.For all of these (and more--MYSS! Is almost 800 pages, remember?!), every aspect is covered, from definitions, to how-to's, to suggestions, to what-not-to-do's, to full-on examples and real life experiences. I'll say it again: for a beginning web marketer/online sales person, MYSS! Might be the perfect, bare-bones start up guide to get your website off on the right foot. It sticks to the timeless basics and relies on common sense to deliver successful results. While this could not be your one resource anymore--you'd be behind the curve as the online landscape has changed so drastically in the past ten years--you will likely come away from MYSS! Feeling like you have gained a great base of reliable, solid knowledge and advice about the sometimes intimidating virtual world. Well, you will if the crazy format doesn't drive you nuts halfway through reading it, and cause you to throw it against the wall in frustration. :)"},{"Title":"Make Your Site Sell","review":"This is one of the first e-marketing books I purchased when I entered the field in 1999 and it really gave me an invaluable education in online sales and marketing.Back in the days when sock puppets sold bags of dog food online (or tried to, anyway) and gerbils were fired from cannons, Ken Evoy had a very simple proposition: if you're going to have a website, you might as well sell something.

Very useful for someone traveling to a new country for the first time. Or so I thought, until I read the portion on India. While most observations seem OK, the naming convention of Indian Muslims caught my attention. While most Muslim names used in India are derived from Arabic, I haven't seen anyone named or using 'bin' or 'binti' as in the Arab world. So my 2 cents - read it, but do check the facts before you tout about your cultural knowledge in a client meeting. But I like the analysis of cultural orientation with cognitive styles and negotiation strategies. That makes it a useful read than the average tips you can find on internet"},{"Title":"Kiss, Bow, or Shake Hands: How to Do Business in Sixty Countries","review":"Kiss, Bow, or Shake Hands (KBSH) is a great guide to international business and negotiation. Even though this book is directed to people who are inexperienced in global business; all enthusiast to international commerce can easily find value in this book. KBSH prepares readers on what to expect when doing business in different regions of the world. This book presents a macro glimpse of socio, cultural, and business principles for each of the 60 countries evaluated. Also presented is brief history on each country that in some cases is relevant to the countries socio and business environment.Below are the sections that the book covers on each country with inserts (in italics) from random countries.* What's your Cultural IQ - This section examines the reader's general knowledge of a country by presenting three questions and answers. These questions are based on general culture, history, and geography.T or F: Although Colombia is named after Christopher Columbus; he never set foot on Colombian soil. Answer: TRUE. The first Europeans to reach Colombia were led by Alonso de Ojeda in 1499.* Tips on Doing Business in Country - As the header explains, this section presents guidelines for doing business in the country.Finland is the closest Nordic nation to the former USSR which makes it ideally located to conduct business with Russia and the Baltic States.* Country Background - This section presents common background knowledge on a country such as History, Government, and Language. Also included is a section that examines the countries domestic point-of-view on important social issues the effect the country.In 1941, Peru invaded Ecuador and annexed almost half of Ecuador's land. The two countries still dispute their borders. Ecuadoreans are still bidder about this loss, and it is advised not to mention this conflict when doing business in Ecuador.* Cultural Orientation - This section presents the following itemso Cognitive Styles: How [Indians] Organize and Process Information - In India, information is accepted openly as long as it does not challenge religious and social ordero Negotiation Strategies: What [Kuwaitis] Accept as Evidence - In Kuwait, truth is found in Islamic law, therefore faith in its ideologies permeates all discussions.o Value Systems: The Basis for Behavior - In Italy and Ireland, the ideologies of the Catholic Church exert the most influence* Business Practices - This section presents the following itemso Punctuality, Appointments, and Local Time - The French are always punctual in appointments for both business and social occasions. French in the south are more relaxed about time.o Negotiating - The pace of business negotiations in Singapore may be slower when compared to the West. It would be unusual to complete a complicated business deal in only one trip.o Business Entertaining - In the Philippines, celebrate a business deal by inviting your Filipino partners to a restaurant. The person who issues the invitation pays, unless if it is a woman.* Protocol - This section presents the following itemso Greetings - In Japan bowing is the traditional greeting. However, the Japanese are very aware of Western habits and will often greet with a handshake.o Titles/Forms of Address - In South Africa professional titles are important, and traditionally only family members and close friends address each other by their first names.o Gestures - In Pakistan gesturing with a closed fist is considered obscene and using individual fingers to make gestures is considered impolite. Women should never wink.o Gifts - In Indonesia, gift giving is traditional. It is not customary to unwrap a gift in the presence of the giver; doing so would suggest that the recipient is greedy and impatient.o Dress - Egyptians may find it offensive to see foreigners dressed in their traditional clothes. Men should avoid wearing visible jewelry, especially around the neck.One of elements that stood out the most after reading this book is the leverage that religious beliefs have on a number of societies, typically in developing nations. \\"A code of ethics by most definitions is a written distinct, formal document which consists of moral standards which help guide employee or corporate behavior\\". [Code of Ethics - p.83] In many countries religious law dictates society and business behavior. In the Philippines, for example, negotiating the distribution of contraceptives in a country with a high birth rate and growing poverty would go against the strong influence from the Catholic Churches ideology. Similarly, Islamic religious ideology has a strong influence in Pakistan and Kuwait, and Hinduism in India. Religion is a sensitive subject that is heavily based on faith instead of facts. Negotiation terms that contradict religious beliefs can easily fall in a conflict trap where beliefs and expectations are firmly in place.Another realization from this book is variance of negotiation preparation amongst different cultures. The Three-Stage Model of the Negotiation Process, \\"prenegotiation, preparation, and negotiation all suffer from multiple interpretations and uses\\" [Rethinking Preparation in Negotiation - p.3]. For example, the Danes typically go right to business, with a minimum of small talk. Danes are also punctual to meets and social engagement, and orderly. Someone negotiating in Denmark should enter a negotiation expecting a Negotiation Process and schedule to be honored. On the other hand, negotiation planning is less predictable in Belize. For starters, \\"A Belizean must like you to do business with you.\\" [KBSH - p.68] Delays can also be expected in Belize; it is important to be flexible with deadlines and completion dates.The probability of a productive negotiation is improved when all parties involved are willing to listen and understand each other's point-of-view. Doing business in countries such as Brazil, where facts are acceptable as evidence, negotiators can expect techniques such as the Loop of Understanding, \\"a technique that helps focus the dialogue and develop understanding throughout the mediation\\" [Challenging Conflict - p.68], to be a means to resolve conflict traps. Brazilians find aggressive negotiators offensive, and expect to discuss all aspects of a contract. Win-win negotiations are more possible in these environments.KBSH is a great book that presents different business attributes from all over the world. I found this book, guide, relevant to my current and past relations with individuals from different cultures. My past work experience in Latin American, I learned the hard way that it is not acceptable to openly joke about a coworker's performance and that \\"maybe\\" actually means \\"no\\"; attributes such as these are mentioned in this book. This book has won its place in my arsenal of global negotiation guides."},{"Title":"Kiss, Bow, or Shake Hands: How to Do Business in Sixty Countries","review":"Kiss, Bow, or Shake Hands (KBSH) is not an epic feat of mediation on cultural relativism in negotiations. Instead it reads like a field manual for the trenches of international business. It oozes pragmatism. KBSH covers 62 countries, each with their own section. Since it attempts to cover so many countries it favors breadth over depth, but despite being extremely Spartan in delivery the advice is no less insightful.There are many valuable lessons in KBSH, and came away with numerous directly applicable principles and tactics. The biggest problem with the book is that it tries to cover so many countries that it is not able to dive too deeply into each. Despite this I believe future audiences would highly benefit by reading this book.Each country section is laid out in a similar format. There is a \\"Cultural Note\\" preface to kick off each section, and these are also peppered throughout the section as asides. This is followed by a quiz of sorts to test your \\"Cultural IQ\\" for that particularly country. Next we dive right in to \\"Tips for Doing Business in ___\\". This is followed by \\"Country Background\\" that is divided into History, Type of Government, Language, and some more practical takeaways in the Know Before You Go section. From here we have three more major section delineations with, \\"Cultural Orientation\\", \\"Business Practices\\", and \\"Protocol\\". Since an exhaustive review of every country covered would be nigh impossible without rewriting the book in its totality, I will instead focus on the Japan section as an illustrative example of the book's notable qualities and salient points that relate to business negotiations.The first bits of sound guidance come in the \\"Tips on Doing Business in Japan\\" section. The text notes that a \\"poker face\\" - maintaining absolute poise and always keeping a blank but serene facial expression despite what one may actually be thinking or feeling - will be a key tool in negotiating with the Japanese. Certainly there can be a tactical advantage to \\"not showing your cards\\" in a negotiation, but moreover the book makes the point that this is an important cultural concession as well. The Japanese do not admire flamboyant displays of emotion or overly animated body language. If one comes from a more expressive culture, or if this is just a facet of their individual personality, the technique of \\"style switching\\" becomes crucial for obtaining optimally desired outcomes.KBSH also notes the lasting tradition of strict adherence to hierarchy and age as a key indicator of \\"rank\\". Younger team members are expected to be predominantly quiet and deferential.More useful guidance is giving in the Cultural Orientation section on Japanese Cognitive Styles. Given their stoic demeanor, one might falsely presume that the Japanese are not swayed by emotions of opinions and apply a Vulcan sense of rationality to their decision making process; but nothing could be further from actuality, in fact the Japanese are extremely subjective and experiential in their decision making. Further, the Japanese strive for consensus and harmony within the group. But the group is strictly defined by only those within the \\"circle of trust\\", and typically this circle does not consist of \\"outsiders\\" (foreigners). To a person new to doing business in Japan this process can seem impervious and extremely exclusionary. While it is tempting to this style is born of arrogance and a sense of superiority, it is actually more closely rooted in fear and anxiety. KBSH points out that the Japanese are extremely adverse to embarrassment and galvanizes them into group conformity and deferment to perceived authority... \\"safety in numbers\\". When I worked as an English language instructor in Japan, I once had a relatively advanced student who was infatuated with American idioms, and particularly any that had parallels to Japanese idioms. He once told me, \\"you know you Americans have the saying \`the squeaky wheel gets the grease,' I think I understand this; we have a similar expression in Japan, but it is a little different I guess, we say, \\"the nail that sticks up is the one that gets smashed back into place with the hammer.\\"One of the most useful chunks of information for negotiations strategies comes in the Business Practices section. KBSH puts it very bluntly, \\"Hard-sell techniques will fail in Japan.\\" The Japanese do not respond well to high-pressure tactics. Rather than relying on bludgeoning your Japanese negotiation partner into submission with a volley of irrefutable facts, instead try to find points of consensus and then use these as your building blocks. Even if these points of agreement are emotionally based, not fact based - something as simple as both parties agree they \\"just like the red one better\\" - use this as your foundation. Keeping the presentation on a positive and consensus building path is the best approach. Similarly the Japanese value personal connections, both at the negotiation table and as a key aspect for doing business. This is one example of many where understanding how to effectively communicate across cultures. Utilizing tools like the Cultural Orientation Indicator, one can readily gather many of the concepts espoused in KBSH. The Japanese prefer Harmony; are Cooperative, High Context, and Indirect; prefer Hierarchy in their power structures, gravitate towards order; and are Inductive, Linear, Systemic thinkers. While living in Japan I witnessed a very informative engagement between at an internet caf&eacute;. An Italian man and his Japanese companion were at the counter where you would pay the attendee for a token to use one of the connected computer terminals. There was some misunderstanding, and despite the urging of restraint from his Japanese girlfriend the Italian man began to vigorously argue with the attendant (this was all taking place in English). He did not understand that there was a waiting list for a free terminal, and instead was insisting that he be given a terminal immediately. Unable to find a cooperative solution to achieve order and harmony in the situation, the attendant simply \\"shut down\\". She froze into absolute motionless silence with a statuesque stare fixed into the distance. The Italian man continued for a short time, then became befuddled. With deflated despair he left the caf&eacute;; the \\"immovable object\\" having clearly held the day over the \\"irresistible force\\"."},{"Title":"Kiss, Bow, or Shake Hands: How to Do Business in Sixty Countries","review":"The ratings for this book are extremely high, but to get all 60 or so countries in, there seems to be little info about each country.

When I received the book, my first instinct was to turn to see the section on the UK to see what was written about the customs and traditions of my native country. The problem was, I couldn't find it. First, I searched under &quot;United Kingdom&quot;. Then I tried &quot;Great Britain&quot;, and in desperation, &quot;Britain&quot;. I was dismayed (to say the least) when I eventually found it under &quot;England&quot;. As a very small Cultural Note on the third page of the section explains, &quot;England&quot; is but one country in a group of three that make up Great Britain, one of four that comprise the United Kingdom, and one of five that form the British Isles.I have no objection to descriptions of the customs, traditions, and history of England. My objection is to the fact that the terms England, the UK, and Great Britain are used interchangeably on the first three pages of this section, before the aforementioned note explains that this is not accurate. Referring to &quot;England's&quot; educational and belief systems when those of the UK are meant, and &quot;the English&quot; when &quot;the British&quot; are meant is completely erroneous - and even offensive. It is tantamount to confusing the USA and Canada, a mistake that very few people would make.Having lived in the USA for some time, I have come to realize that there is a common misconception in America that England and the UK are one and the same country. As it is clear to me from the Cultural Note that the authors of this book are fully aware of the difference, I am disappointed that a book aimed at promoting cultural awareness does nothing to clear up this misconception. The fact that the Cultural Note explaining this difference does not occur until the middle of the section even suggests that it is unimportant......The inaccuracy of the information in the UK section of this book would lead me to doubt the accuracy of the information in the other sections.

A few years ago, I offended a colleague from another country. Before I visited that country--or hosted a guest from that country in my home--I had meant to learn more about his culture, his behavior styles, his business practices, even his negotiating techniques. But I didn't.If you travel outside of your country, work in a multi-cultural office, worship with people from other cultures, email colleagues in other countries, or participate (or even lead) church short-term mission trips, I have a book for you.Kiss, Bow, or Shake Hands: The Bestselling Guide to Doing Business in More than 60 Countries provides a snapshot look at nations where you may be traveling. Example: I visited Turkey this year. If you relied on the prevalent loud speaker calls to prayer, you would think that Turkey is a Muslim country. But this helpful book pointed out that Turkey has no official religion, even though 90 percent of the Turkish population is Sunni Muslim.Did you know it's best to keep both feet flat on the floor in Turkey? \\"Displaying the soles of your shoes (or feet) to someone is rude.\\" And, \\"it is rude to cross your arms while facing someone.\\" Americans and Turks indicate \\"yes\\" by nodding their heads up and down, but Turks say no with their eyebrows. (You'll need to study that section before your next trip.)What's the point? Cross-cultural travel is ripe with opportunities to embarrass yourself and demean others. Advance preparation will help. In Australia, for example, men \\"should not be too demonstrative with other men.\\" Contrast that with the 2005 photo of U.S. President George W. Bush and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah--and their hand-holding stroll at Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas!Each country profile includes the country background, business practices, cultural orientation and protocol. Example: in India, don't pat a child's hair. \\"The head is considered the seat of the soul by many Indians.\\" In Canada (per the authors), \\"the standard space between you and your conversation partner should be two feet.\\" But French Canadians may stand closer. (Memo to my Canadian clients: should I bring a yardstick next time, or will you provide it?)Other books, such as theThe CIA World Factbook 2010, cover every country, but this one focuses on just over 60, including England, Indonesia, South Korea, Pakistan, Mexico, Sweden, Columbia, Brazil, China and Russia.

That's quite a distance to move a major cultural landmark!"},{"Title":"Kiss, Bow, or Shake Hands: How to Do Business in Sixty Countries","review":"Today's business world is such that you are very likely to have working relationships with global business partners. And you *should* know that \\"when in Rome, do as the Romans do\\". But what exactly is that? Terry Morrison and Wayne A Conaway bridge some of that information gap with the book Kiss, Bow, or Shake Hands. This is one of those books that could help you close a big deal (or avoid killing one).The book covers a large number of countries, one chapter per, and gives you the basics of culture, history, language, and what-not. The chapter starts with a quick culture note (some small and interesting fact) followed by a Cultural IQ test (a few quick questions to see how much you know about the country). There are then tips on doing business there, a very brief historical background, the type of government that is practiced, and what languages are common. The Cultural Orientation section attempts to delve a bit into the general mindset of how they think, make decisions, and regard each other in terms of equality. Probably the most practical sections are the Business Practices and Protocol areas, where you learn what is expected when doing business over there. For instance, there are different speeds in which negotiations occur. Some countries get right to the point, while others will engage in social talk for an extended time before starting business. In some places, being on time is critically important, whereas in other countries, the other party may be an hour late with no explanation. There is also extensive coverage on what to wear and what is expected socially once you're outside of the normal workday.Overall, I found the book pretty interesting. I read it from cover to cover, which isn't the best way to digest this book. Since countries in neighboring areas might be similar in culture, I found large sections of information that were identical to something I read a few pages before. It's better to use the book as reference, paying particular attention to the countries where you have interests. There are also websites included in the material that point you to additional references on history, culture, and the like. I would recommend using those, as you can only cover so much information in four or five pages.While not an exhaustive reference for any particular area, it *will* keep you from making the obvious cultural faux pas.

Then, keep an open mind, learn from the people you encounter, and enjoy the adventure!"},{"Title":"Kiss, Bow, or Shake Hands: How to Do Business in Sixty Countries","review":"This book had come highly recommended, so I had hoped to be able to read it without finding numerous errors, but I was very disapointed. Not only were there entire countries missing but there was one piece of erroneous information which was repeated throughout the book in various chapters. A few of the countries I was not able to find were Austria, Cuba, Lebanon and Morocco. Austria may not be the biggest nation in the world, but that does not mean businesses do not exist there, and just because the US has an embargo against Cuba doesn't mean other English reading countries cannot do business there. Many European nations have open relations with Cuba that do not prevent them from business communications. In regards to the piece of erroneous information repeated throughout the book, in Chile, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Spain, and Venezuela, the book claims that Hispanic women change their last names when they get married. (This information may have been repeated in other Hispanic nations, but those were the only ones I read.) Hispanic women do NOT change their last names at any point in their lives. A Hispanic woman can be married half a dozen times and the last names she dies with are the same ones she was born with. Had it not been for the missing countries and repeatedly incorrect information I would have enjoyed this as a better resource."},{"Title":"Kiss, Bow, or Shake Hands: How to Do Business in Sixty Countries","review":"I think this a great and intersting book. It is a great help for international buisness. Although it took three weeks to get a book from someone located in the same state as me. It shouldn't have taken so long, i needed it for a class."},{"Title":"The Seekers","review":"The first two books in the series were good. What I noticed about this, one is that Phillip's character has changed dramatically. To the point where I don't recognize him anymore. The scenes of intimate nature in the previous books in the series were not very detailed which I prefer. In this one, however, he not only goes into detail but most of the encounters he spends pages on are horrible! I have never read so many rape scenes in my life!! (one is too many) one of these victims is only 10, the poor girl. It seems to ramble through the early 1800s with no real point in mind. There are places he will stop at and jump forward in time then flashback to where we just left off. I like to read to end my stressful day and go to sleep. This book near the end has done neither."},{"Title":"The Seekers","review":"Book 3 of The Kent Family Chronicles covers the period following the War of Independence.Jared Kent,son of Abraham Kent, the main protagonist of Book 2 \\"The Rebel\\",is left in Boston in the care of his uncle,Gilbert Kent, younger half-brother of Abraham and Gilbert's wife Harriet, a mean minded woman who resents Gilbert's affection for his nephew.Jared's only friend is his cousin Amanda who is several years his junior.After Gilbert's death, Harriet marries a fortune hunting gambler who not only gambles away all the family's money but who make improper advances to the 10 year old Amanda.Jared is forced to protect Amanda and wrongly believes that he has killed a man in self defence.On the same night Harriet is killed under the wheels of a carriage forcing Jared and Amanda to run away and begin an incredible journey-by foot-across country to Tennessee.They fall victim to a bogus preacher who kidnaps Amanda and sells her to an Indian tribe.Jared at once begins the near impossible task of finding and rescuing her."},{"Title":"The Seekers","review":"John Jakes' Bicentennial series takes a leap forward in time -- and a leap to another perspective -- from the second book to this third one, \\"The Seekers.\\" Now Abraham Kent, whom we last saw as a small boy bounding across the grass at the end of \\"The Rebels,\\" is a grown man and is serving in the military as a sort of self-imposed exercise of personal growth. This third installment passes the perspective from father to son, and boy, is Philip Kent a different man through his son's eyes. Abraham sees him as stern, judgmental and seeking only to fit his son into an idealistic scenario with the Kent and Son printing empire. Philip has done well for himself since the end of the Revolutionary War and the hardship of losing Abraham's mother Anne (and truth be told, this dramatic change in his persona was set up by Jakes with Philip's devastation over Anne's death at the end of the second book). But with his wealth, Abraham argues, Philip seems to have become that which he hated as a young man -- the privileged, sanctimonious upper class.Abraham, so put off by that, feels the call to explore the West, where he heads with his rather-unruly stepsister and now wife, Elizabeth Fletcher, who's also seeking an escape. But the West beats them both to a pulp. And really, all of the characters in this book take a severe beating. (Perhaps you've read the references to rape in the other reviews on this page?!) A reviewer of the second book lamented about the continually terrible events inflicting the characters. I didn't see that so much in \\"The Rebels,\\" but boy did I see it in spades in this third one. Wow. Just one awful catastrophe after another. As the perspective changes again to Abraham's half-brother Gilbert, then to Abraham's son Jared, nothing seems to go right for ANY of these people, throughout the whole book. Trust me, it's ugly, and if you're female like me, the ending is particularly horrifying.Is it a good book, a page-turner? Yes, I was kept riveted, if at times revulsed. Jakes is still a very fine executor of the writing craft. And I intend to stick with him to the end of the eighth book. But if some good things don't happen to these people soon, I'm not going to be highly motivated!"},{"Title":"The Seekers","review":"I was in the mood to pick up on a series and I wasn't expecting too much. Heck, I read the first two and I was satisfied. The characters tend to be a bit two dimensional and the \\"history\\" he integrates is often laughable (how many famous people can someone accidentally run into?) I don't expect perfection though, so not a big deal. In fact, I was riveted by the naval fight aboard the USS Constitution that Jared gets to experience. By far it is the most exciting portion of the novel.But seriously, as others have mentioned: the rape scenes. There are more attempted rape (and successful) in this book than I have ever read. There's one about every 75 pages it feels like, including a ten year old girl, told in graphic detail. I understand Jakes wanting to tell it like it was, but when the rape scenes outnumber all other scenes, you're taking a step in the wrong direction. It gets to be where every male Jakes character is a lecherous drunken moron who has no regard for women. I get that women might have been particularly helpless in the late 1700s and early 1800s, but I got that point two books ago. Seriously I just don't see finding this as \\"entertaining\\" when there are so many of these scenes chucked in for no apparent reason. It's not that I feel they should never be in any book, just that this book seems to revel in including them.I had the intent to read this whole series. I'll move on. It's what America should have done in the 70s to this guy."},{"Title":"The Seekers","review":"this book does not seem to contain the excitement of it's predecessors, the Bastard and the Rebels. War descriptions are lengthy at times and quite confusing and boring. The quality of the writing of this whole series seems devoid of quality and I feel this book was written more poorly than the previous novels mentioned above. I am torn as to whether to dump this seies or continue to the fourth book. THe family represented is interesting but such hard work to get through it. I read this series when it was first published and thought it was great literature. Therefore I was looking forward to rereading it. What a disappointment to learm that what I thought was great litderature 40 years ago is really soap operish trash. Don't waste your time with this book."},{"Title":"The Seekers","review":"Have thoroughly enjoyed the Kent series. However, this was the least enjoyable of the series.

Of all the books I read of his this one disturbed me. There were parts that made me feel really bad since he put me right there in their struggles. He showed me that all wasn't sucess with the people who \\"went west\\" when west was southern Ohio. Of course this book sets you up for the next one and so on. One thing that people have now is that you don't have to wait for months or years for the next book in the series to come out.

There was frustration in the books, because the Arthur was not making it to be a happy ending all the time. John Jakes threw in twist and turns throughout the book.

I recommend them to everyone, especially high school or college level students"},{"Title":"The Seekers","review":"I love John Jakes novels. All of them. But I felt in this series he missed a great opportunity to finish stories and I was left feeling incomplete after getting to know the characters I would like to have known more about their lives. Instead, I would get a glimpse of what happened to them in a 30 year time period in one paragraph.But as always, Jakes makes you get involved with his characters. Love them or hate them, I still want to know about all of them.The one other negative was that I bought the series on my kindle so I was unable to enlarge the family tree enough to actually see it and for this series it would have been really helpful.I can be hopeful that one day maybe he will write the stories that he missed expanding on. I would be the first in line to buy those books."},{"Title":"The Seekers","review":"I just finished this book and I thought it was every bit as entertaining as the first two.\\"SPOILER ALERT\\".Abraham Kent was a the son of Phillip Kent and you can see how his father has changed from the first book to the second after having lost his wife after she was kidnapped and drowned at sea trying to escape.I could see how as Phillip got older and successful he becomes more conservative i.e. a federalist.His son Abraham saw this everyday and so he marries his step-sister Elizabeth and moves out west wanting to have nothing to do with the east and its politics.The west promptly chews them up and spits them out.Their son Jared is a fascinating character and I love reading about him.His young sister Amanda Kent has it the worst and I won't say anymore about her.Some people say this book has alot of rape scenes and there definitely are some but they illustrate how hard it was out on the frontier.Jared and Amanda met just as many nice people on their journey out west as they did bad.It is hard to read what happened to Amanda and I guess John Jakes could have left it out but I don't think it was gratuitous.Anyways I love these books.John Jakes is a wonderful writer and I intend to read every book he has ever written.\\"The North and the South\\" series was fantastic and \\"The Kent Family Chronicles\\" are shaping up to be just as good if not better.Read any of these you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Seekers","review":"Loved this book. It made me want to read every book in the series."},{"Title":"The Seekers","review":"I find his writing disturbing. As a woman who works with victims of sexual abuse, I could not completely finish this book. The descriptions were too intense and graffic. It worries me that child molesters can access this type of material which is not porn and still get their high of seeing children raped. I would never recommend the book and would suggest the author needs sensitivity training. I know the book is supposed to be historical, but I also sincerely hope this nation was not founded by so very many low life scoundrels as appear in these books."},{"Title":"The Seekers","review":"I really like The Bastard and I gave it 4 out of 5 and then the second book The Rebels was good but not as good as the first and I gave it 4 out of 5 becouse it was still a great book. Then the third vol in the Kent family is The Seekers and it's the best one yet. Finally the stories unfold and the charactors finally develope. Abraham Kent marries is hald sister and moves to the west. I really liked the store of Abraham in the west with there encounter witht he Indians and the strugles. You see the down fall of many characters you fell in love with in the first two books. In the middle things change and new stories begen to unfold which I liked. Then the book ends with a kinda of cliffhanger which makes you cant wait to read the next books. The best in the series so far and I cant wait to read the rest."},{"Title":"The Seekers","review":"Exciting and historical. Extensive research. Would have been just as interesting without the typical foul language."},{"Title":"The Seekers","review":"This is book Three in the Kent Family series and a necessary one, if not thoroughly engrossing one, of the series. It continues the story of the Kent Family and fills in necessary holes that you won't get from reading Book Four of the series.This one is about Abraham who falls in love with his step-sister, daughter of Peggy McLean and Justin Fletcher, from book two, and of their son, Jared, and his cousin, Amanda, daughter of Abraham's brother, Gilead and his mean-minded wife, Harriet. Abraham and Elizabeth tried to make their fortune in the Wild West which was Ohio then ~~ only to lose everything when an Indian killed Elizabeth. The story then focuses on Jared, who was dumped on his uncle's household and made to feel unwelcomed and unloved. This book also describes how the Kent Family lost their printing business that Philip Kent had worked so hard to build up from the ashes of Revolutionary War.It is a short book ~~ necessary and entertaining in some spots ~~ but filled with historical antedotes in between the War of 1812 and before the Mexican war. This one is about Jared.

She also illustrates with personal glimpses how she acquired the qualities which improved her own life. Sharing our stories allows others to relate and feel less alone, and structuring ourselves to meet a daily task commands committment.

Heavenly Daze Series.)","review":"It's January on the Island of Heavenly Daze, and though the islanders get a brief, heaven-sent reprieve from constant avalanches of snow and ice, there are some chilly snowdrifts forming in some of the relationships. You don't have to have read the other 3 books in the series, but you might understand the secondary characters more if you do - most of the secondary characters here were in the spotlight in a previous Heavenly Daze story - The danger of getting to know some of the characters in previous stories is you hope to get updates on them in later stories - there ARE updates on previous characters here, but they seem to be sketchier than they have been in past stories... if you want to know more about Bobby and Brittany, who are Salt's grandkids, or Salt (the lighthouse-keeper) and Birdie (the retired librarian) - don't expect much because though they are mentioned, none of them even speak more than a passing comment of a sentence or two - if that. Of course if the authors gave detailed updates on all the secondary characters, the book would probably be double the length it is now!In this fourth story, we get to know Mike and Dana Klackenbush (she's a teacher who runs the Kid Kare Center; he's helped fix up their home and the school) and Dana's eccentric brother, Buddy. The story of Buddy's quest for a place to belong is a very good one, but the snowdrifts that form between Mike and Dana seem to get swiped at with a kitchen spoon instead of a top-of-the-line snowblower - yet the snow and ice miraculously disappear after a brief &quot;heart-to-heart&quot; talk (how can a heart-to-heart talk after weeks of silence take only a few minutes to wrap up?). The family relationships between Barbara and Russell Higgs (a young couple who have been married for 3 years and are ready to start a family of their own; they are currently living with Barbara's parents, Floyd and Cleta, who run the bed and breakfast) and Barbara's parents are in the spotlight, too. This look at a mother who finds it threatening when her daughter cuts her hair and visits the doctor without telling her (and to add insult to injury, she tells Russell things first!) is very heart-rending and realistic (though at times Cleta acts overly-much like a simpering, whiny child while Barbara reacts a bit more adult-like - hurt and confused, YES, but not unbelievably - Cleta's behavior seems overdone) and is resolved in a time frame that seems more realistic than Mike and Dana's - Cleta doesn't figure things out overnight nor does the pain magically go away. We see a little bit of the growing process.Overall, this is a very good story with a healthy dose of humor -well worth the time spent with the islanders even through the brisk, cold winds of January."},{"Title":"A Perfect Love (Copeland, Lori.

So much whining and insecurity from all sides of the story lines. Pages and pages of the same stuff. Heavenly Daze books usually focus on a few islanders in each book and that has worked in the past, but not this time. Bobby and his pet were just obnoxious, Dana's and Mike's kiss and make-up was shallow, Annie's tomato project was lightly written off and the Cleta-Barbara thing was totally overdone although it was given the most acceptable resolution.

Wonderfully, each of her books is quite different from the next.Most women enjoy a great romance book, I am no different. Although, I prefer one with substance, a little more than the Harlequin's. Thus, Commitments is a great romance novel! It's got a steamy love affair, one that floats right off the pages. But it also has a story behind that love, one that I found inspiring, on many levels. Redemption, forgiveness, courage, commitment, unconditional love, dedication...the two people in this story have them all!If you haven't read Barbara Delinsky, I'd recommend picking up one of her books.

Then she wastes no time sharing a \\"rare and lovely moment\\" groping with the convict in the prison yard.Dreck, utter dreck.There are some small authentic glimpses into the life of a parent of a handicapped child, but not many.And listening to our darling confess that she hopes her son has a terminal illness or won't wake up and the convict consoling is a little too much, especially while they are both lusting in the prison yard during the touching exchange.Of course, this is only up to listening to parts one though five of 15 of the audio book. Not sure if I will make it to the end.Too hard to suspend disbelief for this little romance to be romantic and not just irritating."},{"Title":"Vocabulary Workshop: Level B","review":"As a teacher and a dad, I have found that this series is a great way to teach vocabulary and is a great way to learn. Words have the pronunciation(which is also online in audio form), great definitions/synonyms/antonyms, and great exersises. There is a review every 3 chapters in each book and a review/test at the end of it too. Each book has about 12 chapters with 20 words to learn. Great to do weekly. As a teacher I would advise testing weekly 10 of the 20 words with spelling, meaning and using them in a sentence. I would then give them 5 additional words from any earlier chapter to keep them reviewing. These books are great. My students (from 6th-11th grade) all love them. After a few chapters students will comment how they can understand more when they read. It is also very cool to hear your kids learning these words in their daily lives."},{"Title":"Vocabulary Workshop: Level B","review":"This vocabulary series is the best one that I have found to illustrate how the word is most often used.

That book was a huge inspiration to me, and I was thrilled to find out she had a new book out. I've Been Around is a collection of essays that will update Aebi's fans as to her life after her trip. More than that, this new book evokes the same sense of wonder and inspiration as Maiden Voyage. In fact, when I first purchased I've Been Around, I was so excited that I began reading it on my walk from the bookstore to my car. I parked far enough away that I was able to finish the first essay I had turned to: \\"Close Call\\". Immediately, this essay put me back in that state of mind which Maiden Voyage evoked; a sense of the amazing potential we all have. \\"Close Call\\" is about the story Aebi tells people when they ask if she ever felt in danger from anyone she met on her voyage. Aebi relays a story of meeting some fishermen off the coast of Sri Lanka. Ultimately, the story is not of the danger she was in, but of how helpful the fishermen were. In fact, she finds out years later just how safe she really was, and how sincere these men were in their concern and helpfulness towards this young woman alone at sea. I think tales of the inherent goodness of people are more necessary now than ever. \\"Close Call\\" will be the essay I share with the many people who tell me that they are scared to travel overseas. The fact that I was nearly run-over by a Honda Element while reading this essay, however, taught me I need to be more careful while close to home.I've Been Around is written with the same humble, down to earth tone as Maiden Voyage. While there are plenty of sailing stories from trips she has taken since her solo voyage, what appeals to me about Aebi's writing is how she applies the lessons learned from her trips to real life. I've personally never been on a sail boat. The writing in this book is less about sailing and more about how to be resourceful and inventive in order to survive the many day-to-day and extraordinary challenges we all face. I loved reading I've Been Around and I highly recommend it to all sailors and non-sailors out there."},{"Title":"I've Been Around","review":"I was very excited to get this book. I love Tania's column in Attitude's. Then to find out, she just took her old columns, kind of sorted them by topic, and stuck them in book form....Boo.I hope she sits down and writes a book from scratch, looking back at her circumnavigation, her life since then. That could be a great book."},{"Title":"I've Been Around","review":"As a long-time follower and fan of Tania Aebi, and reader of her first book, \\"Maiden Voyage,\\" the account of her solo circumnavigation as the youngest woman to accomplish such a remarkable feat, I waited in great anticipation for the release of her latest book, \\"I've Been Around.\\" This compilation of her articles with her musings on not only the sailing life, but how intertwined that life can be with so many other aspects of living, is wonderful! It's a joy to learn about what is happening to her since her voyage and to be able to peek into the mind of this very special person. For the true adventurer or even the adventure wanna-be, I highly recommend Ms. Aebi's new book."},{"Title":"I've Been Around","review":"After reading the first book by Tania Aebi, Maiden Voyage, I couldn't wait to read her second book to see what happened in her life. However, I was disappointed with this book. I felt that her writing style had changed and the stories lacked the same charm and witt. I was also disappointed to find that the book was actually a group of short stories, not a continuation of Maiden Voyage. I felt there was no flow and devoid of much emeotion. All in all, I still think Tania Aebi is amazing and has lived an amazing life and Maiden Voyage will be one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"I've Been Around","review":"This book is a compilation of short stories Tania wrote for a magazine. I did not find it as informative or interesting as her first book Maiden Voyage. Sadly, if you are looking to learn something about sailing, there is not a lot of meat in this book....however, her first book is terriffic."},{"Title":"I've Been Around","review":"When I read Maiden Voyage by Tania Aebi, I thought it was one of the best, well written accounts on the market...a truly amazing story. I was disappointed in this one however in that it lacked Tania's excellent and detailed story telling, and much of it was just a summary of accounts in her previous book."},{"Title":"I've Been Around","review":"Tania Aebi caused a world sensation when she sailed around the world solo as an 18yr old, the youngest person ever to do so. She told her story in the excellent 1989 \\"Maiden Voyage\\" book. Many years later (2005), Aebi returns with this book.In \\"I've Been Around\\" (230 pages). the author (now in her 40s) brings a collection of sailing-related and other stories, some of which work, some of which don't. One of the better one is \\"Close Call\\", in which she recalls being scared in her trip around the world at one point, when she seeks the help of two Sri Lankan guys to tow her into the harbor and wonders about their intent (being a young girl, alone), only many years later to reconnect with one of them, and feeling ashamed about her apprehension then. Most of the stories in this book are 3-4 pages long, and bring the author's recollections of various sailing experiences, now and then. It is not what I expected, to be honest. I had hoped for a more personal book, as in: how her relationship with Olivier (started in her 'maiden voyage') developed and then fell apart (we know they married, had 2 kids, and eventually divorced).In all, \\"I've Been Around\\" doesn't measure up at all to the pleasure that was \\"Maiden Voyage\\". This book is not a sequel to it. It's a non-personal book with observations about sailing, nothing more."},{"Title":"I've Been Around","review":"I'm one starring(?) sheridan house not Tania, I'd like to read it if I can find a complete copy :-)))I bought two copies (presents) some time ago and only recently was told both copies were missing nearly fifty page\\" right in the best part\\" P 125 thru 176."},{"Title":"I've Been Around","review":"If you read the wonderful book writen by Tania Aebi titled, Maiden Voyage and enjoyed it, then these stories that are inspired from that specific trip, then you will enjoy the inspiration these have to offer. I reread them from time to time enjoying them each and every read."},{"Title":"Secrets of Cold War Technology: Project HAARP and Beyond","review":"The first half of the book is nothing but Tesla. A far too long history lesson for the rest of the book. The second half of the book does deal with cold war tech, but the HAARP project, mentioned in the title, only appears briefly.According to Mr. Vassilatos, every technology in use is a pale imitation of, failed attempt at, or based upon a Teslian patent. I was surprised when fire wasn't included as an invention of Tesla's.There are whole chapters which read as if a second author wrote them. Ghost writers aren't bad, but these chapters didn't fit.The editing is THE WORST I have ever seen (I read over 30 books a year). The author is redundant in handling the material. The book could easily have been 50-100 pages shorter and still covered all the discussions. Misspelled words were so common, they shattered what continuity the story did have. If I was the author, I would be mad as hell at the way this book was published. As a reader, I am never going to buy another book published by Adventures Unlimited Press, assuming the text mistakes are theirs.I liked the info about Tesla and the included bibliography."},{"Title":"Secrets of Cold War Technology: Project HAARP and Beyond","review":"Whoever proofed this text seemingly wasn't paying much attention to their work; there are a fair number of typographical errors throughout the book.Editorial mistakes aside, this book provides a detailed and truthful history of wave and impulse technologies and weapons tested or employed by industry and/or military between the late 19th century and today.The first chapters provide accounts of Nikola Tesla's aetheric energy/impulse experiments of the late 1800s. There's enough information here to bore anybody with a physics or engineering background (unlike myself), but it's a neccessary introduction to the remainder of the book. Consipracy theories regarding wave-based mind control and communications &quot;blackout&quot; technologies are clarified or disproved, and the frightful capabilities of real EMP and ray weapons are revealed. The last few chapters discussing HAARP/IRI and related projects are brief but informative; I expected much more information based on the title. A thorough bibliography which cites patent information is included to support the author's statements.The book has its shortcomings, but to discuss the topics and projects covered in the text in greater scientific detail would require hundreds of additional pages. I recommend this book to anybody with an amateur interest in Cold War weapons technology, and as an introduction to Teslian technology and the history of wave radio."},{"Title":"Secrets of Cold War Technology: Project HAARP and Beyond","review":"I didn't even read the whole book, but I liked the Tesla info so much that I read it over and over. I've read lots of Tesla books and patents, and seen the Dollard videos and replicated the experiments, but this book somehow pulls it all together and explains the Tesla coils in a totally different light, even better than the Dollard descriptions. I wish there were more illustrations to show the amazing descriptions of tesla coils using impulse and tapping into the ether. I also liked the description of exploding wires as the initial experiments for Tesla's new type of electricity. But again I wish there were more pictures or schematics. I also wish the author would footnote some of the more amazing Tesla discoveries about impulses and ether. I also wish for an index. The stuff on orgone energy needs pictures. Unless you researched this stuff on your own and have an archive, it is hard to picture an orgone accumulator and other exotic invention apparatus."},{"Title":"Secrets of Cold War Technology: Project HAARP and Beyond","review":"Lots of info about Tesla's work in the USA. Only 10 pages about Project Haarp and cold war technology. Should have been titled \\"Secrets of Tesla's Radiant Energy research\\". And too much space on Tesla's disagreement with Marconi's inferior waves."},{"Title":"Secrets of Cold War Technology: Project HAARP and Beyond","review":"I've read a fair amount of Tesla books, but have never read one that puts it all together the way this book does. I have tried in the past to understand Tesla science but electromagnetic misinformation (that everything needs to be based on electrons to be real) has stopped me. Following more of a pathway of Wilhelm Reich's work with orgone accumulators and cloud busters, I was carried into an odd understanding of etheric science, and saw the operation of devices that could not be explained with the electromagnetism I learned in college. Now, Secrets of Cold War Technology ties it all together for me.I agree that typos might be edited out, especially with Amazon's one-off technology. However, the wealth of information and depth of understanding in this book deserve 5 stars, with or without the typos. If you want to gain an understanding that reaches beyond electron based science this book is a must.I see the negative reviews as just empty bashing to run down the number of stars to discourage readers. In addition to being good science, it is also a very exciting and engaging story. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Secrets of Cold War Technology: Project HAARP and Beyond","review":"First chapters are about Tesla vs Marconi fight. Sorry but I've never been so deep interested in Marconi's life so I can't compare him with that huge cience man called Tesla.At following chapters it's possible to find a lot of really interesting introductory info about war- free energy - weapons- business, civilian and military search. Maybe 50 or more pages could be drawn by avoiding unnecessary author comments.Any way I recomend any science free energy search interested people to read this book."},{"Title":"Secrets of Cold War Technology: Project HAARP and Beyond","review":"Secrets shines the light of clarity and understanding on a subject most often clouded in conspiratist hysteria. Much of the book does center on the actions of Tesla, but there can be no explication of mankinds technological potentials and future without mention of the paths ALREADY laid out before us upon which we PUBLICALLY have not tread. Read this book and KNOW."},{"Title":"About Dyslexia: Unravelling the Myth","review":"This book is the only one I have read that gives examples of what can happen to a dyslexic child through every grade of school-particularly when their dyslexia goes unchecked. This is a great book to give to people who want to understand your child and how this learning difference affects them. It is a short, sensitive, information packed read."},{"Title":"About Dyslexia: Unravelling the Myth","review":"About Dyslexia: Unraveling the Myth by Priscilla Vail is a book of its time. Published in 1990 (and now out of print), it seeks to set forth the problems a dyslexic child faces in language that is clear, concise, and non-technical. It is a short book that follows the developmental stages of a child, from the preschool years through each grade of elementary school. Vail writes more briefly of the middle school and high school years, since her focus is on early identification and remediation. The chapters on grades one through four are particularly insightful.On the other hand, the book is dated. It is important to remember that 1990 was pre-Internet and that hard information on disabilities was difficult to come by, unless it was in a clinical setting. There were no online parent support groups, no blogs; information came from the library or a blurry newsletter from a state or national society devoted to a particular disability. As a result, parents often felt like they were on their own. A book like About Dyslexia filled this information gap.Since 1990, of course, that gap has closed substantially. In addition to an increase in the availability of information, there is an increase in the kind of information available, based on recent neurological research. Inevitably, there are contradictions between a book like Vail's and a more recent book like Sally Shaywitz's Overcoming Dyslexia. Vail, for instance, states that dyslexia is four times more common among boys; Shaywitz's research indicates that girls are simply under-diagnosed. Vail puts emphasis on the frequency of number and letter reversals; Shaywitz casts doubt on whether this is a proper marker for dyslexia, citing the frequency with which reversals occur in the non-dyslexic population. Most important, however, is that today, two decades after the publication of About Dyslexia, the study of the neurological basis of reading and of reading disabilities is the Big Thing. Vail's work, which is primarily descriptive, predates this.Thus, Vail's book is best appreciated as a book that appeared when the parents of children with all sorts of disabilities were, often for the first time, acquiring a voice, in the years following the federal law that mandated access to public education for children with disabilities. It takes its place with any number of books that brought these children into the mainstream, from a parent's memoir about raising an autistic child (like the books by Josh Greenfield about his son Noah) to the appearance of a Down syndrome child on a TV sitcom (Life Goes On, which aired in the late eighties and early nineties). Parents who read About Dyslexia in 1990 would surely have felt reassured that the problem Vail describes was shared by many. Today, it is still a useful basic introduction to dyslexia. Since it is hard to obtain, seeking it out in a public library is probably the most useful course.M. Feldman"},{"Title":"About Dyslexia: Unravelling the Myth","review":"Actually the book was informative for people who want a perspective on dyslexia not focusing on reading alone BUT I think I got cheated by Amazon because I paid $60 + for it and is was a short book and not new and worth only $10 in my opinion and I tried unsucessfully to negotiate its worth"},{"Title":"About Dyslexia: Unravelling the Myth","review":"I really wanted to order 10-12 of these books. they are great for teachers and parents, but even with the lower price from elephant books, the shipping cost was double the book total.

(If any of these terms are unfamiliar to you, this book might be a real eye-opener.)Genealogical Teaching - for lecturers, instructors &amp; educational writers.Continuing Education in Genealogy.The bulk of the book is in its excellent appendices where examples of genealogical reports, proof summaries, compiled lineages, pedigrees, and genealogies are given to clearly illustrate what good genealogy looks like.This book is great for measuring yourself against how the very best genealogists conduct and report their research. Seeing how proper genealogy should be done makes us all better genealogists."},{"Title":"The BCG Genealogical Standards Manual","review":"If you're serious about the research you do on your family's history -- if you're not satisfied with merely collecting names, if you expect to see proof for statements made by other researchers, if you want those who come after you to be able to pick up where you've left off -- then this review can be boiled down a simple statement: Read this book. Buy it, consult it regularly, learn its principles. Since 1964, the BCG has developed and promulgated reliable methods for genealogical research, standards for proof, and a code of ethics for genealogists. This Manual is designed to clarify, codify, and present these standards in an easily accessible form. The first section presents standards for genealogical proof, data collection, and evaluation of evidence, the second lays out standards for genealogical instructors, lecturers, and authors, and the third discusses continuing genealogical education. These are followed by seven lengthy appendices that give examples of lineage compilations and the proof summaries that should accompany them, the most widely accepted formats for lineage publication, and researcher client reports -- which are a very useful tool even if you're only doing research for yourself. There certainly are thousands of books out there begging genealogists to buy them, but the &quot;essential&quot; bookshelf for American researchers is really rather small: _The Source,_ Greenwood's _Researcher's Guide to American Genealogy,_ Everton's _Handybook,_ perhaps _Guide to Genealogical Research in the National Archives,_ and a few others.

No matter what historical period your greatest interest falls in, you can browse through it year by year. You can look up your own birth year and those of friends and relatives and find out what was happening then, or refresh your memory of past times. You can follow the repercussions of a given incident from beginning to end while noting how the world continued to spin all the while. Of course it's heavily weighted toward more recent events (the 19th and 20th Centuries occupy 68% of the volume), but the detail is superb. You'll find *everything* in this book--kings and presidents and prime ministers, wars and assassinations, financial landmarks, inventions, new developments in science and research, the founding of universities, newspapers, paintings, sculpture, theater, ballet, music, industry, population, and that's just the year 1801!

It is set up so brilliantly, each year broken down by category--politics, music, food, religion, etc--and covering both Western and some Eastern history, that it puts all of history into accessible context and perspective. After looking up a detail in 1099 about English royal politics, it is easy to trace the repurcussions year by year, and to quickly glance at the music, the French situation, the new foods, the new theater, the global exploration, the current Chinese dynasty, and myriad other details all the way up to the present. Or just follow Mozart's career, or the Industrial Revolution, or agricultural innovations. Sure, it is not intensely detailed on each event, but it makes a great jumping off point towards other reference material. It is also the most appreciated gift I have ever given.

I find it most useful to get a perspective on a historic or historic fiction that I am reading. For example, if I am reading about Henry VIII, I will look up the relevant years and read about the other events taking place during this time. These include inventions, agricultural information, progress in treatment and prevention of disease, economic concepts, philosophy, religion, natural disasters, culinary patterns, technologies, and the arts. Small icons in the left margin next to each entry help guide the reader so that it is possible to read all the entrys related to agriculture and skip the rest, if agriculture is your topical interest area.Thus, for any historic book you are reading, you can get a quick view of the times in which the events take place. Because the book is witty and well written, it tends to hold you captive while you read one item after another.I find the best use of the book is to give me perspective on a time in history, with clues and suggestions on other routes of study and reading that will give me a more complete picture.

White","review":"Hutchinson has written a fascinating contemporary biography of Justice White who is almost unique in his continued insistence on his privacy and personal dignity. Although the author eschews speculation as to White's family or personal life, one still gets a good sense of the man--his intelligence, tenacity, and just plain decency. At least as interesting are the times he lived in, and few lawyers or judges have shared the action and passion of their times more fully than Justice White--first on the gridiron, then in the classroom, in the world of affairs, and on the court. White had his shortcomings as a communicator and legal theorist, as Hutchinson aptly illustrates with the oral and written record. But would that our society had more such self-effacing, dedicated and excellent lawyers and public servants!"},{"Title":"The Man Who Once Was Whizzer White: A Portrait of Justice Byron R. White","review":"Byron White intentionally did not leave much of a paper trail, as a man distrustful of the press, which is why this book has nowhere near the depth of Jeffries' Powell biography. White may well be most vilified and castigated justice in his own time, a fact which Hutchinson recounts in great detail, because he frequently ruled against the interests of the intelligensia-- frivolous First Amendment rights claimed by the media, and, of course, homosexuals, in Bowers, which won him the most profane attacks of all, from gay rights activists imbued with more passion than respect for the deliberative function of the Courts.White, though he is accused of &quot;moving right&quot; over the course of his career, was in fact remarkably consistent. The problem was that he was guided by a considerably more complex set of principles than most justices, another fact which Hutchinson brings out quite well. He had an extremely uptight view of electoral politics, disliked formalism in all of its forms, was always against categorically forclosing judicial review, and absolutely despised substantive due process, especially Roe v. Wade. Yet White was an extraordinarily fair-minded and scrupled man. He was the only justice to object to the Court's attempt to retire the debilitated Justice William O. Douglas on its own accord, was an aritculate opponent of formalistic separation-of-powers and federalism doctrine, and frequently came out on the side of the downtrodden (see his role in Jacobson v. U.S.). History should view White more kindly than most of his contemporaries-- he was a man totally without an sort of a political agenda, the type of fair-minded and intelligent person so lacking from our Courts today.There are some faults here: Hutchinson's forays into Constitutional commentary in the text are very opaque and inappropriate for the book. This book is generally well-written and well-researched, but its appeal will generally be to hardcore watchers of the Warren, Burger, and early Rehnquist courts or fans of White himself-- evidently a small group, as this book is now nearly out of print."},{"Title":"The Man Who Once Was Whizzer White: A Portrait of Justice Byron R. White","review":"Since White was on the Supreme Court for over 30 years during a most important period in our history, this biography is full of interest for anyone who knows how important the Court is. But a large part of the book is devoted to White's very unusual life before he went on the Court, and even if you are uninterested in football you will find the account of his career absorbing, or at least I did. I remember as a child hearing of Whizzer White, even though my interest in football was derived only from reading the sports pages. This is as good a biography as I have read in a long time. And I don't give out five stors easily."},{"Title":"The Man Who Once Was Whizzer White: A Portrait of Justice Byron R. White","review":"I first read this biography when it was published in 1998; because I am working with a former White clerk on a matter, I recently took another look--it has held up very well. The author, Dennis J. Hutchinson, long affiliated with the University of Chicago and its law school, had the advantage of having clerked for White. But this is no hagiography, and is quite critical in spots. Because White (1917-2002) has become all but invisible to current generations of Court watchers, and this is the major biography available on him, it is an important book. One measure of the author's thoroughness is that White does not make it onto the Court until page 335 (he served between 1962 and 1993)--the previous pages are devoted to a meticulous account of his prior life, and what a life it was: football All-American; Rhodes Scholar; graduate work at Oxford; then onto Yale Law School while playing in the NFL; valuable work during the war in Naval Intelligence; then clerking on the Court; followed up with a successful law practice and politics in Denver, including work on the JFK campaign in 1960; a stint as Deputy Attorney General under RFK and then appointment to the Court.Hutchinson does not follow the frequent practice of reviewing every major decision a subject made while on the Court; rather the picks out three terms (1971, 1981, and 1991) for extended analysis. He looks at such topics as White's opinion style, including his dissent format; his incremental approach; the problems some had with White's opinion style; his interaction with fellow Justices; and his views on such topics as affirmative action, abortion and finding \\"new\\" constitutional rights. Always central to the discussion is White's independence, as manifested for example in being the only Justice against taking away (in effect) Justice Douglas's vote due to his incapacity. The author also speculates as to the forces that did and did not shape (such as Yale legal realism) White's view. White's reputation for being a difficult and distant individual to deal with certainly is borne out by the book, although White clerks will tell you he was great to work for. Whatever, White is a fading figure, and it falls largely to this fine biography to keep his memory and accomplishments alive."},{"Title":"The Man Who Once Was Whizzer White: A Portrait of Justice Byron R.

White","review":"Generally the book is good, but I would have liked to see less excessive detail about the football days -- college and professional. Half the book is devoted to this, including vital statistics of key games. (But if your interested in the earliest days of professional football this is a must read.) The scope of White's responsibilities with the Kennedy Justice department focused nearly exclusively on civil rights -- wasn't there more to his role and contributions? The author used three Supreme Court terms (out of 30+) to explore and elucidate White's jurisprudence. I would have like to see 2/3 less sports and 2/3 more Supreme Court. In the end, White's tightly focused and methodical approach has a value that I hope more Justices and judges adopt. Although he wasn't poetic or espoused ground-shaking social changes, his substantive value to the American legal system is widely misunderstood and underestimated, as Hutchison clearly documents. Lastly, we learn how much White disapproved of his nickname. It's a shame that the primary title had to force the name again on this proud man."},{"Title":"The Man Who Once Was Whizzer White: A Portrait of Justice Byron R. White","review":"This is a highly readable and very fascinating look at one of America's most least understood, and least remembered, Supreme Court justices. The book's descriptions of White's judicial career are just as interesting as the author's portrait of Oxford in the 1930s and Denver during the middle of the 20th Century.Having read biographies of William Brennan and Harry Blackmun, Nathan Lewin's assessment of White -- written in 1984 -- really stands out for me during this work. Lewin wrote that White's career on the bench fulfilled the role ... that ... Brennan had served on the Warren Court -- as the guiding intellectual influence of the institution. With a steady hand and a belief that the other branches of government set social policy, White forged his own path and played a key role in American history."},{"Title":"The Man Who Once Was Whizzer White: A Portrait of Justice Byron R. White","review":"Byron White began his long judicial career in dissent, resisting the rising tide of criminal procedure liberalism of the Warren Court, and ended it as the balance wheel of Rehnquist Court. In his 31 years on the Supreme Court, from 1962 to 1993, he was in the majority in 807 five-to-four decisions, more than any other justice in history, except for the wily William Brennan who served on the court for 34 years. White also has the signal distinction of being the only Democratic appointee to the Supreme Court since the end of World War II who profoundly disappointed his erstwhile partisan allies. Beyond the fact that White refused to \\"grow\\" his jurisprudence from its New Deal origins to accommodate the latest cultural avant-garde enthusiasms of the juridical left, little is known about White and his jurisprudence is widely misunderstood.The litany of White's accomplishments and his early rise to the court serve to obscure the lines of his jurisprudence, which he never made an attempt to clarify. Hutchinson's principal accomplishment is to discern from the mass of White's opinions a sound jurisprudential framework obscured by bulk of White's output (1,275 opinions in 31 years), and in doing so refute the assertion that White was unpredictable.Although White was popularly described as a conservative jurist, this confounds the term as it is used to describe a specific interpretive philosophy with the judicial tradition which White came to exemplify. Today judicial conservatism is virtually synonymous with \\"original meaning,\\" the method of constitutional interpretation that holds that the Constitution means only what it was understood to mean by those whose assent made it law. This has certain implications, among them that the Congress's powers are limited to those enumerated, that the three branches of federal government and their powers are strictly separated, and that the states retain inviolable spheres of sovereignty. In this sense, White was not a conservative at all. Where, say, Justice Antonin Scalia would subscribe to these general notions, White would not. For instance, while Scalia believes that the law permitting the appointment of Independent Counsels violates the separation of powers doctrine (Morrison v. Olson), White sees it as a permissible experimentation with the form of government. And though Scalia believes that the powers of Congress are, however tangentially, limited (Lopez v. United States) and that the states retain areas of discretion where the Congress may not intrude (Printz v. United States), White views the powers of the Congress as essentially unlimited (Katzenbach v. McClung) and the states as retaining no sovereignty that the Congress is obliged to respect (Garcia v. San Antonio Metro. Transit Authority). Although Hutchinson views \\"New Deal liberal\\" and \\"pragmatist\\" as imperfect labels, his carefully wrought and insightful analysis of White's jurisprudence nonetheless establishes that they are fair and roughly approximate descriptions of Justice White.In it's judicial aspect the New Deal generally sought to eliminate restrictions on the exercise of federal power. These breaks on government power were exemplified early in this century by an activist libertarian Supreme Court's invocation of natural rights and non-textual notions of substantive due process to strike economic regulation. Lochner v. New York, where the court struck down regulations on the working hours of bakers as a violation of their liberty to contract their labor, is perhaps the most famous bugbear of New Dealers. But restrictions also came in the form of the enumerated powers doctrine and in the form of early criminal procedure cases which, as Professor Akhil Reed Amar of Yale has noted, invoked natural law and private property rights, and thus restricted the government's policing powers. All of these, in one way or another, restricted federal action. Judges of New Deal era, then, had a distinctly negative ambition: To remove the restrictions on the exercise of federal power so that the Congress, acting with the Executive, could enact social reform.The ambition of liberal judges changed, of course, with the rise of \\"the real Warren Court,\\" which historian David P. Currie of the University of Chicago dates to the replacement of Justice Frankfurter by Arthur Goldberg late in 1962. \\"Willful judges,\\" as Justice Scalia describes them, were no longer content with deferring to the overtly political branches, but were now eager to enact social reform themselves. The criminal procedure cases of the Warren Court were animated by the ideas that policing by the states was institutionally racist and that crime was a manifestation of disease, not evil, and should be addressed as a public health concern. Steeped in the New Deal idea of the judicial function, however, White largely dissented from Warren Court's innovations. He dissented from Miranda v Arizona, which mandated the now famous warnings to criminal suspects; prefiguring contemporary arguments, he wrote \\"there will not be a gain, but a loss, in human dignity\\" because under Miranda some criminals will be returned to the street to repeat their crimes.. White would also labor to limit the scope of rule excluding from trial illegally obtained evidence, and would dissent from Robinson v. California, where the court struck down a California statute criminalizing narcotics addiction. The court said that the state could not punish a person's \\"status\\" as an addict, only his conduct; White, sensibly enough, pointed out that addiction accrues through continuous willful behavior.White was a pragmatist. He didn't believe that the provisions of the Bill of Rights had a \\"single meaning\\" or that constitutional provisions could be measured like the provisions of a deed, in \\"metes and bounds,\\" but he was insistent that constitutional innovations be small and slow, and linked in a rational process. His father taught him that \\"You can't just stand on your rights all the time in a small town,\\" and White had a lifetime aversion to \\"the angels of fashionable opinion,\\" as Hutchinson memorably calls ideologues of various stripe. But White's contempt for philosophy could lead him astray. In Reitman v. Mulkey, White wrote the opinion of the court holding that California could not repeal a fair housing law because the repeal was motivated by animus toward minorities. In time, the case was precedent for the current Supreme Court's invalidation, in Romer v. Evans, of Colorado's attempt to deny homosexuals privileged legal status, and for a lower federal court to stay the implementation of California's Proposition 209, barring racial and sexual discrimination in state services. Pragmatism unguided by a philosophy lead White to judgments the long-term ill consequences of which he was not equipped to foresee.However, White's small-step pragmatism and disdain for ideological enthusiasms kept him from joining most of the Warren and Burger Court's radical social agenda. Although he was willing to recognize, in Griswold v. Connecticut, a non-textual right to privacy permitting married couples access to contraception and even was willing to extend the right to non-married couples in Eisenstadt v. Baird, White famously and vigorously dissented from Roe v. Wade, privately telling people that he thought it was the only illegitimate decision the court made during his tenure. Perhaps just as upsetting to the votaries of judicial activism was White's majority opinion in Bowers v. Hardwick, which held that Georgia could constitutionally prohibit homosexual sodomy. White briskly dismissed the argument that homosexual activity was constitutionally protected: \\"[T]o claim that a right to engage in such conduct is \`deeply rooted in this nation's history and tradition' or \`implicit in the concept of ordered liberty' is, at best, facetious.\\"In an sense, White was precisely the type of conservative -- one who slows progress, but does not reverse it; one who ratifies the past, whatever its content -- that liberals claim they want. Except for Roe, White would later vote to reaffirm precedent, on the basis of stare decisis, with which he had earlier disagreed. And yet, few modern justices -- except, perhaps, Justice Clarence Thomas -- have been the object of so much vitriol as White. When White retired in 1993, Jeffrey Rosen of the New Republic called White \\"a perfect cipher\\" and a \\"mediocrity,\\" Bruce Ackerman of Yale said he was \\"out of his depth,\\" and the New York Times' Tom Wicker called him the \\"bitterest legacy of the Kennedy Administration.\\" The best Calvin Trillin, writing in The Nation, could say of White was \\"We count his loyalty to team a boon/The other side might well select a loon\\" -- this in backhanded praise that White retired during a Democratic administration. These facile slurs betray the mercurial enthusiasms of the age more than they carefully trace the lineaments of Justice White's jurisprudence and are therefore more reflective of their authors than White's jurisprudence.In many ways White is entirely alien to today's culture, popular and lega"},{"Title":"The Man Who Once Was Whizzer White: A Portrait of Justice Byron R.

I think that with the recent comprehensive late 20th Century biographies, such as the recent ones about Rockefeller and Lindbergh and Nigel Hamilton's Reckless Youth, we have come to expect the biographer to do a thorough investigation and analysis of the circumstances that impacted the subject. While I do not expect a Freudian approach in every case (and would probably object to it if done expressly), I welcome gentle suggestions that link early events in the subject's life with the later, more well known, events. This analysis was missing from Whizzer (with the exception of the origins of his hatred for the press). The book reads as if it is a collection of on-line newspapers searches, ones that I could have done myself if NEXIS had newspapers dating back to the 30s. Didn't anybody keep a diary? Didn't anybody write letters? Didn't anybody have any introspective thoughts?

And that never-exhausted, always relevant and topical subject (suddenly seeming more controversial than ever), the \\"American Dream,\\" has at least one essential, archetypal text in each of the three media. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is still the leading contender in the novel; \\"Citizen Kane\\" is the acclaimed, indispensable film text (notwithstanding a maverick's personal preference for Altman's \\"Nashville\\"); \\"Death of a Salesman\\" cuts right to the heart of the grand national illusion with a surgical precision that O'Neill, Tennessee Williams, William Inge or any other playwright simply can't match.If you've read or seen the play, you may wish to start at the end this time--the Requiem. After seeing it as a college freshman (performed by the Guthrie in Minneapolis), I experienced the full effects of an Aristotelian catharsis before even knowing what it was. At that time the easiest character to identify with was Biff--the straight-talking, tell-it-like-it-is, loving but self-analytical son who pronounces his father's the \\"wrong\\" dream, a lie that had poisoned family relations for his entire life. But as you continue reading through the Requiem you take seriously the eulogies of the remaining three characters, and as the years go by, each has the potential to become the definitive judgment upon the life of Willie Loman, the American dream, and even one's own life-story.We give Hap some credit--it's the Leo Durocher-Vince Lombardi-Knute Rockne speech that we've heard so many times before, or seen portrayed in countless numbers of films, during which we receive rewarding, highly satisfying and spine-tingling sensations while witnessing the underdog finally come out on top by pursuing the dream with determination, faith and optimism--as though there were no other dream worth considering. Many of those who, in the early 1980s, greeted a new \\"morning in America\\" might find themselves nodding in agreement with Hap's belief in the self and in a free-enterprise system offering ample rewards to those with the sense to reach out for them. But for many other older thoughtful readers, Willie's friend Charlie comes closest to an acceptable diagnosis and evaluation. As if answering Biff directly, Charlie defends not the dream (or the system) but the person of Willie. It's presumptuous if not arrogant for any of us to blame someone like Willie for chasing after his dream. All he had, apart from his ability to build a porch and make house repairs, was a \\"shoeshine and a smile\\"--the prototypal American capitalist, seeking to make money out of money, caught up in a system that doesn't reward those without youth, good looks, industry and personal, charismatic energy. But a \\"system\\" is not a relationship, is not fulfilling of itself, leaves the stumbling Willies vulnerable to loneliness, disappointment, momentary glimpses of reality to be muted through escapes, whether gambling, alcohol, or in Willie's case, marital infidelity (though Miller, unlike the American Puritanical tradition and in the spirit of Dante, makes it quite clear that Willy's \\"fatal flaw\\" is not his cheating on Linda but his hypocrisy. The play ultimately refuses to equate morality with sexual behavior, and if we take Charlie seriously, even Willy's hypocrisy (his lies to Biff, Linda, himself) should not concern us.So Charlie takes a forgiving line, one we might all wish our Maker would take toward us come judgement day. You can smile all you want, but when people stop smiling back--and some elder citizens just can't muster up the infectious smile of the aforementioned President, or they may no longer be noticed as individuals worthy of the attention and interest of others--the effect can be devastating. Charlie adds that those of us in a more fortunate position can't possibily understand what Willie went through and certainly \\"dare not\\" pass judgement, let alone negative criticism, on Willie.It's pretty strong stuff, and Linda has to follow it. She doesn't, and she can't. But she nevertheless is given the last utterances in the play, and they move the listener even in their incoherence. It would be easy to blame Linda for \\"cooperating\\" with Willie's illusion, or to pity her for never really knowing what hit her and her family. But if we can suspend some of the currently popular ideologies--about marriage, gender relations, parasitic domestic arrangements--and simply listen to Linda's voice, we hear the sound of someone in shock but also of a caring, compassionate, steadfast life-partner, not merely \\"standing by her man\\" but offering encouragement, support, and hope--and all this even after Willie's suicidal attempts. Even with this burden on her mind, she doesn't blow the whistle on Willie, turn to a shrink, or run out on him, and she's perfectly content to settle for far less than first place: she's already made it plainly clear to us that, though she knows Willy is far from a rock star, she takes pride in him for nothing more than paying off the mortgage. Like the servant in Tolstoy's \\"The Death of Ivan Ilych\\" who, simply by rubbing the feet of the dying protagonist, offers comfort far beyond the words of all who visit Ivan, Linda continually reminds us that she's \\"there\\"--and has been all along. She emerges as a strong contender for hero's honors--not merely as a loyal, masochistic mate but a genuine \\"servant\\"--like those we read about in Chaucer, Mallory, and tales written in a pre-American genteel time."},{"Title":"Death of a salesman: Text and criticism (The Viking critical library)","review":"Willy Loman is the protagonist of the finest play ever written by an American. Eugene O'Neill and especially Tennessee Williams entertain perspectives on life that are much too neurotic to suit me. Arthur Miller's genius resulted in several wonderful plays, including After the Fall and The Crucible, but it is Death of a Salesman that stands in a class by itself as the quintessential American play. Yet, as Miller himself was quick to point out, Willy Loman's appeal is universal. Salesman has mesmerized audiences around the world because it treats a question that is basic to the human condition: \\"What does it mean for a person to have integrity?\\"I've been thinking a lot lately about Willy Loman, as though he was a real person I once met and could never get out of my mind. I first met Willy when I was a young man studying acting with the Strasbergs in New York. Biff Loman was one of my favorite roles in class. I felt that he was me. Lacking the life experience to fully appreciate Willy, I identified more with Biff. One of the admirable qualities of Salesman is that it is possible to regard Linda or Biff or Happy as the main character depending upon who you are and where you are in life. Actually, Salesman takes place in Willy's mind so they are all manifestations of the salesman.One of the quirky aspects of Death of a Salesman is that so many people think it is a play about a salesman. Miller uses the salesman's role as a metaphor for the struggle to find the meaning of life. Willy could just as well be a butcher or a proctologist, but Miller understood that we are all salesmen in a way. We spend so much effort selling - to ourselves and others - the entity that we take to be \\"me.\\" Willy desperately tries to sell himself on the notion that his life has meaning, but his virulent hypocrisy makes that impossible. He is a hypocrite because his behavior violates the core values he pretends to embrace. When confronted with the question \\"Have I succeeded as a human being?\\" Willy is compelled to answer in the negative. This is a staggering realization, one that most of us would lack the moral courage to face honestly or directly. No wonder he kills himself.The beauty of Salesman is that we love Willy in spite of his hypocrisy because, with all his imperfections, he is so human. As Miller later wrote, \\"The tragic feeling is evoked in us when we are in the presence of a character who is ready to lay down his life, if need be, to secure one thing--his sense of personal dignity.\\" So not only do we love Willy, we admire him for desperately striving to attain some vestige of integrity even though he is unable to do so.I am perhaps oversimplifying this complex play because it operates on so many different levels. Willy's suffering and its effect on those he loves defy simple analysis. Miller treats his characters with a depth of understanding that justifies a lifetime of contemplation. Salesman succeeds more than any other theatrical work in dealing with the issues of \\"Who am I?\\" and \\"What the hell am I doing here?\\"Salesman also goes one step further as it expresses a chilling reality. Willy has devoted his life to a job for which in the end he is declared useless. In Miller's words, Willy has broken the law of success and therefore \\"has no right to live.\\" We are valueless, Miller wrote, when we fail to fit the needs of efficient production. \\"We have finally come to serve the machine,\\" he concluded. It raises the hair on the back of my neck.I mentioned that Salesman takes place in Willy's mind. This explains why it has been so difficult to film a satisfying version of this play. Movies are a linear art form. Salesman is more stream of consciousness, which works better in the theater where, with the imaginative use of lighting and staging, you can shift from thought to thought and back again. If I could go back in time, one of my first priorities would be to attend the original Broadway production of Death of a Salesman with Lee J. Cobb as Willy. Arthur Miller said that Cobb was the finest dramatic actor he'd ever seen. Cobb was still in his thirties when he played 60-year-old Willy, yet by all accounts his performance was brilliant. Most of the Willys I've seen were unremarkable, notably Dustin Hoffman's one-dimensional caricature. My favorite Willy remains Philip Baker Hall, who captured the salesman's desperation, vulnerability, and sadness in a 1980s Los Angeles production."},{"Title":"Death of a salesman: Text and criticism (The Viking critical library)","review":"The story of salesman Willy Loman. . . . A life not fulfilled. Tensions with sons. A career that is not blossoming.Aristotle's take, as many normally think of it, is that a tragedy is about a noble person who has a tragic flaw and comes to understand that. Think Oedipus. This is, in a sense, Arthur Miller's take on tragedy for a common man--a tragic flaw. Is there a \\"growth of character\\"? The ending may hint at that. Or at desperation. . . .This 1949 play is still powerful after all these years. . . ."},{"Title":"Death of a salesman: Text and criticism (The Viking critical library)","review":"You could call the play a critic on capitalist system but it is also simply the story about a man with a fatal error that leads to his downfall. Arthur Miller presents a complex and difficult character: Willy Loman. Willys mind and inner life are presented dramatically by the use of flashbacks and inner monologs.It is an interesting trip through psychology for the audience,to find out why Willy escapes into the past. Miller perfectly creates the illusion of the past and makes the audience experience a fusion of past an present by verbal and non-verbal theatrical technique.The audience can reach a deeper rational and emotional understanding of Willys situation during the play. The requiem interrupts this identification to make the audience have an objective view on Willys fate. Miller makes the audience realize the psychological development to make them critisize and think actively about it: Could Willy Lomans downfall have been avoided or not? By analysing Willys character his fatal error gets clear.Willy makes his own bad situation worse,e.g.by refusing his friends offer of a job. There for the play gives an advice to the audience:Think objectively about your behaviour and spot errors,like you spot Willys fatal error."},{"Title":"Death of a salesman: Text and criticism (The Viking critical library)","review":"Needed this for my son's AP English class his junior year of high school, I even read the books so it was well worth the cost."},{"Title":"Death of a salesman: Text and criticism (The Viking critical library)","review":"Book quality/etc was fine.

She is an independent, tomboy-type-gal who lost her mother at a very young age and was separated from her father - a captain who became lost at sea. Fortunately, thanks to her time with him, she has travelled far and wide and acquired an incredible strength. She moves into a typical Swedish village and together with her new friends Tommy and Annika, gives that world a touch of childlike magic.She is very fond of telling absurd stories of her travels, spontaneous activities, feats of strength, especially righting wrongs and the rest. This is all tempered with a healthy disdain for authority and a lack of \\"etiquette\\" - when she decides to start school, she tells her teacher she wants to be a pirate AND a lady when she grows up.Eventually, she visits her father on an island where he has turned out to have become the king, and treats Tommy, Annika and the whole class to a great host of adventures.Not as amusing as some other Lindgren characters, Pippi is still a good role-model in terms of being the rough girl with the heart of gold. The stories are still very playful and fun. A good read for children from a young age (like most Lindgren books)."},{"Title":"Pippi Longstocking, Pippi Goes On Board, Pippi in the South Seas","review":"I was so happy to find these.

The storyline is catchy and intermingled with just the right amount of technical background to bring the pages to life.Don't be dismayed by the one-star reviewers...you really have to question someone who considers Tom Clancy's latest works to have been anything more than mindless drivel.Nonetheless, it's a great choice for anyone with a remote interest in network security and the potential ramifications that it has on contemporary American society. If you have an interest in REAL national security topics, this piece of fiction is a great read."},{"Title":"Zero-Day Exploit:: Countdown to Darkness (Cyber-Fiction)","review":"I'm seeing more security books come out in the style of cyber-novel. The latest one is called Zero-Day Exploit - Countdown To Darkness by Rob Shein. While not on par with Tom Clancy material, it does quite well and should appeal to the cyber-geek in all of us.In the novel, two security programmers (both geeky but pretty normal) are hired to do a security audit on a new VPN product to be used by the Department of Justice. They quickly find two exploitable bugs (denial of service and buffer overflow) and report the situation. But as often happens in real-life, politics and CYA cause the findings to be minimized and the software is installed anyway with a promise to fix the software later. Of course, it doesn't get done. Meanwhile, Islamic idealists enlist the help of two hackers in the Phillipeans to scan networks looking for this VPN package as well as some industrial software so that a cyber-attack can be launched against the US. The original security audit team (this is years later) notices the increase in port scans for the VPN package and try to alert the DoJ. But until the attack actually occurs, no one will listen. Once all hell breaks loose, its them against the hackers.This is more of a novel and less of a security primer than books like Steal The Box. The author does go into detail on the technology, but not to the point of putting pages and pages of screen prints in the book. It's all part of the story dialog and action. The second member of the team (\\"MadFast\\") starts just about each sentence with \\"Right on\\", so don't expect outstanding dialogue. But then again, this would be closer to reality if you were listening and watching real computer geeks/hackers. A reader experienced in security will be entertained (but won't learn much), but others less tied into computer security may have their eyes opened as to dangers that are very real.While not perfect, I still liked it a lot. Definitely worth a read..."},{"Title":"Zero-Day Exploit:: Countdown to Darkness (Cyber-Fiction)","review":"A polemical diatribe that simply tries too hard. Considered purely as a novel, possibly in the thriller genre, it is poorly done. The characterisation is pathetic. Just cardboard. The dialog is utterly repetitive. The two secondary heroes are just sounding boards to the main character. Sherlock Holmes' Watson was hollow, but still light years ahead of these secondary characters.Then there is the plot itself. All too reminiscent of the Y2K scare. Remember that? Planes falling out of the sky. Pacemakers freezing up. Utility companies' generators stopping. Just like Ed Yourdon and others peddled Y2K in the late 90s, this book has the same feel. Hysteria combined with an opportunistic grab at the topical problem of terrorism.Purely as a $8 paperback novel, it is lacking. But as a $35 book?? Strewth."},{"Title":"Zero-Day Exploit:: Countdown to Darkness (Cyber-Fiction)","review":"Defending against external Internet threats and attacks is a daunting task at best. When coupled with internal politics and Byzantine contracting rules, you may as well put a \\"kick me\\" sign on your back. Before the days we became dependent on computers and networking for everyday tasks, the risks were not as great. When terrorism is added to the formula, there has to be a recognition that the days of finger-pointing and excuses are no longer acceptable. In Zero-Day Exploit: Countdown to Darkness (339 Pages, Syngress Press, 2004, ISBN 1931836094), Rob Shein, David Litchfield, and Marcus Sachs present an account of one possible attack scenario.Like most fiction, you will have to ask yourself if the scenario in the book is possible at all. But the answer you give yourself may not be adequate. After all, who else except for the Able Danger team thought 9/11 was a real possibility?What makes this book different from others that I have read, the authors bring a real world perspective of Washington, DC politics and the challenges brought by the divide between employees and federal contractors, as well as what happens when people put their own career self-preservation above doing the right thing. Think this is not possible in today's environment? Think again. Having spent 12 years as a federal acquisition professional, I saw it every day, and I know what happens to people who buck the system.The book does get bogged down early with its detailed narrative of a DefCon convention, and I am not sure that it adds much to the book. The authors do manage to put useful information within this section, but the overall section was so dry I almost closed the book a few times. But then it picked up steam and I could not put it down until I finished it. Given my background, it was very interesting to see what I had experienced first hand (and still do as an IT consultant and auditor), knowing full well the damage those interactions alone can cause.The technical information presented is good, but not so deep that a nontechnical reader will get lost or bored (except perhaps for the DefCon section). As the story unfolds, the authors do a very good job showing how the emotion of a situation can lead to blaming the wrong person (in this case the programmer of the faulty software) instead of the circumstances that lead to the faults outside of his control (See my review of Secure Coding - Principles and Practices for more on this topic).The book is not cheap and may be a bit pricey for the content, but that does not mean it is not worth reading.Who Should Read This Book?IT Audit professionals, bureaucrats, and programmers/developers will all gain benefit from reading this book. It is not really a good read for other people because they may take the wrong message from it.ScorecardPar on Long Par 4"},{"Title":"Zero-Day Exploit:: Countdown to Darkness (Cyber-Fiction)","review":"The first problem I have with this book is the absolutely laughable price tag.

So, since it's a second rate work of fiction, shouldn't it be priced at about half the price of a popular novel, such as those by Stephen King, Tom Clancy, etc...?Where does a nobody clown that no one ever heard of get off trying to gouge people for fifty bucks, and for a cheesy work of fiction to boot!?!?!?The 2 guys who gave it 5 stars are paid reviewers, I'm not (and one of them even states that the book isn't very good).

The story is enjoyable and has several chapters of excitement that make you want to turn the page into the wee hours of the morning. The plot as a whole is more fluid, which is something that was lacking with the StN books, I found.Having said that, there were no less than 4 glaring typos that took the professionalism down several notches. The appendix, in fact, ends midsentence in my copy of the book. At another point earlier it says \\"to find more information .\\" and omits the web address that was expected to accompany it. That, along with the somewhat lackluster dialogue were distractions to an otherwise enjoyable novel. The writing towards the end seemed overly rushed (telling the solution was found to a particular problem, rather than explaining /how/ for the sake of time was out of character for this style of book).Overall, an enjoyable read if you like to get further insight into how the White Hats work, but this isn't a NYT Best Seller."},{"Title":"Zero-Day Exploit:: Countdown to Darkness (Cyber-Fiction)","review":"The Expert on Everything - a novelBig Brother meets Big Business in Edward David Gil's novel, \\"The Expert on Everything.\\" Orwell was on the right track of course, but Edward Gil takes it a step further and into the 21st century.

The first volume includes twenty-six tales from 1929 through 1964 from some of the genre?s greatest authors, a who?s who. The criteria used were not the author?s fame but instead, the most important and influential stories and that, in spite of the votes, an author would appear only once.Though three decades have passed, most of the contributors remain highly renowned even outside the genre, but a few are less famous except among long time purists. Thus the lack of a one-page biography hurts when a virtually unrecognizable name has authored a famous work especially when other media mainstreamed the tale.

Their cut-off date was December 31, 1964, so you're not going to read anything in here that's less than 35 years old.The problem with this is obvious: science fiction, more than any other genre, does not always age well. What is gloriously new &amp; exciting in 1930 or 1940 is old news in 2001. Some of the early stories (they're arranged chronologically), while probably great fun to read when they were first published, now have a kitschy, dated quality that's hard to get past.Having said that, the best stories in this book (my nominees include Isaac Asimov's &quot;Nightfall&quot;, Jerome Bixby's &quot;It's A GOOD Life&quot;, and Daniel Keyes' heartbreaking &quot;Flowers For Algernon&quot;) have a resonance &amp; a timelessness that mark the best stories, SF or otherwise.If you're looking for a good capsule history of the SF of this era, warts &amp; all, you could do a lot worse than to pick this up.

It isn't true that this contains the &quot;greatest science fiction stories of all time,&quot; because it only contains work prior to 1963 (this anthology was first published in 1970).A few of the stories will seem campy by today's standards. &quot;Martian Odyssey,&quot; by Stanley Weinbaum (1934) will show you just how far today's authors have come in terms of storytelling and prose styling. From those humble beginnings, the genre takes off like a rocket.John Campbell's &quot;Twighlight&quot; (1934) show many of the themes and ideas--alienation, wonder, potential misuse of science--that would often define the Golden Age. &quot;Nightfall&quot; by Isaac Asimov (1941) is probably the best of the early stories, showing perfect plotting and construction, combined with scientific ideas and thinking. As time marches on, we encounter such stories as &quot;Scanners Live in Vain,&quot; by Cordwainer Smith (1948) which shows us a future society without burying us under the type of exposition that previously weighed-down other work; by 1954, we have &quot;Fondly Fahrenheit,&quot; by Alfred Bester, a head-spinning, poetic, tour de force of a tale. &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; (1959) is one of the best-plotted, most poignant tales of the Golden Age. The book ends with &quot;A Rose for Ecclesiastes,&quot; rife with the poetic, experimental style that would become a theme for much of the science fiction literature of the New Wave.Unfortunately, a few of the stories don't age that well--and it is necessary for readers to realize that science fiction has continued to evolve in the decades since this book's publication. Nevertheless, it contains a large number of wonderful stories and--and serves as a schematic for the genre's development over four decades."},{"Title":"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: The Greatest Science Fiction Stories of All Time","review":"If you ever had an interest in science fiction, you simply must go out and find these books.

Read &quot;Nightfall&quot; and see Isaac Asimov in his prime, or &quot;Mimsy Were The Borogroves&quot; and muse on the time when sci-fi wasn't written to fit on a Taco Bell cup.Any one of these stories is worth the price of the book.

Robert Heinlein?s ?The Roads Must Roll? explores the flaws inherent in a perfectly mechanized society, Theodore Sturgeon?s ?Microcosmic God,? posits a scientist who creates a new life form for his own edification and the only woman represented, Judith Merrill, has a cautionary tale about radiation, ?That Only A Mother.?Isaac Asimov?s ?Nightfall,? imagines a dire fate for a planet that plunges into night only once every 2,500 years, Ray Bradbury?s ?Mars Is Heaven!? describes a fateful first contact for hapless Americans, and Roger Bixby?s ?It?s a GOOD Life? gives us the mortal fear of powerful children.The earliest stories are mostly of historical interest ? their encounters with aliens and thinking robots are a bit heavy handed in the prose department ? but most are still fresh and timeless. These are stories that inspired a generation of writers and readers, spawning imitations and movies and Twilight Zone episodes. A must for genuine sci-fi fans."},{"Title":"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: The Greatest Science Fiction Stories of All Time","review":"Sometime during the mid 1970's, while an undergraduate student majoring in Biology, my brother loaned me an anthology of Science Fiction short stories. One of the stories I had read in that book (\\"Microcosmic God\\", By Theodore Sturgeon) left me with such a great impression that it influenced the direction I headed in graduate school. Now, as a microbiological professor for nearly 25 years, I thought it might be nice to have some of my students read the same story. However, after an exhaustive search of my library, checking with my brother, and searching through boxes of books in my mother's attic, I could not find the book. I found a web site that focuses on finding Sci-Fi books and short stories, and they gave me the actual title of the anthology (\\"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Vol. 1: 1929-1964). I immediately went to Amazon's web site, searched, and found and ordered the book. I've re-read the story and realize just how much ahead of his time Sturgeon was back in the early 1940's. There are many other wonderful early Sci-Fi stories in this book, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to study the evolution of future-thinking through literature. I can't get over how quickly Amazon turns around their orders. And often with no cost shipping!"},{"Title":"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: The Greatest Science Fiction Stories of All Time","review":"This collection of the best science fiction stories between 1929 and 1964 was assembled by the Science Fiction Writers of America and has the high quality that results from an expert-driven selection process. The twenty-six stories are all good and all by name authors, although they weren't all \\"names\\" when they wrote them.My favorite six--and this wasn't easy--are:Frederic Brown's \\"Arena\\" was made into a Star Trek episode which pitted William Shatner against an unknown stunt man in a rubber reptile suit. This original story of a human versus a well-rounded alien in a fight to the death is better.Murray Leinster's \\"First Contact\\" named an entire SF sub-genre. The aliens and humans meet, learn to communicate, and then need to figure out a way to get home without endangering both of their worlds.C. M. Kornbluth's \\"The Little Black Bag\\" hints at a future where many people aren't too bright. One of them loses a bag of medical instruments all the way into the past. And somebody finds it.Tom Godwin's \\"The Cold Equations\\" illustrates the danger of taking along just enough of everything--air, fuel, mass--on a space trip. There is always the unexpected.Damon Knight's \\"The Country of the Kind\\" examines the life of a lonely man who keeps reaching out for others. Something always gets in the way. This story may have influenced Anthony Burgess'A Clockwork Orange.Daniel Keyes' \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" introduces Charlie Gordon, a mentally handicapped man whose life changes when he participates in a surgical experiment designed to improve intelligence. The experiment succeeds, and Charlie quickly develops first ordinary, and then extraordinary intelligence. This short story was later expanded into the novelFlowers for Algernon.Some of the science in these stories is dated, but that doesn't make them harder to read than stories set in unfamiliar cultures or in the past. Some plots have become clich&eacute;, but it is still worthwhile to read the originals. Whether your reading voyage is one of discovery or rediscovery, it is worth taking. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: The Greatest Science Fiction Stories of All Time","review":"Great collection. I thought the stories were terrific on two levels. First level, as straight stories, they are uniformly exceptional. Second level, as historical pieces reflecting views of the future from fifty to seventy-five years ago, many of the stories had an extra fascination. I'd like to give a special mention to The Quest for Saint Aquin, by Anthony Boucher, and Nightfall by Isaac Asimov. I also enjoyed revisiting two stories I read decades ago (I'm becoming a bit of a \\"historical piece\\" myself), Mars is Heaven! by Ray Bradbury and Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes. There's also a splendid story that was the basis for a famous Twilight Zone episode, and a delightful tale about micro-people, and.... enough, if I keep going, I'll say something positive about every story."},{"Title":"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: The Greatest Science Fiction Stories of All Time","review":"After reviewing this book, I gave it as a gift. The receiver tells me he is currently enjoying it."},{"Title":"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: The Greatest Science Fiction Stories of All Time","review":"This is without a doubt the worst collection of science fiction stories - and the most wretchedly written - that I have ever encountered.Who the hell are these people who have collectively given this book a five star rating? I suppose they must be members of the editor's extended family."},{"Title":"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: The Greatest Science Fiction Stories of All Time","review":"I didn't know exactly what this was before I took a chance on it, but I'm glad I did: the stories are almost all good and I haven't read most of them in other science fiction short story collections. If you're looking into this, be aware this is a collection of 26 short stories that should be the best short stories written before 1965, as selected by the members of the Science Fiction Writers of America (SciFi authors themselves). The book also tries to span a wide variety of authors so none have more than one story selected.Unless you're extremely well-read in the science fiction short story department and already have most of these stories, you'll probably find good stuff here worth having."},{"Title":"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: The Greatest Science Fiction Stories of All Time","review":"I was really impressed with this book. I'm a fan of classic science fiction, so I was prepared to like it, but I expected at least one dud. But this book really delivers on the HALL OF FAME premise. No point in listing favorite stories -- I've liked every one I've read. What amazes me is the ability of these writers to craft a LASTING sci-fi story. Usually, when something is good, its imitators dilute your perception of the original work. Something that was new once now seems trite, viewed in the context of having seen its formerly novel ideas repeated and recycled. But I didn't feel that way with the stories in this book, even the oldest ones -- while I recognized elements that would become fixtures of the genre over time, the originals still radiated creativity and energy. Fun, consistently impressive, and food for thought -- the best things sci-fi can be."},{"Title":"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: The Greatest Science Fiction Stories of All Time","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend in college (1977), and regretted ever giving it back. Of course, I still had the friend (thanks, Howard), but I had been looking for SFHF VOL1 ever since. This book contains many of the most familiar and influential SF stories of the 1st half of the 20th century. You've seen lot of them in the movies and on TV. For example, \\"Arena\\" became a Star Trek episode, \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" (BTW, one of the best short stories I have ever read, only incidentally a SF story) became the movie \\"Charlie\\" in the '60s, and \\"Mimsy were the Borogroves\\" was a recent movie featuring Rainn Wilson. And who could forget the \\"It's a Good Life\\" episode of the Twilght Zone, featuring creepy Billy Mumy as the Boy who is God? There may be more such adaptations, but these are the ones I can come up with from the top of my head.So why read the book if you have seen it before? Well, as the cliche' goes, the book is better. Way better. And there are many, many other stories that are as good or better that these. My favorites (in no particular order):The Nine Billion Names of God, by Arthur C. Clarke. -Talk about a Purpose Driven Life!Nightfall, by Isaac Asimov. -The stars have pretty much this effect on me anyway.Born of Man and Woman, by Richard Matheson. -THE. CREEPIEST. STORY. EVER. Fantastic!First Contact, by Murray Leinster. -What WOULD you talk about with an alien, after all?The Search for St. Aquin, by Anthony Boucher. -Machines as both Accuser and Evangelist. Gotta love it.Not to slight any of the other stories in this collection, either. Any one of them is worth a read, so having them together in one volume is a treat. But I warn you, the stories are all thought provoking, if for no other reason, than that they open up a doorway on the psyche of the 20th century and its obsession with space travel (especially life on Mars, which seems like such a barren rock now), its dealing with global warfare (have we reached any conclusion? I don't think so), and its reflection upon the dehumanizing aspects of technology (before widespread application of robotics or even computers had taken place).Some reviewers have commented that this book isn't the best compilation. Not what they could come up with. I guess that means not THEIR personal favorites. Whatever. The book is a great introduction to Science Fiction literature, and proof that SF is GREAT Literature, not just one dimensional fluff.Read, Ponder, and Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: The Greatest Science Fiction Stories of All Time","review":"This book is an amazing read and a must for all sci-fi fans and a possible entry into the genre for the uninitiated. The stories were selected by the science fiction writers of America and represent the stories they feel have shaped science fiction from the 1920s-1960s. Some of these are classics that the average person may have come across in high school english class, like 'Flowers for Algernon', while others are relatively unknown to today's average sci-fi reader.If you are a sci-fi fan and haven't read the stories contained in this book, then you owe it to yourself to either buy this book or borrow it from your library, because these stories have laid the foundation for all the sci-fi that has followed.

If you are serious about sci-fi this is truly a must-have volume. There were several volumes that followed (2a and 2b for example) but this book remains my favorite.

The first volume includes twenty-six tales from 1929 through 1964 from some of the genre?s greatest authors, a who?s who. The criteria used were not the author?s fame but instead, the most important and influential stories and that, in spite of the votes, an author would appear only once.Though three decades have passed, most of the contributors remain highly renowned even outside the genre, but a few are less famous except among long time purists. Thus the lack of a one-page biography hurts when a virtually unrecognizable name has authored a famous work especially when other media mainstreamed the tale. Still each story is well written and affirms why the ASFWA selected them thirty years ago. This is a winner mostly for science fiction buffs and the nostalgic amongst the boomers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: The Greatest Science Fiction Stories of All Time","review":"I've read a lot of SF over the years, including stories by many of the authors featured in this anthology. Obviously I'm in the minority here but I found of the selected works to be dated, overly long, and dull. The ending of at least one story (That Only A Mother) made no sense at all. There are of course some exceptions, like Bradbury's Mars Is Heaven. A no-brainer for any collection. And a little tale called It's A Good Life will give you the chills. Star Trek fans will of course recognize the premise of the story Arena, which was adapted into a Trek episode of the same name.

Some of these stories are reasonably well known and often reprinted, but most of them are difficult to find anywhere else, making this an essential collection for a true fan of the genre. In response to an earlier request for a list of its contents, here are the story titles and authors. I was going to indulge myself by placing an asterisk next to my personal favorites, but I found myself marking almost all of them. The collection is that good.A Martian Odyssey -- Stanley G. WeinbaumTwilight -- John W. CampbellHelen O'Loy -- Lester del ReyThe Roads Must Roll -- Robert A. HeinleinMicrocosmic God -- Theodore SturgeonNightfall -- Isaac AsimovThe Weapon Shop -- A.

This collection turned out to be a goldmine of Science Fiction. In fact, this is one of the only books I will not lend out to friends; and I own an old, ratty-looking paperback Copyright 1970! There are many great stories here, but there are a few I must mention as bona-fide masterpieces. \\"Microcosmic God\\" by Theodore Sturgeon is fantastic; the plotting for this story reminded me of the 1995 cable pilot episode for the film \\"The Outer Limits: Sandkings.\\" Even the creators of South Park use similar ideas in one of their episodes. This collection also contains the sparkling jewel \\"Nightfall\\" from Issac Asimov. \\"Surface Tension\\" from James Blish is superb in every way. \\"The Nine Billion Names of God\\" finds Arthur C. Clarke is fine form. \\"The Cold Equations\\" from Tom Godwin is arguably the most intense and sad of all the stories here, packing an emotional wallop not ordinarily seen in Sci-fi. And of course, \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" by Daniel Keyes. I believe that last one is my favorite here, showing a retarded man's ascension to genius, 'childhood' to a wise and intellectual human being. This story was later expanded into a novel which, in fact, I am reading right now. However, I prefer the original short story version, if only slightly. There are so many stories here ranging from good to marvellous that I simply had to write a review praising this incredible collection. This book is easy to recommend."},{"Title":"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: The Greatest Science Fiction Stories of All Time","review":"The old purple and blue version of this book - the purple was on the edge of the pages, the way some older books have velvety green sides - was my first introduction to the Golden Age of science fiction. The inventiveness and the creative audacity of these stories was always enough to overcome what I felt would have been a cripplingly antiquated \\"Gee golly\\" 1950s vernacular... except that the writing almost never has that black and white Leave it to Beaver sitcomish feel that, for some reason, was always attached to the Golden Age in my mind. Stylistically the collection is all over the place. The Connecticut Yankee anachronism of Roger Zelazny in \\"Lord of Light\\" is nowhere to be found in \\"A Rose for Ecclesiastices\\". Clarke's famous \\"The Nine Billion Names of God\\" isn't even a science fiction story until, basically, the last sentence. And describing anything written by Cordwainer Smith with \\"genre\\", \\"usual\\" or even \\"describable\\" is not applicable. I love this collection and, impossibly, every story in it - though some more than others.I won't dwell on the weakest. Instead I'll highlight what I consider to be the best:Sturgeon's \\"Microcosmic God\\" has the creepy, jealousy tinged atmosphere of nerds watching another nerd who is better at being a nerd than anyone else. This is what I would've been doing with my adolescent years if only mind and matter would've allowed, so reading it brings the distinct pleasure of reliving childhood fantasies. I'm also pretty sure it's the inspiration for a Simpsons Halloween episode involving Lisa and her tooth, which became a South Park nod to both the story and the Simpsons.Asimov's \\"Nightfall\\" is rightly considered one of the best science fiction short stories ever. I've read the longer form and this is superior in pretty much every way: it's already one of the longer stories in this collection but it still benefits from the shorter form with its building stress and, yes, horror during the final pages. Many would disagree but I think \\"Nightfall\\" is one of the least creative stories in the collection in terms of sheer inventiveness. Despite that it's still incredible.Cordwainer Smith is just amazing. As prosaic as that sounds it's about all I can say. \\"Scanners Live in Vain\\" is one of the weirdest stories in the collection and it might arguably be one of Smith's most \\"mundane\\". Reading a Smith story is like opening the pages of the Book of Revelations as interpreted by the grandson of cartoonist Gary Larson, the painter Francis Bacon, a very wise female clown and Joan of Arc - and you're on acid. This is all an endorsement, by the way.James Blish's \\"Surface Tension\\" is as good an \\"adventure\\" story as you'll find here. It's got a fairly linear plot and isn't hard to follow. It isn't simplistic, per se, but it hasn't got the style of some of the other pieces in this collection. It's one of my sentimental favorites, though, for its ability to impart - at least somewhat - a finer sense of proportion than pretty much any description of the vastness of the universe, including Doug Adams'.And, finally, my absolutely favorite: \\"Mimsy Were the Borogroves\\". I'm not doing to describe it. I'm going to simply agree with another commentator that purchasing this book is worth it if only for this one story."},{"Title":"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: The Greatest Science Fiction Stories of All Time","review":"I first picked up the original printing of this anthology when I was a small child, around ten years old, and the first story in it (\\"A Martian Oddyssey\\") was so good that I put the book back down and didn't read the rest of it for another year because I was afraid none of the other stories in there could possibly be as good.Almost all of them were. That's not the only reason you should read this collection, though. Beyond the stunning quality of the stories in this collection, many of these stories have, by now, what amounts to historical importance within the sci-fi field; these are the best of the best first stories, the bones that the modern great SF writers gnawed on in their childhoods, the building-block stories of the genre. You really haven't read science fiction if you haven't read Asimov's \\"Nightfall,\\" if you haven't read \\"The Cold Equations\\" or \\"Arena\\" or \\"Twilight\\" or \\"Flowers for Algernon.\\" Understanding modern sci-fi without a knowledge of these stories would be like trying to understand modern fantasy without having read Tolkien.I am unaware of a better or even a comparable science fiction anthology (apart, perhaps, from the subsequent volumes in this same series). There couldn't be. These are the stories that built the genre. Any collection that was comparable would have to collect all the same tales.Edit: I figured it would be good to add a list of all the stories in this anthology.Stanley G.

And Silverberg was always one of the best anthologists that sf ever had. After thirty years I decided to re-read the book, but after thirty years, things change, people change, and times change, and some of the stories here have dated badly.I haven't seen much in the way of any reviews of most of the stories themselves, so here goes, arranged by loosely by some of the themes to be found here. One of the most prominent themes is the quest story. There are three stories here that clearly fall into the quest theme.--The first is \\"The Quest For Saint Aquin\\" by Anthony Boucher, the original editor of \\"Fantasy & Science Fiction\\". Like most quests, this story starts out as a quest for something external (St. Aquin) and ends up a quest for something internal (faith). Set in the near future where the religious is persecuted, a neophyte priest secretly looks for the legendary St. Aquin in an effort re-start Christianity. This story was written during McCarthyism's beginning, and as a quest through ideological territories, it has not lost its relevancy. Five stars.--Another quest for faith is the gimmick story \\"The Nine Million Names Of God\\" by Arthur C. Clarke, a story that won out over his \\"The Star\\" (?). \\"Nine Million\\" is a hokey, forgettable, by-the-numbers gag story with a telegraphed ending. Some monks are making a religious quest to find and note all of the nine million names of God, then the world will end. Guess what? Once read, there is no desire to ever re-read the story. One star.--The last quest story is James Blish's classic sf adventure \\"Surface Tension\\" in which some genetically engineered micro-humans must learn to co-operate amongst themselves, and learn to refine and reinvent basic technology so that they can make a quest beyond their own small pond, it is a quest story, an adventure, a metaphor, and a coming of age story with an exotic local. Five stars.There are two stories here that are gimmick stories that actually give their twists out in their beginnings.--Never being a fan, the \\"bad seed\\" story often makes the child smarter than they really could be. While Jerome Bixby's \\"The Good Life\\" may superficially be a bad seed horror story, or a metaphor about society's fear of its youth, it is also so much more. It transcends its pulp origins by also being a morality tale about how absolute power corrupts absolutely. Five stars.--Tom Godwin's \\"The Cold Equations\\" is a sfnal treatment of Jack London's \\"To Build A Fire\\", and has always been a source of much discussion. Having been raised by, and having been a factory rat, my take on this story is different than most. Godwin's story is a scathing indictment on the type of the interminable corporate greed and utter cheapness that pervades most industries. Godwin states that physics rule space travel, but, as we have recently seen, bottom-line economics rule more than anything else. The story is about a stowaway that finds that a life saving mission will fail if she is left alive, and the struggle to save her and the mission. There is no doubt that the girl could have been saved if a nickel's worth of pre-planning had taken place, but the corporate idea of placing money over life is clearly what's being portrayed here. I originally liked this story, then hated it, and not because of the story's politics, but, because the story is so shamelessly manipulative. But, in the end, I guess I like it after all. Four stars.--Richard Matheson's \\"Born Of Man And Woman\\" was not only his first published story, but is still one of his best. It also deals with family betrayal; a child is born horribly deformed during the conformitist fifties, and like his later stories \\"Mute\\" and \\"The Faces\\", it's about child abuse. While shallowly a mere horror story, and only a half a dozen pages long, Matheson's story deals with the pain, and confusion of abuse from the child's point of view. While the sfnal content is tangential, this story still deserves its fame, has not dated since 1950, and shows why Matheson would go on to influence people like Stephens King and Spielberg, and be an influence in the horror, science fiction, and fantasy genres, and be an influence in both prose and film. Five+ stars.--The third story is Judith Merrill's \\"That Only A Mother\\", and while this could have been a story about a mother's blind love, the father's shock at being kept in ignorance, and how the family as a whole has to pull together and rise above adversity, it's not. Maybe it's because we get a saccharine build-up, then the child's disability is revealed in the same manner as a Lovecraftian monster, EVEN with italics. While I don't have any children, and I don't know how I would react in the same situation; being handicapped, I found the story offensive. While the story comes from the conformatist fifties, it dates horribly. Zero stars.America was at war during the early forties and its influence comes through in four war stories reprinted here:--Merrill's story also falls into this category and is dealt with above, leaving three others, the first being A. E. van Vogt's \\"The Weapon Shop\\". Again, it is a story whose theme hasn't dated. A clandestine organization is fighting the good fight against a corrupt dictatorship, by selling weapons, and while a thinly veiled bit of fifth columnist war propaganda, the story ends up still being a good relevant cautionary story. Four stars.--Fred Brown earned his reputation, by being a writer of the gag story. Still, when he got down to business, like in \\"Arena\\", he took a back seat to nobody, and \\"Arena\\" is a superior war-adventure story about a man against an alien. It has been filmed (movies and episodic tv), and while \\"Arena\\" may be predictable, it has the power of good heroic storytelling. The lead character is an everyman, the alien is really alien, the landscape is truly hostile, and the stakes are high, as this everyman must fight for the destiny of human race. Five stars.--Murray Leinster really was one of the great ones, but, unfortunately, \\"First Contact\\" wasn't one of his best. It's pure war paranoia about two space ships of two civilizations who meet, and have to decide how to, and whether to trust or kill each other. An impossible situation, Leinster gives us two solutions, one barely believable, and the other truly lame and having to do with telling dirty jokes. This story does Leinster no service, and the plot has been done better on tv. Two stars.Science fiction wouldn't be science fiction with some serious social commentary, and the first two deal with unions.--Robert Heinlein's \\"The Roads Must Roll\\" is about the work stoppage of a future highway by a union. This story is an anti-union tirade, and deserves a tirade in response. Here all the unionists are greedy, self-serving, cold-blooded, sociopathic, whining murderers, while the man that represents the \\"establishment\\" is a good, family oriented, empathic, organized, natural leader. Bah! Zero stars.--Cordwainer Smith's \\"Scanners Live In Vain\\" is the story that made Smith's reputation, and is also anti-union. Here scanners are cyborgs who ferry humanity around space, but, unfortunately, somebody has come up with a refined method of space travel. The possibility is that scanners might become obsolete, so the scanners then do what all \\"subversive\\" union groups do, they become assassins. However, one scanner \\"comes to his senses\\", realizes that his brother scanners are wrong, turns them in to the establishment, they see the light, become \\"good\\" citizens, and start devoting themselves to the betterment of society. Propaganda. Zero stars.These two stories where written back in, ah, who the Hell cares. Both stories are horribly dated, conservative, anti-union propaganda in that the \\"establishment\\" is portrayed as always good, and good for you, but unionists are bad, subversive, greedy malcontents, and are only in it for their own self-serving purposes. Both authors have done much better work that should have been recognized.--Another story that uses sf for the purpose of social commentary is Fritz Leiber's dark \\"Coming Attractions\\", and Leiber's story is more relevant today than it was back when it was first published. This is because, I think, that the situations described are more acknowledged today than they were then. This was one of sf's first experiments with decadence. It broke new ground by mentioning a nasty form of joyriding, nude dancing, underground knife fights, unmarried sex, techno musik of some kind, and how this all seems to exist in a type of puritanical society that exists in many religiously conservative nations. Leiber also nastily rips apart the whole \\"boy-meets-girl\\" theme, in what was perhaps sf's first story to seriously examine the symbiotic/parasitic relationship that exists between one abusive person and their submissive partner. Truly a \\"dangerous vision\\" in its time. Five stars.--\\"Nightfall\\" by Isaac Asimov was voted the best sf story of all time, and is about the death of a civilization due to a 2500 yearly nightfall. The story seems to date because of too many scientific implausibilities to list here, and that the civilization is too much like ours. I kept wondering just what WOULD a society in which there has been no darkness REALLY be like, and what WOULD their physiology be like if they had evolved in total sunlight. Asimov has done so much better. Three stars.Three stories deal with time travel:--\\"Twilight\\" by John Campbell, Jr., is about a man from the future who finds himself in the past, our present, telling about the eventual eclipse of mankind. \\"Twilight\\" doesn't quite work for me, it's too talky; some of this may just be my fault. Three stars.--Despite it being a scathing satiric tirade, \\"The Little Black Bag\\" by C. M. Kornbluth unfortunately seems to be better known for its O. Henry ending than for the story itself. Kornbluth had little use for humanity, and it shows here as a medical bag from the future is accidentally transported into the hands of an unlicensed drunken doctor, who transforms his life, and helps others. While this could have been a story about the salvation, and, rebirth of a man into a better human being, while saying a few things, good and bad, about medicine, the story sadly ends up as being nothing more than yet another vehicle for one of Kornbluth's rants of superiority and intellectual nazism. The story fails, because in the end, the characters are all clich&eacute;, and the supersmart end up being no smarter than the superstupid. That may be the point, but, the story could have been better. Three stars.--\\"Mimsey Were The Borogroves\\" by Henry Kuttner & C. L. Moore is easily the best of the three, and while promoting nurture over nature, Kuttner & Moore speculate on what is the basis of intelligence. This story deals with the same theme as Kornbluth's, this time some disposable toys are transported back into the past, are picked up by some \\"modern\\" children, the toys then transform the children's way of thinking. The story also focuses on the relationship between the children and their parents, who are fairly clueless as to the toys eventual impact. Right or wrong, the story contains some serious speculation on the origins of, and the formation of intelligence, with a truly heartbreaking ending. Five+ stars.There are two just plain people stories with an sfnal bent:--\\"Helen O'Loy\\" is a marriage of the romance and robot genres to good effect by Lester Del Rey, and it proves that the sf romance genre is nothing new. Just an old-fashioned sf story about love, it is reminiscent of some of Theodore Sturgeon's later stories, while interesting for its time, the story's plot is fairly commonplace now. Four stars.--\\"Huddling Place\\" by Clifford Simak is one of his inter-related \\"City\\" stories, makes a point that seems more and more valid, in dealing with how mental illness, in this case agoraphobia, slowly develops. A surgeon is required to save his best friends life in an emergency, but, he can't leave his \\"Huddling Place\\". The ending is predictable, but still has power, and like in Fred Pohl's story \\"The Man Who Ate The World\\" we see how the effects of mental illness can make even the powerful and intelligent helpless. Five stars.Mental illness also figures in the next two stories, which are also classic sf crime stories.--The first is dazzling, \\"Fondly Fahrenheit\\" by Alfred Bester will be a real surprise to anyone who thinks of Bester as merely a humorist. This is because it is a mean, vicious, chilling psychological horror story in which a man is cursed with owning a psychotic android that keeps committing sadistic murders. The story constantly blurs the line between the android's and the master's identity, from the first person to the third person, all sometimes in the same paragraph, so in the end we are never sure as who the killer really is, or who is really the master, or the slave. The story also seems to feature an almost sexual symbiotic/parasitic to the relationship of the man and android. Five+ stars.--Bester's story is immediately followed by \\"The Country Of The Kind\\", in which Damon Knight writes of a future where sociopath criminals are set free into society. They are however, altered so that they cannot commit interpersonal violence, and their bodies are altered so that their body odors force them to be ostracized by the other members of society. These criminals may commit whatever property crimes they wish, but this is an empty act, as nobody will acknowledge either their offenses or their presence. Five stars.There are two stories here dealing with research and science:--The first being Theodore Sturgeon's \\"Microcosmic God\\", and is about a man's pure unadulterated love of research and what happens when the man meets and underestimates another man with an equal amount of passion, this time for power and money. Sturgeon is in excellent form here as he examines the amorality of both sides, and the self-divorcing of their own humanity, and of two men who, in the end, were more alike than they were different. Still, I didn't care for this story as much as I do for much of Sturgeon's other works, but this is my fault. Four stars.--Daniel Keys knocked about sf for a fair amount of time as an editor and writer, but before finding mainstream fame, he published \\"Flowers For Algernon\\" an emotional gem about Charlie Gordon, a retarded man whose ambition is merely to be smart, and to be normal. Charlie's brain is operated on, and we see his rise and fall in the form of a personal diary. Rarely has such a stylistic device been used so effectively, and we are torn apart by the ending, which is one of sf's true emotional highpoints. Five+ stars.What about that good ol' fashioned sense of wonder? The romance of adventure, the exotic, the very thing that made most of us want to read sf in the first place? COINCIDENTLY, the book is bracketed by two of these, one published about thirty years after the other, and showing it, but with neither showing the worse for the wear as far as imagination goes.--The first, and the anthology's opener, is Stanley Weinbaum's \\"A Martian Odyssey\\", and with its non-exploitive, non-sensationalistic title, it set itself apart from the typical sf of its day. While the characters are clich&eacute; Hollywood stock characters, and the telling is dated, with peripheral characters constantly interrupting the protagonist to \\"to keep the story moving\\", the story itself is still grand early world building. Told in a semi-documentary mode, it's the story of an astronaut who crashes on Mars, treks across an alien landscape, and makes first contact with three very different types of alien creatures, none of which were much like anything else in the adventure pulps of its day. Sadly, Weinbaum died of cancer before he could see this printed. What a writer he could have been. Three stars, only because of the dated storytelling style.-- The anthology's ender is Roger Zelazny's \\" A Rose For Ecclesiastes\\" shows not only a more mature writing style than Weinbaum's, but shows us a much more mature, although just as impossible, Martian civilization. This may also have been the first serious sf story to seriously use linguistics as a science, as a scholar must learn the Martian language so that our civilization are the Martian's can interact. This story is notable in that it is one of the very few stories that I have read over the last forty years to accurately portray the sheer JOY that one can experience while doing research.The lead character is a snotty, self-superior, linguistic genius, but despite his age, he has yet to reach maturity. Eventually though, we sympathize with him as he gradually realizes that the others on the expedition to Mars nearly aren't as DUMB as HE thinks they are, and HE isn't nearly as smart as HE thinks he is.This is a pure classic about love, growing up, and the love of a chosen scientific endeavor. It took me thirty years to re-read this story, to understand what I originally missed. For this I should be flogged, but, thankfully I have lived long enough to rectify my ignorance, and for this I am grateful. \\"A Rose For Ecclesiastes\\" is a story that should be mandatory reading for everybody in sf. Five+ stars.In the end however, looking back at these stories, very few would fit into just one pre-fab niche, or even genre, as all good fiction is more than just the marketing genre they are published as. Are these really the best sf stories published from the years 1934-1963? Probably not, I know I would have picked some, and not some others, but then, I wasn't asked. All-in-all though, this truly is one of those \\"essential\\" volumes that we keep hearing about."},{"Title":"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: The Greatest Science Fiction Stories of All Time","review":"This book collects short story masterpieces from the genre's first four decades. All of the major sci-fi writers are represented, and quite of few of the stories are simply unforgetable. Never has one volume collected more thoughtful meditations on humanity's relationship to technology. Devotees of more modern science fiction (i.e., cyberpunk, etc...) may not be impressed, but for fans of Old School sci-fi, it doesn't get any better than this.Of course many devoted fans will already have many of these stories in their collections - how could it be otherwise? The cream always rises to the top. So some might wish to forgo purchasing this volume, and use the table of contents as a reading list instead.As is typical of the genre during this period, there's little here that will shock the youngsters, and the reading is pretty easy overall. So this is an excellent book for those just discovering the genre, or trying to understand what all the excitement is about. Be forewarned, however, that the volume begins with some of the older and consequently weaker entries, so those for whom this book represents an exploration into unknown territory might be better served by skipping the first 3 to 5 stories and starting with either Heinlein's exciting \\"The Roads Must Roll\\" which features next week's travel technology, or Theodore Sturgeon's amazing \\"Microcosmic God\\" which looks at creating life, or if you're very picky about what you read, going straight for Isaac Asimov's famed \\"Nightfall\\". Another alternative is to start at the back and read forward. There are some very powerful pieces loaded into the back end, including a couple of tear-jerkers, Tom Godwin's \\"The Cold Equations\\" and Daniel Knight's \\"Flowers for Algernon\\".Regardless of how you read it, these stories, more than any other work, represent what science fiction is really about: the human condition remains the same, even as the world around us changes.

If you want to see the where the genre came from, in the short form where it's best, you must read this collection.Consider these titles:Stanley G.

You can (if you so desire) simply open a page at random and start reading that story. This makes this text an excellent bridge into the fantastic realms of futuristic stories that have been shunned by many a fiction reader as being \\"too nerdy.\\" each of these stories is engrossing, but all of them are quick, and to the point. They capture your imagination and then send you on your way forever touched by their visions of the world around you.Great fiction is just that: a great story, whether it is about a North-Going Zax meeting his nemesis, an orphan boy in an abusive home learning of his secret magical powers, or a genius who invents a machine to travel time only to find the hideous fate of humanity that looms in our future. We need more books like this, books that bridge the gap between reading cultures, to allow more avid readers to expand their awareness of great tales.I strongly recommend this book as a gift to any reader of fiction, as it provides easy access to a variety of new authors (albeit giants in the industry) without much time commitment on the part of the reader.

This isn't an anthology of SciFi horror or Space Opera. The stories run the gamut but all have a sense of their era. Inventiveness, inquisitiveness, and a fear of nuclear war abound, immediately dating the stories.

Babel-17 has many new and original idea (cyberpunk modifying of your bodie, discorporate souls for ship navigation, etc), but it a lot of it gets lost in the eloquent prose. I wish he would have taken a little more time and wrote a little more to flesh out the small world he created in Babel-17. This is definately not Delany's best work.

Without giving any plot elements away, the ideas behind Babel-17 and the very apparent research Mr. Delany exhibits throughout are formidable and truly engaging. However, they are somewhat compromised by the campier trappings of the time period during which the book was written - Babel-17's vision of the future is complete with groovy furniture that inflates from the floor tiles - so its potential seems squandered. However, it also reflects a form of sci-fi that rarely rears its head nowadays; thought-provoking without having to be ironic, dramatic without having to be dystopian, Babel-17 is an undeniably unique and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Babel-17","review":"Babel-17 won the Nebula award for best SF novel in 1966, so I read it eagerly.

If you want to read a strange story, there are others I would recommend over this book: Blood Music by Greg Bear, Songs of Earth and Power by Greg Bear, Manifold Space by Stephen Baxter, and Manifold Time by Stephen Baxter are all off-beat, but very good. Sheena 5 is an intelligent squid in Manifold Time. Hearing the thoughts of cognizant squid, seeing the character development of a squid, is a real treat. Babel-17 was not a treat."},{"Title":"Babel-17","review":"These are incredibly entertaining and thought-provoking stories, but they're not pure entertainment. While they are not quite as abstruse as something like Philip Dick, they do require some work on the part of the reader in order to be appreciated fully. Readers who want a pure fun sci-fi adventure will likely find these somewhat disappointing, as will those who prefer a thoroughly fleshed out and minutely detailed universe. That isn't the purpose of these stories. These are short sketches, intended to investigate ideas about perception and existence. Taken for what they are, they are wonderful gems, both of them."},{"Title":"Babel-17","review":"Some sci-fi just ages poorly. Babel 17 is clearly the future of the 60's, with easy love and extreme body art mixed in with pseudo-linguistic technobabble. I'd really only suggest picking it up if it's used, or if you really liked it when it was modern.Empire Star was a better story, if much shorter, but has some of the same feel applied to a recursive narrative. Without the novella, this would only be a two star book."},{"Title":"Babel-17","review":"Can a poetess save the universe?

Not that it's easy, but for the most part the effort is worth it. One of the few SF books to deal with the relatively esoteric topic of language and how it defines us (which really seems to be a natural SF topic, being that they deal with aliens and stuff so much), something it sort of shares with Ian Watson's The Embedding. Delany however won a deserved Nebula for this book (actually he tied with Flowers for Algernon, also a fine book, but as different from this as can be), which probably wasn't at all what readers were expecting in 1966 when this was published. But who cares what the readers want, as long as it's good? And this is. As I mentioned before it's a mediation on how language defines us, both to ourselves and in relation to other people, all cloaked in a Space Opera type story. The Invaders (who are never really seen, weirdly enough, but I think they're human) are attacking the Alliance and are using a mysterious weapon called Babel-17. What is it? Nobody is really sure so the military recruits famous poet Rydra Wong to figure out what's going on. She has little idea either but has come closer than most people. What follows is layer upon layer of story as Ms Wong examines her own life as she tries to unravel the mystery of Babel-17, examining both the roots of language and doing her best not to get killed. Rydra is a rarity in SF, a three dimensional woman who stands on her own as a strong character who doesn't come across as an emotional maelstrom or an ice-cold witch. She's one of the most enjoyable and well-rounded characters to come down the pipeline in SF and there are very few characters since who can match up to her. Delany's story just a bit wacky toward the end and he makes up more than a few SF twists to explain the ending but the story holds together really well and it has brains and a soul underneath all the deep thinking. It's also very short, so all the people scared off by Dhalgren can come over here and see what the man can do in small doses. Then they can move on to the big stuff."},{"Title":"Babel-17","review":"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was Babel-17. And from the Word understanding flowed, and gave substance to the material world. A Symbol: a Name: Rydra Wong. Poet. Cryptologist. Starship Captain. Woman. Co-opted to decipher what Babel-17 is, what meaning it has, what connection there is between war-plant sabotage and the usage of Babel-17.Inside, around, and terminally intermixed with this nominal space opera is the quest to define the relationship between language, symbol, object, and thought process. A quest that flows around surgical body-form manipulation, the senses of the discorporate, succubi , the revival of the dead, love triples, starship pilot wrestling, a society and personality types split between Customs, Transport, and military. All told with Delany's inimitable sense of the English language, with the admirable support of excerpts of Marylyn Hacker's (Delany's then wife) poems.Delany has developed this theme of language as the controlling factor in a person's world map in several books, but this is the only one that I can think of by him or any other author where language is not only a weapon but the main driving force behind the plot. In making his point, he almost goes too far, giving powers of understanding to Babel-17 that stretch the boundaries of believability, although he makes the very relevant point that some concepts cannot (or only with great difficulty) be expressed in some languages, while in other languages the same concept can be expressed very precisely in just a few words.The characters of this book are far more normal than the typical set of Delany people, which is not to say that they are not extremely interesting, engaging, and well presented. And as part of the character set, we learn that Rydra was once part of a love triple, the other members of which, while just names in this book, play a major role in the follow-on novella, Empire Star.Having had your world view expanded by Babel-17, be ready to have it totally turned upside down, twisted into circles and hyperboloids by Empire Star, where a person's world view can be described as simplex, complex, or multi-plex. Here we find Comet Jo, a simplex person who observes an organiform star-ship crash and who is given a message to take to Empire Star by one of the ship's dying members, who looks exactly like himself. In the process of taking the message, we watch as Jo grows to complex, then multi-plex maturity as he meets San Severina, owner of seven Lll slaves (ownership of which causes the owner to experience continuous unbearable sadness), LUMP (a linguistic ubiquitous multi-plex computer), and learns about the battle to free the Lll slaves. But at just about the point where you think you have a standard, straight-forward story, curve-balls of time-travel, causality, and mirrored relationships come to the fore, and twist this story (and by its relation to Babel-17 that story also) into a pretzel of deep complexity that will leave you scratching your head while fully satisfying your emotional requirements.Within these two stories, Delany packs more original ideas than most authors would in ten novels, and does it with great style and panache. Written very early in his career, they fully deserved the Nebula Award and Hugo nominations they received, and read just as well today as when they were first published."},{"Title":"Babel-17","review":"Rydra Wong is a poet - the poet of her generation, though only in her twenties, with a readership spanning five galaxies. Her readership also spans two sides of an interstellar war. Because of her past skills at decryption and current skills in many human languages, her help is asked in decoding messages that precede devastating acts of sabotage against our side.Rydra discovers that codename Babel-17 is no mere cipher. It's a language instead, with its own words, grammar, and lethal internal logic. Rydra chases Bable-17 in a trail of sabotage across the star-streams, learning bits and pieces of the language as she goes. Every fact that sheds light on the language only darkens the real mystery: who speaks this language? And why?It's a slim book, but dense. Fast-paced adventure pulls the reader along, with plenty of worthwhile characters along the way. Delany's writing is so good that we really care about that mousy little bureaucrat who approves Rydra's star flight. We also get a genuinely sick chill from the head of the weapons lab - as well we should, from the hypocritical genteelness of a man so dedicated to death en masse.There's an extra in this book, like the flip side of an old Ace Double. That's Empire Star, a novella with many themes of personal becoming: slavery ending, an urchin rising from the gutter, and a princess seeking her birthright. The storytelling is highly nonlinear, a fact that explains much but becomes apparent only towards the end. I never found a satisfactory resolution within this story, though. Although Babel-17 is truly memorable, Empire Star is not.Babel-17 instantly became one of my favorites when I first read it. A new reading, years later, shows why. I never know whether an old favorite will live up to my memory of it, but this one certainly does.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Babel-17","review":"Delaney explores the influence of language on thoughts en indentity. Would we be who we are when we had grown up, using a language with no word for me or I or, for that matter, you? Would we be able to think better or faster when we used another language for our thoughts? Is that a way to define intelligence? Can language be used to manipulate so sharply that it becoms a weapon?A must-read SF classic, not only because of the theme, but also because of the vivid new (1966!) universe he created, and the way he sees our future. Delaney avoids the trap of (some) older SF-writers: to focus on the theme instead of the plot. It's an excellent read.Babel-17 won the Nebula Award in 1966."},{"Title":"Babel-17","review":"This recent pairing of Samuel R. Delany's early classics is a wonderful piece of publication, as the two novellas together make yet a third window on the combined story. Babel 17, The longer of the two, is a narrative of mayhem, murder, mystery, madness, and metaphor. Though shorter (sort of), Empire Star gets in its LUMPs (Linguistic Ubiquitous Multiplex Computers) as well.Delany, anagramatically AKA Muels Aranlyde, writes sagely about the joy of linguistics (in a Whorf-ian sense), the anguish and sadness of slavery, the questing journey, non-standard sexual proclivities, and a whole new slant on death being no excuse to stop working. (Although both treks are aesthetically closer to Road Warrior than Star Wars, George Lucas does seem to have picked up a couple of ideas here, including the famous alien bar scene.) There is one disclaimer: The topologies of Delany's writing are not for everyone. I first discovered his works while I was in college, and found them opaque and self-absorbed. But I would have pored over them earlier, and much later have come to enjoy them all the more, in spite of the flaws. Intensely self-referential long before fractals, chaos theory, and literary necessity made the technique fashionable, this is the thinking person' science fiction at its finest."},{"Title":"Babel-17","review":"This is the kind of science fiction novel that no one writes anymore. It plunges you into a bizarre and brilliant world, against the backdrop of a war against an enemy known only as The Invaders. It is fully of colorful images and characters: cosmetically altered space crews with claws, fangs, wings, and horns; straight-laced Customs officers and military men; the spirits of \\"discorporated\\" (dead) crewmen; freewheeling privateers, and incomprehensible aliens. The heroine is larger than life, a poet, linguist, cryptographer and space captain. And Babel-17 itself, a strange alien language engineered to enhance logical thought. Nowadays, authors feel a greater need to explain the background of their worlds, producing thicker novels with fewer off-the-wall ideas. In Babel-17, Delany spins ideas so thick and fast that you just have to relax and let them whip past you. A great read for anyone who loves classic science fiction."},{"Title":"Babel-17","review":"Far and away Delaney's best.

It has all that, but the story is an amazing journey through a wild, corse world created by Delany. I found it hard to keep up with each new perspective and character he created because they were so varied and creative. The heart of the story and its true genius is language. The story gets so wrapped up in language though that without a linguistics background, the reader is going to have problems reading this and following along. But if you do, you'll love it and the possibilities. If you don't, you still have one heck of a world to explore.This story is almost a marketing device for the power and possibility of language. After reading this, you'll at least think about things a little bit differently or want to actually take a few courses on Linguistics. You'll love the world of Delany too. The story is challenging but well worth it."},{"Title":"Babel-17","review":"This is THE work of genius. As far as I am concerned, there is no other masterpiece that surpasses the ingenuity of this book.How could the author have possibly written this in the 60s? His vision of the multi-lingual future of the humanity and its effect on the human (and machine) behaviours is almost psychic. I would not have understood any of this, had I read it in the 60s.The book is full of surprises, vivid and memorable episodes, and intricate and profound word plays, which will start to show double, triple, and quadruple meanings as you read on.Do not get distracted while you read this one, because one little sentence maldigested here and there might spoil your fun later.Truly intelligent piece of work that has a remarkably liberating and empowering effect on you.

This is an oustanding book by the person almost singularly responsible for recovering the thought of the anti-Federalists."},{"Title":"What the Anti-Federalists Were For: The Political Thought of the Opponents of the Constitution","review":"Herbert Storing died in 1977 before publication of his 7-volume The Complete Anti-Federalist. The [1981] What the Anti-Federalists were For, the book under review, was part of volume 1 of that publication.The Anti-Federalists were opposed to the ratification of the Constitution as it was proposed following the 1787 Philadelphia (Constitutional) Convention. They were not opposed to the original purpose of the Convention, which had been to discuss the revision, amendment, and improvement of the Articles of Confederation which had gone into force in March of 1781. The Articles as they stood were ineffective as a confederation among the 13 states, but the Constitution as proposed was dangerous to individual liberty and the sovereignty of the states.Indeed, the Convention had no authorization or legal authority to forgo its directive and abandon the Articles altogether, bypassing Article XIII, and formulating an entirely separate and distinct document which, upon approval of only 9 of the 13 confederated states, founded a new government that wholly disregards the authority of the government established by the Articles of Confederation, which, according to its sovereign assertions: \\"shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual\\".A large republic, the Anti-Federalists believed, is ineffectual in a free society. \\"Only a small republic can enjoy a voluntary attachment of the people to the government and a voluntary obedience to the laws. Only a small republic can secure a genuine responsibility of the government to the people. Only a small republic can form the kind of citizens who will maintain republican government. These claims are central to the Anti-Federalist position.\\" (16)Storing tells us: \\"Federalism means that the states are primary, that they are equal, and that they possess the main weight of political power. The defense of the federal character of the American union was the most prominent article of Anti-Federalist conservative doctrine.\\" (9) The Anti-Federalists disclaimed the name given to them by the self-nominated Federalists. They who wrote against the proponents of the new Constitution saw themselves as the true federalists. The terminological debate arose because of an ambiguity in the concept of federalism (compare this with the modern concept of liberalism). One understanding focused on the preservation of state power within a federation, whereas the contrary understanding focused on the authorization of national power within a federation. \\"The ambiguity arose because strengthening the federal *authority* could be carried so far as to undermine the federal *principle*; and that was precisely what the Anti-Federalists claimed their opponents were doing.\\" (10) The new national government, with its consolidation of power, would overwhelm the states.\\"The Anti-Federalists could not consistently hold to the doctrine of state supremacy because they admitted it would lead to anarchy among the states. They could not accept national supremacy because they thought it would lead to centralized tyranny.\\" (33) Following, initially with reluctance, a reconceptualization of federalism by the Federalists to mean \\"a mixed national and federal system\\" (33), the Anti-Federalists came to see \\"a government in which neither the whole nor the part are supreme\\" (33) to be \\"under all the circumstances, the best way to preserve the principles they thought fundamental.\\" (33) However: \\"Once the legitimacy of the new federalism is accepted, the Federalists emphasized the primacy of the national component in the mixture, while the Anti-Federalists urged the importance of a strict division of power and even something like a divided sovereignty, the possibility of which their early strictly federal argument had denied.\\" (33) Again, terminological confusion arose because of conflicting views on the role, purpose, and dangers of a national government.Congress, as sanctioned by the Constitution, is faulty. The House of Representatives is inadequate as establishing the representation of the people, and \\"the mixture of legislative, executive, and judicial powers in the Senate violate[s] the maxim of separation and seem[s] designed to lay the foundation for a permanent aristocracy.\\" (48-49) The Senate is \\"the fetus of an aristocratic domination.\\" (49)Of the power given the Judiciary, the Anti-Federalist Brutus wrote: \\"I question whether the world ever saw, in any period of it, a court of justice invested with such immense powers, and yet placed in a situation so little responsible.\\" (50) He warned: \\"If ... the legislature pass any laws, inconsistent with the sense the judges put upon the constitution, they will declare it void; and therefore in this respect their power is superior to that of the legislature.\\" (50) The Federal Farmer agreed, saying that \\"we are more in danger of sowing the seeds of arbitrary government in this department than in any other.\\" (50)The Constitution as proposed has no Bill (Declaration) of Rights. Without this there is no security against despotism, nor is there security against the tyranny of the majority wherein the people themselves as a coercive, factional majority suppress the liberty of individuals outside the faction. The argument of the Federalists that the entire Constitution guarantees these rights is erroneous. The power of government is not to be trusted.Storing discusses more than reported here. He includes discussion of the Federalist positions on some issues. His chapter on the Bill of Rights is surprisingly weak."},{"Title":"What the Anti-Federalists Were For: The Political Thought of the Opponents of the Constitution","review":"The anti-federalists were really the federalists, they lost, and they're forgotten. Some of them predicted that if the constitution were adopted, even with the Bill of Rights, that the government it created would abuse its power and that there would be no agency to stop it.

I don't know of many other sources for that."},{"Title":"What the Anti-Federalists Were For: The Political Thought of the Opponents of the Constitution","review":"Given the virtually unlimited power of the Federal government as we now know it, it's refreshing (and vitally important) for us to understand what the REST of the Founders supported.

I want advice on how to foster healthy self esteem and a respect for women in my son. What I absolutely do not want is a feminist critique of Home Alone or Die Hard. If she must reference movies, she could at least try to be accurate. Mr. Miyagi in The Karate Kid is clearly Japanese, not Chinese. How anyone could get Chinese and Japanese mixed up like that just baffles me. They're two totally different cultures. As is usually the case, the author can't take all the blame. Some responsibility lies with the editors and proofreaders. Three stars -- there is some useful insight about gender roles and family dynamics in here, once you excavate past the dodgy references to pop culture. I read psychology books for psychology, and parenting books for parenting tips. When I want a film review I'll go to a friend or a film critic."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"I was born after the feminist revolution had done most of it's hardest work, and so I have experienced a world that embraces girls and women in wonderful ways. Though I grasp that there are certainly vestiges of discrimination against women, I have always felt powerful and capable to embrace my femininity and still do whatever I want with my life. Thank you, feminists. But I have always felt a bit of reticence about being identified with feminism, because I believe that who really suffers from gender role stereotyping today is men. Men can't cry, they can't giggle, they can't dress up silly, they can't admit they need someone to love them, they can't be afraid, they can't do a million things that bring joy or solace to women because someone will think they're gay, or they're weak, or dependent, or what the hell ever it is that we think a \\"real man\\" is not. From what I can see, men still live in serious fear of so many irrational things that are perceived to threaten masculinity, and these fears are so deep seated that we don't even consider them when we talk about gender roles. The unspoken thesis of this book is that what really makes men weak and broken is, in fact, the assumption that masculinity has to be forged in a fire of rejection and isolation by the parents who love them and are charged with their care during childhood. It's an eloquent and heartfelt plea to see this sad arrangement for what it is, and change it. It's a revolutionary idea, and it's just so rarely said. Please read this book. It's important."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"Just want to recommend this book to other mothers of sons. It's a very unique book in that it's not about the details of raising boys, rather it's about how our culture and learned behaviors lead us, as moms, to distance ourselves from our sons. When we come to understand this unconscious behavior we can counteract it and have the lasting connection we want."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"The author is indifferent regarding the development of masculine characteristics.

I also don't find most men very appealing on a human level. I doubted my ability to have and maintain a close relationship with a boy-man and this was a matter of some sadness to me.This book exposed my expectations for what they were - socially induced, i.e. mothers shouldn't be too close to their male children, or they will emasculate them, etc. It is a brilliant book with many compelling examples and its arguments are wholly consistent with common sense and instinct. My husband read some of it and thought its hypothesis was obvious, but it is strikingly different in its prescriptions than any other book on raising boys that I have read. (For instance, the &quot;Wonder of Boys,&quot; which says mothers have to leave their sons alone, let them be driven by testosterone into competitiveness, roughness, and machoism, and basically seems to take the attitude that mothers are responsible for most problems their boys have growing up.This is a positive, hopeful book, displaying warmth and compassion, and seems much more pyschologically sound. It should be required reading of all mothers, along with &quot;Real Boys&quot; of Pollock, which is its more recent successor."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"I came to the dialog of gender issues from a feminist perspective.

All of a sudden I found myself concerned (afraid!) of what other mothers and his peers would say (or think) about those purple boots. Without shaming him outloud, I subtly directed him toward the dark blue pair. I was totally amazed at my own fear of bending gender rules for a boy! I would have bought combat boots or any other kind of \\"boy\\" attire for a daughter but I could not bring myself to allow him to wear something others might find too \\"feminine\\". That was three years ago. After having read this book, I am now noticing all the other ways I have subtly or not-so-subtly directed him along a culturally acceptable gender path. And I consider myself to be a feminist. This book was my first exposure to the idea that I won't harm my boys by allowing them the freedom to express themselves, however that might look. This book was my first exposure to the idea that mothers don't harm their sons by loving them passionately and joyfully. I am so grateful for having read this book and I am going to buy it for at least 3 other mothers I know who are raising boys.

All of the books I had read seemed to come from an &quot;Iron John&quot; perspective or be a sort of vague, New Agey feel-good book, but none of them offered concrete steps and clear facts until I read &quot;The Courage To Raise Good Men.&quot; Here at last was a book that told me what my heart should have known all along: just love him like he's a child becoming an adult, and don't try to push him at all (he'll grow up even if you don't push!).

I decided when I was having my sons that they were going to grow up knowing how to be husbands and fathers. I had grown up watching my father and brothers beat their chests and try to impress us with their &quot;macho-ness&quot; I wasn't impressed and determined I was going to find a man who was not afraid of his feelings. I managed to find one who was open enough to learn and have been married to him for nearly 40 yuears, and...we still like each other We have managed to raise two young men who are loving , caring, and whom I have an open and loving relationship with. They all still call from their various locations at least once a week and we gave them all video phones so we can all see each other. The neatest part is they are FRIENDS and they all like each other and communicate often. It can be done!! Thank you for bringing the subject to the attention of the multitude of young people who don't have a clue about raising a whole person. Our youngest said he realized a while ago that they are expecting a person, not just a baby. I feel so grateful to have understood my obligation as a woman and mother.

She shows how boys, then, are abandoned and isolated emotionally, and are left to grow up alone without relational and emotional support. This creates adult men who cannot connect emotionally, and who are reinforced by the culture to be distant. For every mother who has wanted to raise a son to be an emotionally available adult partner, and who is not afraid of raising that wonderful person called a &quot;mama's boy&quot;, this book is a must read.

The authors believe that mothers too are withdrawing from their sons, in the belief that too much contact makes them too feminine, but they strongly disagree with that, and think maternal contact makes them human and humane."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"Silverstein presents facts and figures illustrating the damage done to, not only males but humanity in general, by the tendancy in our society and others to push boys toward activities designed to foster a sense of &quot;male-ness&quot; in them.She recommends, instead, allowing males and females to find their own gender path. This, she contends, can have a humanizing effect on our society. She also gives case examples where reuniting men with their mothers, in other words, giving them permission to love and accept love from each other, freely, has had a curative effect, not only on those involved, but on the family as a whole.I was so impressed with Silverstein's theories, I plan to design a college study around her work. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in gender issues. It also serves as a strong counterpoint to the so called &quot;men's movement."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"My two children are boys, but they are 24 and 26! So why did I buy this book, you ask? A friend and I were recently discussing how our culture has different expectations for men in terms of showing emotions. She mentioned this book ... so I bought it. I also feel that I am still in the process of parenting my sons, so I figured more information would not be a bad thing.This book has a lot of examples that show how subtly we treat boys differently from girls that give them (the boys) the message they have to be STRONG. The author also talks about how our culture empasizes the need for a \\"strong, male authority figure\\" in a young boy's life. This is fine until the culture also diminishes the value and importance of a strong mother.The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that the examples the author uses are somewhat dated -- Karate Kid for instance -- that current young mothers may not relate to."},{"Title":"The Courage to Raise Good Men","review":"Wow! This is one excellent book! Olga was right on the money when she said that it is NOT necessary for boys to &quot;detach&quot; emotionally from their mothers in order to grow up (&amp; become &quot;real men&quot;). The book could have also been written by Mary Perry, Steve Perry's mom. (Steve Perry had a WONDERFUL relationship with his mom &amp; often turned to her for advice). Olga explodes many of the untrue myths surrounding sons, including the rules of conventional &quot;masculinity&quot;. She exposes the &quot;men's movement&quot; &amp; the &quot;fatherhood&quot; pundits for what they are...conservatives attempting to push their agenda on families...conservatives who tell mothers that they are inadequate for their sons &amp; need men around to raise their sons for them, that a close relationship with mom is bad or &quot;emasculating,&quot; etc. I like how she encourages moms to rise to the task of raising their sons, especially single mothers, who just as good as dads.(Contrary to popular belief, sons of single moms are BETTER off than other men &amp; enjoy a closer relationship with their mothers in adulthood). Largely, her book proves that the old rigid gender patterns are limiting &amp; destructive to both sexes &amp; that feminism is not only pro-female, but pro-male as well."},{"Title":"Why People Choose the Wrong Mate: Avoiding the 9 Deadly Booby Traps","review":"This book is the truth and nothing but the truth!Everyone should have this book.It is a true reference to life as we live it.Before starting any relationship,one should read it.It touches so close to home,you wont be able to put it down.My Advice to you 'GET YOUR OWN COPY\\""},{"Title":"Why People Choose the Wrong Mate: Avoiding the 9 Deadly Booby Traps","review":"If you've found yourself in one abusive relationship after another, I bet your exes would have fit the criteria laid out in this book (all of my exes did).What I really like is that Gillis mentions that many people will tell you not to trust your instincts, when your instincts are warning you about all of the red flags about that \\"sweet and great person that everybody adores.\\" This book warns you about everything and can save you from getting into another toxic relationship.

Social change has a pace and rhythm of its own, and understaning its flow enables us to see poliitical changes in a new light.The authors have divided American history into three unique periods: Preindustrial America, from the beginning of the sixteenth century to the 1820s; Industrializing America, from the 1820s to the 1920s; and State and Society, from the 1920s to the present.

Dr. Dillingham, the human dentist, is propelled from alien mouth to alien mouth performing badly needed procedures for xenoforms in pain.

Light meaning it's not cerebral, but merely fun to read. It's a short book, detailing the experiences of a dentist kidnapped by aliens and working in outer space populated by many species of aliens from many planets that we know nothing about. It's not a serious read, but it's fun and comedic, anyone can probably finish this in a day or two.It's Piers Anthony showing his fun side. Too bad he didn't create 2 or 3 sequels to it. Don't know why this book didn't catapult him to success, maybe it's too short! But either way, if you're a Piers Anthony fan or if you like light and humorous sci-fi you must read this one.This book also has a strong message. It's clean your teeth! If there are any parents wanting to teach their kids the important of dental hygiene, they might want to read them this book.

Touches on the topic of homesexuality in IndoPak; something that's more common than we think."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"The book had me riveted. The story, the style of writing, the whole flow of incidents. The ever changing scenes and the myriad of emotions was a colorful kaleidoscope and yet it did not confuse.A new world was opened to me, a new India, a part I never knew about.What happened to Henna - was too much to digest politely, too real, too sudden and wasteful. And yet we know that these incidents - lone incidents that people read in newspapers and see flashing on TV - incidents that happen to other people - do happen all the time.The striking thing about the book was that it was so honest. Every character was human, one isn't sure whom to love and whom to hate, Zeba, Nafisa, Layla herself and even Sameer. Somehow one could see each side of the story, somehow in the end we know they were bound to do what they did, that it could not have been any different. The only people that is difficult to understand, the only people who aren't forgivable are Layla's parents. They did fail her miserably.We too, like most people, like to be blind, to see, what we want to see and when truths are put in front of us, we flinch. We flinch when we think of the bird fluttering to her death, of the lamb to be sacrificed, of Henna's baby cut open.Layla was unflinchingly honest, about everything, and we, like the very women in the book, feel like saying, \\"Why is she doing this\\", \\"Why is she raking it up\\", \\" Why can't she let it be \\", \\"Why can't she accept?\\". It makes us uncomfortable. These questions, and worse, the answers.I admit (as said by some reviewers) that there are many wonderful things that the author can write about, the diverse cultures and life in India and the many happy truths that is apparent in everyday life, but the truths in this book exist too, side by side and I thank the author for weaving these truths into a rich and admirable tapestry."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"Samina Ali has written a fresh fictional documentation of a woman trapped by cultural expectations and tragic relationships. In the begining, the book is very interesting. However, as the story progresses there are a lot of unnecessary references to issues that have already been covered. Many cliche metaphors also litter the story that may perhaps be better told in fewer pages. Nonetheless, this story is very interesting, and certainly keeps the pages turning. A wonderful first novel- definately worth a look."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"The beautiful and talented Ms. Ali had me in the grips of her wonderful and enviable prose from the first page to the very last--and still I wanted more. She is a superb writer; her expert use of language drew me in immediately, as did the mood. The world she opens up for the reader is vivid and rich in detail. At the end of it, I felt like I really knew these people she describes. Layla, our protagonist is simply brilliant. Her growth as a character is organic and outstanding. She's at once complex and genuine; She's a character you can root for. And the suspense! This narrative is simply riveting. I never knew what would happen next, and I walked away with such wonderful insight into Indian culture and traditions. This book has it all. Well done, Ms. Ali."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"\\"Madras on Rainy Days\\" is easily among the worst South Asian novels I have ever read. Ali tries to tackle too many issues (marriage, women, homosexuality, religion, politics), and in the end says nothing about any of them. She plays up stereotypes of Indians and Indian-Americans, and is unable to artfully incorporate any of the subtleties around these hot-button issues.The plot is slow and changes directions too quickly without ever reaching a clear climax. The wedding scenes in the first part are dry and clinical, and read like a documentary. The writing throughout is similarly amateurish and frustrating - high school students can do better.Overall, an entirely unsatisfactory waste of time."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"A gem of a book. It's been overlooked but more importantly, it's an engaging and satisfying read. The emotional journey taken by Layla, a Muslim immigrant in the US who returns to India to marry, unfolds with depth and complexity. Each page draws the reader further into the various and complicated relationships and experiences she has. I truly felt that it's a well-rounded life, even in a snapshot form of a book.

The story and its movement intrigued and captured me (and I'm a very critical reader).I say, \\"Wow!\\""},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"Very creative and unpredictable! I don't really like the detail that she told on on every event that she was describing. But the plot and the story reduce what I so don't like from this book and I like surprises that she gave on her story."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"I picked up this book with great expectations. The title seemed promising enough and so did the synopsis. However the narrative lacks the quality of holding the reader's attention and is flat at best. The story revolves around Layla,a girl from a conservative Muslin family who has a pre marital affair, her subsequent marriage and the dilemma of her homosexual husband. It appears to be set in the late '80s. The theme is not novel in itself since homosexuality and unwanted pregnancies are dealt with in innumerable novels that are churned out these days, still, the author would have been able to pull this one off if she had unraveled the story better. The plot is very loose in parts and one cannot help but think that the author has actually written a textbook on Islam culture and religion, these are dealt with in great depths in the book. One cannot help but wonder why the book is tiltled as it is as the title plays an insignificant part in the story. One can guess the predicament of Layla's husband long before it is revealed in Madras. I generally like reading Indian immigrant literature, being an immigrant myself, but I think I would give this one a skip."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"At first, it was annoying. I thought it used Orientalist imagery, and had a very binary approach to India-vs the West. But now that I've finished it, I find that the imagery is processed by the protagonist, Layla, whose perspective on \\"India\\"- in comparison to \\"America\\" -develops and changes and is complicated. The characterization, which at first struck me as flat, emerged as much better in the final analysis. Amme, Sameer, Dad, Naveed, the uncles and aunts -even Zeba -- all are very human. Their flaws and their participation in oppression are not whitewashed, but they are three dimensional. Samina Ali provides a painfully vivid account of religious attacks (gangs, rape and murder) upon Muslims in India. Her vision is critical, but not dogmatically secular or anti-religious, though she raises serious existential questions. One major flaw in her writing is the transliteration and translation of Hindi/Urdu. At first it irritated me no end. Eventually, as I wept over the last few pages, I decided to forgive her for \\"manjalises\\" and \\"kat kamat is salah\\" (and its incorrect translation) and a myriad other atrocious attempts at transliteration. Seriously, next time, let me do it for you, for free, just so I can enjoy the book without my skin crawling. This is an issue with many White writers on other cultures, but Ali should have had access to better transliteration. And next time, please skip the servants' attempt at English. Why do we have to pretend the servants speak English at all? Is this an attempt to prepare the book for a movie? There's always subtitles, you know. \\"You no worry-worry\\" and \\"he no show l you he-self is just aesthetically traumatizing. I was too distracted by that to focus on Nafiza's (which, I'm guessing, is Nafisa) character. Perhaps I forgive her because Henna's misery was too real. Still the ending is rather abrupt, given the lingering, dragging nature of the rest of the book, and a whole lot of action occurs suddenly at the end."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"I liked this book for the first 100 pages--though they were all about wedding preparations, with some cultural and family history. But then my attention started to wane. The next 200 pages were so \\"subtle\\" (enigmatic? esoteric?) that perhaps I missed the point in my struggle to keep reading. The story seemed to slow to nearly a stop, and I got bored. I didn't particularly care about Layla, Sameer or her family. Perhaps if I knew more about Indian culture, this book would have held my interest.It's worth a read anyway, because parts of it are interesting.I enjoyed \\"The Village Bride of Beverly Hills\\" by Kavita Daswani much more."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"Ali manages to entwine a collection of issues that, to outsiders, dismisses the stereotypes that have evolved in the post 9/11 Western mentality. The usual Indian motifs of vibrant color, heat, food, nature etc are paralleled with some interesting insights into the life of a Muslim Indian girl, returning from the US to her native city. While the subject of arranged marriages takes on a backdrop there is no shortage of issues such as pre-marital sex, familial relationships, divorce and homosexuality to remind readers that the Muslim female isn't quite as \`downtrodden' as we, in the West, might \`like' to believe her to be. The political undercurrent and tension between Hindu and Muslim offers another sad example of fanaticism but doesn't distract itself from the brilliant story line that took me only a weekend to read. All in all, Samina Ali enlightens the ignorant, plays for the romantic, educates the anthropologist and smiles for the feminist. We should all be happy with this read.The book offers a different genre but compliments the Indian novels that have arrived in mainstream book clubs. Two further books that might be an interesting read here..... Rajeev Balasubramanyam's In Beautiful Disguises and Badruddin Khan's Sex Longing and Not Belonging."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"This book is just tedious. As soon as one storyline started to get interesting, everything would screech to a halt & it would shift directions. The lack of a glossary of terms was very confusing for anyone not familiar with Indian culture. I wish I had given up by Page 50, but I just kept plugging away in the hopes that it would get better. Basically it's the story of a girl who lives in America & India who agrees to an arranged marriage & then doesn't want to deal with the outcome."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"I certainly wasn't crazy about this book. But if you are patient, it can be interesting in parts."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"I was pulled into the book mostly for its premise, it was a very interesting story line but as I kept reading...the author left me lost. Ali's descriptions seem too wordy and lose the reader. I think the writing is simply terrible, boring and not concise. The story has much potential but I also am rather bored of how she portrays culture in Hyderabad. I have family near there and the culture is nothing like that...maybe in remote parts of the area but not generally. I feel like a lot of things were put in simply for the shock value, to pull western readers in rather than for the simple truth of things.I also could NOT buy that her servants were speaking english...especially broken english. I found it to be very very distracting, I did not understand what the character was communicating and this lost me further.If you have nothing to do then go ahead and read it but...there are other books that are a lot more intellectually stimulating, less frustrating and more interesting than this one..."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"Perhaps the best part of this book is that it is beautifully written. It's heartening to find a writer who can write well and plot well; too many so called \\"literary\\" novels today suffer from a lack of plot, a paucity of storyline.One less star because this book did have the proverbial everything but the kitchen sink plot line. It's almost too dense.As for the other reviewers, especially Madhu m from Chennai, it's a good story, well told, and that is really important. Writing a book is much harder than reading one, and Ali does a very good job of portraying a young girl's fears in the face of enormous family and societal pressure.I only wonder if Ali has any more stories inside her--this book is said to be semi-autobiographical, so will be interesting to see her write something that is purely fiction. (And that is what makes this story so believable in many senses--the whole truth being stranger than fiction part--I can believe this to be very much a part of Indian life, even today. The forced arranged marriage, the gay husband who is to be set right by the right wife, of course, the willful blindess of everyone around to anything that goes against convention...even, at a stretch, the young girl who is half-American in upbringing, yet so deeply inculcated into her Indian side, it wins above all.)MADRAS (why Madras though?) deserved much more hype than it got, and it got plenty, only in comparison to that other over-hyped book by the other Ali (Monica) this was a better book."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"MADRAS ON RAINY DAYS opens with the celebration of a wedding between Layla, a nineteen-year-old college student, and Sameer, an ambitious engineer. The five-day ceremony is lush with the rich traditions of the families' Muslim culture in the Indian walled city of Hyderabad, and by all accounts the arranged marriage is a good match for both families.Behind the scenes of the opulent festivities, though, something is terribly wrong. Layla, who has spent most of her life in the United States, is deeply conflicted about her parents' desire to have her participate in the traditional arranged marriage. She feels at home neither in India, where she is viewed with suspicion as an outsider, nor in America, where her parents deliberately segregated her from modern culture. \\"I was supposed to inhabit America without being inhabited by it,\\" she says.Despite her parents' attempt to shelter her, though, Layla still underwent many American rites of passage, often without her parents' knowledge: \\"getting drunk for the first time, (...) This last transgression is deadly serious; if her previous sexual experience becomes public, not only will Layla's husband reject her, but her father will be at liberty to abuse and even kill her.Layla successfully conceals her previous relationship (and the resulting pregnancy and miscarriage) long enough for her to be embraced by Sameer's family. Indeed, much to Layla's surprise, she finds herself attracted to this husband she did not choose and does not yet love. (...) Why not let readers make those conclusions themselves? Astute readers, in addition to being able to decipher symbolism on their own, will also be less than surprised by Sameer's revelations near the novel's end.

Layla is a 19 year old Muslim indian girl who lives half her life in the US and doesn't truly fit in either place. Against the back drop of the parlimentary elections in India and raised tensions between Hindus and Muslims, Layla is coerced into an arranged marriage with a boy who is not all he seems. Can an Indian girl raised in a non traditional family find the happiness and stability she craves in the midst of national tension and family secrets?"},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"I found myself wound up in the lives of these characters and couldn't put the book down. It is a great read for people interested in cross-cultural experiences. The story weaves through the life of a young woman who goes to India for an arranged Muslim marriage, after having lived in the United States. The ability to have an insider's look into such traditionally taboo elements in Muslim culture, such as loss of virginity and homosexuality makes this book a bridge to understanding that people are more alike than we are different, regardless of religous laws and customs. The characters are endearing, especially Layla, the protagonist."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"This book provides a searing look into the complex world of Indian Muslims, and particularly when it is mixed with the influence of Western culture, its materialism and its freedom. Layla is a young woman raised both in India and in the west and as a result she belongs in neither world. Yet that is what she longs for, more than anything -- to belong. So when her mother arranges a marriage to the son of family friends, Layla reluctantly goes along, rather than risk ostracism from her family. She soon finds that Islam provides her life with a safety net, a sense of belonging that she had never experienced before. And so she falls in love, not only with her husband, who is all but a stranger to her, but with her husband's family, and the closeness it provides. Ultimately however, the secrets everyone's been witholding are slowly revealed, including Layla's own, and she must make some tough choices.This is a gorgeously written novel that brings to life the dichotomy of life under Islam, particularly for women. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"Layla has spent her life on the periphery of two divergent cultures; while in India she is constantly reminded of her American upbringing whereas while in Minnesota her Indian accent is frequently remarked upon by strangers. This theme of not fully belonging to either culture runs throughout MADRAS ON RAINY DAYS as Layla marries her fianc&eacute; Sameer in an arranged marriage with plans to return to the United States afterward. This novel provides an in-depth glimpse of a Muslim Indian wedding and its varied traditions resulting in a colorful feast of words and images for the reader.As a result of Layla and Sameer's precarious situation of marrying someone that is a virtual stranger they join in matrimony with their own hidden secrets. Despite their pledge after the conclusion of the wedding festivities to leave the past alone when their secrets are revealed they cause significant tensions between husband and wife and aim to end their marriage. But in the tradition of Indian culture these problems don't simply exist between Layla and Sameer but rather become a matter of discussion and problem solving for both extended families and even the neighborhood itself.There is little doubt that Samina Ali paints a rather somber and sinister portrait of the restrictive Muslim customs and religious beliefs that void the freedoms of Layla and other women in general. In addition the centuries-old feuding between Hindus and Muslims in India also put women in peril and dangerous situations if they are found without adequate protection of men.Overall MADRAS ON RAINY DAYS is a vibrant and satisfying read that touches on several serious issues that deserve attention and consideration. In light of the seductiveness and whimsy of recent Indian literature published in the past several years this book is a good addition to the bunch. I'm looking forward to future books by this talented author. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"Ali's storytelling is richly and beautifully detailed, even as it describes the dark and oppressive themes that run throughout the story. Her description of Hyderabadi life and culture was so vivid and visceral, I felt as though I was standing there even though I have never seen the place. I think the reason that it so enveloped me was her deliberate choice to introduce each character (Layla, her parents, Sameer, and the rest of the family members) as sort of a blank slate, onto which the reader naturally imposes his or her own presuppositions. Then she slowly reveals details about each character that pique the reader's interest and often run counter to these presuppositions. However, I should add that the whole idea of this mystery with its nebulous characters never seemed to clarify itself to me. Sameer's \\"secret\\" seemed too much a contrived plot to bridge Eastern and Western social culture, and the ending seemed to beg for a little more summarization of how Layla's character had grown through all this. It is not clear what our protagonist has gained from all these trying experiences, aside from learning that she can \\"hide behind her veil\\" if she remains in Hyderabad where she now feels at home; perhaps a short epilogue would have given readers some closure on Layla's future on her own."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"I personally would recommed this book to anyone who is interested in cross cultural battles faced by this generation. Layla on one hand wants to live life with freedom and on the other hand is bound by customs and traditions. This book not only gives us an insight into the inner turmoils a girl could go through but also makes us aware that as girls we are ready to go to any extent to live up to the traditions and cultural standards set by our ancestors & elders."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"\\"Madras on Rainy Days\\" provides a rare glimpse into the life of a traditional Hyderabadi family. This helps fill a gap in recent South Asian literature especially given the uniqueness of Hyderabadi culture within India. The writing is atmospheric and sharp and the story gripping. Would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"I saw this book on a shelf at the local library and thought it looked a bit too fem for a guy like me. Still, because of it's relation to my beloved India, I knew that I had to read it. I must say that I disagree with most of the negative comments found above. Firstly, it was a relief that the author did not launch into a hackneyed and drawn out description of the Indian wedding - it's been done before and once the description starts...it never ends, much like an Indian wedding (though I know little of the Muslim version, I imagine it is similar). Better to leave something to our imagination. The book is pleasingly devoid of the cerebral, post modern psychobabble that you find in other writers in this genre. Moreover, this is a personal story of this young woman's choices and those thrust upon her. I like the fact that it wasn't playing up on India's exotic appeal, but rather it's a personal journey that just happens to be taking place in Hyderbad. India is in cast, for sure, but it is not the lead role.Although some of the scenarios may be a bit forced (like the Hindu violence against the Muslims), it is fiction, after all and the author has a right to take such liberties. As a *Hindu* (a meaningless word which I am using for convention's sake)I was pleased with her description of Hindu beliefs: sensative and not judgemental. Although that crack about Ganesh mentioned above was a faux pas, it was an understandable one and appropriate to the story.I get the feeling the other Western reviewers never have had the distinct pleasure of residing in, or maybe even visiting, India. Frankly, what Samina Ali has written is %100 accurate. Yes, even Sameer's &quot;secret&quot; is far more likely to be the truth than that other reviewer could ever imagine. Probably as likely to happen in India, if not more so.In any case, I absolutely loved the story and I had to put the book down and cry so many times as it did not just reminded me of India and my failed marriage there, but because it brought India back to me, hitting me like a tsunami; that's powerful writing. This is a good story that will move you, plain and simple. I will certainly never forget it. I am giving it 4 stars, not 5, only because there is always room for improvement. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"The concept for the book was good, it got me to pick up the book, but it left me disappointed to no end. The author was able to capture some images of India to make me believe she'd actually been there, but as for the people and the society... I couldn't buy her version of the story. It seems she stuck to the expected. By the middle of the book I could guess her next move. Predict who would die, or what was the big secret. I read it through hoping that she would salvage the story... but instead the author herself lost the main idea behind her story. She starts out with the concept of a girl fighting the 2 sides of her personality and ends up dragging the reader's attention to the Hindu - Muslim fight without truly completing that stand point and detering our attention from Layla's inner battle as well. As for the whole idea of Layla's belief that her father would kill her for dishonor, and even be allowed... There is no way I buy that happening in Hyderabad! Perhaps in a small village out in nowheresville, but not in a bigger city. It just seemed too \\"stereotypical\\" too expected by an outsider, simply playing into the formula of what someone would expect from a third world country, instead of actually analyzing the country at a closer look."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"Someone loaned me this book months ago, and I finally picked it up to read over the holidays. I didn't know what to expect, but I couldn't put it down - it was intriguing. It was a real treat - Ali's clear writing is a beautiful foil for the complicated emotions that roil through people as they try to discover themselves and work through relationships. A big bonus was the setting for the book - Muslim India. I know people that have actively read books by/about Muslim women, and I had never sought one out. This book provided a window into the world behind the chador. All in all, it was inspiring and simply beautiful."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"Good first novel; I would have liked a little more detail on the wedding (when were they actually considered to be married? what was the significance of some of the customs?) and explaination of some of the terms used, and a little less repetition of some of the other details of Layla's past. I enjoyed learning about the culture and the Hindu/Muslim conflict. This would be an excellent choice for a book club as it supplies much to discuss."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"Ali has written a splendid first novel that is hard to put down. The writing is superb, and the themes explored are many, and fascinating. The author brings a new perspective to the question of arranged marriages, intercultural and intergenerational relations, and those age-old questions of love, and religion."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"Almost half the book was very slow. It begins with an endless description of a Hyderabadi Muslim wedding. The bride, Layla, is a young Muslim girl raised party in the U.S. and partly in Hyderabad. She agrees to an arranged marriage and lives under burkha while in Hyderabad. The book goes on to detail how she tries to blend in with her new husband and his orthodox family. The description of Old City culture and values was interesting and insightful. However, the latter part of the book turns tragic because of religious violence. The author makes Hindus out to be intolerant people who eye Muslims with hatred and suspicion. The only religious violence that is described is that perpetrated by Hindus against Muslims. The author describes this violence as happening at the time of the annual Ganesh festival, and so she asks \\"Where was he [Ganesh]?\\" when the violence against Muslims was being committed. Tens of millions of Muslims live in peace and prosperity on India because Hinduism is a religion that teaches its followers that every religion is a different path to the same God. We are not taught to hate or look down upon any other religion. I was angered and offended by this book. I should not have wasted my time on such a slow and insipid book."},{"Title":"Madras on Rainy Days : A Novel","review":"Ms.Ali's debut novel is a perfect example of how to write a soulless annoying novel based entirely on the perceptions that the western world prefers to hold of a 'backward' country and its customs and how reading books like these makes the civilised free world feel better about itself.For starters Ms.Ali's heroine is an exceptionally stupid, spineless woman, having been raised in the modern world, it is hard to imagine more idiotic courses of action than what this protagonist chooses.(...)Expect major support for this 'new literary voice' for 2 reasons: 1. Extremely photogenic face. 2. Exotic Indian Name & Lineage. What more do marketers need? Major money will go behind this one and needless to say the support of establish crossover asian women writers like Amy Tan & Bharti Mukherjee. If i see their names on one more blurb endorsing one more silly \\"Asian Women Writer\\", i promise mayhem.Save yourself from this disastrous novel.

Very enlightening about what life was like in the medieval village."},{"Title":"Life in a Medieval Village","review":"\\"Life in a Medieval Village\\" offers a tour through basic areas of academic interest relating to English medieval village life, particularly in the 1200s, including but by no means limited to farming methods, the manorial justice system, and the physical structure of houses. As a point of reference, it primarily focuses on one particular village--one that today is all but completely vanished, as is sadly the case with so much from the middle ages. Throughout the text, the authors offer aexamples translated from various types of records of the era, too, to illustrate their points. These add another dimension--a human dimension--to the broader historical details being offered. I learned new things reading this book. For instance, that there was often a single communal bakery in a village for the baking of bread. It is not an exuberant popular history, but there is a charm about this book and the authors' style. The authors clearly love learning about the middle ages and desire others to share in their enjoyment. That generosity of spirit and intent seeps through to the reader."},{"Title":"Life in a Medieval Village","review":"Frances and Joseph Gies do a wonderful job in this book covering the medieval village lifestyle.

Recommended.Life in a Medieval Village is one of a series, including Life in a Medieval City and Life in a Medieval Castle, written by Frances and Joseph Gies. This series rarely touches upon the great people and events romanticized by Hollywood and numerous fiction writers (and perhaps even a few historians), but focuses on the basics of everyday life for the average person or even the average lord or cleric. The Gies use a number of primary and secondary sources, the latter of which reveal how the historian's view of the medieval village has changed in the 20th and 21st centuries and how flexible historians must be in interpreting the evidence.Researched and written for the layperson, Life in a Medieval Village is more accurately about life in an English medieval village, with most of the detail coming from the records of Aethelintone/Aethelington/Adelintune/Aylington (Elton) in Huntingdon, one of Ramsey Abbey's manors. The Gies provide a history of the village concept and its definition; its role in the manorial system (contrasted to the seigneurial system); a description of its people, physical structure, buildings, administration and administrators, judicial system, family and spiritual life, and work; and the background behind its decline.The world of Elton and similar villages is not found in movies or novels. Social and economic statuses are not always clear cut, economic upward mobility is possible primarily through acquisition of land, and even the distinction between &quot;free&quot; and &quot;unfree&quot; is not distinct. Life revolves around the manor and the villeins' and cotters' obligations to the mostly absent lord and the manor, which come in the form of work, rents, fees, taxes, and fines. The administrative structure of the manor is somewhat like that of a modern corporation, with the lord as CEO of multiple manors (and primary consumer of goods) who &quot;wanted the certainty of rents and dues from his tenants, the efficient operation of his demesne, and good prices for wool and grain.&quot; His steward, or seneschal, serves as senior executive, while the bailiff, reeve, beadle, woodward, and others are the manor's day-to-day managers and supervisors.As the villagers acquire surnames (from where they live, what they do, the offices they hold, and personal characteristics), patterns emerge from the records. Some families become dominant economically and politically (e.g., holding many offices such as reeve or juror many times); others decline; while yet others show a propensity for violence and petty crimes. Such infractions are punished primarily with fines rather than corporal punishment; the stocks and hanging are resorted to only in the most egregious cases. The judicial system is often compassionate (or at least practical); many fines for minor trespasses are lowered or forgiven by the court because &quot;she is poor.&quot; When laws are broken, a jury hears the case, but the entire village decides.The Gies also provide an excellent overview of the passing of the medieval village, which began with a sustained famine and the Black Death. The labor-intensive manorial system simply could not survive the depletion of workers, the increase in expenses, the onerous taxes brought on by wars, and, perhaps more importantly, the sense of change and discontent that began to pervade the villein class.The challenge for the Gies as authors is to take the minimal material available (ranging from books about estate management written for lords and stewards to court and ecclesiastical records) and to bring the village to life from these records. What emerges are people who live in fragile houses; are rarely well fed from a nutritional perspective and whose food supply is always in doubt; work hard and are not above trying to wheedle out of work; who drink and fight and are sometimes brutal; fornicate (primarily a woman's crime but not a particularly reviled one); vandalize; commit petty crimes against the lord and their neighbors; and in short live lives of struggle every day without the expectation or vision of change in the future.The Gies focus on Elton, with supplemental material from other English villages, so the reader who is interested in village life on the continent will need to explore other works to flesh out the picture. Because the mostly illiterate villagers themselves left few personal records, it is up to the thoughtful reader to discern the village's character and personality and to conceive of what day-to-day life must have been, based on the little that is known-to put oneself into the worn shoes of the working villein and to imagine his or her thoughts, feelings, and aspirations. Life in a Medieval Village is a good beginning.Diane L. Schirf, 30 October 2003."},{"Title":"Life in a Medieval Village","review":"Renowned scholars of medieval history, the Gies credentials are impeccable. However, in this book, they seem to relish in providing piece after piece of redundant references, notes, and other bits of trivia to tirelessly pound the reader into submission as they seem determined to impress with their knowledge and research capabilities. If nothing else, the work provides the reader with a comprehensive bilbliography and reference list of places to go if they are that interested in life in a medieval village. The result of this style is a dry work that ofter reads like paragraph after paragraph of a census roll or register. It's dry, it's well researched, but it's dry. Oh, did I say that already?"},{"Title":"Life in a Medieval Village","review":"The Gies have made a career out of filling a niche in the medieval history market. Life in a Medieval Village gives a very detailed view of everyday medieval life to the casual reader. As a result, they walk a fine line. Some casual readers may find the text to be dry, and to lend too much detail to seemingly trivial matters, while specialist historians may find the work too general and superficial (not scholarly).I find their work to be engaging, and to provide a fairly good picture of the subject matter. In terms of medieval studies, it's useful to provide a general knowledge base prior to more detailed analysis.I recommend this book as well as their other works."},{"Title":"Life in a Medieval Village","review":"Years ago I checked this book out of the library. I bought a copy the day the book was returned to the library. I have used it so much for my research that it is now held together with tape and glue.

Thanks are due to these fine people for opening up the past to our modern eyes."},{"Title":"Life in a Medieval Village","review":"This book is so densely packed with miniscule details and examples that the information's significance becomes blurred, if not obsolete. The authors show they are very knowledgable on the subject, but they fail to analyze the information they present. The reader is left to interpret the meaning of details and ponder why they are included. The authors also use repetitive examples that become tiring and ineffective. The only minutely important information is presented in the topic sentences of each paragraph, and the book can be reasonably well understood just by reading the introductory sentences. While this book could be a treasure house for someone researching the relationship between manors and their respective villages, the average reader's attention is never captured. Students, beware! Before embarking on an excruciatingly dull explaination of medieval village life, reconsider your other options of reading material.

I felt, as a research tool, it was indispensible. However, It also was dry far more than neccesary and suffered from what I will call 'reader expectation'.'reader expectation' is, from my point of view, the success of a book by measure of ambition, but falling short of the mark by gauge of the reader. Allow me to clarify;LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL VILLAGE is a very well researched account of the breakdown of life in a subsistence agrarian collective. It backs up all statements and is, by all accounts, accurate in it's portrayal. Where it fails is two-fold: It is both a painfully accurate chronicle of the mundane life of the peasant, as well as a perhaps too specific in scope.I originally picked this up as an account of medieval life, and by technical standards, I got what I wanted. However, to any future readers let me iterate what others have said in this page; this is SPECIFICALLY life in the 1300's in England, and not a reference material for people wishing to know how life was for the many centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire. You will find this book very succinct in life and political breakdown in villages of 1300's England, but you will be left wanting as far as general Feudal life was for Europe as a whole. Which was what I wanted to know on a more general level.I guess you can chalk that up to reader expectation. It is by no means a bad book but I was hoping it would tell me more about life in all post Roman rule, not merely the administrative ledger-notes of clerks in the 1300's. Altho, if this is what you want to know about, add another star to my review. It's definitely THAT."},{"Title":"Life in a Medieval Village","review":"On the positive side, this book contains an enormous quantity of well-documented detail and scholarship. On the negative side, the writing is colorless and, to my eye, devoid of any unifying theme. Even someone seriously interested in the history of the period will find it soporific.

It was not just a small town; the nature of the agricultural and legal systems made it unique.Lots of material, and well worth reading, but occassionally dry and pedantic."},{"Title":"Life in a Medieval Village","review":"The Gieses have produced a number of good books for the general reader on aspects of medieval life. When I first came across this one years ago, I was excited to see a new general work by these authors on living conditions. I had loved both \\"Life in a Medieval City\\" and \\"Life in a Medieval Castle,\\" and was hoping that \\"Life in a Medieval Village\\" would complete the trilogy and help me round out the picture.What I found was that this new work simply didn't excite me. Part of that might have been because I had not known very much about medieval life when I came across the first two books in the early 1980s. Since then I had become a bit more conversant with scholarship on the Middle Ages. But it wasn't the scholarship that put me off. In truth, \\"Life in a Medieval Village\\" was actually written in a much more clearly scholarly way than the first two books had been. And yet the first books retained their interest for me, while this one was more of chore to get through. So why didn't I like it better?The answer, strangely enough, was that the openness of the scholarly enterprise actually made this book less vivid, less readable to me than the other two. \\"Life in a Medieval City\\" and \\"Life in a Medieval Castle\\" attempted to do just what their titles implied--bring to life a vanished culture in all its glory. \\"Life in a Medieval Village,\\" by contrast, is weighed down by its attempt to involve the reader in the intricacies of the historical enterprise itself. The authors spend a great deal of time, for instance, trying to explain the difficulties of even defining what a village might have been. The reader is plunged into the world of scholarly uncertainty, into the discussion of what we can or cannot conclude from archaeology, parish records, etc. Only after this introduction do the two authors guide the reader back to the shallows--the narratives of exactly what villagers did with their daily lives, which is where most readers wanted to be in the first place.Now I am aware that many conscientious historians wish to offer qualifications for their conclusions, lest in their writing they lead readers astray. While this kind of source-paranoia serves an academic community well, however, it does not work the same way for a general readership. Too honest a discussion of source material and uncertainty undercuts the historical narrative which is the source of the real pleasure in reading history. The readers will recognize the historical problems the writers present, but they can no longer be pleased.It sounds as if I'm suggesting that pleasure and honesty are mutually exclusive when it comes to history. That's not what I mean to imply. Someone can read a historical narrative, take pleasure in it, and then decide to look into that narrative a little more carefully to see if there is anything that could have or should have been done a little differently. In adopting the procedural-sharing style of writing they do in \\"Life in a Medieval Village,\\" the Gieses force the readers to confront the historical problems they have faced themselves, whether the readers want to do so or not. In so doing, I believe, they disempower their own writing and lose many of their readers.That's my reservation about this work, and why I've only given it three stars rather than four. It's not that there is anything wrong with the work (although I agree with the historical qualifications provided by all of the other reviewers on this site). It's that it just isn't exciting.If you've read other work by the Gieses, I'd say this is a worthy addition and will probably help to paint a broader picture of medieval life. But if this is your first time, and you haven't read a lot of medieval history, then I suggest buying \\"Life in a Medieval City\\" and \\"Life in a Medieval Castle\\" first. Those will get you excited about medieval history. This will not."},{"Title":"Life in a Medieval Village","review":"A fascinating book of all sorts of interesting information of this period from work routines and marketing to medicine with it's bizarre remedies and treatments.

In this well illustrated story, Ms. Hurst recounts the story of her father, a rockhound who was dissuaded from making a career of his first love. We follow him through his life from successful gas station owner to family man struggling to make ends meet during the Depression, all the while lovingly collecting, cataloguing, and caring for an ever expanding rock and mineral collection. The payoff comes when her dad gets a job at the local science museum after the director notices his interest in minerals and then views his personal collection. The father goes on to become the curator of the museum's mineral collection. James Stevenson's illustrations perfectly compliment this story of a triumphant amateur. Children's books with true stories like this one usually have a summary page after the end of the story to give details left out of the main book. Unfortunately, details like the father being sent to college by the director and his eventual rise to director of the museum are left for the dust jacket, a part of a children's book that is often lost.

He displayed his large rock collection at the station where he worked. Many people came to talk, look at the rocks, and play chess with the father. Then the Great Depression started and the father had one job a day. He still found time to go to the museum and look at rocks. The museum manager noticed him and she gave him a job as a janitor there. Then he was found switching the rock labels because he knew they were wrong. After this happened he was moved up to museum currator. I like this book because to me, it is about following your dreams."},{"Title":"Rocks in His Head","review":"&quot;Some people collect stamps. Some people collect coins or dolls or bottle caps. When he was a boy, my father collected rocks. When he wasn't doing chores at home or learning at school, he'd walk along stone walls and around old quarries, looking for rocks. People said he had rocks in his pockets and rocks in his head. He didn't mind. It was usually true.&quot; So begins Carol Otis Hurst's inspiring biography of her father and his lifelong passion for rocks and minerals. In simple and gentle prose, we follow the story of his life, how he grew up and married, opened a successful filling station, lost his business during the depression, and finally while looking for odd jobs and work met Grace Johnson, the Director of the Science Museum. Ms Johnson was so impressed with his knowledge, dedication, and love of rocks that she to gave him a steady job as night janitor at the museum so that he could work around rocks, and that as they say, was just the beginning..... Ms Hurst's fascinating story is beautifully enhanced by James Stevenson's spare and touching pen and ink illustrations, done in quiet earth tones, that really capture the life and times of this very endearing man. With an afterword to complete her uplifting story on the jacket flap, Rocks In His Head is an engaging and nostalgic little treasure that's perfect for youngsters 5-9, and is told with great insight and affection. Never be afraid to follow your dream!"},{"Title":"Rocks in His Head","review":"I was priviledged to meet the author and take a workshop given by her. She was and is a great story-teller! I read this book to my second graders and they loved it. It tells how her father followed his love of rocks and minerals into his dream occupation: curator at a museum. It was a long, slow road, but he always had a rock in his pocket and a story to tell about it. My students repeated the line: \\"Take a look at this one...\\" each time it was read. I combined it with Gail Gibbons' book Dragonflies, Diamonds and Dinosaurs, which is about a Natural History Museum. We followed up with a nonfiction book about rocks and minerals. It was a series that held high interest for my students and me."},{"Title":"Rocks in His Head","review":"This book tells the life story of the narrator's father, a self-educated man who managed to become museum curator due to his passion for rocks. When the narrator's father was a young boy, he collected rocks everywhere he went. When he grew up, he ran a gas station and kept his rocks on shelves for customers to look at. The gas station went under during the Depression. After hunting around, the man eventually stumbled into a job as a night janitor at the Museum of Science. He was quite happy with this job because he got to polish the rocks in the exhibits. Eventually he was even promoted to the position of curator of the museum because of his expertise with the rocks, even though he lacked a college education. The story is quite appealing for older kids. With 1250 words, it may be a bit long for the young ones."},{"Title":"Rocks in His Head","review":"This picture book tells the true story of the author's father, who collected rocks and dreamed of working with them in some way. Instead, he married, raised a family, and ran a gas station -- all the while collecting rocks, labeling them, and showing them to anybody who asked about them. Then came the Great Depression and Hurst's father, like millions of other people, was out of a job. When he wasn't looking for work, he spent time in a nearby museum, looking at the rock collection. This turned out to be his lucky break: you'll have to read the story to find out the results of the lucky break. The illustrations, by James Stevenson, bring an uncommon common man to life.

It's very sweet and nostalgic.I will say that it's probably better suited for the older end of the 4-8 range.

Typically it's outdoor items, like rocks or particular sticks. I am not always sure why one item is special to him or not, but it seems to center him in a way that this book talks about. No one understands why this boy, then man, collects something seemingly so trivial as rocks. It begins at a young age, and many people around him make comments about how he has \\"rocks in his head\\" which although could be taken the wrong way, in this particular instance seems to simply be written as \\"He has a strong interest in rocks.\\" As time goes on and the depression hits the country, he continues on with his collection, keeping a special place for specific rocks in his attic. One day, while looking for work as a grown man, he happens upon a museum curator. Friendships are quickly made and after many year, the author notes that he actually becomes that curator! Fantastic inspiration for those of us who have people in our lives who seem focused on something that is special to THEM, even if we don't share that same passion, we can certainly understand the happiness and joy it brings to them."},{"Title":"Rocks in His Head","review":"Nice illustraitions.

Andy Lipschultz, an entertainment journalist, has produced another the-making-of a movie book that delivers the goods for those who relish thebehind-the-scenes details involved in any Hollywood creation. Here creation is definitely the operative word, for Universal Studios' 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' entailed the daunting task of bringing to life the uniquely imaginative vision of Dr. Seuss, beloved writer/illustrator of picture books for children and the young at heart of all ages. The book includes interviews with the key persons involved in the Grinch live-action feature film project, from director Ron Howard, to star Jim Carrey, to make-up designer Rick Baker, to production designer Michael Corenblith, to costume designer Rita Ryack, to provide those juicy details that backstage buffs crave. If the text at times is a bit sparse, this is more than compensated for by the profuse, gorgeous, full-color photos (and frequently production sketches) that adorn every page of this large-format, glossy trade paperback. Lipschultz documents the process by which a team of talented folks collaborate to bring an invented world to life for the cinema screen, for the Grinch project in particular embodies an effort of near unprecedented scale. Dr. Seuss' world of Whoville and its not-quite-human inhabitants (and their heroic efforts to save their beloved Christmas holiday from the selfishness of the mean green one), had to be built and dressed from scratch and this challenging task is revealed in fascinating detail. Make-up magic involved the evolution of Jim Carrey's Grinch face which took over 3 hours to apply with its 3 custom-made facial appliances and yellow contact lenses not to mention some 200-odd Whoville residents all of whom required make-up, wigs and distinct costumes of their own. Whoville, a quintessentially Seussian world with no straight lines or right angles, was an architectural challenge that required special engineering consultations and the expertise or authorities on Antoni Gaudi, the world-famous architect who inspired Dr. Seuss to begin with. To flesh out the simple, yet timeless and appealing story of 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' to full-length feature format required the dramatic license of scriptwriters whose solutions (approved by Audrey Geisel, widow of the 'source of all'), included adding newly invented characters and to portray them there had to be recruited a cast of talented, dedicated actors willing to endure cosmetic applications nearly as complex as Jim Carrey's. Then the wildly inventive sets all had to be specially lit, photographed,and enhanced by CGI special effects, but the devil of believability is in the details---thus, all the props were custom-crafted and employed along with 600 miles of Styrofoam, 50,000 Christmas lights, 8,000 ornaments, tons of artificial snow, and thousands of candy canes and other seasonal objects.Through all this production minutiae, Lipschultz makes one thing abundantly clear---all the producers, cast members and crew signed on to the the 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' project out of love of the Dr. Seuss books on which they all grew up and they poured their enthusiasm and creativity into attempting to be as true to the spirit of their source of inspiration as they could be. They did this in the hopes that their efforts would communicate the original, ingenious and magical invention of this giant of juvenilia in a movie that would 'steal Hollywood' and engender box office magic! Judging from the profusion of sketches, photos and never-before-seen scenes contained in this document of the production process, 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' looks exceedingly promising and tantalizing (as though their goal has been achieved), thus 'How the Grinch Stole Hollywood' may indeed be prophetic and not be yet another artifact of filmic folly."},{"Title":"How the Grinch Stole Hollywood: The Making of the Movie","review":"to go along with a great movie. i love all the behind the scences stuff... so cool!!"},{"Title":"How the Grinch Stole Hollywood: The Making of the Movie","review":"If you are preparing for your appearance on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, this is the book to fill your mind with production trivia about the movie. The main appeal of this book comes from a description of how the artistic decisions were made about make-up, sets, costumes, and props. The photographs are often reproduced out of focus, in sizes so small you cannot see the details, or with too much ink to accurately portray the original. The potential is mostly missed in the book to get lots of insights into the outstanding work of Jim Carrey and Ron Howard in making the movie.The book focuses successfully on Jim Carrey's makeup, as developed by Rick Baker. As you will read many times in the book, it took three hours to apply and a half hour to remove daily. Each of the 80 wearings required a different mask be prepared. Jim Carrey presuaded director Ron Howard to wear the makeup himself one day, sans the yellow contact lenses over the whole eye. Mr. Howard reported being &quot;highly uncomfortable&quot; by the end of the day.The artistic issue on the makeup was how to make Carrey look like the Grinch, yet allow him the facial and body mobility required to act like Jim Carrey. Reviews of the movie differ on how well this was accomplished with regard to Carrey's facial expressions. You can decide for yourself from the movie and the book how well this was accomplished.With so many actors needing so much makeup (many of whom were children), there was also the challenge of how to get it all on in time for some daily shooting. Also, what does a Who look like? The decision was made to make Whos more human than in the story in order better to attract the sympathies of the audience.The sets designed by Michael Corenblith were a compromise as well. It was felt that matching the drawings in Dr. Seuss's work would make the movie look like a cheap local theatrical production. So the designs come from a number of Seuss books to make a little World's Fair, emphasizing Gaudi-like designs. Designs were drawn from many standard sources including Gaudi's Barcelona work, Carlsbad Caverns, and even the winding stairway in New York's Guggenheim Museum by Frank Lloyd Wright.Props were built (as were the sets) with the rule that there would be no straight lines (not even for a pencil). In many cases, old items from the 30s and 40s bought at flea markets provided components. No materials from after 1957 were used.Costume designer Rita Ryack produced 400 outfits (including 200 hats) in less than 9 months. How's that for keeping busy?Cirque de Soleil stunt people were used for the unusual acrobatic sequences.Special effects were explained mostly by showing how blue screens were used.Everyone who worked on the project seems to have been in awe of Dr. Seuss's work, and dedicated to creating something special. In doing so, they clearly developed and expanded the story and everything else well beyond the original. Purists will say they went too far. Those who don't know the original will probably like it well enough.Those who know film making will learn relatively little from the book. The trivia buffs will have a field day.After you have finished enjoying the book, I suggest that you sit back and think about how you would like to have something you have worked on reproduced by others. How would you ensure that the results matched your desires? How would you grant them the freedom to improve on what you had done? How would you want the results to be judged?Remember the real spirit of Christmas, always . . . even when in Hollywood!"},{"Title":"How the Grinch Stole Hollywood: The Making of the Movie","review":"I recently finished reading this book, and really enjoyed it.

Most books about the South tend to focus on the more populous states. And most cover the Civil War or the Civil Rights eras.The author was a poet by profession, a fact that carries two consequences.First, his prose is lucid. He has an eye for just the right detail. He captures the character of Tennessee's inhabitants. The strongest part, from a literary perspective, is the description of the landscape. The river, the valley, and the surrounding mountains must have been a wonder to behold before they were &quot;tamed&quot; by the Tennessee Valley Authority. (The story of the TVA, one of the marvels of Depression-era civil engineering, fills volume 2.)Second, Davidson does not obey the conventions of professional historians. Since there is very little archeological or documentary evidence dating back to the 17th century in Tennessee, the author collected oral traditions to fill the gaps. He interviewed the descendants of the early settlers and culled what evidence he could muster from local historical societies. Had Davidson relied exclusively on parchments and soil samples, this book might have been another dry read about pioneers and their misdeeds. Instead, he produced an engaging story about some extraordinarily courageous people, people who deserve our garded admiration.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Vivisections from the blown mind (Plays in process)","review":"This is the story...of a lovely lady! This book was the bane of every school child in Ireland for decades. It used to be on the curriculum so that, despite the fact that you would have to grit your teeth to read it, it was a bestseller in Ireland. It tells the story of Peig Sayers, a woman who lived in the poor and rural south-west of Ireland in the early 20th century. In this book, everyone was poor, no-one had anything, people were evicted from their hovels, life was hard, people died young, children were barefoot, the livestock slept in the house, it was always raining....well, you get the idea.Peig was born on the mainland of Ireland, but married a fisherman who lived on the Blasket islands, a small collection of islands a few miles off the coast of Kerry. Tough as things were on the mainland, things were tougher still here! You were lashed by the Atlantic, the wind could blow you off the cliffs, and you could be drowned while you were fishing, and that was on a good day! The book tells of her struggle to be accepted by the islanders, how she brought up her large family, how she coped with the death of some of her sons fishing, and the folklore, stories, and culture all around her.This book, and others like it from other authors on other islands (&quot;The Islander&quot; being another good example) formed a literary style which became known as &quot;the poor mouth&quot;. They all share similar characteristics as they described the oppresive hardships suffered stoically by the people. Even now in Ireland, anyone whinging about their bad situation would be dismissed as &quot;putting on the poor mouth&quot; and everyone would know what was meant. There is even a spoof &quot;poor mouth&quot; book by Flann O'Brien, which is well worth reading as an antidote to all the hardship and depression!Now that Peig is no longer force fed down poor school children's throats, it has been re-appraised as a valuable historical record of western Irish culture, and no longer as an instrument of torture. Now that you don't HAVE to read it, more people now seem to WANT to read it! The book was originally written in the Irish language since that was the only language Peig spoke, but a translation in English is available.If you want a glimpse of an Ireland now long gone (and it really is long gone, despite what anyone might tell you), you can't go wrong with Peig.

You were lashed by the Atlantic, the wind could blow you off the cliffs, and you could be drowned while you were fishing, and that was on a good day! The book tells of her struggle to be accepted by the islanders, how she brought up her large family, how she coped with the death of some of her sons fishing, and the folklore, stories, and culture all around her.This book, and others like it from other authors on other islands (&quot;The Islander&quot; being another good example) formed a literary style which became known as &quot;the poor mouth&quot;. They all share similar characteristics as they described the oppresive hardships suffered stoically by the people. Even now in Ireland, anyone whinging about their bad situation would be dismissed as &quot;putting on the poor mouth&quot; and everyone would know what was meant. There is even a spoof &quot;poor mouth&quot; book by Flann O'Brien, which is well worth reading as an antidote to all the hardship and depression!Now that Peig is no longer force fed down poor school children's throats, it has been re-appraised as a valuable historical record of western Irish culture, and no longer as an instrument of torture. Now that you don't HAVE to read it, more people now seem to WANT to read it! The book was originally written in the Irish language since that was the only language Peig spoke, but a translation in English is available.If you want a glimpse of an Ireland now long gone (and it really is long gone, despite what anyone might tell you), you can't go wrong with Peig. Just make sure you have a good supply of prozac close to hand."},{"Title":"Vivisections from the blown mind (Plays in process)","review":"In 45 years, I'd never seen this book in my dad's library, but on the night my mother died - I went in there and pulled it from the shelf and started to read through the tears.I've not too long myself on this bench - figuratively speaking, of course, I hope."},{"Title":"Vivisections from the blown mind (Plays in process)","review":"I'm with Micheal - had to wade through it at school in Irish.

The structuring of the story is Absolutely Atrocious. Hardy also babbles on and on & ON about characters that have utterly nil to do with the book but amazingly enough, he never bothers to develop the 2 sole MAIN characters. They are just talking heads. Read this book only if you want to witness how BAD bad writing gets. There is not one subplot. There is not any physical description of consequential people or places. There are no secondary characters. Scenes do not naturally unfold, they \\"start\\" in the middle of an event and are rushed with a lot of summarized exposition to an unclimaxed ending. Mitchell apparently has NO life other than his gymnastic courses; JEH does not take the fantastic opportunity to explore the struggles with being a gay teenager or being just a teenager PERIOD. Mitchell has no schoolwork, bullies, physical awkwardness, depression, or rebellious urges that are so prevalent during the high school years.

The other \\"Bible\\" is I'm OK -- You're OK by Thomas A. Harris, M.D.Before reading Games People Play, it is a good idea to read I'm OK - You're OK. There are two reasons why. First, I'm OK is a general introduction to Transactional Analysis whereas Games People Play deals with a narrow aspect of the subject. Second, I'm OK is written in an easier style than the present book. In fact, if I hadn't already studied I'M OK, I might not have understood Games People Play.The author of Games People Play was the founder of the TA school. The author of the other book was his follower. Transactional Analysis was popular during the 1960s and 1970s. Since then, it has lost some of that popularity in America, although it still seems to be going strong in Australia. The society founded by Dr. Berne still exists in this country, today.Before investing in a copy of the book, you might want to check Wikipedia which has an excellent article about Tranactional Analysis. Games, the subject of this book, are special behaviors that people use to accomplish ulterior designs. For example, the game called \\"If it Weren't for You I'd....\\" helps people feel better about NOT doing things they are really afraid to do.I believe this book and the school of Transactional Analysis are worthwhile for everyone who wants to understand human nature."},{"Title":"Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships","review":"Eric Berne, a psychiatrist from Sacramento, CA, wrote this at the height of the humanist movement in psychiatry.

The audio quality, reader, etc. is good. The audio chapters match the book's chapters so navigation within 10-15 minutes is difficult. The biggest problem is that the book depends on graphs and illustrations and often refers to them in the text. There are frequent, \\"As you can see from the chart...\\", \\"Notice this pattern's similarity to the last...\\", etc. Just not a good book for translation to audio."},{"Title":"Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships","review":"This book is what it sounds like from the title, with one exception...it's very technical. It seems to have the target audience of psychologists, and maybe it does. But with such a playful title, I was hoping it would read more conversationally. I read in another review that if you skip right to the games (chapter 5), it's most interesting, then you can go back to the beginning to see how they work if you want. I hate skipping initial chapters--I'd feel like I'd miss something. But I believe he was right. I read through those chapters and they were a bit of a bore--like definitions and a glossary. Had I just skipped those chapters, I would have been able to judge from how it was labeling the sections of the games what the words were referring to. Some games are more interesting than others or make more sense. They all seem to be expressive of plots we see on tv and things we hear of people doing all the time, and this book gives explanations of why people do these things and what the proper response would be to get them to stop--plus the consequences. I do wish it was written less like a text book though. I'm an educated person--I have my master's degree, but didn't major in psychology. I don't mind big vocabulary, but I think the sentence structure and organization could have been much improved to better engage the readers.

BERNE WHERE EVER YOU ARE."},{"Title":"Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships","review":"First off, this book isn't written for the casual layman, even though its information can be critical in how you understand the people around you -- those close and those cursory. But that's not to say it's a dense academic book, far from it; Berne hopes/expects that you have some understanding of sociology and psychology as he jumps in to fascinating discussions about certain human behaviors (particularly interpersonal relationship behavior) that is primarily utilized to construct walls and is rooted in the fear of being intimate (not necessarily sexually intimate, but genuinely honest about what you're thinking and feeling and expressing to & about your life and others that you interact with).The various \\"game\\" titles/descriptors that Berne uses are a little dated, but they still are very apropos and describe the essence of the so-called aberrant behavior in a wide variety of social settings - from the mundane (an acquaintance you know from the lobby at work) to the highly complex (the behavior of sexual partners who are past the early stages of the relationship).Reading the actual entries and their examples takes a bit of getting used to, as the jargon is very specific and precise to the established \\"rules of the game\\" that Berne presents in the revelatory introduction and opening chapters.After reading the first half dozen entries, I was quickly attuned to the behavior of lovers (current and past), friends, family and acquaintances currently and/or in the past that was confusing, frustrating or confounding; that was eye opening and gave me greater understanding to why certain relationship are the way they are.After continued reading (and it's helpful to read each chapter more than once to get the most benefit), it became an interesting exercise to pinpoint and categorize peoples behavior or combinations of behaviors, and think about the origins and/or continued causes of said behavior.Not that this are the end-all/be-all diagnosis of why people play certain games, but it does provide a groundwork for understanding, but, ultimately, this book is uniquely indispensable in providing an understanding human psychology, character (for writers & directors) and the behavior that stems from that."},{"Title":"Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships","review":"Boy oh boy! If you are a \\"liberated\\" man or woman, this book (audio) will remind you, in a hurry, what the femenist movement was fighting.

This book covers both the love games and the interpersonal games. Dr. Berne says \\"People tend to live their lives by consistently playing out certain \\"games\\" in their interpersonal relationships. They are desirable and necessary.\\"There is a 'historical' significance of games, also a 'cultural' ones. The intimate games include those women with large proportions (similar to Dolly Parton) who will sit with their hands behind their heads so as to thrust forward her best features, to draw attention by remarking on their size, like Dolly; and squirming around in front of males to show that they are available. Usually a lascivious mother uses provocativeness to get noticed. Note this, J. N., that is the provocative use I knew when you called me provocative, and I was scandalized, as I had never in my life been that way!\\"Schlemiel\\" is a game to be forgiven for non-existentent sins. Adults play this game in polite, grown-up social circles to obtain forgiveness, the chief goal of the game. \\"Anti-Schlemiel\\" shows the objective opposite by creating an enemy. Whatever, you say to this kind of close-minded person, the worse thing is \\"I'm sorry,\\" because he will not accept it and turn the tables on you by insults and worse. He is the type who never says \\"Im sorry.\\"In marriage, one of the 'bad' games is \\"If It Weren't For You\\" because you are blaming the other person (the one you agreed to love through thick and thin) of causing you to act as you did. No one can cause us to be uncivil; we can react to their bad behavior 'in kind' and that is not acceptable, either. If you ignore their slurs, then they accuse you of 'passive resistance.' Another 'bad' one is \\"Look How Hard I've Tried\\" usually by the male making the woman feel guilty for something she did not do. That, my friends, is called the game of love. It's not about sex; it's about power. Who is the most dominant partner? It used to be the man, but now the tables are turned and the young women rule the household and their husbands like no other time in existence. Why, I wasn't allowed to be that kind of wife! And it hurts to see my daughter-in-laws do it.\\"See What You've Done Now\\" and \\"See What You Made Me Do\\" are childish games but played on a continuous basis by ignorant adults, usually paranoids (he says). In the underground slang, \\"patsy{ meant all right or satisfactory; later, it was changed to \\"pigeon' like 'stool pigeon, not homing pigeon.'When you end up at the psychiatrist's office, you've played all the wrong games, those which led you into difficulties. We all sometimes work our way into a corner, but it is possible to jump out. Good games are those party games like 'Charades' in which you act out something in front of an audience and they guess the letter you are wanting until you decipher the word. I have played that game exactly one time, and pretty good at it, was the only one who knew the woman was acting out a book title, THE NAKED APE, and it embarrassed me. I just blurted it out without being socially polite.Dr. Berne has written WHO DO YOU DAY AFTER HELLO?

Admittedly, Wallace is good to have on the shelf, but this book is what I carry to class and actually use on a regular basis.At the beginning of each section, this book provides references to the larger works by Robertson and Moulton. Although not necessary, it is very beneficial to read those references as directed, especially those in Robertson. This book is supposed to come with a chart of verb conjugations in the back, but if it is missing (as it was in mine), there is an identical chart in the back of Essentials of New Testament Greek by Ray Summers.In my opinion, this grammar should be the standard for any student of the New Testament; it really is that good.

I really appreciate the fact that i could find something so affordable and quick. Thank You!! :)"},{"Title":"A Manual Grammar of the Greek New Testament","review":"This is the textbook I used in studying intermediate Greek at Denver Seminary. And it is a very helpful volume. The purpose of this book is not to teach how to parse Greek words. That would be an introductory volume to Greek. What this volume does is to detail different usages of the varying Greek grammatical forms.So, for instance, this volume outlines the various uses of the Greek present tense. The regular uses are the progressive present, the customary present, and the iterative present. The book then presents \\"special uses\\" of the present tense, namely, the aoristic present, the futuristic present, the historical present, and the tendential present.The book explains in detail how each of these uses function. Such information is imperative to understand when translating the New Testament. In fact, I relied heavily on this volume when I was working on myAnalytical-Literal Translation of the New Testament: Third Edition(ALT).I followed many of this book's suggestions in my translation work, so the information in this book helped me to bring out finer details of the Greek text that are often missed in Bible translations. So, for instance, this book states, \\"A prohibition in the present imperative demands that action then in progress be stopped.... Thus a prohibition expressed with the present tense demands the cessation of some act that is already in progress\\" (pp. 301).Utilizing this information, I consistently translated the prohibitive, present imperative using the form \\"Stop ...\\" (e.g., Matt 6:16, \\"And when you* are fasting, stop becoming gloomy like the hypocrites\\").However, there is so much information in this book that sometimes it can be difficult to keep it all straight. So when I began working on the ALT, I typed out initially just for myself, a summary of the various grammatical points and suggested renderings given in this book and various other Greek grammars. That summary proved invaluable as I worked on the ALT, so later I expanded it and included it as an extensive \\"Grammatical Renderings \\" section in my bookCompanion Volume to the Analytical-Literal Translation: Third Edition.So yes, get this volume if you want to understand the various uses of Greek grammatical forms. But to help keep it all straight, check out my \\"Companion Volume\\" as well.

For a savings of $105, I can live with it.If you are new to Koine Greek and can find a good deal on this book, get it. It's deep, that's true, but worth the study."},{"Title":"A Manual Grammar of the Greek New Testament","review":"Dana and Mantey know little about Greek grammar.

Mr Hall, the Public Affairs Officer for the 4th Fighter Group, did an outstanding job of capturing life of the U.S. fighter pilot's during WWII.

It is certainly one of THE finest military aviation books ever written.It differs from other books covering WWII fighter pilots in that it concentrates more on the pilots themselves, rather than their planes and campaigns. It is a much more personnel narrative, yet has some of the most entertaining and exciting tales of aerial warfare ever put on paper.If you can somehow find a copy of this book, I cannot recommend it more highly."},{"Title":"1,000 Destroyed: The Life & Times of the 4th Fighter Group","review":"This is perhaps the finest book ever written on WWII fighter aviation - at least for the ETO.Not only does it have vivid accounts of air combat over Europe, but it also introduces one to some of the greatest American pilots (and colorful characters) of WWII - especially the 4th's primary leader, Col.

I just could not imagine a love story where the heroine is first married to the father of the hero. Being a Sandra Brown fan, and I buy all of Sandra Brown's releases, I went ahead and bought it. I must say I was not disappointed. The plot turned out to be very good, and kept me interested. The book was also a double treat of romance, with not only Rink and Caroline, the main couple, but with Steve and Laura Jane (Rink's sister). I fell in love with this couple just as much as Rink and Caroline! I would most definitely recommend &quot;Bittersweet Rain&quot;. It was a quick and very sweet read!"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"the joy of falling in love for the first time is something you will remember for all of your life. of course the first time you feel your heart break, you'll always remember that too. this is probably the best book ive read dealing with both of those issues. sandra brown has the ability to bring the same sort of excitement to the reader that the characters are going thru as well as the let down. in bittersweet, we have two different love stories going on. the first dating back to childhood between caroline, the daughter of the town drunk, and rink, the son of the towns most wealthy family. the second, between laura jane, rinks sister, and steve, the hired hand. sparks fly between rink and caroline, mostly because of rinks dad, carolines HUSBAND! laura jane and steve are absolutely wonderful. i didnt want this book to end. ive read reviews where people say things like &quot;they felt like friends that i had to say goodbye to when the book was over&quot; but until this book, ive never really understood what that was like. this one is a keeper ::smile"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I've read almost all of Sandra Brown's novels, and this one didn't disappoint me at all.

It kept me reading until I found out what kept them together, then the startling truth that kept them together."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"SANDRA BROWN'S BITTERSWEET RAIN takes a more convoluted twist to the plot when the couple in the book, Caroline and Rink are wedged apart by Rink's father, Roscoe with his scathing treachery.However, readers may find it hard to digest the plot of a stepmother in unrequited love with her son.The stunning revelation of Roscoe's plan to ruin his son upon his deathbed remains a shadow over Caroline's undying love for Rink. Despite their strong attraction, Rink cannot cast off the fact that Caroline belonged to Roscoe once.Fortunately, SANDRA BROWN handles the twisted plot with unexpected maturity in her perspective. Caroline and Rink are fuelled by desires but at the same time they tried to fend off the attraction for the relationship is bound to explode in a conservative town still in awe of Roscoe. To fight off the shadow, Rink has to confront himself their bond is too strong such that Roscoe has never once taken his beloved away.Right till the last moment when Caroline fainted at award ceremony dedicated to Roscoe because of pregnancy, readers are gripped by the powerful emotions spun by Ms. Brown. It is savagely tender and their love no less bittersweet. She transforms an unconventional tale into one of simplicity and poignancy with her rousing narrative.For this, BITTERSWEET RAIN is one romance that will wring heartfelt tears for Caroline and Rink, and incessant accolades for this beautiful writer constantly producing textured materials."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"Once I started the book, I couldn't put it down. I wanted to sream with frustration at the characters pig-headedness, yet I could understand their logic. The bickering between them is sweet yet very sexual and sassy. This isn't one of Sandra Brown's finest but it is very intriguing."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I've read more recent books by Sandra Brown and really liked them, so I thought I'd give this one a shot. Should have known better. First off, reading the scenes where the heroine, Caroline, is 15, made me feel like a pedophile. And we're supposed to think that some 22-year old guy who takes advantage of an obviously naive 15-year old is a good guy? Just because he oh-so-nobly decides to wait to have sex with her until he tells his dad about her, that makes it OK?Next, how you can you have any sympathy or respect for a romantic heroine who flat out admits that she married a nasty, horrible man for wealth and status? She had a job, she was supporting herself fine. It's not like she was living on the streets and that was her only way out. Chalk up two in the ick factor.Finally, while it was much better handled than the rest of the story, the subplot involving a developmentally disabled girl and a much older Vietnam vet bothered me, probably because Brown was never consistent or detailed in explaining what the developmental disability was. And the descriptions of her actions were inconsistent as to her capabilities. The net result is, it feels a little creepy. And even though she does try to make it sweet, the first time the vet kisses her, he's feeling her up. Which again, makes it feel like she's taken advantage of.All in all, while I still really like Sandra Brown, I'm sticking to her books that were written in the last decade.I would also caution anyone against buying this on a Kindle, as the spelling and punctuation is awful, so that you have to go back and reread whole paragraphs just to figure out what it's supposed to say."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"This is the first of Sandra brown's books I've ever read but will not be the last! Not only an author but an artist! She made the characters come to life for me and I could visualize in my mind's eye what they all looked like and even the looks they gave each other! It made me long to be at The Retreat, I can't wait to get another of her books. I hope it's just as good because I'm not sure it can be better!"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"If you don't mind relationships where the surviving spouse takes up with a family member or friend of the dead spouse, then you might like this book. But if you're like me, you won't. However, even without my convictions, this book was still pretty sorry. First off, it's slow. Second, the leading lady, who by the way was the main reason I disliked this book so much. (However, judging by the other reviews, I'm in the minority)It might not have been so bad if we weren't made to believe that Rink, the son of the man Caroline married, was the real love of her life, yet she married the father anyway for money, status, and a stupid house. What kind of woman does that? Not one that I could like. The Retreat? PLEASE!!! Give me a break. She must not have loved Rink too much. What made me the maddest about her was her response to the reading of the will. She tells Rink \\"her true love\\" to contest the will in which his father left him nothing, but left his mothers house (The Retreat) to her, his stupid wife. I just could not believe it. I would have said, contest it huh, why don't you just give it back to me you tramp. She was just selfish, stupid, of weak moral character, and she was always putting her nose where it didn't belong. SB tried to redeem her in the end, but it was too late as far as I was concerned. Anyway, bottom line, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"What would you do if the person you hated most in the world took everything from you, including your mother and the love of your life? And still he was not satisfied.On his deathbed, Roscoe Lancaster requests that his long absent son come home so that he can see him one last time. His wife complies and the prodigal son is summoned. Of course not on is Rink her stepson, he is also her first (and only) love. Of course Roscoe's motivations for a reunion are not all out of compassion for the son he lost; it is just one more chance to one up him by flaunting his relationship with wife Caroline in Rink's face. Roscoe was the main antagonist who drove the two apart when they were engaging in an elicit relationship (Caroline was 15; Rink was 22 - kinda icky).Rink cannot help himself and his still intense feelings for Caroline. A stolen kiss here; a grope there. But underlying in his thoughts is that his father made love to her first. Can Rink ever get over his pride and declare his love for Caroline?\\"Bittersweet Rain\\" is a melodramatic love story set against the machinations of a truly evil and desperate man, who loves no one, least of all himself. His contempt for the less than perfect daughter (who loves him unconditionally) makes you want to punch him. There is a lot of chemistry between the two leads; but clunky, dated love scenes (his \\"maleness\\"; her \\"feminine core\\"). One of the most endearing qualities of the book is the emerging relationship between Rink's sister Laura Jane, and the disabled ranch hand, Steve.Though a little dated (it was originally written in 1984; re-released in 2000), it was an enjoyable and romantic romp."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"Only Sandra Brown will put together the most unexpected couple, step mom &amp; step son. But the story was so beautifully woven that I don't mind at all the weirdness of the situation. Although Caroline was married to Rink's father, she had been Rink's lover even before she got acquainted with Roscoe. Only years after Rink left her to marry somebody else, did she chose the father. For those who are familiar with SB's other books, the relationship between Caroline and Rink resembles Schyler &amp; Cash in &quot;Slow Heat in Heaven&quot;; the secondary characters, Mary Jane and Steve are Janellen &amp; Bowie in &quot;Where There's Smoke&quot; only for Mary Jane and Steve, SB went deeper with their love story. Quite a treat for the readers. Two romances in one book - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I loved this story!! It is romantic and heart wrenching at the same time.

In this book, Rink first knew caroline when she was of tender age of fifteen. they fell in love but because of some circumstances they were kept apart.Without any explanation from Rink for his running away Caroline found it hard to wait for him forever and took the chance of having respect and money that she always craved for by marrying a rich but older man. Well till now it isn't so bad, is it? But as it happened that older man was Rink's father and Caroline knew it. Now how is that for feeling antipathy for a woman who married the father of the man she loved? And i don't really blame Rink for being angry with her again and again for what she had done.Caroline wasn't a saint and i don't think any person in her shoes can afford to be anyway. Who knows what i would do if i happened to be in her place? So i wouldn't judge her and would advice other readers to not judge her too.Both the times Rink came in contact with Caroline she was forbidden for him. That part of this romance was best. Their summer romance so many years back was very sweet. Rink's conscience and desire were in fight with each other. i like this in a romance and i like the build of sexual tension in Sandra brown's novel.She really is the best!"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"WOW, WHAT A PREDICAMENT. WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU FOUND THE WOMAN YOU ONCE AND STILL LOVED MARRIED TO THE MAN YOU HATE TO CALL YOUR FATHER?

I bought this book mostly just to see how on earth she could make the step-mother/step-son scenerio work and I was amazed. It started off alittle slow, but it picked up and boy...I didn't want it to end. And if the story about Caroline and Rink wasn't enough, there was a secondary romance between his sweet little sister Laura Jane and Steve going on. This book stirred my emotions with the cruel Roscoe (I was furious!!),Caroline's years growing up with the town drunk, Rink's first wife and her daughter that he missed...there was just so much. I couldn't put it down once I got about half-way and stayed up until 2:30am this morning to see how it ended. I'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I found Bittersweet Rain to be entertaining. I could not put this book down. I fell in love with Caroline and Rink. If you have time for a short romance this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"Okay, so I read this book because I read three others by Brown. I was motivated to do so by the fact that each of the previous books had at least one great sex scene in it. This book has one pretty good sex scene, but is negated and made all the more unlikely by everything that happens later in the story. My biggest problem with the book though is Brown's characterization of women. There are two main female characters: one is a virgin (and complete idiot) who marries the father of the man she loves for no apparently good reason other than to live in his big house; and, the other is a mentally retarded(but in a &quot;endearing&quot; way, i.e., as long as she's being told what to do, she's happy), makes me wonder if its not Brown's intention to propagate the myth that women are all a deficient sub-species when it comes to getting along in life.Brown's main female character in this book wants love under the ideal (i.e., the right) conditions, but needs a &quot;good&quot; man to calm her down, relax her into the groove, and open her eyes to the subliminal realities that can arise from &quot;great&quot; sex even when life is less than perfect. Hogwash! Only the mentally retarded woman seems to understand what joys may be had on the wings of pure desire, and only the mentally retarded one is ready to get down anywhere, anytime with her lover, which, of course, she does not get to do because she couldn't possibly know what she's doing. &quot;What if she has an orgasm?&quot; -- is the question uppermost on the minds of the family. Her big brother decides to let her try sex (by getting married first), but vows to kill the new husband (a crippled man) if sex hurts his little sis. And all the while I was reading this, I was wondering - how'll he find out? Will there be regular debriefings or as long as she's wandering around blissfully oblivious, is everything supposedly fine?Anyway, the main female character, Caroline, is boring, easily manipulated, dumb (as opposed to being legitimately brain damaged), and totally unbelievable. Nobody...I repeat...nobody could be as unaccountably indecisive as this woman. Half the time she's heaving and sweating over the man (his name is Rink?), the rest of the time she's running away from him because she's worried about anything and everything except working things out with him. She's so insubstantial, she's sickening. The male lead sounds delicious sometimes, then he'll say something so stupid you want to throw the book out the window. I'm supposed to be reading these books for fun; nibbling on them between re-readings of Shakespeare, Dante, and Milton. Mind candy, however, has to at least be palatable, or whats the point? If you like your romance with a little reality, drop Brown like a hot rivet. Start by NOT reading this book."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I am a long term fan of Sandrea Brown, but this book was a waste of money to buy and a waste of time to read.The male character either has a case of arrested development or child molest tendencies, and even if he had beeen a character in a forensic novel rather than a romance , he would not have been interesting. The female character was equally pathetic for putting up with his obnoxious behavior. I like a good escape novel now and then but this was too unbelievable to be the least bit enjoyable."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"The story line for this book is good, if you are looking for a Romance by Sandra Brown. The reason for the low rating is the number of the typos in the Kindle edition. It definitely interferes with enjoyment of the book. There should be better quality control.

It would be as satisfying to read a gory mystery.When I'm finished I will go back to Shadows of Yesterday. That is a 'feel good' romance."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"By the time I began reading Sandra Brown novels, she was writing mystery thrillers and I just couldn't buy the books fast enough. Then I was introduced to the miracle of Kindle for PC and I began looking to see which of Sandra's books were in this format. This romantic love story is as well written as any of her mystery books and a welcomed change from that genre, although she tells her readers in a note at the front of the e-book that she wrote this story before she began writing mysteries. The characters are well developed and delightfully diverse. The story line is gripping and has a nice surprise ending. I especially liked her treatment of two social issues in the book. I don't want to spoil it by telling you what they are, but she handled the situations with accuracy and sensitivity. As is the case in all of the Sandra Brown novels that I've read so far, the sex scenes are written with both passion and grace. If you read this book and like it, you should also read \\"Rainwater\\" an excellent literary novel set in the Great Depression era in middle America. I would love to see more of that genre from her."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I loved this little book and couldn't put it down.

I read a Kindle version of Bittersweet Rain. I don't know what procedure is followed when a novel is issued in Kindle. However, there were so many typos and gramatical errors that they were a distraction. I found myself counting them up instead of paying attention to the story.

In 50 years of reading, never have I seen so many errors in one short book."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"This book was not one of the usual type that Sandra Brown is known for but it was really good. It kept my attention throughout and I could not skip read to find out the outcome. Excellent."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I wont lie I almost didn't read this book ... The plot of it sounded, to put it nicely, gross. But so far I have liked all Sandra Browns books, and not to my suprise it was great, I read it in one day. The book is about 2 young people who were torn apart by lies and brought back together by death. Caroline was the town drunks child and she grew up with the title. So when she was offered a chance to try to change her title she marries Roscoe (a very wealthy man),and the father of Rink, whom she had a slight past with. When Rink comes home for his fathers death, they find out the passion that he and Caroline had shared was stronger now then 12 years ago when Rink left her behind. And before Roscoe dies he lets known all the secrets of his dirty scams that he was involved in and set up, and the couple has to figure out where to go from there, now that they know the truth.

Am I the only one this has happened to?"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I could accept the premise of star-crossed lovers seperated, only to be brought back together by unhappy circumstance. Even if the circumstance was the marriage of the heroine to the hero's father. Okay, so the father was evil was orchestrated everything. He was cruel and used the heroine, verbally abusing her as well as being physically rough with her.So how is the son different from the father? When he gets angry with her (which is most of the time), he grabs her, mauls her, tells her she's trash, while she fights to get away from him. How is it we're supposed to believe she loves him? Their summer romance was when she was 15, and this is some 12 years later. He certainly doesn't rekindle any romantic feelings by being kind.The sex scenes are embarassing with their euphemisms and overall lameness.The book wasn't a horrible premise. It was just horribly done. A hero should be likeable and it should be obvious why the heroine wants to be with him."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I love her suspense and wasn't sure about the romance type.

You can get so absorbed in it and not want to put it down! The characters are written so real! I highly recomend it! :)"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"This was my first Sandra Brown Book. Maybe the many good things I had heard and read about the author had raised my expectations too much or maybe this is just not one of her best works, but I was fairly disappointed with this book.Sure Mrs. Brown adheres to the 411 of romance writing and the basic story is not without originality. But the characters and their actions are as real as the ones in a cheap soap opera, complete with all the tears, screams and clich&eacute; stances (his cornering her, hand against the wall, her walking away turning her back, his standing rigidly, head forward, tight fists by the sides). The heroine was given more maturity with 15 than with 27 and the lead couple was more likable in those flashbacks (these were however well interwoven with the main story). Also, the couple's reasons to stay apart until the end of the book, her concern about her reputation in the town and his pride are really weak. This and some of the character's other flaws kept me from ever relating to either protagonist.Additionally, some of the plot twists were unconvincing (Caroline's sex life with Roscoe); others were easily reconizable crutches to give the couple more time together and later vanished into obscurity. Some promising threads were never tied up. The sexual tension was overbearing and the prolific sex scenes dragged on too long, all for the price of some deeper character exploration.So if you just start out with romances or with Sandra Brown for that matter you can probably make a better choice than this book."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I bought this book today and I've already finished it. I have read one other title from her and I am now addicted to her work. Her writing flows and has an energy that makes you laugh and cry at the same time. I will now buy anything I can find of hers. If you wanna read a sassy story that has chin dropping romance, read this book!"},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I am a huge fan of Sandra Brown, and I have read almost all of her books. I was a bit disappointed in &quot;Bittersweet Rain&quot;. The plot itself was a great idea with a lot of potential, but the story did not follow through. The story had a good opening, but then it didn't really go anywhere. The sub-plot of Laura Jane and Steve was more interesting than the hero and heroine. I'm still a big fan of Sandra Brown and on the whole it's a good book, but I've come to expect more from her work."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"Wow, that was terribly hard to read. I had no idea it was going to have so many lame sex scenes. They overtook the story and frankly I completely missed the point. So sorry to have bought it. I dont need a picture painted, I have an imagination."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I realize that this book was originally released in the early 80's, so some of the themes were reflective of the times. One of them being a 15 year old having a relationship with a 22 year old man. Putting that aside, I still had issues with the story.Rink (I love that name)returns 12 years after his romance with Caroline ended. Caroline is now married to Rinks very rich father and is dying. Rink is bitter about the marriage, but was the one who had ended the relationship with Caroline 12 years before.While the attraction is still there, there's lots of resentment on Rinks part and he's pretty vocal about it. Other than the physical attraction, there just didn't seem to be more to it, in spite of what was written. Also, the story with the father (Roscoe) just seemed to be so not believable.The aspect of the story that I did enjoy was a blossoming romance between Rinks sister, a mildly mentally handicapped woman, with a sweet demeaner and Steve a somewhat cynical man who is recovering from the horrors of Vietnam. It's a sweet story and tells that there is someone out there for everyone. That romance was both believable and sweet."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"This book starts out with promise, and kept me wondering what really happened to the lovers that kept them apart. Other than the supsense of finding out what really happened between Caroline and Rink, there was nothing good about this novel. The secondary characters seem pointless, as if Brown only included them in her novel to fill space and add more pages to this book. With character names like Rink, Roscoe, and Granger, Brown tries too hard to make this into a romance. There is no distinguished climax to this story, other than Caroline becoming pregnant. I was always taught in English class that stories should have climaxes, and shame on the publishers for not noticing that there is none. It was a big let down to receive this book, which kept me in supsense for a while, and read as nothing came of it.

I usually steer clear of contemporary romances (unless it's a book from Judith McNaught), but I'm now real glad that I gave Brown a try; the story was very romantic. I didn't think she could pull it off, with Caroline being married to Rink's father. Their relationship was very sweet though, and the author conveys the tension, love and longing between the couple so well that it was as if nothing was lost between them despite the long separation. The only problem I've had with the book was that I found the names of the characters (Rink!) a bit strange which is a minor complaint which will not deter my appreciation for this book."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"This book was interesting, and it kept my attention with all that lovey-dovey stuff, but I think Sandra's way to obssessed with just one topic, and it's not romance."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"I've only just finished this book yesterday and I've already forgotten much of it. It's just plain unremarkable. There is a villian, the heroine's evil older husband. There are two romances in the story; one of the heroine, and one of the hero's younger, developmentally-disabled sister. The love scenes are trite and although they do not go into graphic detail, there's something vulgar about the language. This novel was written in 1984, and perhaps it read differently then, but I found the dialogue and descriptions during love scenes a bit smarmy. It's not terrible, but there's not much to enjoy either."},{"Title":"Bittersweet Rain","review":"There is no question that this is definately one of my favorite Sandra Brown books.

Sadaie], the most influential poet of the Kamakura era of Japan.Teika had taught that to write tanka (= waka, 31-syllable Japanese poems) one should \\"make old tanka your teachers. Those who steep their minds in the old style and learn their diction from the masters cannot fail to live in song.\\"By the time of Tamekane the traditions of waka court poetry had become for many stilted and rigid rather than supple and flexible. Tamekane was a person of strong character (which caused him to be exiled twice) who strove to find new pathways in waka poetry.But the broadly negative characterization late medieval court poetry in Japan has unfairly earned was refuted by Steven D. Carter in his wonderful book, \\"Waiting for the Wind,\\" containing over four hundred poems by thirty-six poets of Japan's late medieval age (1250 --- 1500). Tamekane was a bright light among many, it turns out.This book contains comparisons between Tamekane's waka with earlier waka in such imperial collections as Kokinshu (10th c.) among others. Also in the appendices are 60 excellent waka by Tamekane. All in all, the poems are beautifully rendered into English by Huey.One could have wished for more translations and less commentary in this book. However, as a study it is pathbreaking and important. The many dozens of translations that are included make the book a definite plus. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The kettle on the fuchsia;: The story of Orari Gorge,","review":"The Kettle on the Fuchsia. The Story of Orari Gorge. Barbara Harper. (1967) 1967. Reed, Wellington.In 1854 Barton Acland and Charles Tripp took possession of their land at Mt Peel. The cook, Mrs Smith hung her kettle on a fuchsia tree. Acland stayed at Mt Peel and Tripp moved on to Orari Gorge. The Tripp homestead is still one of South Canterbury's showpieces.This book is the history of Charles Tripp and his descendants and the fortunes of a great Station and its people through 112 years of depression, prosperity and development. It's very much a \\"history\\", far less entertaining than books such as \\"A River Rules My Life\\" or David McLeod's books. On the other hand, it IS a good history of Orari Gorge up to the mid-1960's, and there's a great collection of black and white photo's that illustrate the development of the Station over the years.Personally, I enjoyed it as a history of a New Zealand Station but it wasn't a book that enthralled me from start to finish - I had to keep coming back to it to complete reading it.

NO. 2: THE DOOMSDAY AFFAIR.","review":"I just read the third \\"Man from U.N.C.L.E.\\" novel - a paperback book written by John Oram and published in 1965. These novels written for adults are not much different from the 3 books in the children's series - \\"The Gunrunner's Gold,\\" \\"The Gentle Saboteur\\" and \\"The Calcutta Affair.\\" The main difference is that the children's books were written in larger print and have illustrations. The books are \\"grittier\\" than the TV series was, but perhaps only a little bit. Seasons 1 and 4 were more serious, while Seasons 2 and 3 used lots of campy humor. The decision to use too much humor made U.N.C.L.E. lose viewers who were serious about the James Bond 007 spy genre, and the time slot for Season 4 in 1967-68 was poorly chosen - shown when too many small children were still awake in the early evening. \\"The Copenhagen Affair\\" takes place entirely in Denmark, and the bad guys are from T.H.R.U.S.H. (\\"Technical Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humanity\\"). They've built very fast and maneuverable flying saucers in an underground bunker left by the Germans during World War 2. Most of the characters in the story are Danish, and you get a nice introduction to Danish customs during the Christmas season. They drink lots of beer (Carlsberg, Tuborg and others), liquor (like Akvavit) and eat smoked eel with bread. The head bad guy in the story is part Irish and part Danish, and he gets away in the end. But the underground factory is destroyed, and the other villains are either killed or captured. The U.N.C.L.E. TV series, movies and books make nice, lighthearted entertainment and good, clean fun! It was a cool TV show and it made both cool movies and cool books. Corgi toys made an U.N.C.L.E.-mobil during the 1960s which was based on a GM concept car from the same period. If you like toy cars (especially Corgi cars from England), I also recommend the book titled \\"Scale Model Collectible Cars\\" which you can buy on Amazon in both paperback and Kindle editions."},{"Title":"THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E.

NO. 2: THE DOOMSDAY AFFAIR.","review":"Microfilm concealed in a pack of cigarettes exposes strange goings-on in Denmark. Is THRUSH building flying saucers as part of their latest world-conquest scheme? It's up to the men from U.N.C.L.E., Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin, to don their anoraks and find out.This third of the \\"Man From U.N.C.L.E.\\" tie-in novels, published in 1965 just as the TV series was hitting its peak, is a good example of an adventure story which manages to please and entertain in every way except in terms of the adventure itself.Author John Oram makes a lot of effort to use the Danish setting to its fullest potential. Whether it's an opening action sequence set in the wilds of Seeland, a standoff in a seedy Copenhagen neighborhood, or a snowy finale amid the steep cliffs of Jutland, Oram works hard to ground the story in this colorful but often-overlooked (for Americans) coastal nation.Oram sets one scene thusly: \\"There's no traffic problem in Stroget. It has long been closed to all traffic on wheels except baby carriages. So you can stroll around at leisure, crossing from side to side of the street with no risk to life and limb. Oddly, this security takes some getting used to. You can always pick out an Englishman or an American by the way he stays grimly on the sidewalk while the Danes parade happily along the middle of the road.\\"For \\"U.N.C.L.E.\\" fans, Napoleon and Illya as presented here may not connect up with the TV series characters, but they come across as three-dimensional characters more than they did in the first two books, with Napoleon showing spleen and temper. They are aided by several Danes who the author takes pains to give individuality to. Even the bad guys are given color and vigor.In a book as short as this one, such attention to setting and character means something has to give. In this case, that something is the plot. What exactly THRUSH is up to with the flying saucers is never really addressed. What few moments there are of suspense are brushed aside too quickly. If not for a couple of ludicrous enemy escapes, the story would be wrapped up even quicker than it is. Too often, a description of some plot point, say preparations made for an assault on a THRUSH fortress, are interrupted so people can have some Christmas punch and aquavit and soak in the ambiance of Denmark one more time.The one part of the book involving the most suspense ironically features neither Solo nor Kuryakin, but an opening chase showcasing a faceoff between a salesman who stumbles onto the scene and THRUSH's head satrap in Denmark. I give Oram credit for not resolving this in the expected way, and additional points for having the THRUSH leader come across as something other than diabolically efficient and ruthless without scotching the plot.Mostly I enjoyed this novel a great deal as a kind of time-capsule travelogue with shootouts and occasional call-outs in the direction of a fondly-remembered 1960s television show. I'm not sure I can recommend it to someone not interested in the same things, but I wouldn't mind again experiencing Oram's singular style with a spy novel - compelling characters, deep settings - in addition to just a bit stronger plot."},{"Title":"Messages from the Bombing Range","review":"While Jim Hunter's book is a small one, it packs a powerful message .

One day, God announces to the Pope that he's coming to the Earth, specifically to Spain. An important journalist wins the exclusive and is appointed to interview God at his arrival. People from the whole world congregate at Madrid, to cheer him up (and ask him things). But God is not what anyone expected. He's a simple character, a humble &quot;man&quot; with wise words that nobody listen to. People are expecting something entirely different. Why, he's THE celebrity. God addresses the crowd in the famous Bullfighting Arena in Madrid. And the message is lost. Hearing strange and simple words coming from him, the crowd leaves him alone. After some things more happen, God understands it's been a mistake to come down and leaves. This novel starts as a comical romp, but slowly its tone changes to confusion, resentment, and a deep sadness. God's address at the Bullfighting Plaza is simply excellent and moving.

Traditionally, discussions of rewards at work focus on cash compensation, benefits, and, more recently, stock deals. These monetary and wealth-building vehicles help one have great experiences in life outside of work. But what about the experiences at work, where a dedicated employee might spend more than half of waking time? What makes the day-to-day work experience itself rewarding? In an age where the war for talent demands that every organization address this question successfully, Jim Shaffer provides powerful, practical answers for CEO's, executive teams, general managers, and heads of human resources.At the heart of the day-to-day work experience is the process of communication. As Mr. Shaffer writes, &quot;You can't not communicate. Everything you say and do communicates.&quot; Forget about bringing dogs to work and on-site concierge services. These are fluff, not substance. Mr. Shaffer gets to the substance. He demonstrates that the quality of organization communication is, by far, the greatest governor of the quality of the work experience for all employees.Mr. Shaffer shows leaders how to develop a communication environment that shapes a highly rewarding day-to-day work experience for everyone in the organization. He shows how to build and lead ongoing organization communication processes and disciplines that align people to a common purpose and motivate them to pursue it with vigor. In the war for talent, he shows how to span the generations and ensure that one and all agree: &quot;Our company is a great place to work! &quot;Do you face unprecedented challenges in attracting, retaining, aligning, motivating and rewarding top-notch staff at all levels? &quot;The Leadership Solution&quot; delivers distinctive know-how for building a huge advantage in getting, keeping and deploying the people you need.

With insights from many of the world's top CEOs, two &quot;case studies,&quot; plain old good writing and a spot-on sailing metaphor to top it off, Shaffer proves what the best leaders have known (or at least have sensed) for some time: &quot;informed people outperform uninformed people...&quot; Better still, Shaffer steers a clear course -- with plenty of helpful examples -- through the sea of ambiguity that is business today, mapping the route for leaders who need to connect their employees to their business strategies. He calls it &quot;connecting the dots.&quot; Business schools everywhere should use it and call it &quot;Leadership 101.&quot; This is a terrific book for great leaders seeking to gain further marketplace advantage, leaders in training seeking instruction for &quot;putting it all together&quot; and the managers who serve them. The chapter on &quot;earthshaking&quot; events would be especially helpful for any one managing through a merger, acquisition, turnaround and the like."},{"Title":"The Leadership Solution","review":"This is an amazingly useful book for anyone who wants to learn how to motivate people.

Five stars on my list -- I've already recommended it to several hundred people."},{"Title":"The Leadership Solution","review":"Jim Shaffer, in this work, really connected the dots for me! His premise, that it all starts with effective communications, is dead on! As a former CEO and whose time is now spent as an outside director for a number of companies and as counselor to large company CEOs, this work is both relevant for today's leaders in today's warp speed economy and timeless in its approach.Shaffer has crafted a very readable, yet content rich handbook for anyone either presently running a company or with dreams to someday run one! (In fact, this work is an excellent handbook for CEOs wanting to develop &quot;bench strength&quot; on the management team. Simply use Leadership Solutions as the textbook for a company-run academy for those up and comers selected for bigger jobs in the company's future. So many books are long on theory, short on application. Shaffer's approach is exceptionally practical...and applicable. It can be reread time and again."},{"Title":"The Leadership Solution","review":"Jim Shaffer describes how leaders can excite and engage people in organizations, and how that engagement can drive business results. He builds his case and his processes on a very clear portrayal of what happens when people don't feel connected or involved, and the striking contrast with organizations whose leaders understand the importance of &quot;connecting the dots&quot;. Jim has a great collection of stories that bring the material to life. In his direct and and sometimes challenging style he lays out some of the ineffective, traditional, one-way communication strategies that are (not quickly enough) being replaced by customer- and business-focused processes and leadership. His examples include corporate publications that contain no information of use or relevance to the business; leadership behavior that runs exactly counter to the behaviors that the leader is urging employees to adopt; and many examples of the remarkable results that can be gained by leaders who recognize, draw on and reward employee potential and results."},{"Title":"The Leadership Solution","review":"Jim Shaffer's book, The Leadership Solution, is a MUST READING both for all corporate communications executives and staff and CEOs. Nobody does a better job in the age of &quot;High Tech&quot; to remind us to use the &quot;High Touch.&quot; If we take the points that Jim cites, then we will find that attrition will be decreased.Jim reminds us throughout that employee communications and touch will make the difference in performance and thus, stock price and a competitive and &quot;best in class&quot; company.Shaffer lays out clearly the VISION aand STRATEGY. We all need to follow his course of what he states. &quot;A vision is a target, a picture of the future. A strategy is a roadmap, how you're going to achieve the vision.&quot;Tools are excellent. Follow the Readiness questionnaire to improving performance. See if we can all master the 6 course process to connect people or employees or associates to the business strategy. Shaffer identifies the 20 things to generate commitment. He cites the &quot;3 people principles&quot; that guide Best Practices and the Best Performance.With all the focus on Mergers and Acquisitions, we find that Shaffer's 9 Guildelines for negotiating through the M&amp;A are excellent.Shaffer's examples of CEOs help build the case. His messages will help any communications chief help your CEO.Shaffer demonstrates vividly how and why the communication function is being reinvented. The last chapter embodies the message strongly. It means what we all learn that communications much be align to assist the company's strategic goals. Shaffer does it.Read and underline; share with your colleagues."},{"Title":"Little Science, Big Science","review":"This small book packs a huge punch - it contains the 1962 Pegram lectures at Brookhaven National Labs by this oustanding and original science historian at Yale, who saw exactly what would happen when science became bloated with a vast inflow of funds and people and the glare of ever increasing media attention. The nature of scientists would change as those attracted by different rewards than before would take it up as a career profession with their aim self advancement rather than scientific curiosity. One result is now seen in HIV AIDS where a corrupt paradigm rules, never substantiated but protected vindictively by scientists and institutions as if it was an inviolable religious belief. Derek Price's thoughtful demonstration of this prospect of big science-bad science at such an early date makes this little book a classic.Here's a sample paragraph:\\"I suggest that all those characteristics apply to people who became eminent in the days of Little Science and that we do not yet have much inkling of whatever new characteristics have been elicited by the change to the new conditions of Big Science. Many of the personality traits found formerly seem to be consistent with the hypothesis that many scientists turned to their profession for an emotional gratification that was otherwise lacking. If this is true, be it only a partial explanation, one can still see how cataclysmic must be the effect of changing the emotional rewards of the scientific life. If scientists were, on the whole, relatively normal people, just perhaps more intelligent or even more intelligent in some special directions, it would not be so difficult. But since it appears that scientists are especially sensitive to their modes of gratification and to the very personality traits that have made them become scientists, one must look very carefully at anything which tampers with and changes these systems of reward. Any such change will make Big Scientists people of very different temperament and personality from those we have become accustomed to as traditional among Little Scientists.\\"Interestingly, Price writes that he admires Newton's desire to write the Principia rather than reply to critics of his optical papers with papers in reply.This is one book that shows how much we have lost by having too many darn papers instead of complete books."},{"Title":"All This Change","review":"i don't think i'm a very good reviewer. but i just couldn't pass up making an attempt to describe how special i think this slim book of poetry is. i often visit a friend who has horses and animals like the author sue had and all the words sue uses to capture how it feels to be among these live beasts-horses, and in the dust and sun...she just touches something that rings true to my life, although i'm a suberbanite. the big clincher that made me want to own this book and not just keep borrowing from my friend is my favorite poem... sue's tribute to her dog that died."},{"Title":"All This Change","review":"Of all the poetry books I've read in my life, this is my favorite.

But once the cat is out of the bag, there is nothing left of this tale. It could have been an interesting mystery told if told chronologically, but in this manner it was tedious. The confusion is in trying to remember how something was told - was it during another conversation? Was it by the narrator? And with only two people on the audio, it was sometimes difficult to tell the difference between the characters.I was also not very keen on the abridgement version either. The dialogue was trite, the setting non-existant, and the characters stiff and without life. It could have been partly the fault of the voices, but most of the blame belongs on the writing.Very poor effort and barely good enough to finish."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"Alison Pagone committed suicide... or did she? She's on trial for murder, and she's obviously guilty... or is she? These are the tantalizing tidbits of information we are given at the beginning of \\"In the Company of Liars.\\" Or should I say, the END of \\"In the Company of Liars.\\"Initially, I was intrigued by the idea of a murder mystery told in reverse chronological order. Like many others, I loved the movie Memento, and the jacket of this book compares itself to that critically-acclaimed movie. I'm also a fan of Grisham, and the back of the book compares itself to that ultra-famous author.However, this book falls short. The \\"tantalizing tidbits\\" become a swell of fragmented ideas. It's not as clever as \\"Memento\\"--the journey backward through time gets old very quickly (did we need to know what happened EVERY day??). And the book isn't as engaging as a Grisham novel, either.\\"In the Company of Liars\\" boasts many fresh ideas, but it's not as unpredictable or fascinating as it would like to be. Overall, I'd give it 2 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"In In the Company of Liars, David Ellis applies the unusual, though not unheard of, technique of telling his mystery in reverse chronological order. As the novel opens, what appears to be an open and shut case is presented, that of crime novelist Allison Pagone who is on trial for murdering her lover, a congressional lobbyist. Soon it slips back to a few days earlier, then a few days before that - well, you get the picture. Of course, all is not what it seems, and the reader is presented with the actions and perspectives of Allison herself, her family, her lawyer, the FBI agent on the case, some Pakistani terrorists, and a host of other characters. All, including Allison, are shady, and all have their own reasons for being so. Is Allison guilty? If she didn't do it, who did? What do the terrorists have to do with the death of a lobbyist? All eventually becomes clear, but not until the very last chapter.This is a complex plot that requires close attention to prevent losing your way, and a couple of times, I had to reread portions to be sure I had it right. Ellis did a good job with it. It would be interesting now to read it in forward chronological order, but he's probably not planning on doing a rewrite."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"This might quite literally be the most annoying book I've ever read. Now mind you - I bought this because I liked 2 other books by David Ellis so much. But this book starts off near the end of the story (a common thing, and one I don't generally object to), but then rather than reverting to the beginning of the story in the next chapter, each chapter steps back a day or two.Every chapter.For the whole book.It's like reading a normal book starting with the last chapter, and moving on through to the beginning.Now - some might say \\"it's a literary device!\\". \\"It's artistic!\\". \\"What? You can't follow a story in reverse you cretin?\\"And to them I say: There's a reason that in the entire course of human history - most stories are told beginning to end. I'm not ashamed to tell you that this book makes my head hurt. Trying to decipher in each chapter what character has done what, knows what and will know what - in what order, is making me insane. I'm about 60% through the book, and am most likely going to just stop.Because the other two David Ellis books I've read were so good - I will try another one - but avoid this one like the plague. Or go buy yourself some aspirin first...Update 6/8/12: I feel like I gotta give this author some credit; while I stand by my original review of this particular book - I have since read 3 others by Mr. Ellis - and have thoroughly enjoyed them. They're interesting, I like the characters, and they tend to have unexpected endings which is awesome (I hate predictability in a book). So don't let the above review turn you off from David Ellis altogether - his other books are really great..."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"I am a voracious reader, and rarely have trouble understanding a plot, but I found this reverse order very confusing. After I finished, I had to go back to the beginning to find out if my conclusions were correct, which they were not. Was Ram a bad guy? Is Allison really dead? Answers, please."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"I generally don't like stories written backwards chronologically, but this was the last David Ellis book that I hadn't read, so I had to try it. About half way through I could see the wisdom of writing it in this fashion. I think in the hands of a lesser author, it wouldn't have worked, but it is very well written and developed. It's an intriguing story with many surprises as you move forward - really backward - that keeps the tension level high throughout the entire book. There were a couple of questions I had at the end (which would be the beginning of the book but the end of reading it) that I would have preferred were made clearer. I felt like I needed to find someone who had read it to discuss it with. But, as with all of Ellis' books, I was always interested and very glad I read it."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"I picked up this book because a previous David Ellis novel I read, Line of Vision, was excellent. \`In the Company of Liars' however, is on another level. The plot goes in reverse chronological order, so for the first few chapters, I had no idea what was going on, who was who, what the relationships were, and who was good and who was bad. Famed novelist Allison Pagone is on trial, accused of murdering her lover, Sam Dillon. Dillon and Allison's ex-husband, Mat Pagone, were both lobbyists working to get Bill 1551 passed. The evidence against Ms. Pagone is extraordinary, and she is not even denying the accusation. Ellis has clearly painted the portrait that Allison is hiding something, or at least, covering for someone, but the reader is left guessing who.At the same time, Dillon was working his way through an \`ethical dilemma,' one that some people believe had to do with bribing Senators for their vote to pass legislation. There is one person that believes that Allison is innocent-Larry Evans, an author Allison meets at the grocery store. He is researching the events to write a book that he thinks will show Allison to be innocent of murder. Then there is the story line of Ram Haroon, and it takes a long time before the reader understands what his role is.This novel is so original and different on so many levels that it is hard to review without letting the readers in on the big finale. How everyone ties in and how the events all tie together is surprising, yet the story was beautifully crafted. Once I was done with the novel, I had to go back and re-read the first few chapters, and doing this, everything made sense. This one definitely kept me up at night reading, and really, when you read thrillers like this, isn't that what you want?"},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"In searching for another book of the same name, I stumbled across this wholly original and riveting novel. I bought this one and completely forgot the other.The story unwinds backwards, yet it still contains more twists and turns than a season of 24! I was truly amazed, and I often looked back to the front of the book where subtle clues were deftly placed confirming what happens \\"later\\" in the book.This writer is a master and I am a new fan!"},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"Yes, having the plot written in reverse chronological order requires you to pay close attention, but this novel is fun! I consider myself a fairly skeptical, cynical reader, yet Ellis made me happily suspend my disbelief. He did it by creating believable, sympathetic characters who you can believe are capable of doing the things Ellis has them doing.And what a refreshing departure. Too many suspense novels make you wait until the last chapter (or worse, the \\"epilogue\\") to unravel the knots the author has created. Ellis's reverse plotting allows him to begin the process midway through in the most entertaining ways, and the revelations come when you least expect them. Just when you're saying, \\"Hey, something doesn't make sense here\\", all of a sudden it does."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"First, Ms. Klausner does NOT do too much of a spoiler job, and p.s. the character is JANE McCoy (in my edition anyway).Second, I had no problem with the repetition, because each time we were seeing the same words in a new light.Yes, there were a few cliches. Is there a cup of coffee anywhere in print that ISN'T \\"steaming\\" ?But this is such a good idea, and wrings so many interpretations out of so little, that you enjoy it and have to grant it some admiration.There were quite a few \\"What the ..?\\" moments, each followed by a \\"Hey, well, yeah, that's fair, and that character might have done that, and it DOES fit with what went, um, before.\\"It passed the ultimate test - I stayed up too late to finish it."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"until my mind boggled. reverse chronology only adds to the disjointed plotting in this novel. the setting is non-existent and the characters are not developed well. this tale of murder, suspicion, government graft and international terrorism might be readable in a chronological or backflash order.i am not against ingenious and original writing styles, but in this case the device seems to be used as cover-up for a sloppy plot and cardboard characters."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"I have enjoyed all of this author's past work. I did, unfortunately, find this one a very tedious and uninspired read. I suppose the idea of writing a book from back to front may have seemed clever, but the execution simply does not work. The end to beginning format is awkward and unclear, especially with two of the main characters, neither of whom come alive, or become real or sympathetic. Their fate is also somewhat contradictory.With the exception of Agent McCoy,the characters are very flat and uninteresting, never really coming to life. You read the book for the sake of getting through it, almost as a challenge.Beyond the above, and probably the most annoying feature of all,is the simply mind numbing amount of repetition of the same thoughts and statements, over and over again. This book is a read of around 375 pages. Without the repetition, it would have been under 300.This is a work in serious need of an editor.That said, I have enjoyed Mr. Ellis enough in the past to want to try his next attempt. This is just one to leave on the shelf."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"Ellis can usually be counted on to write a riveting thriller with plenty of unique twists. This is a thriller with one unique twist: the chapters are written backwards.It's possible that Ellis first completed this novel in regular format and then inverted the order of the chapters in order to give the book a gimmick. If so, I hope it never happens again. The story itself is convoluted due to the chronololgy being mixed-up, and the twists seem to be a deus-ex-machina.It would have helped Ellis if he'd done more to make us like the characters, but he didn't.This is the first of his books I won't be giving to my friends to read. I'll give it to people I don't like."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"In the Company of Liars, the books goes from the end to the begining. I didn't think I would like or even love this book. When I started to read it, I was hooked. I turned the pages so fast. David Ellis has a way of getting you to know the charators in the book. In the book, the end was a surprise. I was totally unprepared for the end, but it was a good ending. It just blew me away.I recommend the book, even it does by reverse chronilogical order. I was is excited and the book keeps your head moving. Trying to help solve these murders."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"This mystery book is written in such an original style! It never stops surprising you until the end.David Ellis is by far one of the most interesting writers of crime novels,he is the most clever and entertaining."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"For readers with keen memories and analytical skills, Ellis has designed a challenging puzzle. This is truly top caliber suspense writing. Ellis shows his skills as a writer by telling his story in reverse chronological order and by creating compelling and strong female characters. One warning: if you don't like \\"international\\" angles, this book isn't for you. In my opinion, Ellis is one of our best writers."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"On trial for the murder of her lover, State lobbyist Sam Dillon, best selling crime fiction novelist Allison Pagone commits suicide when it becomes apparent that she is going to lose the trial, her freedom, and, ultimately, her life. But this isn't the beginning of the story, or the end. Told in reverse chronology, we live the story, much like Merlin, going backwards from the end to the beginning, and as we travel through time, day before day, week before week, month before month, we slowly learn through conversations, memories, and 'live action' what really led up to Sam's murder and Allison's suicide.David Ellis handles this unique style masterfully, and though I admit there were times I became a bit confused as to *when* exactly something had happened, in the end, I was quite satisfied and happy to have read this book. The layers of the tale are peeled back slowly, and as they unfold, you realize that things aren't really at all what you thought.This is the second book I've read by Mr. Ellis afterEye of the Beholderand he is now on my list of \\"must read\\" authors."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"This book is very hard to describe, much less evaluate. In essence, it is a legal thriller involving murder, terrorists, government intrigue, FBI operations, and courtroom drama. But Mr Ellis decided to tell the tale in a unique manner: backwards. He begins the book at the end of the story and every scene in the entire novel takes place one or two days before what you just read. Now, I am normally not a person who goes in for gimmics. Too often authors like to prove how smart they are by fooling the reader with a gimmic of some kind. However, I had high hopes for this one (I knew about the backwards thing before I ever began to read) because of the author's first published novel, \\"Line of Vision\\", which is one of the finest legal thrillers I've ever read.I really struggled through the first third of this book. Most stories build up the plot and develop the characters in a logical progression, allowing the reader to absorb each new element one at a time. But here, since we are starting at the end, we have to see how all of the characters end up. We read about a suicide by a character but have no idea at the time who she is and why we should care. It's confusing to say the least. And to add to the confusion, the author frequently uses flashbacks of what the character is thinking...thoughts from their past...which we will read about in upcoming chapters...wow.But then, suprisingly, it started to jell. But the time I was half way through the book, I knew who the main players were and what their motivations were. Now I wanted to know how events got to be the way they were. I'm sure that's how the author was approaching the whole book. The ending (beginning?) was quite good and went a long way in overcoming my initial objections to the \\"gimmic.\\" I will admit to going back and re-reading the first 20-30 pages to see those events from the different perspective of knowing the whole story. That provided good closure for me. I would definitely classify this work as \\"smart\\" fiction, as the writing itself is well done, and obviously every aspect of the plot is well engineered. Overall, I am both happy to have read it and glad that it is behind me. I give the first half of the book 3 stars and the last half 5 stars...rounding out to 4."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"David Ellis' In The Company of Liars is one of the best mysteries I've ever read. It's unique, a real tour-de-force in the best way. One starts at the end and progresses backwards!! How Ellis manages to give just the right hints along the way and not confuse at the same time is something I don't think many authors would be able to do. It's a great story. Both my husband and I enjoyed it and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"This is the second of David Ellis' books that I've read and enjoyed this one as much as the first. The characters are interesting and developed so that you can identify with them. It is written in reverse order which made it challenging to read and remember from one chapter to the next. A very interesting concept. It took some concentration to keep the thread of the story going, but it was interesting enough that it was enjoyable to do so. He is one of the better writers and glad I found him."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"I have not missed one single novel by Mr. Ellis since I first met him while he was defending me in an election fiasco! There is not one thing that I do not enjoy about his books! Being an avid reader I can rate him as a true professional with a heart for writing. I cannot wait for his next novel!!! Do yourself a favor and give him a chance if you love to be held in suspense and fall in love with the characters he creates!!!!"},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"I read mostly mysteries and similar and David Ellis is one of my favorite authors so I am always glad when there is a new book out by him."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"If you are like me, you enjoy mysteries that challenge the little grey cells (as Hercule Poirot was so fond of saying). Having heard that David Ellis had written his latest novel in reverse chronological order, I felt like a worthy challenge had arrived.While many books use flashbacks, this one goes in reverse chronology (and uses flashbacks). So you have to be nimble-minded.If you are like me, you will continually make assumptions about what's going on that are wrong. One of the pleasures of this book is that the reverse chronology makes for many more plot complications . . . which, for me, kept the story fresher and more unexpected.So how do you review a book written in reverse chronology . . . very carefully!I suspect that the most I can do is to describe some of the key characters . . . rather than give you a sense of the plot. You'll just have to unravel the plot on your own. Beware of any reviews that give you plot details . . . they are, by definition, spoilers!Allison Pagone is a best-selling novelist of detective stories who is also a lawyer who formerly worked as a public defender. She is recently divorced from her ex-husband, Mat, who is a political lobbyist in their state's capitol. They have a daughter, Jessica, who a college student working part-time for another lobbyist, Sam Dillon, who is a friend of Allison's and Mat's.Since this is a mystery, you have representatives of law and order (deputy investigator Jodie Griggs, detective Joe Czerwonka, special agents Jane McCoy, Owen Harrick and Irv Sheils from the bureau, county attorney Elliot Raycroft and the prosecutor, Roger Ogren) and those who defend the innocent (attorneys Paul Riley and Ron McGaffrey).Naturally, there are journalists (such as Larry Evans) and various mysterious people outside of the Pagones' lives (such asDoctor Neil Lomas, a brilliant drug researcher, and Ram Haroon, a suspicious exchange student). These characters spice up the story much more than you would expect.One of the pleasures of reading the book is that Mr. Ellis does a nice job of both misdirection . . . and giving you clues to overcome the misdirection. So if two things don't make sense together, assume that there are other shoes to drop in the past.Some will grade this book down because it takes 100 pages or so before you begin to see the beauty of the story. Be patient if you are not thrilled while you first read the book . . . it will get a lot better before you get to the beginning (or the end, if you prefer).This book will most appeal to those who have enjoyed plays like Sleuth.I envy you for having this wonderful reading experience ahead of you.I hope that Mr. Ellis will provide us with another of these gems soon."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"This novel opens with three different story lines. FBI Agent Jane McCoy holding a gun on a well-known doctor, a Marine squad attacking a convoy in the Middle East to capture a well known terrorist, and mintutes after the death of mystery writer Allison Pagone. Allison was on trial and about to be convicted for the murder of her alleged lover. Just what ties all of these plots together? To say anymore would ruin the masterful job that Mr. Ellis has done in writing this novel in chronological reverse. He succeeds in crafting a tale with narrative breadth and emotional scope seldom encountered in mystery fiction. The novel proceeds to a flawless slam bang conclusion - or should I say beginning? The result is a deeply satisfying novel that transcends general limitations and lingers in the mind long after the book ends."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"I initially had some doubts about IN THE COMPANY OF LIARS, David Ellis's new novel. The element that (momentarily) brought me up short was the revelation that the narrative is in chronological reverse. This method, though unusual, is not unknown, nor is it limited to novels. The problem is that it is occasionally employed as a trick of form to distract from the substance of the piece. An example of this is Coldplay's video for \\"The Scientist,\\" where the method is utilized as a stalking horse to keep the viewer awake during the song.But it turns out there was no reason for me to worry. Ellis has demonstrated in previous works such as LINE OF VISION and LIFE SENTENCE that he need only rely on his prodigious reserve of talent to carry the day. The same holds true here.The use of the chronological reverse with respect to IN THE COMPANY OF LIARS is a plot device that functions as a bit of lagniappe to the primary strength of the narrative rather than having to carry the day. It also, incidentally, presents a dilemma for reviewers faced with the task of providing a sufficient summary of the plot without giving everything away.Let us try. Allison Pagone is accused of murdering her former lover, Sam Dillon, a lobbyist whose company is the subject of a Federal investigation. The evidence against Pagone is damning, and she has done the prosecution the favor of behaving like a guilty party as well. When she is found to have committed suicide, with the weapon that murdered Dillon on the premises, the conclusion is that she has saved the prosecution's time and some taxpayer dollars.But, but...well, that is only the beginning. And the beginning raises a bunch of questions, including whether Pagone actually did the deed. If she didn't do it, who did? And what is the connection between a murder committed by a jilted lover and the attack upon and capture of a Middle Eastern terrorist? These intriguing questions are more than enough, on their own, to keep you up all night reading this novel. Yet the star here is Ellis, who leads the reader through a minefield of potential distractions with nary a misstep. And that's while walking backward, no less.IN THE COMPANY OF LIARS is an intriguing, suspenseful, funhouse of a book, with surprises jumping out at you from above, below and sideways. You'll never forget this book, or Ellis, after you've finished reading. Highly recommended.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"Easily the best book of the year so far.In the Company of Liars turns the thriller narrative on its head, and makes a clever and engaging statement about the structure of storytelling, while also being a slam-dunk page-turner.Do you think you've read it all? Guess again.You won't ever guess the ending, which is really the beginning, and when you reach the final page you'll marvel how Ellis managed to pull it all off.If you like to be challanged, and enjoy a great mystery, you can't go wrong with this one.This is a six star book. Amazon needs to add an extra."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"Even though I kind of guessed one of the main plot twists, this book still kept me reading. Yes the reverse chronology is a gimmick, but I think it worked well. On another note, be careful when reading these reviews - Harriet Klausner gives away pretty much the entire story, which will essentially ruin the book for you. And for all the reviewers who said you still couldn't figure out who killed Allison or whether she committed suicide or what, or that the government was sleazy in how they handled the situation, I suggest you re-read Monday, February 9, near the end of the book. It's all explained quite clearly and satisfactorily. (If you haven't read the book, whatever you do, don't read ahead or it'll ruin everything!)"},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"IN THE COMPANY OF LIARS is a murder mystery written in reverse order. No need to cheat by going to the last chapter to see \\"who-done-it\\". My only problem was even after I finished reading the book and learned all the surprising twists and turns, I still didn't know who killed Allison! The book is well written but it was hard to follow a story in reverse order.Allison Pagone is an award-winning novelist with an ex-husband, Mateo, and daughter, Jessica and she is dead. Agent Jane McCoy and her partner Owen Harrick, are working two ends against the middle to try to complete their assignment from the Bureau. She has created a scenario that is suppose to keep everyone safe and yet stop the bad guys. Can she juggle all the balls to make it happen?The story includes Sam Dillon, a lobbyist; Larry Evan, an American journalist; Ram Haroon, a Pakistani National, Irv Shiels, the SAC Officer for the Bureau; Dr. Lomas, a research scientist; Flanagan-Maxx, a pharmaceutical company and Divalpro, the blood pressure drug FM produces.The first 200 pages were slow reading. Many paragraphs were repeated over and over until I thought would die of boredom if I continued to read the novel. But I did and the last 100 pages was the best part of the whole story. At that point, it was spell-binding reading and caused me to stay up late to finish it.These last chapters also were where the twists and turns were found. Early on, I had a certain character pegged as the bad guy and I was certain that he was calling all the shots. But, watch out, David Ellis turned the tables so fast and with such obvious clarity that I wondered why I didn't see where he was taking the story earlier on."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"I put up with the reverse chronology for about 70 pages. Too much work, frankly."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"I've always wanted to read a book by Mr. Ellis and I'm glad that I started with this novel. I was captured by just reading the book jacket. I thought his idea of writing the book in reverse order was creative. I was in a \\"rut\\" and have been looking for something different and this was what I had been looking for. Just when you think you know what happened, you get another twist. Definitely worth the read. While reading this book, the theme that kept coming back to mind is do you know who you can REALLY trust? This book is definitely ownership worthy."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"Author Ellis is too cute for his own (and certainly the reader's) good. He writes the ending first, then goes back in time to show you \\"how the ending got there\\" - or words to that effect. Mostly it is various characters (none we can sympathize with) tip-toeing around one another with dull dialogue. Nothing much happens! If you enjoy reading a book where you are constantly wondering what the h--- is going on, this is your dish. Otherwise, avoid this writing experiment. Some might say, \\"Well, it's better than a sharp stick in the eye!\\" - but I say, \\"It IS a sharp stick in the eye!\\" Better you should read a cereal box, as grandma used to say."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"With John Grisham having seemingly taken a downhill turn, I believe that David Ellis is now the best contemporary author of legal fiction. With his latest, a story told from ending to beginning, he solidifies this reputation.Unlike Ellis's earlier work, the story here is really secondary to the writing method. The book begins with the stopping of a terrorist action, and the suicide of a woman, Allison Pagone, allegedly involved in the plot. From there, the story moves backward in time, as the reader tries to figure out exactly what has happened, and why.Initially, I really thought little would be revealed from the past that would have much of an impact on the book's beginning. I thought most of it would be filler, just a device to allow Ellis to pull off a tricky piece of writing. However, what we learn as the story goes backwards in time changes much of our perception about we've already read, and many readers will probably find themselves flipping back to re-read certain sections.I think many authors could write a book in this format, from the present through the past. To Ellis's great credit, though, he does so while creating an excellent mystery, one that will have many scratching their heads until book's end. I'd recommend any of Ellis's books, all of which have been great, and this one is no exception."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"This is mostly a comment on the other people who supposedly read this book. HOW can you have read it, and comprehended the story, but still have no idea even whether a certain character was alive or dead??You have to pay attention and you will be rewarded with a great story, told in an interesting way. Every time you make an assumption about what is happening, think again because you are probably wrong."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"For reasons best known to himself, David Ellis decided to employ a reverse chronology in this mystery. This is an unfortunate decision I think because it makes the novel very difficult to follow and far less enjoyable than it should be.The story itself is adequate. It opens at the scene of a suicide: a famous author on trial for murder takes her own life. A female cop paired with an understanding male partner feels guilty because it was her job to keep the woman safe.You see, the woman on trial for murder really . . . well, I'm not going to tell you. The plot is solid, the characters not too unreal. I think the story would have been better told without the reverse chronology, but it's still a fun read. Just prepare to be in a mild state of perpetual confusion about what happened when.Jerry"},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"Agreed - the reverse chronology makes the book difficult to follow. If I want a book that is extremely challenging to follow, I'll read Faulkner with Oprah. A thriller full of scandals and terrorists shouldn't be this hard to read."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"I have just finished this book, and I found the author's idea of starting at the end of the story and finishing at the beginning was original, but frustrating to me.It seemed the plot changed from chapter to chapter.When I finished the book, I really wasn't positive who lived and who didn't.I found the book interesting, but it was so full of twists and turns, I couldn't seem to enjoy it.Possibly, my brain was either tired or overworked, or just sour grapes.Since so many people seemed to enjoy this book, I may just go back and read it from back to front.

I couldn't resist commenting on In the Company of Liars.

This was the first David Ellis novel I've ever read; I fear it will be the last."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"This latest from David Ellis is a good trick in form, turning the worked-over linearity of standard thriller lit inside out, upside down and backwards. It's fascinating to see the storyteller work around his gimmick so carefully. It's too bad that style and any chance of curled intrigue took such a back seat in the process. \\"In the Company of Liars\\" is burdened with cliches. The prose is wooden and reminiscent of the laziest crime writing. Thank goodness it was at least a little more than the sum of its parts."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"As others before me, I really hated this book and only finished it because I have enjoyed Ellis' previous books and thought he might somehow pull this off. The backwards episode was one of the few - perhaps the only one - on SEINFELD I did not care for. It was fun the first time, but that was comedy!! Why David Ellis thought this was a good idea I cannot imagine. Perhaps he was bored and liked the novelty of the idea. NO! It was at his reader's expense It was terrorist/politician/scientist/lobbiest all pulled together; a subject I would find boring in the usual format. This is an excellent way to lose the respect of his readers. Forgetting the backwards format, I found one-half page chapters unacceptable, and the writing seemed stilted andamatuerish. Outside of that, well read at your own risk. Oh, in addition I take issue with all the favorable professional reviews. I guess they were afraid to pan it."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"I received the book before it was scheduled to arrive and it's in great condition."},{"Title":"In the Company of Liars","review":"Famous novelist Allison Pagone is on trial for the murder of lobbyist Sam Dillon, but she is not mounting any credible defense. Instead she is more worried about her ex-husband who bribed three state senators to pass a law that would allow the drug Divalpro to be put on the state's prior approved Medicaid drug list. She made a deal with federal agent Kat McCoy that she would allow the state to try her for murder if her ex-husband and daughter gain immunity from prosecution.Although Allison is protected as part of the deal, a terrorist from the Liberation Front kills her because they believe she knows that a doctor they are working with has developed a medicine that will kill millions. The reason they believe this is because her lover lobbyist Sam Dillon was going before the grand jury. They didn't know he had no idea about a terrorist plot but was going to testify about the bribery involving Allison's husband and daughter. Kat believes that if they capture the head of the Liberation Front Allison wouldn't have died in vain.This novel is told in reverse chronological order similar to the movie Memento, a writing technique that is brilliantly successful in David Ellis's capable hands. Even though readers know from the very first pages that Allison is murdered that adds suspense and enjoyment to this exciting thriller because although it looks like everyone's motive are clear-cut, as the story progresses readers will see that things are not as they appear. IN THE COMPANY OF LIARS demonstrates that some government operations are ugly and morally wrong regardless of the ends.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Russian: a Self-teaching Guide","review":"I have been studying in Russia (as a total beginner) and this is the only book I took with me.

However, that first impression quickly wore off after using it to teach Russian to my student, who had a familiarity with the alphabet, but nothing beyond that.My student and I have found that although the discussions of spelling and grammar or word usage were interesting and helpful... we have found a lot of problems: No cursive alphabet; no drawings of clocks, relatives, animals, food, \\"cheat charts of declensions\\", etc; not all of the words used in exercises are defined in the book; there are incorrectly spelled words; words are given for the first time in a case other than the nominative case, etc.I have been bringing my dictionary and verb conjugation book along with me to the classes I teach since a lot of words aren't defined in this book and there are very few verb conjugation examples in this book.After using this book for three months with my student, we are now looking for a \\"college textbook\\" since this one does not meet our needs."},{"Title":"Russian: a Self-teaching Guide","review":"Very good book, useful in teaching a class also in addition to being well arranged for self teaching."},{"Title":"Russian: a Self-teaching Guide","review":"my russian teacher (a native speaker) recommended this book to me after one of her other students left it behind. she thought the explanations of the lessons were very good, thorough and simple to understand. i tend to agree with her on this point, but unfortunately i probably would not recommend this book to a beginning russian learner.we've used the book on several occasions for homework assignments, but when my teacher corrects my work, the mistakes she finds are usually not my own....there are many spelling and grammatical errors throughout this book. woe be to the student who actually IS teaching himself russian. as if russian weren't confusing and difficult enough, your guide through the complicated declensions and myriad verbs of motion is sometimes more hindrance than help. i paid 84 cents for this book used on amazon and nearly every time i crack it open, i'm reminded that you get what you pay for.on the plus side, the explanations of the grammar that are offered in this book are very simple to understand and fairly concise. there are a lot of funny asides and the exercises are actually pretty entertaining! for a fun, relaxed, part-time dalliance with the russian language, this book is great. if you're looking for actual fluency, maybe just look to this one as a supplement to a real text book and a real tutor."},{"Title":"Russian: a Self-teaching Guide","review":"As a native Russian speaker, I can confidently say that this book is awful.

Pollitt is one of the most respected scholars of ancient Greek art, and with good reason. His analyses are clear, well-written, cautious, and highly logical. Art and Experience is a classic (!) work of Pollitt's early career. It is an authoritative and engaging introduction to the history of art in ancient Greece, focusing on the Classical period (fifth and fourth centuries BC). The book assumes a general familiarity with some ancient history, philosophy, and literature, so it might be most useful for students or enthusiasts of classical culture who feel that their understanding of classical art is lacking. Nonetheless, the text is introductory enough that even a reader with no background in classics could find the book interesting and informative.What makes this book a particularly valuable introduction to Greek art is that it aims to explain the motives and ideas behind the art rather than to provide the reader with a list of works and names of styles. Pollitt answers the question of why Classical Greek art looks like it does, and he thus gives his reader a framework for understanding individual works.I can level only two criticisms at the book, and they are both relatively picky. The first is that, because of the brevity of the book and its intended non-specialist audience, some of Pollitt's conclusions seem to me like logical leaps, and some of his arguments seem too summary to be fully convincing. I would have preferred a more comprehensive treatment with fuller explanations--something along the lines of Paul Zanker's Power of Images in the Age of Augustus. As an introduction, however, the extent of the arguments in Art and Experience is sufficient. My second criticism is that Pollitt at times reveals more personal value judgements regarding the art of ancient Greece than I thought were necessary or appropriate. This is no doubt in part the product of the period in which the book was written, when value judgement still played some role in the teaching of art history (it has since largely been abandoned). It also may relate to the intended audience: I am sure that some readers will be interested to hear what traditional considerations have made art historians consider certain works to be &quot;great.&quot; At the same time, readers should be wary of Pollitt's negative statements about some of the art (e.g., Hellenistic sculptures of children). The value of such art has recently been reevaluated by many art historians, including Pollitt himself, and the works do not deserve the dismissive tone apparent in Art and Experience.On a final note, readers should keep in mind that this book is intended to cover only a brief (though significant) period in the history of ancient Greek art. Because of its scope, this book does not provide a &quot;grand tour&quot; of all famous Greek art--works like the Nike (or Winged Victory) of Samothrace are not covered. While Art and Experience is a great way to begin an exploration of the art and culture of ancient Greece, for a full picture one must consult additional sources. I highly recommend following Art and Experience with Pollitt's masterful (and more scholarly, though still quite accessible) Art in the Hellenistic Age."},{"Title":"Art and Experience in Classical Greece","review":"Pollitt's book is one of those rare pieces of writing that rewards you with fresh insight each and every time you pick it up. It is beautifully and sensitively written, and manages to breathe remarkable life into the civilization of ancient Greece. This is a wonderful way to prepare for a trip to Greece--it will only make your travels even more rewarding. This is history at its best."},{"Title":"Art and Experience in Classical Greece","review":"Knowing little of Greek art, I happened upon this book in my shelves (an old college textbook belonging to my husband). I was pleased and impressed with this overview of Classical Greek art. Pollitt covers the main strands of development in architecture, sculpture, and painting and places the works firmly in the context of the historical events and cultural atmosphere of their times. As a result, I came away with an increased appreciation and understanding of the quality and value of Classical Greek art and of the interconnection between art and larger society in ancient Greece."},{"Title":"Art and Experience in Classical Greece","review":"[let this man speak for himself...]A thoughtful observer of these events, likeAeschylus, could not but have felt uneasiness.Were the Greek cities and the factions withinthem being drawn, through their quest for powereven at the expenses of principle, into thecycle of *hybris*, *ate*, and *nemesis* whichthey themselves had seen in the undoing of thePersians? In a world where Zeus punished*hybris*, where men reaped the fruits of theirown actions, were they sowing the seeds oftheir own downfall?&quot;...be mindful, men of Greece and Athens,lest one among you, disdaining in hismind the fortune of the present, andlusting after more, waste the greatblessings he has...&quot;the ghost of Darius had said in the *Persians.*These fears, and with them the vivid memoryof what destruction actually means (particularlyin Athens,which had been sacked and ruined bythe Persians) must have been strong motivatingforces in the creation of the serious andmeditative character of so much Early Classicalart. The &quot;Aspasia,&quot; the Charioteer of Delphi,and even the very early &quot;Blond Boy&quot; from theAthenian acropolis all seem to be attempts toembody the ideals of thoughtful restraint andresponsibility which the Greeks were so frequentlyprone to forget.

But it's still a very imaginitive work and many parts made me laugh out loud. All in all, it's very satisfying.It uses a very clever premise to end the series: Samurai Cat descending into the depths of Hell to avenge his master, where he can re-encounter all of his foes who perished by his blade (or gun, or grenade, or ...) in the previous books. Admittedly, a first-time Samurai Cat reader probably won't catch all the references.So if you've been following Samurai Cat through the years, what are you waiting for?

If you enjoyed &quot;On Methuselah's Trail&quot; I'm sure you will enjoy &quot;Time Machines.&quot; The two books dovetail interestingly -- for example in &quot;On Methuselah's Trail&quot; Ward describes an encounter with an angry Basque who points to holes drilled in the rocks near Zumaya in northern Spain. We don't learn why he drilled the holes in &quot;Methuselah&quot; but in &quot;Time Machines&quot; we learn that he was trying to study paleomagnetism, and why. The fact that it didn't work in this instance just becomes part of Ward's compelling story. It's hard to praise Ward enough -- so many books about paleontology are boring or wordy or overly self-serving.

They should be of great interest and real value to students, counterintelligence analysts, and all those who continue to marvel at the early days of counterintelligence in America.\\" I would like to add that from Krivitsky's debrifings one can see how little MI5 knew about the Soviet intelligence, both the NKVD and the Fourth Department, but what is most amazing - how little Krivitsky himself knew about Soviet secret services. All what he revealed about their structure and personnel is false. His correct information only concerned several Soviet spies and illegals.

Stanley Stellar has combined great skill and a host of subjects to produce a book that is truly unique. Most books of this nature have a certain theme or mood attached to them. This is not the case with Stellar Men. There are photographs ranging from the beuaty of the male form to the darker side of homo-eroticism. This book has something to offer for almost every artistic eye. Stellar has an ability to focus more on the importance and impact of the male form to art, than just glorifying the nude body. Every page gives an example of this ability in a varitety of ways. Overall, I feel Stellar Men surpasses &quot;coffee table&quot; status, and has found it's place as an example of photography and art.

Longenecker systematically presents the foundational and relevant information necessary for all the NT students.It covers the Jewish background like Midrash, Pesher, and allegory etc. It also includes how Jesus, Paul, and the early Christians preachings uses the OT. Particluarly helpful to me is the session on Paul in which Longenecker listed Paul's quotation of the OT and then traces his exegetical techniques back to the Hebrew roots. I consider these basics for any work on NT exegesis which takes seriously the continutiy between the NT and the OT."},{"Title":"Biblical Exegesis in the Apostolic Period","review":"Everyone interested in biblical studies should have a copy of this book.By the time of Second Temple Judaism, scriptures, whether written or oral, were regarded as having been divinely inspired. \\"Jewish exegesis of the first century can generally be clasified under four headings: literalist, midrashic, pesher, and allegorical\\" (p 28), with midrashic exegesis more usual than literalist.Also worth noting about Judaism around the time of Christ is the fact that the Jews were likely \\"bi and probably tri-lingual\\" (p 64) in Palestine. Although there were various kinds of Judaism, all Jews were expected to recite the Shema, which declared the monotheism of Judaism, every day.Early Christianity sought out correspondences in history. Pesher interpretation is also common. The \\"'Servant Song' while never accepted by Judaism to be applicable to the Messiah, could very well have been fixed quite early in Christian thought, stemming from Jesus' own reinterpretation of the passage\\" (p 102).Paul mentions some one hundred Old Testament passages. Although Paul usually follows the original meaning of the texts, in some instances he find new historical or eschatological fulfilments.Of course, all the gospels are drenched in Old Testament references. Notable especially is the new use of typology.A classic reference book."},{"Title":"Biblical Exegesis in the Apostolic Period","review":"If you've had enough of critics shoving the ignorant rantings of Thomas Paine, Robert Ingersoll, Jim Lippard, Dennis McKinsey, and so on in your face on the topic of the New Testament's use of the Old, then you can scramble their brains once and for all with this detailed thunderclap provided by Richard Longenecker. The aforementioned skeptics complain violently about how the NT authors supposedly misused and twisted the OT for their own purposes. Longenecker shows that such complaining is simply anachronistic -- the NT writers were interpreting and explicating within an established paradigm and methodology consistent with Jewish hermeneutics of the period, as evidenced in the works of the rabbis, Philo, and the Qumranites.This hermenuetic did not sit simply with the literal reading of the text, but assumed a fuller sense that could be unlocked by events of the day. The twin principles of corporate solidarity and typological correspondence are a key here, and while Western, wooden minds will scoff nevertheless, the charge that the NT writers manipulated the texts for their own purposes is thereby destroyed.The simple-minded literalism of the Paines will take a beating from the details provided in Biblical Exegesis in the Apostolic Period."},{"Title":"Biblical Exegesis in the Apostolic Period","review":"Point: The New Testament authors used hermeneutic principles which were available and acceptable at the time of their writing. The Old Testament was not merely a source of proof-texts, but the living Word of God, pointing to Jesus Christ.Path: Longenecker presents a horizontal view (13) of the first century scenario by walking through several parallel areas of Jewish and Christian exegesis. He first overviews Jewish hermeneutics as a whole with their literal, midrashic, pesher, and allegorical interpretations. He moves from the broad scope of Jewish hermeneutics to Jesus' use of the Old Testament, demonstrating the wide and varied use of the Scriptures in Jesus' teaching. He then addresses the early Christian preaching which followed closely the example of Jesus. Next, Paul's Old Testament use is evaluated. The author then looks at the Gospels, and how each author uses Scripture. Hebrews, arguably the book which relies the most on OT quotations, is discussed, and then other Jewish letters such as James, 1 Peter, etc. The author finishes with an overview of New Testament exegesis.The Jewish interpreters agreed on four basic points, according to Longenecker. These four points were 1) divine inspiration of the Scriptures. 2) The Torah contained the the entire truth of God for the guidance of mankind. 3) The Scriptures needed to be understood both in their plain meaning and the implied meaning. 4) They saw their role as making the words of God meaningful and relevant to their audience (19-20). The final analysis of the author's study of Jewish hermeneutics is that \\"both the Pharisaic teachers and the nonconformists exegetes employed literalist interpretation, particularly in halakic concerns\\" (48-49).The reader must understand that the early Christian preachers used a variety of methods including literal interpretation, midrash, pesher, and the application of predictive prophecies. They did not hold to a wooden hermeneutical method, but sought to interpret \\"the Scriptures from a Christocentric perspective, in conformity with the exegetical teaching and example of Jesus, and along Christological lines\\" (103).Paul, although not one of the original apostles, did have contact with the risen Lord, been commissioned by him, and had direct revelation concerning salvation history (132). The Gospel writers, specifically Matthew and John, used Scripture in a way which was divergent from the other writers. There methods were distinct, yet still in line with the Jewish hermeneutics of their time (133).Longenecker concludes with the observation that 1) the New Testament writers did not have a mechanical process of proof texting their arguments with Scripture 2) nor did they twist or distort God's revelation (206). Rather, the New Testament authors interpreted the Old Testament \\"1) from a Christocentric perspective, 2) in conformity with a Christian tradition, and 3) along Christological lines\\" (206).After addressing the various methods employed by the NT authors, Longenecker offers an answer to the oft asked question, \\"Should we do as they do?\\" When the exegesis is claiming revelation, is merely cultural, or circumstantial, the answer is \\"no.\\" When, however, it interprets Scriptures more literally with Christ at the center, the answer is \\"yes\\" (219). His foundation is the inspiration of Scripture. Could the New Testament writers do it? Yes. Can we do everything they did? Not unless you believe your writings to be inspired.Longenecker's primary interest lies in three areas. First, he addresses the specific exegetical practices of the first century. Second, he focuses on the range and use of biblical quotations at the hand of the writers. Third, he traces the \\"patterns of usage and development that appear in the various strata of the biblical citations...\\" (12). He addresses these three issues so that the student may understand the hermeneutical procedures themselves, appreciate the objective of biblical revelation, and determine what is descriptive and what is prescriptive in the biblical revelation (217).I appreciated the author's multifaceted approach to New Testament hermeneutics. He did not attempt to squeeze the authors and their message into a tight box, but rather sought to allow them to say what they said. The hermeneutics of the NT authors is a topic which deserves much study. Longenecker has provided a valuable resources to help the reader along the way."},{"Title":"Biblical Exegesis in the Apostolic Period","review":"At one point in this great work, the author quotes another researcher, \\"it is doubtful whether we can hope to understand the contents of any mind whose presuppositions we have not yet learned to recognize.\\" This is the key to any hermeneutic. Until we understand the presuppositions of the authors, we cannot hope to truly understand the message they wanted to convey. We can learn those presuppositions by observing how they use the texts of scripture that preceded them and taking into account the hermeneutical context in which they were trained. The study of writings like the dead sea scrolls (see also,The Modern Scholar: The Dead Sea Scrolls: The Truth behind the Mystique) have given us a great deal of insight into the exegetical methods of second-temple Judaism. We are remiss if we do not take advantage of that scholarship in understanding the new testament writings. Reducing the texts to the lifeless literalism of historical-criticism, for instance, will lead us down a path away from the original authors' mindset. In addition to the peculiarities of second-temple Jewish hermeneutics, we need to remember the context of the effects of the incarnation and resurrection. Whether those events are believed as truth by the one attempting to glean meaning from the scriptures - it must be accepted that the writers of those texts believed the events had occurred as recorded. Understanding the mindset of these writers in the context of having seen a risen Christ will alter how we interpret what they wrote. It is not enough to study the works of scripture in the context of history and philology and claim we are following only scientific methods. It is not scientific to ignore the context in which the authors were writing - the context of their faith in a risen savior and the context of a community of others with the same faith.This is a must-have work for any seeking to truly understand the new testament in the most complete context possible. Very well done and with plenty of examples from scripture to illustrate the concepts it contains. A must have for any student of exegetical methods."},{"Title":"Biblical Exegesis in the Apostolic Period","review":"For years I had wondered why the New Testament writers didn't always quote the Old Testament in a literal and exact manner, but were somewhat more flexible, sometimes even creative with the text. This comprehensive book explains why this is. The author analyses all the quotations and finds four different types - literal and allegorical (both of these terms mean pretty much what they say), Midrash (using interpretive rules which Jewish scholars had worked out, and which result in often loose and non-literal interpretations) and Pesher (in which the writing is re-interpreted in the light of later events - in this case, mostly the coming of Jesus). It turns out that literal is not the most common way of interpreting - Jesus tends to use Pesher the most, and Paul tends to use Midrash.The book is very useful in understanding that truth does not always have to be expressed in literal forms - an obvious thing, but sometimes forgotten by Bible students. The last chapter addresses the very interesting question of what all this has to say about how we interpret the Bible today - can we also use these creative approaches? Unfortunately, the author doesn't really come to grips with this question (possibly not surprising since it is an academic book).There's a lot of detail in this book which will be useful for reference. I heartily recommend it for anyone who wants to better understand the Old Testament in the light of the New."},{"Title":"Playboy, November 1999 (MIA ST JOHN)","review":"Cover : Mia St. JohnPlaymate : Cara WakelinInterview : Jesse Ventura20 Questions : George JonesPictorials : Sex In Cinema 1999, The KnockoutPublication Date: November 1999"},{"Title":"Fast Ball","review":"Good story, great character deveolpment, blind-siding surprise ending.

The romance is fun, too."},{"Title":"An Unsuitable Attachment","review":"AN UNSUITABLE ATTACHMENT might be called the most typical of Barbara Pym's novels, which is a bit surprising because it was one that was famously rejected by her publisher in the mid 1960s, leading to her long spell when she did not publish until she was famously rediscovered over a decade later (and was nominated for the Booker Prize for QUARTET IN AUTUMN). All the types you'll find in other Pym novels--the unmarried woman leaving the bloom of youth doing research or filing work for others; the gentle vicar; his eccentric wife; the preoccupied anthropologist--are present here, and the central questions (as always) center upon marriage and happiness in distressed but genteel circumstances. This is not one of the Pym books that absolutely knocks your socks off for either its humor or its construction, but it's still well crafted and very funny (in Pym's gentle and unsurprising way). There's a great cat that figures as much into the plot as nearly any of the humans, and a splendid and very recognizable set-piece of most of the major characters taking a vacation in Rome where they flirt with one another (always one of the preoccupations of any Pym novel, and probably why she has so often been compared a bit misleadingly to Jane Austen)."},{"Title":"An Unsuitable Attachment","review":"Perhaps my favorite of all Pym's novels for its poignancy, humor, sly social observations, its recognition of social and economic changes going on in England at the time, its wry accounts of workplace interaction, its great treatment of class, the Church, love in its many forms, courtship......A superb comedy of manners......Not cool or brittle, though: Pym loves her characters."},{"Title":"An Unsuitable Attachment","review":"In 1977, Philip Larkin (who was offered but declined the honor of Poet Laureate) famously co-authored an article in the _Times Literary Supplement_ in which he described Pym, who had just published her seventh novel, as \\"the most underrated writer of the 20th century.\\" That acclaim from a respected source helped, but she still never achieved the sort of recognition she deserved from the general reading public, and it's a puzzle why that never happened. Several of her books, in fact, were rejected by publishers when first written and were not published until after her death, years later. That's the case with this one, which was actually written, and was set, in 1963.Like many of Pym's books, the principle themes are the often confused relationships between men and women, who seem never to quite understand each other, and the unsettled place of the church in modern Britain. Ianthe Broome, the properly raised daughter of a canon of the C of E, is left in moderate comfort by her late parents. She works as a librarian (an acceptably ladylike profession), which doesn't pay much, but she still has enough money to buy a small house in a not-posh area of north London. She becomes acquainted with the residents of the nearby parish vicarage, the Rev. Mark Ainger and his wife, Sophia, and the latter almost immediately begins trying to find her a husband (apparently seeing that as one of the primary duties of a vicar's wife). Sophia's unmarried younger sister, Penelope, is in the market, too, and the two women decide her best bet would be another new resident in the neighborhood, anthropologist Rupert Stonebird. (An academic is nearly always an acceptable husband, however dull and otherwise intellectually engaged he might be.) But what will they do if Rupert shows a preference for the slim, well-dressed, nicely presented Ianthe? But then John Challow comes to work at the library, a young man five years younger than Ianthe, and with a background in small-time acting, who nevertheless takes an immediate interest in her, somewhat to her confusion. (He, of course would be entirely UN-suitable in the eyes of all the other women in the story.) Next door to the vicarage live veterinarian Edwin Pettigrew and his unmarried sister, Daisy, whose mission in life is to minister to small animals, whom she is convinced are being mistreated by practically everyone -- especially foreigners.That's the principal cast and Pym brings them into contact with each other and watches their reactions and the assumptions (usually incorrect) they form about each other. And nearly all of them are sympathetic characters, even the often irritating Mervyn Cantrell, Ianthe's and John's boss at the library, and who also covets Ianthe -- or her heirloom furniture, at least. The chapters dealing with the parish field trip to Rome are especially good, with the newly-arrived English ladies immediately setting off in search of a cup of tea, while Daisy, who has packed a supply of tinned cat food in her capacious purse, is hopeful of discovering indigent Italian felines. But during their visit, Ianthe also discovers quite another, somewhat unsettling side to her friend, Sophia. The interesting thing is that the flavor of Pym's writing is almost Edwardian -- matching the mindset of many of the characters -- and the reader may forget that the setting is actually the early 1960s, until some casual reference yanks one back to the present (which is now forty years in our own past). It may simply be that this sort of gently written, quietly amusing English comedy of manners is simply too old-fashioned to appeal to 21st-century readers, but that's a shame."},{"Title":"An Unsuitable Attachment","review":"If you like novels of manners, this is a good one set in a modern period.

The famous lightness of wit is quite absent, replaced by a turgid narrative about a group of sad unattractive characters, none of whom are even satirized, and for whom I felt nothing at all. Worse still, the Church, although always quietly present in her works, seems to have got such a grip on the writer's psyche, that she is unable to put together three lines without some reference to it, even when it is irrelevant to the action. My feeling is that she had come to the end of a long creative spell and needed a long rest. And this is what happened. When she returned to write many years later, she was a new person.Having said all this, I warmly recommend all her other books."},{"Title":"William Shakespeare (Home university library of modern knowledge)","review":"was a wonderful way to read the classicswill be checking out more and wonderful way to expose my children to these wonderful stories"},{"Title":"Experiments in Astronomy for Amateurs","review":"If you'd like to have fun with astronomy on the cheap, this is your book.

If you're a fan of Flannery O'Conner, I urge you to read Purdy - you will not be disappointed. &quot;Eustace Chisholm&quot; is a stunning achievement. A compelling tale of unrequited love,self loathing, and horror. This is a great train wreck of a book, filled with charcaters and situations you may wish you'd never encountered, and yet you are compelled by forces ungovernable to continue reading. Yes, the material is dark. The characters fail to come together in any positive ways - quite the contrary. Purdy has populated his tale with emotional illiterates; people who most assuredly feel that God has forgotten them. The story of Amos and Daniel is rife with symbolism - innocence corrupted, love demonized, self flagellation - it's all here. The conclusion is quite stunning, horrible and real. Purdy is a true American original, a Gay author who wrote about gay people long before it was fashionable to do so. DO NOT LET THIS ONE GET AWAY UNREAD."},{"Title":"Eustace Chisholm & the Works","review":". .and top-notch all the way! EUSTACHE CHISHOLM AND THE WORKS doesn't fit into easy subgenre or marketing categorizations because its era (bottom of the Depression ca. 1931), setting (the incredibly diverse Hyde Park district of South Side Chicago, near the U. of Chicago campus) and cast of characters (de facto leader Eustace Chisholm and his \\"works,\\" a bunch of guys semi-squatting in a tax-overdue house) are difficult to type after seventy years of New Deal, Joseph McCarthy, Vietnam, and Televangelism. Taken strictly on its own terms, EUSTACE comes across as a work of 1930s social realism (although written in the 1960s), a masterfully wrought work, nicely nuanced yet accessible . . . and great fun.Principal players are title character Eustace Chisholm and his \\"works,\\" a kind of rough-hewn rat pack who rely on their de facto leader's one-day-at-a-time problem-solving as they face the ironic stresses that the rest of the USA also faced during the early 1930s--living in a capitalist economy without capital. Their situation was hardly unique. From farm to town to metropolis, one-third of a nation found itself unemployed and--most trying of all--the Hoover administration, following pre-Keynesian economic policy, paradoxically pulled back on the federal money supply, upwardly sucking the currency from use, recovery and hope. (Think of Studs Terkel's *HARD TIMES* and other oral accounts of the Great Depression, the common refrain: \\"All of a sudden there was no money!\\") A great deal of this novel's comic tension lies between the conditional sympathy many readers will feel toward the lead characters and their demi-monde and the automatic fellow-feeling wired in the American DNA toward their economic plight as mass casualties of the Great Depression's fiscal meltdown.In concert with Eustace's innate wisdom and street smarts, \\"The Works\\" understood that life in a money-free money economy made them something like Busby Berkeley's \\"Golddiggers\\" of movie fame: They were \\"in the money\\" because they \\"had a lot of what it [took] to get along.\\" If that meant the occasional venture into horizontal service, well, German playwright Bertolt Brecht puts it nicely: *Erst das Fressen, dann die Moral*: \\"Food first, morals afterward.\\" EUSTACE is certainly worth reading with a queer eye, but it is no more totally beholden to the canon of Gay Literature than is BABBITT totally a book about Real Estate.It's Purdy's great gift--as previous reviewers have hymned so well--that he can find sweetness in the ordinary and in what (to many people) might sound sordid and mean. Crucial to this is that he does so without distortion, propagandizing or advocacy. This is REAL literature, and sadly overlooked at that. Eustace & Co. are a mixture of sugar and spice, compromise and charm. As such, they are just as much in the American grain as Mose and Addie Pray in the novella that sparked the movie *PAPER MOON*: shrewd little Addie understands that sometimes a five-buck Bible might be worth $50 to a wealthy widow and sometimes--as to a poverty-wracked farm family--the only compassionate thing is to give it away as \\"prepaid\\". And what are more quintessentially 20th-Century American than marketing compounding by the pinpoint timing of arbitrage?Purdy is such a gifted narrator that he shows the compelling and even witty existential freedom of that pre-Holocaust, pre-AIDS world in which the only givens truly were death and taxes--but either could be held at bay for quite a while with cunning and friendly solidarity. This book speaks to a \\"modern\\"--which is to say universal--sensibility. Read it with an open mind and you'll find it will go straight to an open heart, with frequent forays into your funny bone and social awareness."},{"Title":"Eustace Chisholm & the Works","review":"No better way to start this short little review with one of the most beautiful titles ever found (by Purdy): Color of Darkness. Almost all of Purdy's work can be characterized by this metaphor. His most famous works (Eustace Chisholm, Malcolm, Narrow Rooms, In A Shallow Grave) belong to the most mysteriously beautiful American novels ever and the literature of the whole Western World. Truly American in characters, truly universal in themata, truly disturbing in effect. He reminded me of those other greatgreatgreat American authors, Flannery o'Connor, Faulkner and Poe. Younger authors like Easton Ellis and the likes of him are simply looking bleak and lifeless compared with Purdy, although i also liked reading them.Purdy's work is really about Love and the disturbing effects of it on humans and the human society. Never was there an American author who understood so deeply the fundamental qualities and nature of Human Love, clearifying it, to make the reader understand, to feel the fundamental and terrible force of it. I can't even begin to tell about the beauty of his work. I read Eustace Chisholm, Narrow Rooms, In A Shallow Grave years and years ago, I don't even know whether Purdy lives or is dead, but the effect of his work is there, again and again, never to leave anymore. I can only wish there was more of such work.I am so glad that there are still Americans who also appreciate his work, and that they write so highly regarding of him. People all over the world should read it, especially in these days when the ultimate form of love seems primarily to be transformed into the Love For...Homeland ...Read it, for God's sake."},{"Title":"Eustace Chisholm & the Works","review":"I cannot remember having read a book that made me souneasy. Why read it then, you may ask? Because, as the liberal mindedperson I thought I was (liberal)before reading this book. I liked to be accepting of all aspects of human desire, however concocted they seemed to me. The book abuses that spirit by presenting desires that are hard to accept as &quot;humane&quot; or &quot;healthy&quot;, while at the same time the fulfilment of those desires are convincingly portrayed as redeeming and liberating. But how can I accept what to me seems most gruelsome? I think the book showed me that what I thought was my liberal accepting spirit, was in fact more some sort of... curiosity. I feel all the better for it."},{"Title":"Eustace Chisholm & the Works","review":"At the June 2007 meeting of the NYC LGBT Center book discussion group, we discussed \\"Eustace Chisholm and the Works\\" by James Purdy.While some of us found the story and individual episodes moving and understood why this novel has been re-printed (and the author re-discovered), other readers thought that it was a horrible book and would never read anything by this author again. Several readers sort of liked the book but couldn't recommend it.Rarely has a novel uncovered such a schism among attendees. Some of the prose was very \\"purple\\" (during the discussion, it was compared to a text version of Tom of Finland cartoon imagery) and the story itself was wandering, but the style made it interesting.

The explanations, examples, and problems are well written and can be followed without cross referencing other texts and pages on the web. You will learn the basics here without too much of a fuss.Unfortunately, the book has a nasty habit of circular proofs. The author leaves out vital parts of the explanation in the text, referencing other parts of the text, which reference other parts of the text, and then ask you to solve the underlying proof yourself without explaining the fundamentals at all. The book also references FORWARD into chapters you have not gotten to yet in order to solve current proofs. This is not at all helpful. If your professor requires you to solve any of the proofs in any section you will be lost. Good luck.Chapter 6 is an all-around disaster. Unless you have seen the material before, you will not get it here. The explanation at the beginning of the chapter cannot really be called an explanation. It is more of an obfuscation. The notation is not explained, it is assumed you know it or can figure it out on your own. The proofs in this chapter are a maze of unexplained concepts and hidden information.Chapters 8 and 10 are more like the first chapters in usability, but the proofs are just as jumbled.Intervening chapters from the ones I have described are applications of the material from previous chapters and are optional.Buy another book (or two or three) as a supplement.

I also felt I needed something to undo the prejudices I had formed against the main character from seeing The Man of La Mancha. Johnson provides an excellent orientation to the many things going on in the novel. His scholarship is current and insightful; the extended discussion in the chapters \\"A Book about Books\\" and \\"Readers and Reading\\" were especially helpful. I also liked his explanations about how Parts I and II relate to one another (part II is clearly more than just a sequel or \\"more adventures\\"). Johnson concludes his study by revealing his own personal reading of the text. I found it plausible (it's mostly a psychological reading), but Johnson by no means suggests that his reading is conclusive or better than any other reader's reading. This is a book I plan to keep at hand as I begin (once again) to try to make it all the way through Cervantes' classic and ground-breaking novel."},{"Title":"Don Quixote: The Quest for Modern Fiction (Twayne's Masterwork Studies)","review":"I'm a fan of the Twayne's series of studies, which offer an undergraduate course in about 100 pages. Johnson's little book on Don Quixote is one of the best. It's much better than either the Nabokov book or the studies in the Norton edition, all of which are chatty and interesting but not very helpful in coming to terms with Cervantes' long, often boring, brilliant novel. Johnson provides enough dollops of literary theory, history, biography, culture, and critical exegesis for the reader to really start to work independently. What I liked most was his final reading of Quixote as a man fleeing his incestuous desire for his niece, madly projecting and fantasizing to relieve the pressure. His description of a world where Moors and Jews lived secret lives while passing as Christians, ne'er-do-well aristocrats like Quijano suffered lives of quiet desperation, and encounters with the Other in the New World radically altered Western consciousness at the very time that print brought people into closer communion, provided grist for many hours of thought and appreciation.

Perhaps the fastest-paced of all Haggard's many novels, it races from one highspot to another with manly verve and vivid scene-setting. The stalwart Eric and his &quot;thrall&quot; Skallagrim fight back to back against a horde of foes, while two beautiful women vie for Eric's love. The eerie battle at sea is an exciting read in itself, to say nothing of all the rest. Eric is one of the most virile of Haggard's heroes and, like so many of them, is susceptible to earthly temptations and ambitions---unlike Haggard's too often impossibly spiritual females. The reader familiar with Haggard's favourite &quot;archetypes&quot; will recognize in Eric, Skallagrim, Gudruda the Fair, and the wicked Swanhilde the traits of a cast of characters immortalized under other names, in other times and places, in other titles of his famous canon. &quot;Eric Brighteyes&quot; is also distinguished by an interesting author's preface that furnishes some insight into Haggard's imaginative overlay of &quot;high romance&quot; and occult themes on what, in a writer of less lively invention, might have been just a simple adventure story. Both heroes and villains come on strong with splendid confrontational dialogue before coming to blows. A feast for escapists of all ages! Long may it remain in print."},{"Title":"Eric Brighteyes","review":"The author of numerous romance-adventures in the 19th century tradition, Haggard turned his hand, at least once, to the older saga tradition of the northern peoples. The result may well have been his best work. Skillfully crafted, this tale proceeds at breakneck pace to unfold the saga-like adventures of the stout Icelandic yeoman, Eric Thorgrimurs' son (surnamed 'Brighteyes' for his most notable trait), as he struggles to win the hand of his beloved, Gudruda the Fair, despite the vigorous opposition of her half-sister, Swanhild the Fatherless (who seeks Eric for her own). Caught between these two beautiful women and faced with the need to overcome the opposition of Gudruda's father, Asmund the Priest (not the Christian sort) and his son, the greedy Bjorn (who would prefer to marry his sister off to a wealthy chieftain in lieu of a liaison with the farmer's son Eric), our hero must prove himself worthy of his destined bride while dodging the snares of those who would unman him. Conspiring with her mysterious mother, Groa the witchwife, Swanhild arranges to have Ospakar Blacktooth, a northern chieftain from Swinefells, pay Asmund's household a visit in order to see and woo Gudruda for himself. This Ospakar and Eric become immediate foes for Ospakar is as ugly and vile as Eric is handsome and honorable. And the tale only accelerates from here. From death-defying feats of derring-do to duels between deadly foemen to treachery and mayhem in blinding blizzards and on the high seas, this is an adventure which, once having grabbed you, will not let you go. Written in an archaic prose, mirroring the old nineteenth century translations of the original Icelandic sagas, and intended to simulate the voice of the old sagas themselves, the power of this narrative is compelling and unrelenting. And yet it is less exhausting than exhilirating as it unfolds the tale of Eric and the two women who loved him -- no matter what the cost. If the tale has a flaw at all it is that the characters are not real in any sense of that word but only larger-than-life actors who strut about upon the stage which Haggard has drawn for us here. At the same time the sensibility offered is one of pure and unmitigated adventure. But it's great fun and marvelous escapist fare. A must for lovers of Norse and viking times.SWMauthor ofThe King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"Eric Brighteyes","review":"Stanley Kubrick always wanted to make a movie of this book.

Discovered in this perfidy, she is married off against herwill to a visiting Orkney Earl, Atli the Good, who is well on in yearsand sent off with him to the Orkneys. Eric again reveals his warliketalents in another ambush by Ospakar's minions, this time at sea, butis finally taken captive with Skallagrim due to the dastardliness of Eric's own first mate. Yet Eric is able to free himself when warned ofthe impending treachery of his captors by the sorcerous interventionof Swanhild who has continued to monitor his progress from her unhappyabode in Atli's hall. Eric goes on to a distinguished career in theservice of the English King Edmund but refuses all of that king'surgings to remain with him at the royal court once his three yearoutlawry is up. Turning his back on the royal largesse (including alovely royal bride), Eric takes ship to Iceland on a road which musttake them past the Orkney Islands. Now Swanhild the witchwife of Atli,perceiving Eric's return raises a storm to overthrow his ship,beaching him on the very island where Atli has his hall. Atli isdelighted at the arrival of such a heroic guest but Swanhild contrivesto have Eric to herself while Atli and his men are away and she soontempts and seduces this paragon among vikings, using a love draught ofher own concoction. In the end, Eric is distraught to realize that hehas betrayed his beloved Gudruda and flees from Swanhild's embrace --but too late, for she has betrayed him to Atli in revenge for hisdesertion of her. And she has taken a clipping of Eric's fine goldenhair to send to her half-sister, together with a token that only Eric could have had. Gudruda, on receiving this and on hearing the lyingtale Swanhild has concocted to go with it, angrily vows to break herengagement to Eric and agrees to wed Ospakar instead. Eric thereafterarrives in Iceland, a scorned man (for having betrayed and finallykilled Atli his host in the aftermath of his indiscretion withSwanhild) only to learn of Gudruda's plans to wed Ospakar. He makeshis way to Asmund's hall (though that viking worthy has also nowpassed on to his reward) on the eve of the much heralded wedding and,in a fierce confrontation, reveals the truth of their betrayal toGudruda. The result is more bloodshed including the death of themiscreant groom Ospakar and of Bjorn Asmundsson. But Swanhild is alsopresent and with Ospakar's son Gizur she contrives to deny Eric andGudruda their final happiness, even now. Gudruda dreams a dream ofOdin the All-Father and in it he grants her one night of pleasure withher beloved before taking this hero for his own. Thereafter and withthe momentary cessation of the killing, Eric and Gudruda wed. But inthe morning they are attacked while still asleep, for Swanhildsecretly guides Gizur into their bedchamber and directs his hand tothe killing of Eric. But it is to Gudruda's fair head she guides the sword which Gizur holds and not to Eric's so that when Eric wakes hefinds his beloved dead in his arms. Beside himself with grief, Ericburies his new bride and now Gizur leads his followers and the menwhom Swanhild has brought with her from the Orkneys against Eric andSkallagrim. To make their final stand, these two flee together to thenearby heights. And there they turn to face their foes in a bloodyscene worthy of the gotterdammerung itself. Here Eric and Skallagrimcut down their enemies in one last orgy of killing and vengefulrecriminations and, in his own last dying moments, Eric seizes Gizurand plunges with him over the cliff to their common doom. In the endonly Swanhild is left to supervise the funeral arrangements on boardthe viking ship she has selected for this purpose and to sing thedeath song, as she and the bodies of Eric and his faithful servantSkallagrim burn on a pyre of those men they have slain betweenthem. Haggard wrote his tale with the romanticist's flair, making anartist's use of Shakespeare's English to evoke the antique flavor ofthese events, and giving full rein to his love for the occult --though such rein is rarely encountered in the real sagasthemselves. Nor are the sagas usually so tightly drawn as this, while they are frequently a great deal more realistic in their portrayal ofpeople and the motives which drive them. If there is criticism to belevied here it's that the tale, itself, is much too pat and thecharacters, though sharply drawn, are not real folk in any normalsense of that word -- they are players only who never breathe thebreath of real life, or even briefly fool us that they do, albeit theyare larger than life actors with parts to play in a whopping goodtale.

This resulted in a white screen and I could tell if the Kindle was on or off. I could get no response at all from the Kindle. I thought it had killed my Kindle but about 2 hours later, I looked at the Kindle and saw the sleep screen. Without thinking I tried to open \\"Eric Brighteyes\\" again and the same thing happened again. This time I deleted it from my device and put it aside. I was traveling in China and didn't want to lose access to my other books on it. Later, back in the US, I tried it again under more controlled conditions with someone to show it to see if they could figure the problem out. It happened again and neither of us could make any sense of it.I hope someone at the Kindle store reads this and checks it out.

Travels in an Age of Vanishing Cultures and Extinction","review":"Warning: This travel guide is not designed for the &quot;accidental tourist,&quot; the person who travels to foreign lands hoping only to recreate a faraway, expensive version of his homeland. This book is for anyone who wants to travel not only for pleasure, but also for knowledge. With humor and incredible insight, Phil Karber writes of his adventures in the lands he has visited, lands that most of us will only see on National Geo specials. Karber immerses himself in each culture, learning as much as he can about the history, philosophy, people, and customs of each country that he visits. After reading this book, the reader will feel as if he, too, has visited each place Karber describes. This book is a must-have for anyone who plans to travel to these exotic locales, but it is also a delightful way for those of us who lack the courage, time, or funds to travel to experience places that may no longer exist in a few year's time."},{"Title":"Yak Pizza To Go!

Travels in an Age of Vanishing Cultures and Extinction","review":"While visiting family members in Arkansas over Easter weekend, I happened to read a review for the book Yak Pizza to Go by Arkansas native Phil Karber. The excerpts from the book in the review left me craving more and as soon as it came out, I purchased a copy. I was not disappointed. As an avid traveler (I believe I may have run into Karber while visiting Sapa, Vietnam), this book is incredibly interesting and entertaining. Unlike most travel books that only tell you where to eat, sleep, and drink, Yak Pizza To Go provides the reader with this information along with a capsule summary of the history and culture of the regions that Karber has visited. From the bia hoas of Hanoi, Vietnam to meeting fellow Arkansan Hillary Clinton at the Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania, Karber's informative and at times sarcastic stories along with vivid and accurate descriptions of these places flooded me with memories of my own journeys and a longing to visit others. This book is a must read for anyone who is serious about traveling and getting the most out of their experiences to foreign lands."},{"Title":"Yak Pizza To Go!

This impressive written and presented treatise by Pierre-Andre Taguieff (a philosopher, historian, and research director who teaches political studies in Paris) is a frightening revelation of new trends and the informational resource to go to when seeking a survey of anti-Jewish incidents and attacks on Jewish symbols. Rising From The Muck aptly documents hundreds of attacks against French Jews in the last few years, considers the underlying sentiments and methods of these new attacks, and studies these case histories as evidence of the rise of a new antisemitism in Europe as a whole."},{"Title":"Rising From the Muck: The New Anti-Semitism in Europe","review":"This short but well-annotated book makes some worthwhile points. It starts by showing that the repulsive \\"zionism\\" opposed by modern antisemites is an imaginary construct. Actual Zionism \\"has always been the national movement of a Jewish people deprived of support, a hunted people, a victim of genocide which risked annihilation if it made a mistake.\\" Meanwhile, the international pampering of Arafat's anti-Israelis is \\"without precedent in modern history,\\" a fact that has encouraged Arabs to reject compromises and peace proposals.Taguieff supplies us with six main features of the \\"new global Judeophobia.\\" They are (1) massive and virulent use of anti-racism for anti-Jewish purposes (such as at the infamous Durban conference in 2001), (2) denunciation of the \\"Holocaust industry,\\" (3) radical critiques of neoliberal globalization, (4)massive uncritical reception of the myth of innocent Arab victims of Jewish persecution, (5) extreme Israelophobic discourse, and (6) monopolization of the words \\"racism\\" and \\"genocide\\" to benefit Muslims and Arabs and to obliterate the history of their victims.All in all, it is a scholarly discussion of the ideas behind modern antisemitism."},{"Title":"Rising From the Muck: The New Anti-Semitism in Europe","review":"First published in French in 2002, this pioneering work on the new antisemitism or Judeophobia has proved prophetic. The author identified several important factors that were obscure at the time but are obvious by now. The trends he observed in France have since spread to other European countries. He analyses the process by which Zionism became demonized concurrent with the embrace of terrorists by Europeanintellectuals, politicians and the media. As for the first group, he agrees with other observers that they tend to be supporters of totalitarianism much more than ordinary citizens. Anti-Zionism acts as a convenient, indirect smokescreen for Judeophobia. As regards France in particular, Taguieff shows how the demonization of Israel is a process of projection that derives from French guilt about collaboration with the Nazis.Documenting many incidents of violence against French Jews since the 1990s, the author dissects the methods and motives to warn against the resurgence of the plague throughoutEuropeand its global spread. Rising From The Muck confirms earlier observations of the new anti-Semitism as a mingling of mutations of familiar strains from the past, a rearrangement to form a new configuration. During the last decades of the 20th century, right-wing antisemitism rooted in race and xenophobic nationalism was metastasizing into new varieties based on anti-racism, internationalism and antiglobalism that found willing hosts on the left of the political spectrum.Globally, this ideological configuration incorporates imagery and themes derived from various traditions such as the Marxist, the Fascist andChristian Judeophobia. The aim is to equate Zionism with colonialism, racism and imperialism and to imply that all Jewish people are colonialists, imperialists and racists. Israel is to be perceived as the Nazi state. Portraying the Palestinians as arch-victims goes hand-in-hand with an assault on modernity and the criminalization of the West,particularly the USA. The author outlines the manner in which the media sings the praises of blind pacifism in order to undermine legitimate self-defense. Thus Taguieff foresaw mantras like \\"the excessive use of force.\\"Six major characteristics of the new global antisemitism identified by Taguieff are the wielding of anti-racist terminology against Israel, denouncing the 'Holocaust industry,' attacks on neoliberal globalization, propagating the myth of the Palestinian as innocent victim, targeting Israel with extreme rhetoric and appropriating words like \\"racism\\" and \\"genocide\\" in order to deny the victims of Islamic expansionism. This language of anti-racism in which it has clothed itself was further explored byPhyllis Chesler.The book investigates the phenomenon's leading figures as well as the indifference or complicity of various organizations and individuals. In addition, this remarkable work reveals the role ofthe conspiracy theory, how the rise of relativism in the West enables it and how this new configuration of the ancient mental disease is being spread by means of the latest communications technology. Today, the community of Israel faces a worldwide conglomerate of enemies consisting of Radical Islamists, the Arab and most of the Moslem world, Leftists, somemainstream Liberals, Neo-Fascists and Christians of the liberal as well as the extreme rightwing variety.For further information on various aspects of the spreading pestilence that - if not checked in time - could cause even worse death and destruction than the previous outburst, I recommendEurabia: The Euro-Arab Axisby Bat Ye'or, Globalizing Hatred by Denis McShane, The Changing Faces of Anti-Semitism by Walter Laqueur and A Lethal Obsession by Robert Wistrich."},{"Title":"Labyrinths from the Outside in: Walking to Spiritual Insight-A Beginner's Guide","review":"Fortunately, understanding the nuances of the labyrinth is easier than figuring out what the aforelisted reviewer said in his review!&quot;Labyrinths from the Outside In&quot; is a primer for the labyrinth as a useful metaphor and mystical tool through which one establishes a stronger connection to self and the larger world around them.

At times I wondered if I was reading an essay or poetry.Regardless, Mary Wollstonecraft summarizes the plight of women very well and the reader ( whether male or female ) gets a palpable sense of it's injustice.She concludes that since the literate male giants like \\" Rousseau\\" bolstered the prevailing thought that men were made to reason and women to feel it is hardly suprising that women were oppressed.From birth women, in the manor of pets, are trained in refining their \\"sensibilities\\" pursuing frivolity in \\"proper manners and etiquette\\" and stylish dress to the exclusion of cultural and intellectual development. Her only purpose to marry and become slave to the whim of her man's pleasure . Her drudgery and mindless existence is punctuated only by her childish outbursts. In such a state she is hardly capable of independent living let alone thought and utterly unfit as a mother. This state of affairs not only degrades women but men of reason and society at large since domestic affairs ultimately spill upon the fabric of society.The baleful consequences of such forced behaviours are a romantic temperment reinforced by reading novels of the day instead of science or history the latter deemed \\"boring\\" since the women lack the capacity to understand it. Such women being deprived of intellectual stimulation focus on vanity which further corrupts their soul making them envious, bitter and mean. Any woman who dares to challenge this state of affairs is ostracized almost to the same extent as a woman who has lost her \\"reputation\\".Mary Wollstonecraft writings are rife with social and political commentary which is refreshing. She is particularly critical of the upper class and their perpetuation of oppression."},{"Title":"A Vindication of the Rights of Women with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects","review":"As I read this book, I find myself comparing the authors examples of the treatment of women by their fathers/husbands with the way women are today treated by the media.Mary discusses how women are to be kept ignorant of all knowledge and only to be valued for their physical charms (almost every ad on TV/in print). The examples of her contemporaries that she quotes are frighteningly familiar.Why is this so? Who determines that the education of females is not relevant to society. Sure they are allowed to go to school now, but they are still treated with amazing patronization and condescenscion? The amount of my (intelligent) female friends that insist they are dumb/ignorant/stupid/an idiot is disturbing. Maybe now females are allowed to learn, they should also be allowed self esteem.I think I got sidetracked. This book is a complex and well written argument for the emancipation and education of women. It is as true today as much as it was 200 years ago. It is, however a slow read as the language is couched in the vocabulary of the late eighteenth century and many of the terms are unfamiliar."},{"Title":"A Vindication of the Rights of Women with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects","review":"This book has Wollstonecraft's A VINDICATION OF THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN and a through Background, Debate and Criticism section. This book gives one everything needed to understand Wollstonecraft's personality strenghths and weaknesses according to authors from her time; a complete debate on the subject of women's rights from multiple authors (from different time periods); and an intense review by serveral other authors (within the last 25 years) on Wollstonecraft's success/failure. Every article in the book has been published independently of this book. This work also contains several journal articles."},{"Title":"A Vindication of the Rights of Women with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects","review":"It is interesting to teach this book and track how students respond to this book, and how differently male and female students respond to the issues Wollstonecraft raises and discusses. We contextualize the book, and then extract it from its time and place and try to place the issues in our own time and place. A lot of great questions can be raised as we contemplate how far we have and have not come, and what can or should be done about that. . .and who shall do it. It is also an arresting exercise to ask students to apply different literary theories as they discuss this text. The idea is to encourage them to step out of their own shoes and into someone else's as they consider these issues. And it gives great opportunity to ask students to try to separate themselves from their own assumptions and stereotypes about gender and gender behavior, and reassess the issues in Wollstonecraft's time and place, and in light of today's assumptions and stereotypes, which can be harder to quantify than some presume."},{"Title":"A Vindication of the Rights of Women with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects","review":"If you need to read this for a college or high school class, or as part of a women's studies project that you are doing for some other purpose, then I'd like to assure you that it won't be all that painful.

Some of the language and nearly all of the issues that are brought up are inflamatory. In class discussions I compared the book to &quot;Fight Club,&quot; and was nearly laughed out of the room, but I am at least partly serious. It does have the edge of a social visionary who wanted to shake things up and blow old fashioned society out of the water. No soap bombs, though, but that's only a technicality.If you have any choice in the matter I would suggest that you choose this book over stuffier works by less forward thinkers.

This is a true classic."},{"Title":"A Vindication of the Rights of Women with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects","review":"In both the Preface and the Introduction, Wollstonecraft emphasizes what she sees as the root cause of the failure of men to treat women as equals. Men discourage women from achieving the same education that men routinely are given, and as long as women are denied this education, then they can never hope to achieve social and economic parity with men. In her opening remarks to Talleyrand, she is gently optimistic that her powers of persuasion will be sufficient such that he \\"will not throw my work aside.\\" Her other comments are couched in similar conciliatory terms: \\"I call upon you, therefore, now to weigh what I have advanced respecting the rights of women.\\"It is not only the lack of educational opportunity for women that rouses Wollstonecraft's ire. She connects this lack with a general lack of respect to a morality that has become \\"an empty name.\\" Men cannot acknowledge morality in women unless they can first acquire it in their own persons. The only way, she notes, for men to do both is for them to permit women to have sufficient access to education that will lead women to acquire virtue. Wollstonecraft suggests that virtue in women cannot occur until men respect them enough for women to feel virtuous. As long as men see women as trophy wives, alluring mistresses, and idolized objects of unneeded Renaissance gallantry, then the oppression of women will continue under a paternalistic hand. Wollstonecraft's annoyance clearly is evident when she considers that men have appointed themselves the gender guardian of what is best for women: \\"Who made man the exclusive judge if women partake with him the gift of reason?\\" Throughout history, she continues, tyrants of all stripes have been \\"eager to crush reason; yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be useful.\\" Men of Wollstonecraft's day are very much like the tyrants of former eras, and the female victims of the present are no less oppressed than all the victims of the past.Wollstonecraft roundly condemns men for their own dearth of virtue in that when men see no need to expect virtue in women, then they feel no necessity to show it themselves. The result of this failure to expect or exhibit virtue is their seeking extra-marital affairs, a state she terms a \\"box of mischief.\\" When men stray in this manner, their wives may follow suit or even neglect their children. All that remains for such women is to seek to obtain by cunning and guile what their men ought to dispense freely.In the Introduction, Wollstonecraft builds upon the same idea that women are deprived of equality by being denied a proper education. Surprisingly enough, she does not lay the blame squarely on men. Wollstonecraft writes of various faults that women commit that enable men to get away with such heavy-handed actions. She writes as if women are little more than clay figurines to be molded exclusively by men: \\"The minds of women are enfeebled by false refinement.\\" This \\"enfeeblement\\" has its origins in a myriad of sources, all of which women are seemingly unable to resist. She writes of \\"books of instruction\\" (written by men of genius) which purport to be models of delicate feminine behavior. It is unclear from context whether \\"genius\\" is meant ironically. Even more startlingly, Wollstonecraft admits flat out that in some respects at least, men are biologically superior to women: \\"In the government of the physical world, it is observable that the female, in general, is inferior to the male. The male pursues, the female yields--this is the law of nature.\\" She adds that \\"this physical superiority cannot be denied.\\" She does grant that men take unfair advantage of this immutable law of nature by widening what should be merely a biological gap into a sociological chasm: \\"But not content with this natural pre-eminence, men endeavor to sink us still lower, merely to render us alluring objects for the moment.\\" Women, it follows, cannot help but be \\"intoxicated by the adoration which men, under the influence of their senses, pay them.\\"The strength and persuasiveness of Wollstonecraft's arguments are diluted by her being unable to detach herself from her thoroughly middle-class status. Those who reside above her on the economic ladder seemingly reside in a universe untouched by matters that relate to those lower on the scale. She, as one of the middle class, is in a \\"natural state,\\" and thus amenable to the laws of nature and the power of rhetoric. Those who are of the upper class are \\"weak, artificial beings raised above the common wants and affections of their race, and in a premature unnatural manner, undermine the very foundation of virtue, and spread corruption through the whole mass of society!\\" Such women are to be pitied since their education \\"tends to render them vain and helpless.\\" What Wollstonecraft does not acknowledge is that such female vanity and helplessness are not limited to the empty-headed women of the rich. In fact, it is these very traits that she so lamentably bemoans that are so entrenched in the females of her own middle class. Life, for these rich women, is limited to a useless search for amusement in a world bereft of it.Wollstonecraft further suggests that women are at least partially to blame for their unchivalrous treatment by men. She assumes that given the least amount of gallantry by men that women will immediately assume the fawning traits of docility that so enrage her: \\"My own sex, I hope, will excuse me, if I treat them like rational creatures, instead of flattering their FASCINATING graces and viewing them as if they were in a state of perpetual childhood, unable to stand alone.\\" The favored male tactic to suppress and dominate women is to show untoward gallantry and excessive politeness at all times. Wollstonecraft terms all such patriarchal barbarities as \\"the soft phrase, susceptibility of heart, delicacy of sentiment, and refinement of taste,\\" all of which inevitably lead to such actions as \\"almost synonymous with epithets of weakness,\\" From these actions by men, she concludes that \\"those pretty feminine phrases\\" do no more than to engender a \\"weak elegance of mind, exquisite sensibility, and sweet docility of manners\\" in women. Thus, in comparing the elegance of gallantry to the endurance of virtue, women may seek the latter but settle for the former.The language and style of her book have caused future critics to discern a disparity between the clearly stated message and the less clearly phrased rhetoric. On one hand, Wollstonecraft promises that her writing will be the very epitome of simplicity and conciseness, yet on the other the content belies the asserted intent. She writes of her intended simplicity: \\"I shall disdain to cull my phrases or polish my style--I aim at being useful; and sincerity will render me unaffected; for wishing rather than to persuade by the force of my arguments, than dazzle by the elegance of my language, I shall not waste my time in rounding periods, nor in fabricating the turgid bombast of artificial feelings, which coming from the head, never reach the heart.\\" This sounds very much as if she places considerable urgency in keeping matters expressed as clear and unaffected as possible. Flowery diction, then, ought to have no place in her book. However, at the start of her Introduction, she uses a series of botanical metaphors whose elegance is intrusive:\\"The conduct and manners of women, in fact, evidently prove, that their minds are not in a healthy state; for like the flowers that are planted in too rich a soil, strength and usefulness are sacrificed to beauty; and the flaunting leaves, after having pleased a fastidious eye, fade, disregarded on the stalk, long before the season when they ought to have arrived in maturity. One cause of this barren blooming I attribute to a false system of education.\\"The issues of apparent inferiority raised in both the Preface and Introduction are revisited in later chapters of Wollstonecraft's book. Each time that she considers why men are permitted to so thoroughly dominate women, she more often than not implies that there is some defect lurking within women that men are quick to expand upon to justify a series of patriarchal actions that are no less than tyrannous despite the ostensible gallantry with which they are couched."},{"Title":"A Vindication of the Rights of Women with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects","review":"I read Mary Wollstonecraft's piece, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, for a western civ class. Initially, I found the text hard to understand. However, if one pairs the piece with Rousseau's writings (particularly Emile, or, On Education) the writing really comes to life. Ms. Wollstonecraft wrote this book as a rebuttle of some of Rousseau's beliefs. When the two are coupled, it is very interesting to compare and contrast. Great place to start when looking at the true meaning of \\"equality\\" a famous mind like Rousseau was striving for at this time period. Dense prose, though.

Read it."},{"Title":"A Vindication of the Rights of Women with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects","review":"I admit that I read this because it's mentioned in the forward to an edition ofPride and Prejudicethat I recently read. I wanted to better understand the context of that novel, and now I see the clear lines from this treatise to Austen's novel.Wollstoncraft argues that women of her era need better education and better goals than simply marrying a good man. Through better education, women and men are improved by having better relationships, better conversations, and are better able to raise children. Written largely as a response to Rousseau'sEmile, she argues that women have more to offer than simply wife and mother, but as fully-functional members of society. She vehemently argues against the idea that women exist only for the entertainment and edification of men.Reading this in a modern context, one has to wonder how far we've actually come."},{"Title":"A Vindication of the Rights of Women with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects","review":"When Charles Maurice de Talleyrand wrote that the education of women should be limited to the home, Mary Wollstonecraft was annoyed enough to respond by directly addressing him in her Preface. She begins politely with \\"I am confident you will not throw my work aside\\" and follows with her hope that he will \\"weigh what I have advanced respecting the rights of women.\\" Wollstonecraft's entire plea for the rights of women is phrased as a plea for the advancement of both men and women. She writes that men cannot see themselves as advanced beings unless they treat women as equals. She notes that in France, women are seen as distinctively lower than they are in England: \\"In France the very essence of sensuality has been extracted to regale the voluptuary and a kind of sentimental lust has prevailed, which...has given a sinister sort of sagacity to the French character.\\" As a result, modesty \\"has been more grossly insulted in France than even in England.\\"Wollstonecraft sees a direct link between manners and morals. When manners are permitted to be corrupted, it follows that \\"morality becomes an empty name.\\" She insists that not only must men recognize modesty in women but they must also cultivate it within themselves. This inculcation, she writes, is inextricably tied to education for women: \\"If she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge.\\" It is only when the good manners of men lead to a widespread restoration of chaste morals in women that the latter can achieve lasting and true virtue. Part of the problem, she writes, is that men embellish or idolize the male notion of female sexuality to the extant that men feel the need to protect women from their own lascivious nature. As far as protecting women and deciding what is in their best interests are concerned, \\"Who made man the exclusive judge?\\" Wollstonecraft writes that many tyrants of the past have used similar logic to justify brutality against a minority in that the reasoning of the tyrant surpasses that of the victim. Reason may be used as a faithful guide toward progress only when it is equitably applied to all. When reason is used as a guide rather than a hammer, then the understanding in women that reason would engender would make it likely that women would be better and fitter companions for men. When men use reason as a hammer, then men become tyrants and women victims, and as victims will refuse to remain forever as bonded prisoners in their homes. Men as tyrants will seek extramarital affairs; women may be inclined to do likewise. In this unhappy state, she laments, \\"What is to preserve private virtue?\\" When women see reason used against them, then they will have little option but to achieve by low cunning what open virtue cannot.In the Introduction, Wollstonecraft indicates the driving reason for her writing of this book, that she has \\"a profound conviction that the neglected education of my fellow creatures is the grand source of the misery I deplore.\\" This misery lies in her conviction that women are subject to overly fawning men who increase the belief in women that they are \\"rendered weak and wretched by a variety of concurring causes.\\" She sees the primary cause as the deliberate miseducation of women, the purpose of which is to heighten their attraction to men as sexual objects and trophy wives rather than to increase their utility as rational wives. Women who gladly primp and focus on their looks do themselves and their men a disservice: \\"The civilized women of the present century...are only anxious to inspire love, when they ought to cherish a nobler ambition,\\" which she soon identifies as virtue.Wollstonecraft lists various ways by which men induce women to see themselves only as superficial adjuncts to men. She mentions \\"books of instruction\\" which purport to outline how women ought to behave in the company of men. Such books, she notes with a touch of sarcasm, are written by \\"men of genius.\\" She further notes that these instruction books are similar to the means by which Moslem men keep their women in a perpetual state as second-class citizens. Wollstonecraft sees no discrepancy between her championing the rights of women and her statement that in some ways, at least, men are the superior sex: \\"In the government of the physical world, it is observable that the female, in general, is inferior to the male. The male pursues, the female yields--this is the law of nature.\\" From this, she concludes that \\"This physical superiority cannot be denied--and it is a noble prerogative.\\" Men take what she terms this \\"law of nature\\" and modify it by using it as a club \\"to sink us still lower, merely to render us alluring objects for a moment.\\" Women, she laments, react by feeling a sense of being \\"intoxicated by the adoration which men, under the influence of their senses, pay them, do not seek to obtain a durable interest in their hearts.\\"Wollstonecraft views such a heavy-handed, if well meaning, patriarchy as relevant mostly to the middle class, \\"because they appear to be in the most natural state.\\" Many women of the upper class have long since shed \\"the seeds of false refinement, immorality, and vanity.\\" Yet, there are still far greater numbers of the feminine rich and famous whom she sees as no less than \\"weak artificial beings raised above the common wants and affections of their race, in a premature and unnatural manner, undermine the very foundation of virtue, and spread corruption through the whole mass of society!\\" Her contempt for such upper class denizens is clear: \\"The education of the rich tends to render them vain and helpless.\\" They possess no goal other than to amuse themselves, the result of which is only \\"to afford barren amusement.\\"Part of her ire is vented toward women as she notes with no small touch of sarcasm the inability or unwillingness of women to heed her advice: \\"My own sex, I hope, will excuse me, if I treat them like rational creatures, instead of flattering their FASCINATING graces, and viewing them as if they were in a state of perpetual childhood, unable to stand alone.\\" Wollstonecraft urges women to look within themselves to find an inner core of dignity and virtue that she is sure is only lying dormant, waiting for the right moment to appear. What women must learn is to resist the siren call of men, namely that \\"the soft phrases, susceptibility of heart, delicacy of sentiment, and refinement of taste, are almost synonymous with epithets of weakness.\\" Those women who fall victim to such gender ruses \\"will soon become objects of contempt.\\" Men also use \\"pretty feminine phrases\\" to \\"soften our slavish dependence\\" merely to heighten women's \\"weak elegance of mind, exquisite sensibility, and sweet docility of manners.\\" All of this superficial elegance, she decries, is \\"inferior to virtue.\\" When men play the Renaissance gallant by placing their capes over a mud puddle for delicate ladies to avoid getting bespattered, the result is a woman who has sacrificed the primary objective of being seen and treated as an equal in favor of secondary views that relegate women to second class status.Wollstonecraft sees a connection between gender and genre. Some modes of writing and style are typically feminine while other more robust methods are distinctively masculine. She declares that the writing style of this book will be free of the curse of patriarchy: \\"I shall disdain to cull my phrases or polish my style--I aim at being useful and sincerity will render me unaffected; for wishing rather to persuade by the force of my arguments, than dazzle by the elegance of my language, I shall not waste my time in rounding periods, nor in fabricating the turgid bombast of artificial feelings, which coming from the head, never reach the heart..\\" Such writing must \\"avoid that flowery diction which has slided from essays into novels and from novels into familiar letters and conversation.\\" When diction that is overly florid flows from either the mouth or the pen, the result is \\"pretty nothings...that render the domestic pleasures insipid.\\"The education that women do receive is designed to foster the \\"libertine notions of beauty\\" at the expense of \\"strength of body and mind.\\" As long as women are denied a proper education, then the only way left for them to rise in the world is through the stifling institution of marriage, a process which merely continues the same dreary path of dehumanization that they have known all their lives. Wollstonecraft assumes that rational men will read her book and be sufficiently persuaded to alter their ways. Should men not heed her sage words, then women will have no choice but to use low cunning and guile to achieve what they could not by more traditional means."},{"Title":"A Vindication of the Rights of Women with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects","review":"When Mary Wollstonecraft published A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in 1792, the status of women in England was marked by a series of laws and customs that relegated them to second-class citizens. Among other shortcomings, women were routinely denied the right to vote, to divorce equitably, and to maintain property rights on a par with men. The source of the problem, she saw, lay in an inadequate education that guaranteed that women had to ally themselves to men merely for the basics of survival. After centuries of such a misaligned alliance, women had been reduced to whimpering, simpering clinging vines who had to use guile and beauty to maintain their current level of existence. If women were given a proper education, Wollstonecraft foresaw a time when men would no longer feel the need to exert a patriarchal hegemony over women who could then dispense with guile and beauty as a means to achieve equality. A problem in her paradigm soon arose when it became apparent that there was a gap between her stated intent and her means toward achieving that intent.This gap lay in two overlapping arenas of thought. In the first arena, Wollstonecraft could not divorce herself entirely from the stifling hand of a patriarchal hegemony that seemed almost as natural to her as it did to the men who used it to justify a thorough quashing of female rights. Wollstonecraft did not believe in the equality of men and women as feminists today so relentlessly urge. She saw the sexes as different in such a fundamental way that it never occurred to her to seek to redress the lack of gender inequality by questioning this unspoken premise. Men had a physical superiority over women that simply could not be denied--only acknowledged. What remained for her was to appeal to the better side of men by persuading them that it was in their best interests to forego their well-entrenched custom of male gender supremacy first by viewing women according to Wollstonecraft's new paradigm and second by acting on that view by discarding the outmoded habits of gallantry and paternalism that she saw as the root cause of the plight of women. Convincing men to do this would be no easy task nor would it be any easier to persuade women to discard their tried and true means of feminine wiles that acted in concert with male gallantry to maintain the uneasy status quo. Wollstonecraft's tract was well-intentioned but it is painful for the modern reader to learn that part of the reason for the failure of the book to achieve widespread acceptance until nearly a century later was due to her unbalanced perception of how men relate to women on levels ranging from the social to the intellectual to the physical. She could articulate with clarity and forcefulness that men were the superior gender with regard to biology, but her other arguments assumed secondary and unexamined bases that she could only allude to without ever recognizing her own true limitations. Men who received a formal education, she reasoned, must inevitably develop powers of exactness in reasoning that were concomitant with such an education. Women who were denied the same education or received an inferior version of it could not hope to achieve a similar lofty means of intellectual prowess. Feminine reasoning thus was limited to \\"so they do today, what they did yesterday, merely because they did it yesterday.\\" It did not occur to Wollstonecraft that a rigorous sense of reasoning lay not in formalized education but rather inhered within women themselves. Further, she assumed that the knowledge that women gained from whatever source was both quantitatively and quantifiably different from that which men so effortlessly attained. Thus, the true unspoken stumbling block preventing the equalization of the genders lay more in Mary Wollstonecraft's internalization of the inferiority of women than it did in the lack of education that she saw as the cause of that inferiority.The second source of her failure to connect viscerally with both genders in her age was due to the discrepancy between her stated goals and the means she used to achieve those goals. In the Preface and the Introduction, Wollstonecraft was direct in stating that she must maintain a clear line of demarcation between the virtues of simple and plain English which she associated with male thinking and the excesses of figurative language and tropic expressions of elegance that she connected with feminine thinking. \\"Elegance,\\" she stated, \\"was inferior to virtue.\\" Further, she wrote that \\"I shall disdain to cull my phrases or polish my style, and sincerity will render me unaffected, for wishing rather to persuade by the force of my arguments than dazzle by the elegance of my language, I shall not waste my time in rounding periods or in fabricating the turgid bombast of artificial feelings.\\" Unfortunately for her logic, she proceeds to violate these very precepts of simplicity and directness.In Chapter I, she writes metaphorically: \\"For what purpose were the passions implanted? That man by struggling with them might attain a degree of knowledge denied to the brutes; whispers Experience.\\" This obvious personification does not fit in with her avowed aim of non-tropic language. Later in the same chapter, she takes Rousseau to task in a verbal explosion of heavenly metaphors: \\"Man has been held out as independent of his power who made him, or as a lawless planet darting from its orbit to steal the celestial fire of reason; and the vengeance of heaven, lurking in the subtle flame, sufficiently punished his temerity, by introducing evil into the world.\\"What are we to make of these frequent gaps between intent and realization? Literary critics today tend to analyze her text using the binary language of deconstructive thought, that is taking two pairs of opposing ideas and separating them with a slash: natural/unnatural, free/controlled, man/woman etc. Unless we today assume that Mary Wollstonecraft could presciently assume the discovery of a mode of thought not dreamed of until the 1960s, we are left with the obvious, that she tried to level the economic playing field in the best way that she could. That she made what we call either blatant blunders or enduring insight is secondary to her stated goals. Women deserve a fair shake and education was the means toward that end."},{"Title":"A Vindication of the Rights of Women with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects","review":"This book is an important read in understanding the struggle for equal rights for women.

It's funny, it's paced well; it's a terrific summer read. That said, however, I don't think this is quite the Great American Novel the critics have declared it to be. My suspicion is that many of them are more excited about HOW it came to be than WHAT it came to be. Just as music critics dream of breaking some obscure-but-magical band they just happened to hear in a small-town bar, this work -- written by a talented-but-troubled young man, forgotten for years after his suicide, discovered by his mother is some musty cabinet, dropped on the desk of a skeptical English professor, begrudgingly read, then found to be a masterpiece -- proved too tempting; it's TOO perfect. So go into this knowing that the book's legacy probably has as much to with its lavish praise as its content.I found the book to be a bit like a kiddie pool -- colorful, fun, inviting, but, while broad enough to hold many characters, ultimately very shallow. Certainly, many of the characters were given magnificent, hilarious dialogue (although Burma's constant \\"Hey!\\"s and \\"Whoa!\\"s baffled me; was he being shot at, did he have Tourette's?), but they weren't given much life; we never got to know them. Miss Trixie, Lana Lee and Mrs. Levy, for instance, were given a hook line and esentially repeated it ad nauseum for the rest of the novel. And once the roster was divided into good guys and bad guys, the book marched on to a fairly predictable end.Even our enormous, over-educated, cripplingly neurotic, eternally belching anti-hero Ignatius was ultimately little more than a vehicle for Toole's amazing monologues. While we were given tiny glimpses of his humanity, an awful high school experience, his heartbreak over his departed dog, his secret love for the movies, we never learned what made him tick. WHY was he so rabidly averse to sex, obsessed with pre-Renaisannce history, undermotivated and fearful? What in his childhood or college experience molded him, changed him?That said, though, the book IS pretty darned funny and has some of the most twisted twists ever. Ignatius' near-success in organizing a full-blown religious crusade with a pack of bemused, semi-literate factory workers had me rolling, and his, er... unique plan to inflitrate the armed forces to bring about a new era of world peace had to be one of the most hilariously fiendish concepts in recent memory -- it seemed as though it actually MIGHT work. All of the character plots tied together beautifully and, although their eventual outcomes are fairly obvious, the roads which led them there are anything but.So know that this is not one of the greats, nor is there a Big Message, other than that desperate self-preservation will generally triumph over either secular humanism or staunch religious morality. Know also, though, that you will have a heck of a good time reading this. Perhaps not a leather-bound tome to be positioned among the classics in a college library, but a great addition to the pile of paperbacks in your rented beach house."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago after having read rave reviews of it and an article stating that Toole was nothing short of a genius. I really thought that I'd like it. I tried to like it, but I had to struggle just to get through it. I thought that Ignatius was a fatuous, unlikeable windbag, and after a hundred pages or so I just wished someone would throttle him. What killed this book for me was that I just didn't care about Ignatius. I will try to reread this book in the next few months to see if my opinion has changed. If this book entertains you, great, its just didn't work for me."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Just for the pure enjoyment of the character and the genius of the writing, buy this book! You have to know New Orleans somewhat to appreciate some of the places, but you don't have to know New Orleans to recognize the characters!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is quite simply the greatest book ever written. The basic premise seems almost ordinary, but in the hands of JK Toole, it becomes a magnificent one man circus, a triumph of crass stupidity over reason and normality.It is crammed with self- referential &quot;in-jokes&quot;, which may pass you by on the first reading. The characters are believable, immaculatley brought to life by the authors incredible style- you can almost taste the New Orleans atmosphere, and its collection of Vagrants, losers, lunatics and heroes that are the books cast are observed with empathy and admiration. The central character is surely the creation of a genius, and the plotlines draw you in to their spiralling web, until they collide with uproarious humour in one of literatures truly Great moments. Few works deserve the title &quot;Masterpiece&quot;- this is surely one."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I'm sure 99% of the reviews here will rave about the humor of the book, so further testimonial regarding the comedic greatness of this book probably isn't necessary.What else is truly special about this book, however, is its mastery of American written english, and its portrayal of New Orleans spoken accents of the early sixties. As you read the book, you can hear the people speak and see the city in perfect, rich, and colorful detail. Perhaps the best part is Toole's absolute ability to describe situations, objects, and people with perhaps the richest, most creative use of simile I have have ever seen from an American writer. It's a shame that much of the language and subsequent humor will be lost to those who aren't American (although I believe quirky Brits will cry with laughter when they read this).I am on to my second reading of the book, and the second time through is even better than the first. And each chapter, paragraph, sentence, and word is so complete, I can set the book down for a month and come back to it, and it seems as if I had just finished reading the previous chapter yesterday.And of course I'm laughing all the while. And the best part of it all? The ending will not dissapoint the reader. I half expected this book to end weakly, but it doesn't.I will never forget this book, and most people I know feel the same way. Too bad Toole killed himself. Genious gone before it was even discovered, truly tragic. But in reading the book, this fact only leads the reader to appreciate and be thankful that something of Toole was left for us to enjoy and admire. I can only imagine that he must have been an incredibly amazing individual, and funny as hell! Read it, this is a must for anyone, casual or avid reader."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I've been struggling with this review for quite a while, trying very hard to take a stand on how I feel about this book. It's a book beloved by so many people (my husband among them), yet it's reviled by probably equally as many. I had a very hard time determining which side I was on. I think I may be one of the very few sitting on the fence.Toole's characterization of Ignatius is indeed a brilliant portrayal of a self-centered, lazy, cynical and repulsive man, but I had a hard time finding his exploits funny. I've met people like Ignatius, and quite frankly, I want to get away from them, not indulge them as they attempt to skew the rest of the world their way. I truly despised Ignatius, and couldn't wait to finish the book to be rid of him.But, how can I fault an author who managed to evoke such a strong feeling of disgust from me? That's obviously the result of some darn fine writing. The story flows smoothly, combining Ignatius' misadventures with those of the other characters in a climactic conclusion that brought them all together an effectively amusing little tangle. So here I sit on the fence - I don't want to meet Ignatius again any time soon, but I don't regret having spent a little time with him."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The first time I read this book I laughed so hard that I had tears coming out of my eyes and was snorting. This was awful as I was on the train from NY to Boston and while I should have been embarassed and put the book down, I remember thinking that I had become Ignatius J. Reilly himself; I really didn't care what anyone thought. Besides, the book was so fantastic, I couldn't put it down.Fifteen years later I re-read the book for my bookclub and was so surprised to find that it just wasn't AS funny as I remembered; the depressing angles of the story stood out more that time around. I also had the high expectations of humor I had placed on the book to contend with. Maybe it was that I had a mortgage and four kids and was not prone to snorting in laughter on trains anymore(....that, on it's own, was a little sad.)Well, here I am, four years further along and I have read it again and I am back to crying with laughter. Ignatius is one of the most memorable characters you will ever take away from a novel. He is lazy and clumsy, inept and a snob of sorts. The descriptions of him with that awful green hat and his damp mustache, his \\"valve\\" problems and his sloth-like behavior will leave you howling.Ignatius leaves such an impression on you that you will start \\"seeing\\" him places. He IS that odd guy who's always at the bagel shop...he's the one you cross the street to avoid when you are with your children...maybe he's that guy snorting in laughter in the corner of the train.This should be on everyone's summer reading list."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book presents the story of a slovenly but educated young man living in New Orleans, suffering the slings and arrows of a world that doesn't understand his superior intellect. He abuses his mother and any other poor soul that crosses his path. In his travels he interacts with a cast of characters that shows us how much he can twist simple expectations of him into assaults on his distorted view of the world and gastric health.John Kennedy Toole put together a brilliant book bringing characters to life in a way you can see and hear them. Some may find his characters negative stereotypes and possibly offensive; I believe these are just characters in a farce and don't represent his feeling of their race or sexual orientation.New Orleans plays a significant part as a setting for the book, it is timely to read it and consider another view of this city and its cultural diversity we may lose.It is also fun to imagine this as a film. From my first reading many years ago, I have mentally cast many actors in this as a film. Think of John Candy as Ignatius. And as his girl friend and foil Gilda Radnor.This book is not to miss, it is a hilarious diversion."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I actually liked the book. It's so life-like. I know far too many people that are just as awful and obnoxious as the charecters in it. Very vivid, very depressing. The only character I would really want to spend time with was the cloud of smoke that is Jones. The book was worth it just for Jones.My main problem with the book was that it failed to make me laugh. This wouldn't be a problem normally. I don't expect books to be laughfests as a rule, but everyone said &quot;Oh, it's soo hilarious! I was cracking up the whole time I read it!&quot; So I had to read it for a literature class. My teacher said it is a masterpeice. It won the Pulitzer Prize! So I was expecting to laugh this time. But I couldn't. It was just too depressing. I told my teacher I didn't think it was funny. He asked my classmates if they thought it was funny and they all said yes. My teacher quoted Jonathon Winters, who said that the scariest person in the world is someone without a sense of humor.So maybe I don't have a sense of humor, but I find it difficult to see the point of laughing at miserable people who make each other more miserable. There are also a lot of sex jokes and a lot of jokes about passing gas, but I can get that from Beavis and Butthead.My teacher also said the whole book was about scorn. It is supposed to make you feel beter about yourself because you're not as horrible as the people in the book, but I think my ego was okay without having read this book.But I liked Toole's style. The dialogues and descriptions are wonderful. The book is great as a description of the burgeoning chaos of the early sixties. It just didn't make me laugh."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Let me preface my review by stating that there is no middle ground with this book. At least I've never met anyone who was indifferent about it. You either love or you hate it. While I'm firmly in the camp of those who think this is a comic masterpiece, I understand why those on the other side think the way they do. After all Ignateous Reilly basically has no redeeming qualities. None. His absolute belief in his own intellectual and moral superiority, and his ensuing poor treatment of everyone around him as a result can make this a hard book to get into. Consequently it can be impossible for the reader to identify with, or feel sympathy for, him. But it's this same attitude that also gives the book it's greatest strength. With this imagined superiority, Ignateous brings a fresh, unique & comical perspective to every situation he encounters. Whether he's leading a rebellion against the management of a factory, attempting to start a new political movement using a certain minority group as a catalyst, or simply trying to work as a hotdog vendor, each scenario rapidly descends into hilarious anarchy as he loses control of the events around him. Add the wonderful descriptions of New Orleans and its various denizens to the mix and this is a classic in my opinion. Bar none! In reading and re-reading this book, I can't help but wonder how many other amazing stories were lost because of the author's early (and self-imposed) demise. But thankfully we still have this wonderful book as a monument to his talent. And that will have to be enough. The bottom line is that A Confederacy of Dunces is devastatingly funny. Give it a try."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Of all the novels I have read, I consider John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces to be one of the best (and certainly the funniest). I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel, laughing myself silly at times throughout this zany story. The situations that Ignatius put himself (and others) in were classic and unpredictable.In my opinion, it's very easy to understand why this novel won a Pulitzer Prize. The character descriptions were brilliant; I could picture someone I knew for every character in the story. Toole's prose made me feel as if I were standing next to Ignatius during his adventures, and I could almost feel the frustration and anger of those who became his \\"victims.\\" Every character's appearance and personality was described in specific details, as well as the surrounding scenery. The humor used was ingenious, both in content and timing, even at the risk of being stereotypical.My favorite part of the story came when Ignatius forged the letter to Abelman's Dry Goods. I think it reminded me of that mischievous side of myself, and perhaps suggesting that I myself might do such an act. The contents of the letter was enough to keep me laughing , but then I imagined the look on the faces of Abelman, Levy, and Gonzalez upon reading this letter themselves, and that fueled the fire! Yes, it can be said that I got carried away with this book.On the negative side of the book, I thought that some of the letters written by Ignatius were alittle long winded and not relevant to the story. Perhaps Toole thought it was important to reinforce this character's mind set to the reader. However, it seemed to me that this was accomplished by the colorful description of behavior throughout the story. In addition, I think that it's safe to say that in this day and age of being \\"politically correct,\\" this novel probably wouldn't currently win a Pulitzer. I base that on some of the stereotypical character and language depiction, especially with Jones. This novel was placed at a time when racial segregation was still prevalent (which probably explains why it wasn't an issue to the Pulitzer committee). However, even if a current author made a racial degrading reference to a character set during that period, it probably would not acceptable to the current standards.I really enjoyed taking this adventure with Ignatius. I feel the story was well written, painting a vivid picture in my mind about who exactly we (as the reader) were dealing with. I only wish the ending had turned out with more substance. I felt myself wondering how Ignatius was going to get out of the forgery mess, or if his mother was going to marry Claude, or even if Levy Shorts would be successful. Ironically, I feel this way about Toole himself. It disappoints me that an author with such a gift for writing, would tragically ends his life at such a young age. This inspired me to do some research (see attached), but information on him was very scarce. The biggest tragedy of all (I think), is that we will never enjoy any new works from this talented artist, nor will we know where Ignatius is today. However, this doesn't stop me from keeping a sharp lookout for a large goofy-looking guy, wearing a green hunting cap."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I'd heard this book described as social satire told from the perspective of an educated man reduced to selling hot dogs on the streets of New Orleans' French Quarter. I knew the author committed suicide and I was expecting bitter commentary on the absurdity and corruption of the world that later drove him to it. I was very pleasantly surprised. CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is NOT a suicide note. It's actually rather gentle at times. Despite undertones of desperation and tragedy, it presents a world in which even misfits have their role because the chaos surrounding them is necessary to disrupt complacency and pretense.It's more a New Orleans novel than a French Quarter novel. The quixotic hero, Ignatius Reilly, lives uptown with his mother in a middle class neighborhood. His pathetic pre-hot dog employer, Levy Pants, is in industrial Bywater. Both those environments receive comic examination along with the French Quarter. There is a delightful complex of subplots involving a well-intentioned policeman, a neglected business, a pirate costume and Ignatius' enthusiasm for founding outlandish political movements. Almost every character introduced gets a larger role. Ignatius' shortcomings are as serious as those of the people complicating his life and suspense arises from concern that he will be ruined when the various subplots' inevitably collide. However, there are also surprise saviors here.The gay party in the French Quarter is the weakest part, constructed from once daring stereotypes that now seem dated and narrow-minded. This slows the novel's last half somewhat but not enough to wreck Toole's narrative.Don't let phrases like &quot;literary masterpiece&quot; put you off. (It is that- there's some G. B. Shaw, Jonathan Swift and especially Oscar Wilde behind this, I think.) It's a great book because it's the work of a master storyteller. This tale can capture anyone."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"There is something appealing about a misanthrope, and Ignatius in COD was that in spades. It is funny and a catharsis to read from a point of view of someone able to so completely abandon concern for the opinions of their fellow man. There were several old 19th century British novels that used a similar device, but none (that I've read) with so much success.I personally didn't find it side-splittingly funny, and the protagonist is naturally not someone you easily relate to, but as the story unfolds you can't help but realize how well written the book is, and how consistent it is, and just how brilliant it is. Knowing about the author's tragic story can almost overshadow the read at times, as it is impossible not to wonder how auto-biographical it was- but be that as it may, it has such a variety of well-developed characters and such good and unexpected plot devices, that the passive energy of the story overwhelms the sad undertone. Small wonder it makes it to so many English teacher's summer reading lists."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Just finished this so-called masterpiece and found it to be an average read at best. Yes, there were parts that made me chuckle, but they ran about even with those that bored me enough to fast forward through some sections. I leave this book without keeping a memory of even one likeable character.I'm glad for those readers who found this book to be so enthralling. I'm glad we all don't have the same likes and opinions or it would make for a very dull world."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have read a lot of negative reviews of this book, and I was surprised to see that so many people do not like it, because I'm almost done with it already and I can't put it down. It seems like the majority of people who don't enjoy the book dislike it because they don't think the characters are likeable and they don't think that it's hilarious. I don't know who started the rumor that this book was laugh-out-loud funny, but I promise you the author did not intend it to be that way. The humor is dark and tongue-in-cheek at most, so it won't make you laugh, it will reveal how pathetic and sad the characters really are. It's the kind of humor that pokes fun at society rather than makes you really laugh. If you want to read a hysterical book with idealized, heroic characters, then this is not the book for you. Go read Harry Potter or some kind of book that everyone can understand. If you feel like reading a brilliant work of social satire in which all of the characters are exaggeratedly UNheroic, which in my opinion is more realistic than people who turn out the way you want them to, then you will appreciate this book as great American literature. Yes, there is a lot of burping and other such bodily functions going on in here. You're not supposed to find it endearing and funny, you're supposed to find the main character utterly disgusting! Perhaps the author empathized and identified with his protagonist who was smarter than everyone around him but was tragically lazy and therefore always unsuccessful at everything. Toole perfectly captures the almost (but not quite) humorous plight of a neighborhood dealing with poverty, vice, ignorance, and probably mental health disabilities, for whom nothing can ever go right. It's not laugh-out-loud funny because it's not supposed to be. It is, however, very interesting and different."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"There are two ways of perceiving Cervantes's \\"Don Quixote.\\" In the modern interpretation Don Quixote is an idealistic dreamer, a hopeless romantic battling the windmills of a bitter, cynical world. The more traditional (and I'd say correct) interpretation is that Don Quixote is a dangerous madman adhering to an outdated ideology and sowing havoc wherever he goes. Based on which interpretation you believe in, the novel can be seen as charmingly comic or darkly comic.The same can be said for \\"A Confederacy of Dunces.\\" Ignatius Reilly is Don Quixote of the bayou, a grossly overweight, strangely dressed believer in Medieval philosophy. He espouses these beliefs in notebooks, to his mother, at the movie theater (to the annoyance of patrons, ushers, and managers), and to any perspective employer. The only one close to understanding him might have been his dead collie, whom he loves in a not-entirely healthy way. The second closest is his former girlfriend--using the term loosely--Myrna Minkoff, an heiress turned political activist from New York.Reilly's mother caters to his every need--such as supporting him through the better part of a decade of college, though it never leads him to a stable job--until she runs her car into a building while drunk. This leads her to forcing Reilly out into the world. His interactions with employees at a pants factory, a hot dog vendor, a gay man in the French Quarter, and a bar's employees create mayhem for Reilly and those he comes into contact with.I think the prevailing view is to think of Ignatius Reilly as a madcap fish out of water, the idealistic dreamer interpretation. But it's not hard to also see him as a fat, selfish lout deserving of the scorn and ridicule he receives. Clearly Ignatius Reilly--like Don Quixote--is someone who takes himself and his ridiculously out-of-step views far too seriously, so you're never laughing WITH him so much as laughing AT him. It's up to you to decide just how mean-spirited the laughing at part is.At any rate, it's unfortunate that John Kennedy Toole did not live long enough to hone his craft a bit more. Had he received some support and guidance he could have been one of the great American authors of his generation with the likes of Vonnegut, Updike, and of course Walker Percy, who at least made sure we could all read this novel. As it is, there are still some kinks in this, like how people are always screaming relatively ordinary lines of dialog or how the gay characters are stereotyped queens and butches.Still, there's no question this is a good novel, and a funny novel as well, which is why it managed to endure even after the death of its author. NO matter how you should interpret it, you should read it.On a side note, I think if Ignatius Reilly were around in modern times he would be writing his missives on the Internet instead of in notebooks. Mostly likely he'd be writing reviews on Amazon...That is all."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Amazing how the wheel spins.

There are so many levels on which it satisfies. Without a doubt, it is one of the funniest books I have ever read.This is definitely a book that you either love or hate. There is no middle ground on this one. I wonder if part of that is the fact that comedy is not universal (Some people love Monty Python. Some people hate Monty Python.). The more I talk with people about this work, the more I'm convinced that there is a certain regional aspect that you have to \\"get\\" in order for it to be funny. Maybe you have to be a Southern Catholic to \\"get\\" it. Maybe you have to have a passing interest in medieval philosophy (or general western philosophy) in order for this to be funny. More likely, it's none of the above as \\"funny\\" is so intangible.I couldn't help but think of Carmina Burana while reading this book. Fortuna is the main character of this work. Each of the minor characters are caught in their own wheel of Fortune from which they can't really escape. The interesting thing is that, in Toole's novel, the wheels have teeth and act like gears. The rising fortunes of one character precipitate a drop in fortunes in another. A drop in fortune in Ignatius ends up raising the fortunes of everyone else (and, in the end, Ignatius too).In the end, the book is a love story, and Ignatius, like Boethius, ends up understanding happiness comes when Love rules the heart. I would actually recommend that the prospective reader read \\"The Consolation of Philosophy\\" before reading this book. It's not really necessary in order to enjoy the book, but I think it makes the book more enjoyable. It certainly gives you an extra chuckle in a few places."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have read and reread this book 3 or 4 times in the last 10 years, and it is always hilarious.

I read the entire book because of the high praise it has received. To be honest, I wanted to toss it after two chapters. I have a very good sense of humor. Salman Rushdie's &quot;The Moor's Last Sigh&quot; made me laugh for hours on end. This book did nothing but depress and disgust me. If Toole's life was anything like Reilly's, I can understand his depression. The quality of the writing and the level of imagination exhibited in the book are both very high. As a literary study the book has merit (the Pulitzer is questionable). This book unequivocally did not live up to the jacket reviews."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I am from New Orleans, a lifelong native and resident. I read this book when I was 19 years old (for the first time) and then just recently at my grand old age of thirty something. I remember the hype from the English Department at the University of New Orleans-the year was 1981 and I had to read the book for an English course. Constantly, over and over again, I heard what a great book this was, and I agreed-somewhat. My problem with the story back then was because it seemed like a masterpiece to me for the first few chapters, but then the plot bogged down in a mire of excessive sleaze. I have lived and worked in the French Quarter for several years, and I can say that the individuals who live on the fringe of society there are definately NOT like Toole's depiction of characters like Liz Steele or Betty Bumper, Dorian Green or Lana Lane. Toole is writing about an era that is today all but faded, an era of New Orleans rapidly descending into forgotten lore. The Irish Third Ward is today an inner city wasteland of decrepit houses and crumbling warehouses, and in the quarter, you are more likely to see characters from all over the country with a myriad of traits all differant from each other. The Quarter is a crowded, tight space today and the ghosts of the past are all leaving. But still, there are many still alive-the majority, I would think-who remember the old ways and crack a grin at this novel. But as a young man of 19 years, I thought it was mediocre at best because of the way Toole packed it with sleaze and what is now almost anachronisms, anachronisms that tend to remind me of my parents and grandparents, betraying the great promise the first few chapters displayed. Today, I am repulsed by the similarity between this book and William Faulkner's short story, &quot; A Rose for Emily.&quot; The thematic similarity is clear; Toole's story takes place about the time Old New Orleans was starting to fade into the modern era of the Superdome, Poydras Street and the World's Fair. Faulkner's short story takes place near the end of the Old South. In both of these stories the images of decay are present. I am reminded that Toole is a southern writer, but his book is like a sad commentary on the often mentioned flight to the suburbs taken by many of the urban middle-class, a flight which began in the sixties, leaving mostly undesireables in the downtown area. I give this book a &quot;6&quot; because Toole uses very accurate dialogue and cultural referances, but the over-all impact of the novel is too weary; the sleaze fest becomes offensive."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is often cited as a classic, expecially by people who live in New Orleans. It is the story of the adventures of one Ignatius J. Reilly, a social misfit from Uptown New Orleans, and his interactions with a bunch of stereotypical New Orleans characters.This book is one of four books often mentioned as mandatory reading for anyone wanting to understand New Orleans ( Incidentally, the other three are TN Williams' Streetcar Named Desire, Walker Percy's the Moviegoer, and Kate Chopin's The Awakening). Many people love Confederacy, and many people, though probably not as many, don't. After a second reading I confirmed my initial reaction and again firmly place myself in the \\"don't\\" category. Undoubtedly, the book has some major things going for it ( as do most Pulitizer Prize winning novels ). Toole nails New Orleans cold. The dialogue is great.One might enjoy the novel if for no other reason than listening to Ignatius' mama and her friend, Santa, pass the time of day in conversation. His depiction of Uptown New Orleans and the French Quarter are again right on the money. As someone who lives in the Quarter, I especialy enjoyed his depiction of my neighborhood. The plot comes together quite well. But, God, I found the characters, especially Ignatius, just horrible people without many redeeming social values at all. And, after two readings with very few chuckles, I just don't get how so many readers think this is not only a laugh out loud novel, but maybe the greatest such novel ever written.But what do I know ? What I do know is that my views are in the minority of New Orleanians. If you are planning to live in New Orleans, you better be familiar with this book, or else you won't be able to get a visa."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Due to the respect I have for many great and funny writers who have lauded this book's brilliance over the years I have planned to read it for some time. I recently read something that referred to the book and decided, \\"it is time to do this\\".As a reader I try to give a book 1-2 hours, maybe 100 pages before giving up. I read this whole thing waiting to laugh, find something funny, anything. THis was a great disapointment in my literary life. I have been trying to rethink this book and try to imagine what could be funny. Perhaps I'm such a dunce myself I could not get into the high-mindedness of it?Oh well . . . like some disapointed movie fan I'll say, thats a few evenings of my life I'll never get back."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It is not consider good form to laugh at deranged people. The main character is dreanged, and if you ever personally known someone like him, you would not like this novel. On the other hand, I read it to the end. The really likeable and funny character is Jones. I hope the fact that he is black does not offend anyone. His character makes everyone else look insane. This is a well writen book, and since I listened on tape, the narration was excellent. There really is no plot in the book. Its a bunch of miserable characters living in disorder. If there is a plot, its Riley's descent into madness. And again, apologies to New Orleans, but where else is more likely to discover a cast of characters living on the edge of sanity.This is not a book to take to the Beach, or read after a friend or relative is hospitized for a mental disorder.

The descriptionswere accurate to the smallest detail(yes, the riverfront is even swarming with rats). The characters were genuine and believable (I can relate to Ignatious Riley, being a misunderstood genius myself). I would strongly reccmond this novel to anyone who enjoys good humour and feels misunderstood themselves.- Devin FitzgeraldP.S.

If you are bright, caring and contribute to society, spread the word. this is a read to be enjoyed and enjoyed again. You will never meet another character like Ignatius Reiley in fiction or real life. I read the book every year. I'm always a little sad when it ends, but I know I'll revisit in a year or so.

When I'm reading, people look at me and think I'm a nut because I'm laughing so hard. I get so excited at reading the dialogue between the characters (mainly Ignatius). I've never read anything like it. If anyone knows any other books this funny, please, e-mail me. Toole is simply brilliant."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"According to a quote in the beginning of the book by Jonathan Swift, \\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.\\" It is pretty obvious that this quote directly is included to directly pertain to Ignatius, the main character of A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole. Ignatius J. Reilly is no doubt a genius, but I was never able to wholeheartedly view him as such, for he always acts foolish. For instance, when Mr. Gonzalez tries to help Ignatius sit up after Ignatius falls from a stool, Ignatius coldly replies, \\"No! You must never move a person with a broken back unless you have a stretcher\\" (84). Yet, a few moments later, when Miss Trixie accidentally steps on Ignatius's hand, he \\"thundered and sprang into a sitting position. 'The bones in my hand are crushed. I'll never be able to use it again'\\" (85). Ignatius speaks intelligently, for he had eight years of college education; yet he uses his intelligence with the immaturity of a five-year-old. This is the main reason I was sometimes frustrated while reading the novel.It appears as if Ignatius is a character created for the purpose of contradicting the old saying, \\"Two wrongs don't make a right.\\" While working for Levy Pants, Ignatius naughtily replaces Mr. Gonzalez's letter to a recipient company with his own letter. The contents of this letter are so offensive that that recipient company decides to sue Levy Pants for $500,000. This obviously creates a major complication for Levy Pants, more specifically for its owner, Gus Levy. Through his wit, Ignatius ultimately \\"saved himself, Miss Trixie, and Mr. Levy, too, in his own kook way\\" (377).What makes this story extremely interesting is how Ignatius's life seems to have fallen off a cliff. The story continuously leaves the reader anxious to find out when he will hit the ground or if, during his plunge to death, he will suddenly sprout wings and save himself. The significance of the Night of Joy bar in relation to the story is only understood at the end of the book when Ignatius lies lifelessly on the street in front of the Night of Joy bar. Throughout the story, Ignatius starts with a very respectable job at Levy Pants, then gets fired and lands in a job pushing a weenie wagon, and ultimately ends up at the foot of the Night of Joy bar, a disgraceful and unpopular bar whose owner is affiliated with pornography. Just when I thought that was the end of the road for Ignatius and that the remainder of the story would describe the consequences of his mischievous actions, Toole shocks me and somehow vindicates Ignatius from all of his wrongdoings.A Confederacy of Dunces is an extremely interesting story that justifiably won the Pulitzer Prize. Though irksome at times, Ignatius's pompous attitude succeeds in making the reader laugh. Oh, I forgot to mention the funniest part of this book - Ignatius is an obscenely obese man who wants to change the world back to how it was in the Middle Ages; this makes for a very interesting read, guaranteed. But I advise you to keep some Big Chief tablets handy for your pyloric valve might close at times.Now I must return to my homeland, India, and suffer until the British confederacy of dunces realizes that I'm truly a genius :)."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Funny, moving, bizarre, fresh, original, with a unique voice of truth. In the tradition of Tristram Shandy, Catch-22 and other great comic novels. So many deep books aren't funny, and so many funny books aren't deep. But when you find both characteristics together in one book, you know you've found something you will never forget. And isn't it telling how the most idiosyncratic character and situations you can imagine are also the most universal? If you want to be deeply refreshed -- not just amused -- read this book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I won't bore anyone with yet another glowing review of this amazing book. If you're reading this, no doubt you're already a fan. If you haven't read this book yet, a word of warning - don't read this book in public unless you want the odd stare when you start laughing out loud. One of the few books that you can pick up and start reading from anywhere and be totally engrossed in the story."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read. Toole's ability to capture the character in all of us is uncanny. He nails Ignatius in all his self absorbant academic glory. If you enjoy reading at all do not touch this book because it is too hard to come down off of and other books will leave you unsatisfied and disappointed. However if you do not have a sense of humor read on, anything you touch afterwards will please you to no end."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Loved this book! It is so funny. This book should have a cult following."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Down deep in south Louisiana, is a small univesity employing a professor who is rumored to be Ignatius. Rumor has it he and Toole were roommates at LSU, and Toole consistently flustered/bemused by his roommate, immortalized him in the Confederacy of Dunces. Now, I've read the book, and I also took a class taught by said professor, who arrived to class via bicycle (think slow and lumbering) with dried shaving cream around his hairy ears, and mustard stains on his shirt. He frequently lost our 'blue book' exams, and then accused the class of not turning them in. The smell of the hallway containing his office can best be descibed as gamey. Class was dismissed early to go and catch stray dogs. How is he a teacher? He got himself appointed trustee of a multi-million dollar endowment to the University which dictates his professorship for life. He is so flawed and bumbling and completely clueless you really cannot but help like this man. He is utterly brilliant in literature, and always amusing. I don't think Toole created Ignatius so much as illustrated and portrayed a real person from his short life. I often think, as unfortunate as it is that his life was shortened, it was at least colorful."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Although I managed to get through the majority of this book without certain knowledge to the &quot;point&quot; of it, I have to admit I've never laughed so hard. Ignatius, a sarcastic, overweight, and obnoxious man who still lives with his mother, is one of those characters that gave me a reason to read on. I found myself constantly questioning his true intelligence level and I still have my doubts toward the conclusion I arrived at.I want to avoid at all costs, spoiling any part of the book, simply because its plot is so small that spoiling one part would leave you knowing the ending.This is one of those books that you have to remember you are reading for mere enjoyment. You will probably not learn anything new (except perhaps a snappy comeback that you will probably never use). You will probably not benefit in any way, form, or fashion, unless you believe that laughter is the best medicine (which it is). And most of all, you will not be raised on any sort of pedestal for completing another great book of our time. If one were to read this, they should be prepared to laugh and (gasp!) actually enjoy what they are reading. One should not dive into this book, much like its forbidden to dive into the shallow end of a pool. Overall method? Simply take it page by page, savor its wit, and allow yourself to become thoroughly entangled in the life of someone else."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"There's not much really to say about this book other than read it. The main character is great. By the end of the book you are cheering for him. But it is not for the unimaginative. To really appreciate this book, you must be able to get inside of it and dissect it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The novel A Confederacy of Dunces written by John Kennedy Toole is very unique. This particular novel takes place in New Orleans, one of the most infamous cities in America. New Orleans is generally known for its \\"upbeat\\" life style, which mainly consists of diverse people and parties. This setting alone would cause for a very interesting and original novel, filled with the many adventures...The novel starts off with a physical description of the main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, which allows the reader to use their imagination and become interested in the character/surroundings. He is a 34-year-old man that lives at home with his mother, in which he is totally dependant on. Ignatius has a good college education and is smart, however, he has never been able to obtain a long-term job. He has many hopes and dreams of being a writer someday and he often writes, and/or expresses himself in his \\"Big Chiesf Tablets\\". (personal journal) His mother, Irene, is a very nice woman. She takes care of Ignatius and meets his every need. Throughout the novel, one may often find themselves feeling bad for Irene because she spends most of her time waiting on Ignatius \\"hand-and-foot\\" and does not seem to have much of a social life that she can call her own.Ignatius is a very unique and unpredictable man. He does not give into the confinements of society, which makes him standout in public. Society often judges Ignatius by his appearance. The reader is able to see this instantaneously in the first chapter when Ignatius is outside on Canal Street, waiting for his mother to return from a doctor appointment for her arthritis. He is just standing there, not doing anything wrong when all of a sudden; a police officer arrests him because he thought that Ignatius looked \\"suspicious\\". This is just one of the circumstances in the novel in which Ignatius is judged.Ignatius and his mother, Irene, were very upset with the situation and decided to go and have a drink at a local bar called The Night of Joy. The two of them each consume a few drinks and then they jump in the car where Irene tries to drive while being under the influence of alcohol. She ends up running into a town building and causes a damage of $1, 020. Ignatius is then forced to put aside his hopes and dreams and face reality; he was going to have to find a job to support his mother. After numerous unsuccessful job interviews, Ignatius finally gets a job at a factory called Levy Pants. However, this job did not last for long because Ignatius swas fired after he attempted to assemble and lead the employees of Levy Pants in a demonstration to \\"get rid of\\" Mr. Gonzala. He convinced all of the workers to rebel against Mr. Gonzala due to the low wages, poor working conditions, and long hours at the factory. This demonstration failed. Ignatius then got himself a job with \\"Paradise Hot Dogs\\", being a vendor, where he encountered many new and interesting people.Over the course of the novel A Confederacy of Dunces, John Kennedy Toole takes the reader on a unique adventure through the life of Ignatius J. Reilly. Ignatius meets many new people and throughout the novel the reader is able to see the changes in Ignatius's life and the lives of the people that he comes in contact with. This style of writing is very effective in indulging the reader. This novel gets the reader curious as to what comes next in the story, which makes one want to continue reading until the last page of the novel..."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Filled with satirical black humor concerning the usually overlooked \\"characters\\" of society, John Kennedy Toole's Pulitzer prize winning novel The Confederacy of Dunces , captures a reality of our society that we like to disregard.In The Confederacy of Dunces the unique tempo and the slow pace of the overall development of the plot creates a feel of dreary, everyday life, while the immediate happenings tend to be absurd, ridiculous, or down right stupid. In many instances Toole will jump between a third person point of view subjective to different characters, or a objective point of view depicting the seen from many angles making the absurdity of the happenings or the actions and words of our hero Ignatius J. Riely painfully clear. Then the long tedious exchanges of letters between Myna Minkoff and Ignatius, or the journals of Ignatius, though still absurd, draws out the story and creates a weary response from the reader. Energetic, dreary, energetic, dreary.... The delicate mixture of excitement and dullness creates a parallel with life, a disturbing realization due to the fact that readers tend to think the actions of the characters in this novel \\"not normal\\".There are many \\"characters\\" in this novel, to tell the truth all most all characters that appear in this novel are not what people would like to call \\"normal\\". Still, none can beat Ignatius J. Riely in uniqueness. \\"Huge, obese, fractious, fastidious, a latter-day Gargantuan, a Don Quixote of the French Quarter\\" (Henry Kisor, Chicago Sun-Times), how did this complete slob of a man ever make it to the cover of a best seller? Through out the book he undergoes no mental growth (he does gain some pounds though), and his only reason for even considering moving is threats! What is the point of putting such a complete \\"character\\" in the main role? When this combined with the earlier idea of the book paralleling with life, one sees that Toole is saying that these people, this society, maybe not in this extent, but still does actually exist.The Confederacy of Dunces captures vividly the society of \\"queers\\", \\"nerds\\", \\"social-outcasts\\", and the \\"sub-normal\\". Then through the book he shows the readers the desperate reality that this is not \\"sub-normal\\". It is a depressing realization, but an important one. Knowing of a failure is the best way to start fixing what ever it is that is failing. If you feel in any way revolted by anything in this novel, understand that it is real, then think of how you can change things for the better."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Some of the other reviewers on this page have remarked on the book's ending as one of its strengths. Quite the contrary, I found the end to be flawed, which is why the book loses one star from me. After such an uncompromising look at the dysfunctional world of Ignatius J. Reilly and his utter inability to cope with the modern world, I felt that the finale was the literary equivalent of the feel-good ending that has been tacked on to a film that has not tested well at advance screenings. Given what had gone before, I really didn't see how Ignatius could end up anywhere but a mental hospital. This is not to impugn John Kennedy Toole's honesty as a writer. Given the fact that Toole committed suicide before his book saw publication--according to Walker Percy's introduction, it would probably never have been published had his mother not shopped it around after his death--I wonder how much Toole himself was like Ignatius; it may be that giving his story a hopeful ending was his way of encouraging himself as well. I was also put off by the over-the-top stereotyping of the gay characters.The above-mentioned reservations notwithstanding, this is a remarkable work of black humor; although I laughed frequently, I was also struck by the real pain in these characters' lives. A very unique reading experience."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ummmm, I think I have mixed feelings about this book, and it seems I am one of the few people who neither worship it nor hate it. I really enjoyed the originality of the setting, the bizarre characters and Ignatius Reilly, what a riot! His dialogue is absolutely sharp and hilarious, we have to give credit to the author for this. And Ms. Trixie, ooohhhh!!! My favourite character of the novel, no doubt! But somehow the story lacks a plot, and Ignatius's ramblings become derivative far too early into the book. I'm sure I appreciated the humour and sarcasm in the story, but a better developed plot would have given it five stars."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I romped through this novel in only a few days - laughing all the way! I'd never read anything so clever: so funny, yet wrought with the many sad and universal truths of this life. Ignatius J. Reilly - a pathetic and sad picture of a human being - being quite well-aware that he is possessed of a vast superiority of mind - gallivants through New Orleans leaving all forms of upheaval in his wake.Ah - Toole brings New Orleans, a city I love dearly, alive here - it swelters and breathes with every word on every page of this epic work of art and wit!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I bought this book on the strength of its reviews,a nd the fact that I was in the mood for a laugh-out-loud novel. Instead, I have stumbled upon a situation similar to the emperor's new clothes....does everyone really find this book funny, or are they all jumping on the bandwagon? After attempting the first 150 pages, feeling repulsed, and finding little humor, I had to stop. What others must find as humor is really cynicism disguised with a patina of offensiveness. It's sad that O'Toole committed suicide, but if the theory that all novels are autobiographical holds true, Ican see why O'toole/Ignatius did"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have recently decided that any of my friends or family that do not like this book or think it is funny are no longer allowed to associate themselves with me. This book is one of the smartest, funniest books I've ever read and anyone who doesn't understand it is clearly a dunce."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"As the typical Gemini, I understand both the reviews that hate this book &amp; the ones that love it. I hated it for the first 100 pages. Ignatius Reilly is such a self-centered, unattractive character that I wondered why anyone would write a 462 page book about him. And in truth, he doesn't change from the beginning to the end of the book. Is he insane or the classic iconoclast? What Toole does brilliantly in this book is swirl a universe of minor characters and absurd events around Iggy. The minor characters are extremely well defined from the mother to Santa the matchmaker to Dorian Greene the gay blade to Mancuso the addled policeman that we delight in the world that seems to swirl around Ignatius, just outside his much touted &quot;worldview.&quot; If you hated this book, you're absolutely right because the main character takes the word &quot;jerk&quot; to a whole new level. If you loved this book, you're also absolutely right because it is a story rich in detail, fresh in its outlook, even several decades after it was written. This is a book that challenges us, tries our patience, and rewards us with a glimpse into the alternate universe known as New Orleans. Good luck!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"In his book &quot;On Writing&quot;, Stephen King's advice to aspiring writers is not to focus so much on plot or theme, but on creating characters that act true to themselves, and the plot will basically write itself. &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, I believe, does just that. The strength of this book is in its characters, and as they interact, the plot develops in an often hilarious fashion. There are enough &quot;minor&quot; characters to rival the cast of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and they all have their quirks and eccentricities. There is Mancusco, the disgraced policeman who is forced to patrol wearing absurd costumes and disguises. There is the jive-talking Jones, trying to keep one step ahead of the law by working at sub-minimum wage in a seedy dive. There is Darlene who has the &quot;bright&quot; idea of performing a striptease act with a trained cockatoo, with disastrous results. There is Miss Trixie, a senile secretary still waiting for her Christmas ham. There is the henpecked CEO of Levy Pants, who is content to let the company run itself much to the chagrin of his shrewish wife. These characters and many more populate the universe of this expert novel.The character around which this whole universe revolves is Ignatius J. Reilly. Ignatius cannot fully be described, only experienced. An overweight slob with the vocabulary of an elite snob, Ignatius is at the same time a reactionary and a revolutionary, decidedly out of place in the 20th century, a man with a &quot;unique world view&quot;, writing out his manifesto on an endless supply of Big Chief Tablets. Ignatius is usually screaming at almost everything, especially his tippling mother, but also at the dancers on an &quot;American Bandstand&quot;-type show and the actors on the movie screen. His entrance into the job market, as a file clerk who refuses to file and a hot-dog vendor who eats most of the product himself, his botched attempts at political organization, and his obsessive disgust with his &quot;girlfriend&quot; in New York make for a character the likes of which is previously unknown in all of literature.Reviewer have called this a great comic novel, which I feel is shortchanging this book quite a bit. It's a great novel, period."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This may be the funniest book I've ever read. The protagonist is one of the most well written characters in history. A great, funny read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces was a book club pick. We have been reading a lot of new, recently published books, so we decided to go with something that fell into the \\"classic\\" category. I'm not sure this one is truly a \\"classic\\" , but it's been around for awhile and is definitely a book that certain people just absolutely love. I was not one of those people - at first.I really struggled with this one at first. It's not particularly dense, but I found the story kind of dull and a little pointless. In fact, about 200 pages in, I put it down and didn't pick it up again for another two weeks (I used the excuse that I had a library book I needed to finish before the due date, despite the fact that this was a library book too. Self-serving logic? Yes, please.) However, with this month's book club looming, I gave it another go and finished it with a few days to spare.When it comes to books, I usually go with my first reaction. If I'm not hooked after 50-100 pages, I'm probably not going to come back with a favorable review, if I even finish it (I don't force myself to finish books I'm not loving). A Confederacy of Dunces was different though. I wasn't quickly hooked and I didn't really like it that much after I had finished it. However, it turned out to be one of those books that I have a hard time leaving behind. I've been mulling the book over since I put it down (for the second and last time) and it's actually grown on me. Turns out A Confederacy of Dunces is like cheese or wine - gets a little better with time.My take on the author's point: most people are pretty stupid and so wrapped up in their own pointless lives that they don't realize how stupid they are. This is not exactly a comforting thought - it's actually kind of harsh, even if it may not be far off the truth. However, instead of creating a depressing, sad book, Toole creates these peculiar characters and sets them down in these ridiculous scenes, but none of the characters realize how peculiar they are or how ridiculous their current situation is. And I came to realize that the aimlessness of the story I originally struggled with, underlined Toole's point.I actually think this book would make a good movie - there is a lot of situational humor that would translate well to a visual medium and the story would support a great ensemble cast. Jack Black or Zach Galifianakis could play Ignatius, the obese, over-educated, self-important mama's boy. Myrna Minkoff, the sex-obsessed politico, could be played by Parker Posey. Ignatius' tired, possibly alcoholic mother, Irene, could be played by Carol Burnett.In a nutshell: Originally, I gave this one 2.5 stars, but after some thought, it grew on me and I have bumped my original rating up to a 3.5."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I belong to a book club and never would have selected this to read.

His works on theology, philosophy, and logic, were textbooks in the Universities, in which (as at Oxford) his followers, called Scotists, were a predominating Scholastic sect, until the 16th c., when the system was attacked with ridicule, first by the humanists, and then by the reformers, as a farrago of needless entities, and useless distinctions. The Dunsmen or Dunses, on their side, railed against the \`new learning', and the name Duns or Dunce, already synonymous with \`cavilling sophist' or \`hair-splitter', soon passed into the sense of \`dull obstinate person impervious to the new learning', and of \`blockhead incapable of learning or scholarship'.Boethius, is a 500 century Italian scholar, wrote texts on geometry and arithmetic which were of poor quality but used for many centuries during a time when mathematical achievement in Europe was at a remarkable low.Reilly, the obese, farting, belching central character believes that Boethius together with the cartoon character batman, uphold all that is worthwhile in philosophy! His worldview is ludicruously insane, his actions that of a madman. During his graduate years, he advised one of his professors, to hang himself by his underdeveloped testicles. His girlfriend, thinks that the problems of the world can be solved only through liberated sex. The thoughts and actions of all the characters in the story seem like some sort of a tribal incantation. Yet, the foreknowledge of events, the delight in repetition gives strength to storytelling. The overall conglomeration is precisely - a confederacy of dunces. In parts the book is funny, but together the book shows us how easy it is to get trapped in our respective small worlds."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Given some of the comments made previously regarding Ignatius Riley's &quot;sad&quot; existence, I must say that those finding him to be such a sad character are, themselves, sad.

Ignatius' letter to the firm he lambasts so ridiculously still gets me weeping with laughter. I once actually had a friend of a friend tell me that she couldn't detect the humor.

Toole is not a polished or fully mature author; the writing is uneven, and some scenes drag, especially those involving Levy and his cliched harridan of a wife. That said, I will add my voice to the cacophany of delirious fans. Brilliant, the work of a visionary. A seething, poignant book that captures the tragedy as well as the comedy of urban life. If there was some voudou ritual that would bring Toole back for the sequel I'd volunteer myself as a sacrifice. Scintillating dialects and dialogues, a dozen determinedly interwoven subplots, and of course Ignatius J Reilly himself, the hero whose (disappointingly trim) statue graces present-day Canal St. in New Orleans.

This is worth a re-read because of the detail and the incredible humor. It helps to know the New Orleans dialect and mindset while reading it. A wonderful book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"After my visit to the great city of New Orleans just a week before the devastation left by Katrina, I decided to read this award-winning novel that is set in New Orleans. And it's true that this novel has the city at heart. As a matter of fact, the city itself becomes somewhat of a character in Toole's novel. But in the end, I can't fully admit to having loved this book.And this is mostly due to the story's main character. Ignatious is a large, very loud, very opinionated man that can never find the errors in his ways. His life is nothing but a sham, and his mind is a ludicrous fried mess. Being well in his thirties, he still lives with his mother, does not have a job and refuses to take ahold of his life.No wonder he is giving his mother headaches. Ignatius is just a big bag of problems. So after his mother has a car accident due to his carelessness, she decides that he needs to find a job in order to help pay for the damages. Reluctantly, Ignatius agrees. As we follow him from job to job, the character becomes more and more ridiculous, more and more irresponsible.Ignatius got on my nerves, plain and simple. Although some moments had me smiling, I rolled my eyes more often than anything else. These characters are clueless, desperate and very, very emotionally empty. I like a little more substance and three-dimentional characters when I read a book. And the ending itself is much too evasive; nothing is really resolved, nothing is explained, nothing is settled.I did enjoy the novel for taking me back to New Orleans, albeit in the 1960s. In here, we find great pleasure in following these characters around the great city.In the end, this somewhat comic novel simply didn't do it for me. Although I could appreciate some of it, a greater part of it left me feeling a little bitter."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Is Ignatius J. Reilly a tragic hero? Well, he certainly has tragic flaws. He is obese, loud, obnoxious, careless, rude, condescending, irresponsible, and annoying. His entire life is a blur of mishaps, movies, television, [...]. There is not a single instance in which he commits a selfless or useful act. Ignatius might be a genius of sorts, but I refuse to consider him a hero. He is a hate-filled, selfish narcissist who thinks his burps don't stink.Should Reilly be considered a genius because the world seems to be in a confederacy against him? The narrator certainly seems to think so. The title of the novel, A Confederacy of Dunces, suggests that Ignatius is a diamond in the rough. Throughout the story, Mrs. Reilly talks about people who have a hard path. In fact, the most difficult path of all is that of the reader attempting to muddle through this book. The plot is intriguing to some extent, and this novel is filled with good comedy. But the main character is so grotesque, so hard to deal with, that it is almost impossible to stomach his abhorring existence for the simple pleasure of a few laughs. I can only hope that Toole's featured character is based purely in fiction.Ignatius J. Reilly is a villain, not a hero. He actually attempts to bring bodily harm upon poor Mr. Gonzalez, who was nothing but nice and hospitable throughout the novel. This story is set in a time when colored people were discriminated against harshly. But the colored factory workers actually show more class and intelligence than Ignatius could ever embrace when they abandon his quest for Moorish dignity. The most frustrating part of the story is when Ignatius becomes a hotdog vendor. He could make money so easily, and he proves this by actually selling all his hotdogs one day. Instead, he muddles around and embraces the \\"poor me\\" outlook on life. He is so pathetic he can't even help himself. Still, I don't know how any reader would feel pity for Ignatius.Just when it seems Ignatius can't get any worse, he is confronted by Mr. Levy. Instead of confessing to the letter, or making up some wild story, Ignatius is cold hearted enough to accuse Miss Trixie of writing it. As if her life wasn't horrible enough, he felt obligated to shovel another heap of manure on her wagon. By the end of the novel, I found myself desperately hoping Ignatius would meet some violent or horrible demise. I wanted his escape attempt with Myrna to fail so he could be taken away to the mental hospital. I wanted to see Ignatius rot for all the horrible things he had done.Ignatius is so mechanical it's funny. This character is a beautiful illustration of Henri Bergson's theory of comedy, as presented in Laughter. Ignatius is predictable and unoriginal. He is someone we can all laugh at, but certainly not someone we should consider heroic. I respect the fact that he is different from the rest of the world and doesn't conform simply to fit in. People should aspire to be more like Reilly in the way he doesn't let other people influence him. You can't always worry about how you are perceived by other people. But in Ignatius' case, his fierce independence and singularity is not admirable at all because he refuses to develop as a person. He won't leave New Orleans (until he is forced to), he won't open up to anyone, and he reacts the same way to everything he encounters.Under the bloated, dirty, ugly surface, Ignatius J. Reilly is nothing more than a simple minded coward. His vocabulary is impressive; his ideas are unique in the time in which he lives. But Ignatius is basically a child in a fat man's body. He is motivated by the wild fantasies in which he lives. He is completely dependent upon his poor alcoholic mother. He has no intentions to ever better himself or society in any realistic way; instead he remains absorbed in ancient fantasy tales. His belief in Fortuna best sums up his existence: a refusal to take any kind of responsibility (ever) and a complete lack of motivation in life. Ignatius J. Reilly is the most tasteless and indecent character I have ever encountered. With all the vagrants and criminals in New Orleans, Toole's only shortcoming was that he never allowed Ignatius to catch a knife in the ribs, or worse.A Confederacy of Dunces is a worthwhile read, if only to learn how awful a person can be. Ignatius is absolutely despicable and disgusting, but he is funny nonetheless. This is an absolutely unique novel and a first rate comedy, but I haven't so strongly disliked a character since I read excerpts from Mein Kampf."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius T. Riely is rude. Ignatius T. Riely is fat. Ignatius T. Riely is a loud, obnoxious, over-educated, under-achieving boob of a man. Yet somehow, when it comes to life, he just gets it.Not only is this book funny as hell, it is deliciously thought-provoking wonderfully written. Worthy of as many stars as possible."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Confederacy of Dunces written by John Kennedy Toole is by far the most bizarre book I have ever read. John Kennedy Toole is a unique author to say the least. He displayed this ability to write a unique book when he when he wrote Confederacy of Dunces.This 400page book takes place in New Orleans, which is a port city with many immigrants who come to America. All the different cultures that the immigrants come from represent uniqueness which is a big part of Ignatius's personality. It is very fitting that Toole chose New Orleans as the setting for the book. The diversity of the city can be related to the diversity or uniqueness of Ignatius.Confederacy's main theme is how Ignatius is different from the rest of society but that he does not realize this. He does not realize in the book that if he lived anywhere else in the world he would not be able to complain or critique anything about the government like he does in the United States. Not only is Ignatius a little different than most people in society but all the characters who surround Ignatius day to day are also a bit \\"different\\".The book shows how Ignatius \\"who is not all their\\" functions in day to day society. I should say tries to function in day to day society. The book also reveals as time passeshow Ignatius and his mother do not get along. Once his mother meets the cop who almost arrested her son Ignatius because he looked suspicious, she slowly becomes friends with him. Before Ignatius realizes, Mancuso, who is the cop ,is at his house quite a bit and Ignatius is completely against him hanging out with his mom and being in his house. Ignatius slowly develops grudges against people and it is not just Mancuso.Ignatius begins to become enemy's with other characters such as Lana Lee who is the owner of the Night of Joy bar which is not a place where Ignatius is necessarily liked. He is not liked by Lana because of the behavior he displayed when he went in her establishment after he almost got arrested by Mancuso. He told his mother on their walk back to the house from the store where he almost got arrested that he was very hungry and he could not wait till they got home to eat. So Irene took him to eat at Night of Joy but after they ate because of the hard day they had they both decided to get very drunk. Once they were drunk Ignatius started fights with the other customers and that is why Lana has been upset with him ever since. It is events like these that become a trend in the way Ignatius behaves as the book goes on.One of the reasons I disliked the book was because their was no moral to the story. The character never showed maturity as the book progressed. I think that if someone is going to write a book they need to have a reason or a plot to base it on. I feel as if Toole just wrote this book for the hell of it instead of writing to prove a theory or a point or to teach a lesson. Why would anyone want to read a book that has no point? To me this question is still unanswered and this is why I did not like Confederacy of Dunces."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It was a good book. I'll admit to that. However, I did not find it &quot;rip-roaring&quot;. I found it disturbing. It did have funny moments, but I was disappointed, I guess I heard too much hype about its humor.J.K. Toole was a good writer. But I felt this book was unfinished. The last chapter, although climactic seemed to die at the very end.All in all a good, quick read. Interesting characters and story line. Some humor, mostly tragedy and unsetteling reality."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I read this years ago, and found myself disliking it immensely from the first chapter. I forced myself to finish it and seem to remember liking that at least we sort of got somewhere, to some sort of plot conclusion, at the end. That's about all I can say in its defense. It's turgid, not funny, and I really don't care about what happens to a single character. Now, I had to read it again for my book club this month,and I put it down after just re-reading the Kindle sample.Ignatious is a slacker and unattractive person with no redeeming qualities. Other characters are just foils for his so-called antics and are neither believable nor interesting. I think the writing is poor, and I guess I just don't get the hype. I wonder if the author received the Pulitzer for dying, much as I think Heath Ledger won the Oscar for the same reason.If I want to read a book in which the characters are slackers, I'd rather re-read Steinbeck's Tortilla Flat. That at least had both real humor and real pathos. This, in my opinion, is just crap."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"1) It's over-written.2) The characters are sledgehammers with little subtlety and less credibility.3) The dialogs are boring, trite, and artificial.4) The humor is forced.5) The scenes are too long for their content.6) I'll give it a star for mass.In short, it is precisely what I would expect the intellectual elite to choose for a classic.For everybody else, it needs a laugh track."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him. -Jonathan Swift, Thoughts on Various Subjects, Moral and DivertingThere's always a danger, when the story of a book's publication or an author's biography is really compelling, that our natural fascination with the background elements will effect how we judge the novel itself. I believe John Kennedy Toole's very funny, but badly flawed, Confederacy of Dunces, to be an instance where this happened. For anyone not familiar with the circumstances surrounding the book, Toole's mother, Thelma, pestered Walker Percy until he consented to read her dead son's &quot;great&quot; novel. Percy, to his great surprise, found the huge manuscript, which was presented to him on badly smeared carbon paper, compulsively readable. As it turned out, Toole had committed suicide in 1969, and his frustration at his inability to get the book published may have been a contributing factor; at least, such a supposition makes for an even better story. Percy helped to get the book published, by the Louisiana State University Press, and it went on to become a surprise best seller and won a posthumous, by 12 years, Pulitzer Prize.The novel tells the story of thirty year old Ignatius J. Reilly of New Orleans, an eccentric medievalist, living at home with his mother, whom he torments, and of his one man war against modernity. Ignatius, who is an undeniably original comic creation, is a hugely fat bundle of body functions, paranoia and obsessions, topped with a green hunting cap, who spends all of his considerable free time eating, attending movies, and locked in his disgusting room committing his various demented thoughts to his stacks of Big Chief writing tablets.The story opens with Ignatius being arrested by the hapless Patrolman Mancuso, an arrest which soon goes awry and sends Ignatius and his mother in search of liquid comfort, which they find at the Night of Joy bar. While Mrs. Reilly tipples, Ignatius regales her and various dumbfounded listeners with the story of his ill-fated trip to Baton Rouge aboard a Greyhound Scenicruiser for a job interview, a trip which was apparently so traumatic that it has kept him from working ever since. But later that night Mrs. Reilly backs into another car and in order to pay for the damages Ignatius is forced to seek work.The misanthrope, turned loose on the work a day world, proceeds to do hilarious damage to various employers, coworkers and customers, while using his experiences as the basis for a memoir titled : The Journal of a Working Boy, or, Up from Sloth. His misadventures at Levy Pants are particularly funny, as he sends abusive letters to clients and tries leading a revolt by the firm's largely black workforce, marching beneath a banner, actually one of his badly stained bedsheets, declaring the &quot;Crusade for Moorish Dignity.&quot;From there he goes on to a job as a hot dog vendor, an attempt to found a new political party, and all the while carries out bitter vendettas against his mother, Patrolman Mancuso, and Myrna Minkoff, a supposed girlfriend from college. All of this is quite funny, but at the same time it's fairly easy to see why it was not considered publishable. In the first place it is much too long and loses its focus as it goes along, before rallying at the end. Secondly, Ignatius, though amusing, is just too far over the top to command our sympathies. His fascination with body functions and his erotic dreams of a departed pet collie are less shocking now, when even Disney movies are filled with fart jokes, than they were twenty and thirty years ago, but it still gets to be a little much. Lastly, and most importantly, Ignatius is so screwed up himself, and his various screeds are so contradictory, that his general opposition to the modern age, which could have served as a badly needed unifying theme for the whole novel, and have given it some intellectual heft, ends up being pretty incoherent and hypocritical.A great novel might well have been made out of these raw materials, had Toole lived and a good editor gotten ahold of him. But we'll never know. What we have instead is a very amusing, sometimes even laugh-out-loud-funny book, which adds up to less than the sum of its parts. The tragic fact that a talented author killed himself before he could make the changes necessary to turn this into a first rate novel should neither diminish, nor make us overstate, what he did achieve.GRADE : B"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I'm about a third of the way through and it's slow-going. I keep waiting for the uproarious comedy and scathing insight promised by this book's glowing reviews. Nothing yet.The sections of the book written by the character Ignatius are at least readable; a take on modern life provided by a misanthropic medievalist is kind of interesting. But that's not enough to justify the $15 I paid for my copy. Be warned - if you're intent on reading it, borrow a copy from the library."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Someone compared this disaster to the Seinfeld tv series, and I suppose I would agree. I never had much appreciation for Seinfeld and its desperate grasps at comedy; just so, Confederacy of Dunces relies largely on slapstick, nerve grating characters, and meandering plot. The book drags on and on--the climax, that should indicate an easy, swift road to the conclusion, is so backward that the last 20 pages will be even harder to read through than some of the middle 20 pages.In all fairness, there was some effective comedic elements; the voices of the characters were unique, and the language was elegant. Its hard to say exactly why this greatly lauded, Pulitzer Prize winning novel failed to live up to my expectations, what literary mechanics failed Toole, but I would approach the reading of this book with a grain of salt or two.

If Dunces demonstrates genius, then the Three Stooges are on par with Chaplin. The amazon review also says this drivel cannot be easily dismissed. Again, says who? This is one &quot;book&quot; I plan to forget as soon as possible."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"While I suppose this book is realistic, it is completely unreadable due to its main character, Ignatius Reilly.

I have no idea what the author was thinking when he created him. In the story, things always go right for Ignatius even though the reader desperately wants him to suffer. Why would anyone want to read about such a loathsome character? Ignatius is treated as the hero because he's the main character, but he is no hero, to be sure.Why did this win a Pulitzer? I think it was mainly due hype over the complex story of the book's publication.

Even with a well-developed vocabulary, you may find some of the antiquated word selection difficult to digest without some of the alternate contextual definitions used by the author.

How sad that Toole was taken from us by his own tormented hand, how lucky readers are to have this brilliant book to remember him by.A few years back, when I was working on my novel, \\"Life Askew,\\" a friend who'd read a few chapters pressed his copy of \\"Dunces\\" against my chest and insisted I read it immediately. My book and I were posessed by the spirit of John Kennedy Toole, he'd said. Of course, I was flattered to be compared to a Pulitzer Prize winner, and saddened to learn of the story of how the book was posthumously published by his mother.Now, years later, my novel is done and I'm convinced my friend was right; \\"Life Askew\\" and \\"Dunces\\" are cut from the same cloth."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I was astonished to see that anyone has given this book a bad review. It's so funny, I laughed until tears rolled out of my eyes. Fifteen years after I first read it, I still give copies as Christmas presents."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"John Kennedy Toole presents an eloquent, vibrant look into the life of a consummate educated slacker. The protagonist moves through the pages with nonchalance and the reader vicariously thrills to a life that says, \\"I am not putting up with hassles.\\"We get a real sense of the experientially rich city that is New Orleans, but with the amazingly diverse set of characters, it is fun to read in a city like New York.It is definitely a tragedy to see yet another example of an artist with a real grasp of living lose his life so young.Toole's legacy - this dynamic comedy opus - will remain."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"If you ever watch The Simpsons, Ignatius P. Reilly is a lot like the Comic Book Shop Guy, and I think they are both hilarious. This is a book everyone should read. I know a several people who are a lot like Reilly, which makes the book both funny and depressing; realistic and absurd. A literary classic because it encapsulates our American Society into a story. Amazingly enough, it is more relavent now than it was then. Some people would say that it has been overrated which might be slightly true, but the bottom line is it is a damn fine novel and a classic. It deserves at least one read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I don't know why it took me thirty years to pick up this book and read it...but wow! I'm glad I did. Ignatius J. Reilly is arrogant, smelly and wickedly hilarious! His distaste in everything and everyone cracks me up. So many times during the read I was baffled yet thoroughly entertained by this character and all of his misadventures. I laughed out loud many times reading this book. It's too bad the author never lived to see it win a Pulitzer...but for some reason, I think that he may have scoffed at the idea anyway."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"..... and those of you who didn't like it... please let me know where you live so I don't accidentally move next door to you...A confederacy is a brilliant piece of work. However, on my second reading of it I was struck more by the underlying tragedy of Ignatius than by the sheer, absurd humor of his lunatic, madcap escapades and his eerily logical rhetoric.This work, is also, without a doubt a powerful political commentary of the times.Buy it, read it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is a book that makes you laugh out loud over and over again, as you eagerly await the next moves of a protagonist who is brilliant, yet pathetic at the same time. The characters remind me of those in a Thomas Wolfe novel, with their faults and foibles right out in the open. Ignatius disgusts, yet compels you to cheer him on at the same time. When you get to the Ladies Auxiliary art show scene -- BE WARNED -- you may not want to read this on a public plane, train etc. because you will be laughing so hard the tears will be running down your face! I was sorry to see this book end, and wish Kennedy had lived to write more. I would have liked to see where Ignatius' travels lead him to next!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Does anyone else notice how many of the one star reviews hate Ignatius because he's &quot;overweight&quot;?

It would say something about him."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"What kind of pet? JKT's take on the world is different from anyone else's, and this book gives an idea of how things can be at the opposite end of the scale compared to most people today."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"He's obnoxious...he's opinionated...he's dysfunctional...yet under it all he is brilliant. Who is he? He's Ignatius J. Reilly, the absurd modern day philosopher who's mission is to crusade for moorish dignity and to teach the human race his worldview.One evening in New Orleans, Ignatius and his dim-witted mother go to the Night of Joy Bar for a few drinks. On the way home, with Ignatius riding in the back seat of their 1946 Plymouth and a tipsy Mrs. Reilly behind the wheel, they crash into a building leaving it damaged and the owner furious. Mrs. Reilly is liable for payments yet has no money. The solution? She demands that her over-weight unemployed 30 year old son Ignatius, who has never held down a job get one. Reluctantly, Ignatius hits the streets of New Orleans in search of employment. When he gets his first job working in the office of Levy Pants Factory he describes himeself in his journal as a pacifist working boy.When chaos strikes around every corner, you know Ignatius is there. First he gathers all the factory workers at Levy Pants to stage a protest against poor working conditions. Things get out of hand, a short-lived riot ensues and Ignatius's big plan backfires. He gets fired from his job and is then forced to make a living as a hot dog vendor. His mother becomes very distraught that her beloved son must stoop to, &quot;selling weenies.&quot; One mishap after another happens as the new weenie man comes into contact with the vivid characters that rome the french quarter of the city.I admit, I was a bit skeptical when I first picked up this book. It took a few chapters before I really got absorbed but then...WHOA! The wild storyline took off like an F-14 Tomcat cruising down the runway for a takeoff. What really makes this novel so original and comical is its colorful array of characters. There is Miss Trixie, the senile secretary for Levy Pants who refers to Ignatius as Gloria. There's Mrs. Levy, whom believes she is the next Sigmund Freud because she took a correspondence course in psychology. Also there is policeman Mansuco, a rookie cop who is assigned to work undercover in the streets of the city wearing outrageous costumes. Let's not forget Myrna Minkoff, Ignatius's female friend from college who now resides in New York City and corresponds regularly with him. Myrna is a sex-crazed hippy who is given to anti-government protests and whose ultimate goal is to see Ignatius lose his virginity. The list of lively people that cross Ignatius's path is too ample to state. Ignatius even befriends a homosexual man and unknowingly finds himself at a gay party that he thinks has been organized as a new political movement to spread his philosophical cause. All in all, this bustling novel is definitely worth a read. Fasten your seat belt and get ready to be taken on a frenzied journey!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I give this book 5 stars easily. It is my favorite book and was consistently funny the entire way through. That said, it is not for everyone. It's lack of substantial story and plot may be off putting to some and refreshing to others. There is not a villain and classic story structure sense, but that's fine. Some need standard books. This is not one of them. This book is eerily relevant in today's culture with college graduates living at home and being in a constant state of childhood. It's a shame that no further books were written by Toole, he would have been the top satirist of the century."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This story has no plot really to speak of. Yes Ignatius wants to make the wheel of Fortuna stop plopping him down where he doesn't want to be, but he basically wanders around aimlessly spouting pompous absurdities everywhere he goes. I can understand why Publishers were averse to publishing this, and also why some don't like the story. I don't think someone 'doesn't get it' if they don't like this one. As most know the book not being published was a horrible tragedy that resulted in John Kennedy O'Toole committing suicide. That said it is not for the plot that this is a masterpiece or why it won the Pulitzer Prize. It is the book's entirely realized characters. Each is unique each stays in character through every action, word and thought, even the old man in prison sorting through the belongings in his pocket. In addition the humor in this novel is unparalleled. I could agree some scenes seem to drag on a bit long and are repetitive, but the novel's overall originality and attention to detail overcomes these flaws. This is certainly a case of a novel's overall greatness overcoming it's limitations. I can't give this book less 5 stars in spite of its problems. The things it does well are simply done too well to justify that. Not a week goes by where I don't think of a scene or detail in the story and chuckle or as Jones might say, \\"Whoa!\\""},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius Reilly is one of the most unusual and truly unique characters I have come across in novels. Exceedingly obese, self-centered, disengaged from society by choice, hygienically-challenged.....this is not the typical protagonist a reader would pull for. But, there is something very appealing about this corpulent and unfashionably dressed man from New Orleans that keeps the reader's attention. Like a terrible wreck on the highway that you can't turn away from and secretly hope to see carnage, this is a man you just can't turn away from no matter how loathsome he gets.Whether he is musing on his preference to be a Negro (this is the 1960's) and not have the white man's burden of struggling to attain a place in the misguided middle class, leading factory workers in open revolt, inventing a new filing system, or pushing a hot dog cart through the French Quarter, Ignatius commands your attention.Whether this is a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy is debatable, but one thing is certain: you will find yourself laughing out loud on just about every page. The author's clever use of language, the well-defined secondary characters, and the pure genius of the tale itself leaves you thinking about Ignatius and his mom long after the book is read.Brimming with the local color of New Orleans, the author fills the reader's mind with images from the underbelly of that city, its more unsavory characters, and the dens of ill repute that made it famous. Only once in his life did Ignatius leave the city and that was on an ill-fated bus ride to Baton Rouge, or as Ignatius likes to call it in his many retellings of his misadventure, \\"the whirlpool of despair\\".Because of a mistaken arrest which leads to his mother's heavy drinking and subsequent car accident, Ignatius is forced to get a job. And that is when the fun really begins.His Ivy League education has not prepared him for anything other than lying around the house, critiquing American Bandstand, and making demands of his haggard mom. However, when money is desperately needed, Mama tells him to get out of the house and get a job or else.His comic misadventures at Levy's Pants and later as a hot dog vendor on the streets of the French Quarter are hysterically funny. Miss Trixie, the befuddled septuagenarian who only wants to retire, Gonzalez the conscientious office manager, Darlene the stripper who wants to be a star, Jones the janitor who only works to avoid jail, and the incompetent but dedicated Officer Mancuso enter and exit Ignatius' life and all come together in the end to insure a surprisingly logical conclusion for Ignatius."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Many reviewers explain their dislike of this novel by pointing to the fact that the characters aren't likable. Since when do all the characters have to be cotton candy for one to read it? The locale of the novel is interesting, the plot is well-handled, the characters are vibrant, the dialogue - especially in dialect - rings true, the book is not overlong,there is a glorious humor that surrounds everything, and the book holds up upon re-reading."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Very little I can say that hasn't been said in so many reviews but this is one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. I bought it many years ago after reading the story of Toole's suicide and his mothers quest to have her son's book published.

It is EXTREMELY well crafted and possesses an amazing sense of humor and satire; making it a classic. I was amazed to find a book with such brilliant humor and at the same time a very deep philosophy. A Confederacy of Dunces is more than just a laugh; but of course the true meaning of the book is only visible to those who seek--as with any masterpiece. The only downside is that this is the only work that John Kennedy Toole has left behind."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I never expected when I began reading this book that I would encounter such a hilarious and original character as Ignatius. He is similar to Shakespeare's Falstaff, always playing, his language always new.Like Falstaff, Ignatius Reilly is not an admirable character from a moral or social standpoint. On the contrary he seems a pathetic bum, and a burden on his mother. His medieval inclinations set him in constant contrast from the world around him. Does his imagination isolate him from reality? Or does it allow him to make, in his bizarre, idiosyncratic way, a genuine social criticism of American life? Perhaps both at once.While he is somewhat disgusting, he is also beautifully interesting in his individuality. His sparkling humor is mixed with underlying sorrow and helplessness, and one dreads with him the time when he would be finally trapped by \\"reality.\\" He is very selfish, but somehow at the same time he is a catalyst for change in the stagnant lives of others.The end of this book is not what one would expect, ... Personally I think the ending is perfect, and as happy an ending as Ignatius could hope for."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"&quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; is a sheer joy to read. The protagonist is one of the greatest comic creations of the twentieth century. In John Kennedy Toole we find yet another example of a staggering talent of whom we can only now say &quot;what if...&quot; However, I think we are extremely lucky to at least have this gracious gift of his left behind. &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; will be providing laughing fits for centuries to come."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have been reading all of the reviews, and I must say...I did not expect there to be so much controversy surrounding this book. It seems that people either love it or hate it; I didn't see the words like and dislike used much. I happened to be one of those who loved it. The characters are colorful and memorable. It seems to me that a person who can read into things would appreciate this book more. I think that much of the humor is merely Toole's commentary on societal faults. If you laugh, you are laughing at our, American society...which is often quite funny. If you haven't read this, you should definitely give it a try. At least then you can choose your side of the war."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The first time I met Ignatius J. Reilly was many years back as a young man in my teens.

The writer's comedic timing brings the reader to uproarious laughter and affection for this gestalt. The author presents these socially, educationally, and economically failed characters with warmth and a stricken tolerance of their foibles; as if, at some level, even he cannot believe what they are up to next. Toole describes the unsavory underbelly of a decaying, corrupt, racist, and irrational old New Orleans, with such a fine hewn pen as to turn the city, and thus the story into a masterpiece. This novel is a gift from a sensitive and tragically deceased author."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius J. Reilly is certainly one of literature's unforgettable characters, and so are many of the supporting cast of this farcical morality play, written by a writer who committed suicide in his 32nd year, winning the Pulitzer posthumously.Ignatius, a self-proclaimed genius, is lazy, opinionated, hypochondriacal, idealistic, flatulent and sexually scared, content to relieve himself with solo performances in his room. He is unemployed (and unemployable), lives in New Orleans with his harried and broke mother, and has an ambivalent relationship with his radical but sexually frustrated girlfriend, Myrna, who has run away to New York to start her own political movement.On his mother's threat of declaring bankruptcy, Ignatius gets a job at Levy Pants, a derelict garments factory that exploits its employees. Ignatius tries to organize the workers to demand for better working conditions in an event that turns into a nightmare and gets fired. He ends up pushing a hot dog cart around the French Quarter, eating much of the product himself. He is the quintessential messiah for the downtrodden, eager to pick up any cause that will ease their burden. In these days of Occupy Wall Street, his story takes on special significance and reminds us that nothing much has changed in labour relations. Surrounding him in his adventures is a motley cast, the confederacy of dunces: a hapless policeman looking for his first arrest, Mrs. Reilly's new boyfriend who sees a communist around every corner, and the denizens of the Night of Joy, a derelict bar, whose proprietor Lana Lee is selling more than booze. Lana also has a love-hate relationship with her cleaner, Jones, who works for her for peanuts, fearing being arrested as a vagrant if he is out of work. There are also the Levy's, the owners of Levy Pants, locked in their own love-hate relationship, and the ancient Miss Trixie, who is not allowed to retire from Levy Pants for Mrs. Levy believes that will hasten the old lady's physical and mental demise.Ignatius gets into some of the most bizarre situations and the book skirts caricature and contrivance in places - my only criticism. The author brings out the underbelly of New Orleans vividly and humorously, and the accents and prejudices are well displayed. Like a play, the scenes weave together fluidly with secondary characters taking centre stage the moment lead players make their exit.Certainly, a page-turner if you can stomach a gross, unhygienic and sometimes unsympathetic hero, who has the whole world conspiring against him, including his mother.There is an ending reminiscent of the movie \\"The Graduate.\\" We are left wondering if Ignatius, now re-united with Myrna, and free of the confederacy, will step out of his comfort zone finally and have that one explosive orgasm with her that will restore him to normalcy and retire him from the pages of literature as one heck of an unforgettable guy! We shall never know, for John Kennedy Toole, like Ignatius, made a hurried and unexpected departure from the literary stage, much to our loss.(Shane Joseph's latest novel The Ulysses Man is available as a trade paperback and kindle edition on Amazon)The Ulysses ManAfter the FloodFringe DwellersRedemption in Paradise"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Easily among the best southern novels ever written.

The character of Ignatius J. Reilly is so unbelievably ridiculous it cannot be easily summed up in an Amazon review. This is how a comedic novel is supposed to be written and I find it hard to be mesmerized at how short these 300 pages I have read have seemed to go by. Excellent Read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A very amusing read. I enjoyed following Ignatius Reilly, pedantic blowhard par excellence, blunder through one madcap caper after another. My main criticism of the book is that it relies too heavily on stereotypes as the main source of comedy. That said, I was impressed with Toole's ability to write a variety of different dialects for the characters' dialogue. I also greatly enjoyed how closely Toole refers to the city of New Orleans, its street names, landmarks, culture, etc.By the end of the novel, I had grown rather fond of Mrs. Reilly, Jones, Santa Battaglia, Myrna \\"the minx\\" Minkoff, Patrolman Mancuso, Lana Lee and Darlene. May they live on in the pages of this epic, absurd, oddly charming satire forever."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A few weeks ago, a reader commented and suggested that as part of my book reviews, I acknowledge first and foremost what my expectations of each book were before reading. Thus, I will begin this practice with A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole.At first glance, I must admit that I was ambivalent to this book. I was torn between the story behind the author, the brightly illustrated cover, the fact that this book was written in the latter-half of the Twentieth Century, and the fact that it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize.First, there exists the intriguing and auspicious story regarding John Kennedy Toole and A Confederacy of Dunces. John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969, at the age of thirty-two. In 1976, John's mother approached Walker Percy, a professor at Loyola University New Orleans, with the manuscript. Four years later, in 1980, the book was published and John was posthumously awarded Pulitzer Prize for fiction. More intriguing is the fact that John had written an earlier novel, at the age of sixteen, titled The Neon Bible. This book was one that John's mother Selma wished to remain unpublished; yet, after she passed in 1984, the rest of the family sued for the rights and, in 1989, The Neon Bible was published. Is it a good book? I have no idea, I have yet to read it; however, it does has a four-and-a-half-star rating on Amazon.com. Had John Kennedy Toole known he was sitting on a literary blockbuster, would he have still ended his life so early? Or, would he have continued to write?While JKT's life and the story of publication were intriguing and compelled me to read A Confederacy of Dunces, I was wary at the fact that it was awarded the Pulitzer. The last book I read that received such an \\"honor\\" was Oscar Wao. It was terrible. Therefore, I was expecting more political and sociological undercurrents in Dunces. Fortunately, these were not an issue.The cover is brightly illustrated. The man on the cover wears a green hunting cap, a green scarf, and a red sports coat that is much too tight and is about to bust the top button. Atop this man's head is perched a yellow bird. In the background sits Bourbon Street. I had a great desire to know who this man was.Finally, I found myself again dreading the fact that I was reading contemporary literature. In one of his essays, C.S. Lewis advices both readers and aspiring writers to focus their efforts on well written books. In order to do this, Lewis advised reading only one contemporary piece for each five books read. So far, I have found this to be great advice and I routinely find myself disappointed with contemporary lit while pleasantly surprised with classic lit. Being that out of the previous ten books I read, three could definitely be classified as contemporary (Let the Great World Spin, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Methland), I found myself dealing with not only the anxiety of staring into the face of a poor ratio, but more pressing, staring into the face of two pretty bad books out of three. Fortunately, I was also reading I and Thou concurrently, which I figured more than offset the balance.A Confederacy of Dunces is truly a comic tragedy. This quirky narrative follows the life of one Ignatius J. Reilly through...well, really through a bunch of nothing. Ignatius is an intellectual who esteems himself to be better than the world around him and therefore, he does his best to remain uninvolved in that world. He spends most of his time reading Boethius and writing the next great commentary on the current state of the world.Unfortunately for Ignatius, Fortuna is out to get him. From the beginning of the novel, Ignatius finds himself at the butt end of a series of unfortunate events. First, he is haggled by a police officer simply for loitering in an arcade while his mother is shopping next door. This even causes a downward spiral in which Ignatius watches, from the backseat, as his mother plows the station wagon into a storefront while she is drunk. Having no income and faced with paying for the damages, Mrs. Reilly forces Ignatius to get a job. Fortuna continues to prey on Ignatius as he loses job after job all the while watching his world crumble around him.While reading Dunces it is easy to see that this is not so much a story concerning characters (all of whom are so far removed from any \\"normal\\" archetypes that it is difficult to form personal relationships with them) as it is a story concerning ideas and ideals. On page one, Toole writes the following:Possession of anything new or expensive only reflected a person's lack of theology and geometry; it could even cast doubts upon one's soul.Toole, through Reilly, is mourning the loss of the past. He sees in antiquity a world of great men and great ideas, a world of decency, an immaterial world where worth is measured in the depth of the human soul. Everything modern, to include canned food is \\"ultimately very damaging to the soul.\\"At every turn, Ignatius does his best to defy convention and rebel against the norm. At this he is successful, while demonstrating a complete lack of ability in every other facet of life. Unfortunately, this leaves the Ignatius a sad, lonely figure whom the reader can simply watch tumble further and further down:for I mingle with my pees or no one, and since I have no peers, I mingle with no one.However sad the book was, in total, I found myself slowing down as I neared the end, not wanting to leave the story behind. John Kennedy Toole produced a masterpiece and left it for the world: not quite comedy, not quite tragedy, but all quirk and one I can say with the confidence of someone who has read no other title from 1980* well-deserving of the Pulitzer for 1980*Other titles of note from 1980:The Bourne Identity - Robert LudlumMidnight's Children - Salman RushdieThe Covenent - James MichenerBattlefield Earth - L.

It's from that mindset that I realized that this book is (wholly by accident) about the genre convention stereotype: \\"the fanboy\\". The main character, Ignatius Jacques Reilly exhibits the following qualities:1. Socially awkward to the point of being overly social. You know the type.2. He dresses outrageously and is never without his mismatched hunting cap (much like cosplayers out of costume.)3. He gets into long winded nonsensical arguments with about random things via letters (very much akin to online \\"flame wars\\" on fan forums.)4. He cites Batman comics as the only impactful literature of the time.5. He still lives with his mom while in his thirties.A Confederacy of Dunces is a satire that depicts the ridiculous antics of various folks in New Orleans on the 1960s. It is profounds in its biting commentary on people and essays have been written about the book and the deceased author (if you haven't read the story behind him, DO IT) - yet none that I have found point out the obvious (at least to me) connection to current stereotypes in fandom culture.If you've ever walked the around San Diego Comic Con or Dragon*Con, I suggest you take some time to read this and see how alive and well Ignatius is in today's society."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The misadventures of Ignatius J. Reilly are humorously detailed in this novel. Many readers will find Ignatius so repugnant and the black humor of this story so off-putting that they won't enjoy the book. Why do people need to relate to, or feel some compassion for a main character? A good villain or entertaining ignoramus can be just as fulfilling to base a book around. I found Ignatius' smug arrogance and superiority complex so amusingly funny that I read this book rather rapidly. Ignatius is a pathetic human being who lives with his mom and can't hold down a job. But to hear him tell it, the world can't handle the genius that is Ignatius. He is full of excuses about how his delicate sensibilities prevent him from succeeding and besides he wouldn't want to succeed in such a depraved culture. But Ignatius loves to torture himself by delving in to this indecent society. One of his favorite past-times is to go to horrible movies and shout, \\"oh my god\\" with disgust at the movie. But he can't stay away. The humor of such a pathetic character who feels that he is superior to the world is what keeps this book ticking."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius oh how the world conspires against thee! This book is my all time fav, great plots and even better characters. Like a chocolate cake you've snuck off to eat, this is one of life's guilty pleasures."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Being thrown into the world of Ignatius J. Reilly was an interesting experience. The introduction of such a bizarre character certainly caught my attention and kept my interest for the first quarter of the book. Ignatius is revolting to the point where there were times I had to put the book down simply because I was cringing too much. That said, I am not a large fan of disgusting humor and reading about his bodily function issues did not appeal to me.This novel is driven, as most comedies of this sort are, by the way in which things happen rather then by a strong plot. Toole's writing is easy enough in its clarity, but I still found myself rereading sections to better understand what had just happened. Not that you have to go back in order to understand, but it was more like I reread it just to make sure I picked up on everything. The scenes are so absurd and the experiences and mishaps of the characters are so crazy, that there is no possible way to process it all the first time through.But the fact remains that this book did indeed make me, someone who does not usually enjoy disgusting humor, laugh at times. Ignatius' outlook on the world and his writings about it, his conversations with others and the situations he gets himself into are ridiculous, but they are what compel you to read on. I do recommend this book for anyone looking for a good comedy, that is, only if your stomach is strong enough for this sort of humor."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I cannot praise this book enough. Never before have I laughed out loud so many times while reading a novel. IT IS COMPLETELY BRILLIANT!

Having just finished re-reading the Heart of Darkness, I thought, \\"Why not, I could use a laugh.\\"Let me first say that Toole was a fine writer, and his ability to describe people and places impressed me. However, I found nothing about this book funny. Ignatius seems to suffer from some sort of borderline personality disorder, and almost every other character is pathetic and caricatured. Their antics are not amusing, but sad. Before you respond that the caricatures were deliberate, the caricatures may have been amusing when the book is written, but I do not feel they have aged well in the 30 odd years since the book was written.So did I laugh? No. Is this book hilarious? I don't think so (and frankly, I am easily amused). Reading this book made me sad. So to cheer myself up, I am going to read an author who makes disfunction truly hilarious: David Sedaris."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"There is very little to like about Ignatius J. Reilly. He believes he is always correct despite plenty of evidence to the contrary, his personal grooming and general behavior is blatantly anti-social, and he treats his confused mother horribly. He takes on a \\"Don Quixote\\" quality when attacking what he perceives as social injustice; usually making matters infinitely worse. Yet for all of this, you are compelled to finish this book about this very odd man, the particularly inept policeman whose actions start the book's action, a young man who is trapped in a modern form of slavery by events beyond his control, and a host of other New Orleans denizens who are all particularly bizarre but somehow very real. This work is a true original that probably could have used some editing ( some plotlines take far too long to develop); I don't know if I would categorize it as a classic, but it definitely shows an author who had talent and it is a shame that this is his only major work."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I think I may be the only person who did not like this book. I read it because I had read so many great reviews and been told by a lot of people that it was hilarious. The synopsis painted a picture of a well-written story that sounded like just the thing for a reader with a sense of humor as quirky as mine. I was completely disappointed. I will say that it was well-written; that is undeniable. However, it was NOT funny at all. The characters were absolutely unlikable. Most reviews will tell you outright that the main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, is certainly no hero. He is a pompous, lazy, selfish, and self-righteous bore. I even disliked the secondary characters though. Ignatius mother, who should have been likable, grated on my nerves until any pity I should have felt for her just disappeared. I kept reading because I expected the story to pick up and hoping that a likeable character would appear. I just knew that all those good things I'd heard couldn't have been wrong but the story just never picked up. It is not very often that I start a book and don't finish it...but I just couldn't take anymore of this one. I'm sure that some of you will like it. After all, I never read a negative review before this. I just don't know who to recommend \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" to because I, personally, felt that it lacked any redeeming qualities aside from being well written...and sometimes that just isn't enough."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Although I am sorry that the author, discouraged that his book had not been published, killed himself, I did not care for the book (and I don't care if it did win a Pulitzer). I think the author's writing is gifted and believe he could have been good, but the book was too bizarre for me. The main character simply has no redeeming qualities whatsoever (but then neither does any other character in the book). Ignatius goes from one impossibly stupid situation to the next, spouting his nearly psychotic rhetoric. It is funny at first, but it just gets old after a while. I'm not sure what the point of the book was. The author was not very pleased with people, apparently."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I enjoyed some of this book's humor but after working in the social service field all my life what some may find funny I found tiring and based more on reality than some might believe. There are hundreds of men out there who fit the the main character's profile who have frustrated more than one well intentioned caseworker not to mention the \\"dunces\\" families. There is comic genius to this novel but how much is creative writing is at issue. Nick Hornby's a \\"Long Way Down\\" made me laugh a lot more and had much more to say!! It's sad the author died but I sense his genius was overblown by critics based on the circumstances of his untimely demise."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"i've had my copy since 1985 and am on 3rd or 4th reading. had the author lived perhaps there would have been a succession of ignatius riley but he didn't. more's the shame"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It's not that I can add a whole lot with ANOTHER review, I just want to help bring the average rating up to five stars. If any book absolutely deserves Amazon's highest rating, this is it. Anyone who disagrees is probably a Communist!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Excellently and very intelligently written. Hysterical and constantly entertaining. I cannot help but be struck by many similarities to what I believe to be the best written T.V. show of all time....If John Kennedy Toole was alive today, I have to wonder if he would be writing for the Simpsons.After having read numerous reviews at this site, I am also aware of what I feel to be an inaccuracy which I would like to point out to potential future readers. Does anyone else notice that while the positive to negative reviews of this book seem to something like 5 or 10 to 1, the percentage of people that found the positive reviews helpful seems in comparison to be dramatically lower...obviously I am not drawing a logically deductive conclusion here, but it seems to me that those few who did not like the book vindictively went through and polluted the good reviews by finding them not helpful. While certainly this is their right, I think it helpful to note this, and suggest that the book is even better than many of these reviews and percentages of reviews found helpful would suggest. It seems like a very basic fact that not everyone will like the same books, but at the same, tearing down the work of others is immensely easier than establishing a creative work of one's own. This is a fantastic book; creative, intelligent, captivating, and certainly well worth the read. Don't let a few vindictive individuals who cannot appreciate the true depth of this novel keep you from reading it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I had tried once to get through the first chapter of A Confederacy of Dunces before putting the book down in utter frustration. I stuck it out and read the whole thing this time, but still didn't care for the book. It seems the majority of the readers love this novel, but I really couldn't wait to be done with it. Virtually every character is unlikable and obnoxious to the umpteenth degree. The sheer obnoxiousness of this novel is difficult to bare. The author tries to make Ignatius as some sort of Don Quixote of 1960 New Orleans or antihero spouting his philosophies on Big Chief tablets, but it just doesn't work and comes across as rather sad and trite.One issue was simply that these weren't characters; they were cartoons. People commend the book for its dialogue, which they say is \\"real\\", but it felt more like a sitcom to me. And, much like an episode of Seinfeld, the dialogue and situations went in circles in A Confederacy of Dunces with little substance. Virtually every character behaves on the level of a maniac. Many of the other characters, seemingly caricatures, continually repeated the same cycle of badgering and belittling each other in the various episodes (Jones and the bar owner, Mr. and Mrs. Levy, Mancuso and the sergeant, Ignatius and his mother, etc).Yeah, I get it: it's a farce, comedy, satire, etc. Still, the ridiculousness of the subplots and the level of humor just made this novel feel cheap. The whining, yelling and general chaos was more of a chore to get through than entertainment. Sure, A Confederacy of Dunces might be mildly entertaining at points (I thought some of Ignatius' intelligent journal entries were humorous), but most of the humor is sophomoric. I vacillated between despising Ignatius and feeling genuine pity and sorrow at his pathetic, deranged existence.In final, this is a novel that really irritates more than entertains, which is a pity, because I had high hopes."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Be warned you will not like this book if you need your \\"heroes\\" to be respectable, dignified or even worthy of admiration in any way. That's not the the point here: Reilly is a fat incompetent, and arrogant about it. So making him the heroic protagonist is rich in...pathos. If you can sympathise with the little man-at-sea, tossed and turned by fate, it's a joy."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"What a book, what a masterpiece! A comedy, the likes of which I've never read, with characters so unbelievable real I had to occasional take breaks from reading it.The prose surprised me again and again with such beauty, wit and genius. From the first page, I was held in thrall to Toole's talent: \\"Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs.\\"The everyday mundane, sometimes disgusting, bits of the lives of these people combined with Toole's writing is just incredible. It makes for such an unforgettable experience.Toole has his some of characters talk his local dialect, which in many books, is so confusing, so difficult to read or to decipher. He makes it work. No, not work, he makes it seamless, perfect, brilliant. I'm not reading their words--I can hear them talking. It's beautiful.The story centers around Ignatius J. Reilly, as does everything if he can make it, an overweight, over-educated, overly demanding man living with his Mamma, holed up in his bedroom, drinking Dr. Nut and scribbling about Medieval history and the problems of today. This has gone on for many years, and would continue for many more except for a family emergency which pushes his Mamma to take the unusual step of standing up to Ignatius and telling him he must get a job. His world is shaken, he is spiraling out of control, Fortuna has spun against him.And thus, with much GI troubles and vitriolic ranting and railing against peoples in general and particular, Ignatius goes out into the world for the second time since college. The omnipotent reader is privy to both the actual facts and often, Ignatius's more flattering description of events as he writes about it later, with the view of future publication, in a Big Chief tablet in his room.There were times I didn't laugh, though, but that was when I saw myself in this gargantuan idealistic slob, this over-educated moron trying to impose his world views on all around him. That's when, instead of laughing, I gave an inwardly embarrassed chuckle and moved on quickly.There's an underlying element of sadness to the novel, to me anyway. Is it knowing this is Toole's only novel and there'll be nothing else to read? Is it knowing that he committed suicide, and feeling that sadness seep into the pages? Or is it simply knowing that Ignatius is destined to bumble every attempt at every thing merely because Fortuna has it out for his overwhelming conceit? I think it's a mix of all three, and this melancholy tempers the outright hilarity, balancing it, making it even more thought-provoking.Other residents of New Orleans find their paths crossed with Ignatius, usually to their dismay, and always find their lives changed in some way as a result. The vagrant, the man afraid of the \\"comuniss\\", the girl wanting to be an exotic dancer, and many more. . . One reads about them again and again and wonders, how will they all come together? Trust Toole, he's a genius--the plot themes and characters come together like orchestral themes resulting in a crescendoing finale of stunning proportions, and then stream off again, a solo here, a duet there, until the final page. I was genuinely worried at some points, as to how the book would end, how Toole would leave Ignatius. Never fear, dear reader, as Ignatius himself might have said. It's a masterpiece through and through."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is marvelously amoral and it will do little to raise anyone's social conscience. Ignatius is a ridiculous name for a protagonist and the author makes him so disgusting that the reader doesn't know what to make of the guy or his story. As a piece of literature it is brilliant, oddly beautiful, funny as hell, and impossible to place in any known genre. I recommended this book to my 22 year old son and he practically has it memorized. We now call each other up and talk about our pyloric valves. When I was his age I didn't really get this book. I love it now."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is a truly wonderful book made all the more poignant by Hurricane Katrina and Ken Toole's untimely death. A wonderful collection of characters bouncing off one another in a comedic form of Brownian motion."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"If a more repulsive protagonist than Ignatius J. Reilly can be found anywhere in literature, I've yet to encounter him. Conjure up an image of an older, more twisted Holden Caulfield, unemployed and living with his mother after depleting all of her income on bankrolling his over-education, bloated to gargantuan proportions from inactivity and the consumption of enormous quantities of weenies, and you begin to get the picture. Whether or not your particular tastes will rate this as one of the funniest books ever written, as claimed by some reviewers, it is certainly one of the most creative and disturbing. When I wasn't laughing at Ignatius's outrageous antics, I was overwhelmed by the sheer force of his self-destructive behavior. Surrounded by a cadre of pathetic characters whom society would regard as more-or-less \\"normal,\\" I pulled hard for the undeniably-brilliant Ignatius to expose them as the \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\" promised by the title and reveal his true genius to the world. But time after time, he ended up disappointing me with his serial-lying and delusional views. While the ending tantalized me with the hope that Ignatius had reformed his ways, I closed the book with the sinking feeling that his downward spiral was bound to continue, a feeling reinforced by my awareness of the author's own suicide at age thirty-two.-Kevin Joseph, author of \\"The Champion Maker\\""},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I've read plenty of books in my life, but I have never read one for a second time, usually preferring to move on to the next. Confederacy of Dunces I may just decide to pick up again.Ignatius is one of a kind and certainly had his moments, but am I alone in thinking the funniest parts were those featuring Mr. Levy and his crazy wife? To those who say that there are no likeable characters in the entire book, I have to say that I liked Mr. Levy, Jones, Darlene and Mancuso a lot.Just a great and unique book that will sadly make you wonder what else the author had in him. (He killed himself in 1969 in his early 30s)."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius is a beastly, repulsive, pompous character who, regardless of how disgusting and annoying, we become irresistably interested in. His character is completely absurd- an almost monstruous exaggeration of a real person- and yet believable at the same time. The reader becomes so familiar with his hilarious eccentricities, with his so-called world view that we begin to see him as a real part of our lives. While we can come to expect his gastro-intestinal problems, his devotion to the rules of theology and geometry, his demand for taste and decency, we are also constantly surprised and appalled by his unimaginable originality and wacky behavior. Knowing Ignatius so intimately, we are irritated by him, we sympathize with him, we detest him, we are attracted to him. He is completely out of place amongst the illiterate New Orleans neighborhood he lives in, but somehow makes it seem as though it is the rest of society that is out of place-- not him. And this absurdity is what makes the novel so comical. Just imagining a character like Ignatius would be amusing, but Toole's ability to convince the reader of such a nutty character makes the book hilarious."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Like a cross between Jackson McCrae's THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD and the best Vonnegut book, A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES takes the prize as far as great, funny, and well-written southern literature goes.

Food for thought, if nothing more.Anyway, my rating remains as stands, abiding and true.And to Ignatius, the green cap mother; your 'blue and yellow eyes', your 'worldview', your 'theology and perhaps geometry', your 'value judgments', your 'Dr. Nut', 'Fortuna' and her fateful 'spinnings', your constant and incessantly frivolous 'procurement' of 'something to eat', your 'taste and decency', and your fear of 'perversion' and the 'blighted bourgeois' (relative to your Medieval (Boethius induced) philosophy) will live on in my heart, in perpetuity.

Try the book on audio, as well. Very well done."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces, written by John Kennedy Toole, is a novel that sheds light on those normally unseen in a novel. In other words, the main characters in this novel would normally take a backseat to personalities that are easier to relate to, in other books. Ignatius Reilly, the main focus of the novel, is an overweight, middle-aged, lethargic man, whose experiences land him in many different and absurd situations.Other characters, such as Ignatius' mother, are also, if not more, eccentric than Ignatius. Irene Reilly has been living with her son his whole life and cannot seem to get him to shape up to be an upstanding citizen that makes contributions to society instead of lying in bed writing absolute nonsense on tablets of paper. She seldom leaves the house, due to Iganatius' constant need for care, and therefore has no social life until she meets detective Mancuso. Having recently run into Mancuso, due to a scene made by her son, he eventually befriends her and Mrs. Reilly slowly gains the courage to leave Ignatius at home at night and on weekends. Their friendship introduces Mancuso's Aunt who tries to get Mrs. Reilly to commit Ignatius to an asylum. This to Mrs. Reilly is a horrible thought.This novel has an interesting idea behind it, that the main characters are the most unlikely personalities in a novel to be the main focus. However the book's chapters seem to drag on and, at times, ramble without any significance without relating to anything in the chapter. The main character is the most annoying personality someone can read about, and the book had no real plot and jump from one subject to another. If you enjoy reading senseless plots and irritating characters this book is for you; if not than this book is not recommended to you."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is fantastically funny.

Turning to the forward I was even more enthused when I read about how this book was published post-humously and won the Pulitzer. I was pretty disappointed with the results. The story is just dull and long-winded stuffed with characters that are outright unlikable. Ignatius is somebody whom you completely despise and by the time you creep to the last pages, hopes will suffer a terrible fate. Even reading the blurbs on the back cover you read much about \\"laugh out loud\\" statements. Never happened. A single page from \\"Catch 22\\" elicited more genuine laughs than this entire story. I don't know if I ever loathed a main character more. He's a fat, lazy and unhygienic slob that seems to sidestep trouble with equal parts intelligence and the unrealistic gullibility of his adversaries.

Being from New Orleans, I know the city as a bunch of little cities which make up the greater metropolis, and each of the smaller parts is on a quest to present its part as the only right part.

I wish that John Kennedy Toole were still here to look at our current views and routines and develop new characters to represent each of us; I wish he could still offer us each 12 inches of paradise just as he did in the Quarter while lazily pushing his rolling hot dog cart through the New Orleans humidity.

I was very eager to enjoy it, but quickly became disappointed. To me, the book lacks the humor that so many here are ascribing to it. The main character (Ignatius) is something akin to the fat comic book guy on the Simpsons, but without any of the wit or funny sarcasm. He is socially awkward and tacky. Moreover, the whole book is written in that style. Most of the characters are inept, and the situations that arise are silly, but really not funny. An important aspect of good storytelling is developing characters that the reader can relate to on some level, or at least care about. I certainly didn't find that in this book. The only positive aspect is that it's an easy read (in spite of the phonetic spelling which gets slightly annoying), so you won't end up wasting a great deal of time reading it. As far as attributing the title of 'Literary Classic' to this, as I've seen in a few reviews, - you may agree if comic books are your favorite literary genre, and you think of the Three Stooges as the greatest cinematographic masterpiece."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The protagonist is weird, he belches a lot, he loses his job.

If you believe all fictional characters should only reflect your highest moral ideals, then this book is not for you (nor, perhaps, any other work of fiction).As for the rest of you lucky readers--you'll swoon by page two."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I AM CURRENTLY FINISHING UP MY FOURTH READING OF CONFEDERACY.

AWESOME.IF YOU HAVE NOT READ IT, YOU MUST."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"As a veteran bookworm, who cannot be easily dazzled by books any longer, I experienced my greatest literary shock ever reading this amazing book. Maybe it is indescribable but I will try to do it. I think Ignatius is one of the most grotesque characters of world literature. His queer logic, the originality of people around him and the maddening course of events transfixed me for eight hours successively. One hour of that reading took place in a waiting room and I laughed so much that they had to force me out. Some of them called me &quot;a special kind of mad&quot; loudly. The overlapping events and the intelligently woven web of plots and subplots make one think this is the product of a great genius. Beneath the grotesque face of the novel lies a great tragedy. A tragedy that is no less striking than the comedy. And the dexterity of Toole in creating that second dimension is the proof of his unique place among all writers.Reading this book is a special experience that urges you to share it with another one. I gave the first copy to my friends and it soon became a source of in-jokes, endless conversations and the formation of a sect-like circle of friends whose only mission is to proselytize the views of Ignatius.I wish I could read this book in English but alas I had to read its Turkish translation (itself a masterpiece). I terribly envy people whose native tongue is English and have the chance to understand the linguistic nuances fully. After all, even a good translation is not capable of giving the whole taste of the original text.The only sad thing is the heart-rending suicide of a literary genius dying an unjustly premature death. If only he could see that many people around the world adored his opus magnum."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I'm re-reading this novel for the second time. A Confederacy of Dunces reeks with irony, not in the least because the author, John Kennedy Toole, took his own life in part because of his inability to get the book published. The irony was that his mother persevered in showing his manuscript and the book was published and won a Pulitzer Prize. The book really is extremely funny. Toole had a fabulous ear for dialogue; he perfectly captures the way people in New Orleans spoke in the early 1960s. At that time most of the people of Lousiana had a language that was unique. Here's an excellent argument against suicide-you honestly never know. Toole's suicide silenced his voice and denied us whatever other novels he might have produced. I'm grateful that we've got this one, but it's hard not to feel cheated. Anyway, anyone who's never read this book should grab it; it is a genuine classic. People will be reading this novel for a long time."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"What a slog it is trying to get through this book. I'm nearly there (I've read 3 or 4 other books since starting this)... the reason for my stubbornness in finishing it is that it came so highly recommended by friends, and the mostly rave reviews it's got here. Ignatius Reilly, the main character is interesting enough (that's why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star) but that has a lot to do with the fact that the rest of the cast and plot is so boring, I find myself flicking on the pages to see how far I have to go before the story gets back to Ignatius again. I keep thinking \\"OK, the side splitting stuff must be coming up soon\\"...there are humourous passages here and there but nothing to merit the accolades it has received here nor winning the Pulitzer Prize. I'm at a loss to explain its popularity."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This may be the funniest novel ever written. I cannot understand how people do not see the humor in this great book. The characters are marvelously absurd; the setting in New Orleans is perfect; and the writing is superb -- every word seems to be in the right place. It is such a tragedy to realize that the author did not live to see the success of this comic masterpiece."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"John Kennedy Toole suffered and died from Bipolar disorder which is also called Manic Depressive Illness. His main character, Ignatius Reilly is the personification of the disorder of which the author suffers. Ignatius exhibits, in all his hilarity almost all of the symptoms of this dreaded disorder and the author even gives several cries for help through the Ignatius character. Ignatius exhibits constant agitation, fitful sleep, religious psychosis, punning and rhyhming, a constant pressure to keep on talking, severe grandiosity, critisim of others, a ridiculously dated worldview based on his grandiose ideas of how to turn the world in to a place of &quot;taste and decency&quot; through theology and geometry. Ignatius also, in his journals exhibits a type of writing through &quot;clang association&quot; that only people that suffer from mania can accomplish. The book is undoubtedly written so floridly,(another symptom of mania) that I will boldly state that if Toole was not manic, he could have not possibly written such a touching masterpiece. Ignatius, cries for help, I think in the author's behalf. The words manic and depressed are used several times throughout the book. Ignatius cries,&quot;Is my paranoia getting totally out of hand!&quot; The Psyciatric Ward at Charity Hospital is mentioned several times. The description of Ignatius' dreams where he appears on a New York Subway platform as the re-incarnation of Saint James the Less and declares,&quot;Jesus will come to the fore, skins or not!&quot; certainly describes religious psychosis along with the aforementioned clang association. Toole, during his short life, was an instructor at several Universities and Ignatius was even allowed to teach a course in the book although it ended in disater. There are two version of Toole's end. One is that he committed suicide, a symptom of manic depression. In fact, most suicides are caused by people with untreated Bipolar illness. The other story is that they found him dead, long after the fact, in his car in a desolate backwater down south and that he possibly died of manic exhaustion. As a sufferer of Manic Depression, &quot;Dunces&quot; is my Bible. All of my symtoms, including hypersexuality, are exhibited in Ignatius. Unfortunately Ignatius did not re-unite with his beloved Myrna until the very end and he had to resort, sadly to the mastabatory arts. So such a bittersweet book as a reflection of such a bittersweet illness, in all its florid hilarity cannot be missed. I have read this book a dozen times over the years and still find myself breaking out into horselaughter at some of the things stated by the beloved Ignatius Reilly."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Without a doubt, this is my all time favorite book and at nearly 60 years old I have read many. Ignatius J. Reilly is such a crotchety guy that nurturer that I am, I want to give him a big hug and the unconditional love that might help him enjoy life. On the other hand, I can hardly read fast enough to satisfy my fiendish curiosity for what he will say and do next. This book makes me laugh out loud at Ignatius's tormented \\"worldview\\" but also makes me sad (I am prone to melancholy by nature)realizing there has to be part of Ignatius in the author John Kennedy Toole. As most readers probably know, Mr. Toole committed suicide at age 33 after trying unsuccessfully to have this book published.I am delighted this book received the Pulitzer Prize. My son and his wife are expecting a son in two months. Since my son feels the same way I do about A CoD, my grandson's name will be Milo \\"Ignatius\\". I couldn't be happier...well, maybe Milo Ignatius J. Reilly would be cool!My suggestion to those who have not read this book is get up from the computer right now and head out to your favorite bookstore. Or do as I do and stay seated on your tush and order from Amazon. Regardless of how you acquire it, start on this delightful novel. I can assure you, you will not regret it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I loved this book. I found it charming and funny and clever and well written. I loved this book, but I make room for the possibility that others may not have had as enjoyable an experience as I.A few points: This book will be disappointing to those of you who need to like or identify with the characters in fiction. This book will be disappointing to those of you who need your characters to be explicitly redemptive. That's not the point of this book, and to be honest, that's the reason I find this book so remarkable.The characters in CoD feel very much like the characters I encounter in real life. As far as I can tell, a great many of the people on the planet are only likable or only seem to have any sort of redemptive quality to the people who already love them (for whatever reason). To the objective outside viewer (strangers in real life cases, the reader in the case of this novel) most people appear self-interested, arrogant, delusional, lazy, and the list goes on. The fact that the characters in the book aren't always overtly likable only makes them feel more real. Then too, I think that if you look hard enough you'll discover at least one good quality about all of the characters. And you can also see how some of their not-so-great qualities are rooted in insecurity, fear, frustration, etc. Again, this feels much like real life to me.Now, I won't go so far as to suggest that disliking this book makes you some sort of idiot, but it's probably safe to say that if you tend toward Oprah's Book Club books, you probably won't be into CoD."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Neither comic nor a masterpiece, this book becomes more oppressive with the turn of each page. Reading the sophomoric prose is like being slowly buried under sodden newspaper. Nevertheless, being in the minority here, I truly wonder what I might be missing. I beseech and BEG the admirerers of this book to cite a paragraph, a sentence or a turn of phrase they consider to be masterful and comic, or just comic, or just masterful. I ask that in sincerity because, far from finding anything humorous or well written, let alone masterful, I found myself astonished that anyone could be even mildly amused or impressed, other than by the fact that the author actually had the will power to watch this much paint dry."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I like comedic books, dark comedies, and the like. I picked this book up because it was referred to with one of my top 5 books:A Fraction of the Whole. I found nothing funny in A Confederacy of Dunces, no relevance to Fraction of the Whole, and when I read the part where the moron is masturbating I threw it across the room. This is not even dark humor, it's disgusting, the characters were utterly pathetic creatures, wastes of space and a despicable example of the human condition."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The reviews of this book are overwhelmingly positive, but I found it to be a tedious read and a big waste of time. It could have been great, but alas, it fell short1. Not funny: admittedly, the occasional pompous diatribe against the world by Ignatius coaxed a smirk or two. The rest is sophomoric stereotyping and scatological humor (and it is not even good - \\"Family Guy\\" fart jokes are much better).2. Not a captivating story: the characters are one-dimensional, the plot is chaotic and the situations are so fundamentally repetitive, it could bore you to death. The secondary storylines just fizzle out unresolved after awkwardly converging where the \\"climax\\" of the book supposedly is. The real turning point of the story is in the last 5 pages - and happens a little deus ex machina, because 300 pages are not enough to develop the story organically. The book needed some serious editing, which apparently did not take place since the author committed suicide before it even went to a publisher.3. Not visionary - A one-sided message is delivered by one-dimensional characters. Maybe I just don't get the message, but you will probably be more enlightened by, e.g. Nietzsche, Sartre or for that matter - \\"Fight Club.\\" Better entertainment, too..."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"As your begin to read a book you almost envision what you read. In A Confederacy of DUNCES, by Toole, it is hard to keep envisioning. The characters bounce about as obliterated fools do as they live their lives in the poor area of New Orleans. Your eyes begin to close dreamily as his first character, Ignatius, gets a job as a hotdog vendor, only to shoot back open for a moment as he and his mother fight once this is over they dreamily close once more. Now Toole's characters do have potential to be something more but they don't. For instance: Ignatius is a 30 year old obese man who lives with his mother while they both live off of his dead father's saved meager income. Ignatius is a smart man, or at least he has been to college, he could have had a job years and years ago yet he has never once had a single job. This 30-year-old man has been writing a book for 3 years. This 30 year old man acts like a 3 year old child, when he was asked to get a job to be able to pay for a drunken mistake he almost throws a hissy fit. The mistake was purely to blame for the two alcoholics driving, Ignatius and his mother Mrs. Riley. They had both gone out and got themselves trashed then preceded to drive home. They crashed into a building and that's how the story really began. Now everyone, it seems like, that the author mentions in the book he begins a little tangent about him or her that continues through out the entire book. They all sort of click in the end and even sometimes you see the connection in the middle of the book. For instance: Patrolman Mancuso is the officer who found Mrs. Riley and Ignatius's car in shambles combined with a lovely hole in a wall. He also asks Mrs. Riley out on a date involving bowling. We then meet his sister, Santa, who Mrs. Riley really quite enjoys. Or even before that when Mrs. Riley and Ignatius went to drink they met at the bar Lana Lee, the owner of the bar and Darlene her employee. Lana Lee then hires a black man trying to stay out of the police's way, Jones.I mean it seems like the list could go on forever, and that's why I don't enjoy the book, it goes on and on and on. It has no point at all, this may be because Toole killed himself before finishing, and definitely does not stand out in my mind as being a book of merit. A novel of merit is a book that has deep meaning to you and will stay with you always. I have trouble remembering what I had just read in A Confederacy of DUNCES! The book showed me no deep and powerful meaning, however I believe it might be a different story if I were to read it in 20 years or so. I think that the book has too much to do with debt, families, and the lives of middle age persons that it is virtually impossible for us youngin's to truly enjoy it or even understand it.So on that note I would suggest this book to only those who have a knack for reading and the persistence of a buffalo on steroids, or to those above the age of 35. This book couldn't grab me even if I was covered in glue. Hearing from others in my class and of my age group I have also found that they don't enjoy it either. There is one advantage to this horrifyingly boring book and that is that it is short, 394 pages!!!! This is why we read it. And well I don't believe it was worth it. I give it a half a star."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It seems like you either love this book or hate it. I guess I'm just not getting what is so great about it.

I tried, but it just wasn't for me."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"For many years, I have heard what a hilarious book this was. I consider myself to be a jovial person in every way, but this book put me to sleep. I could have easily closed it after 20 pages or so, but I slogged on because I was determined to find out what was so funny. The answer was: NOTHING. They keep talking about making a movie out of it...I think the financing has fallen short because it's not a comedy, it's not a drama....it's a sedative."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Many people have experiences in life where they find themselves in a situation where their opinion does not follow what a larger group may think. In the book A Confederacy of Dunces, by John Kennedy O'Toole, the main character Ignatius finds himself in this situation through out the whole story. The book does a great job displaying a situation where the reader can relate to certain sitations that the main character is in. At the same time, the author does a great job creating a character that evokes powerful emotions from the reader.The book is about a man, Ignatius, who finds himself to be living in a world where he is surrounded by people who are ignorant about what really matters in the world. His subliminal goal is to help people realize this and set them in a direction where they can continue living their life in a way that is more real and fulfilling. Ignatius seems also to be caught between his mother and her dimentia of thinking that the world, including her son, are against her. Ignatius ends up being forced through different jobs and he burns a scandalous past through every place that he becomes apart of. In the end, Ignatius loses his last job as hot dog vendor, sparks a 500 thousand dollar law suit, retires a woman who has wanted to have been retired for years, but someone was convinced that she wanted to work where she was, is sent to a mental hospital by his confused and mentally blocked mother, and elopes with his ex girlfriend who he keeps in touch with through mail through out the story.The book does a great job displaying the theme of ignorance through a variety of characters who the reader can watch lie and cheat their way into the hopeful dream of achieving the American Dream of being happy and making money easily. Although the book is written in a way that can be tiring and sluggish at times, once the reader completes the book, looking back on it leaves one with a feeling of accomplishment and a new knowledge and view on life and the people in it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Three quarters into the book I wished I hadn't spent the time reading it. It was fatiguing to read the same arguement over and over, nothing new develops about the characters, nothing made me want to finish. I skimmed the last one quarter. Maybe East Coast intellectuals can laugh at the antics of those silly southerners but here in the Northwest I prefer my humor more dry."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have read this book no less than 7 times. I have seen the play and I anxiously await the making of the movie. I have been a big fan of books-on-tape for a long time. However, Dove Audio needs to get out of the business. Whoever wrote or edited this audio book for Dove should stay with Dove because I no longer purchase their publications - I avoid them like the plague. Reader is very important. It is hard to match F. Murray Abraham, Tony Roberts or Judith Ivey as quality readers, which is clearly demonstrated by Dove who employs the likes of Arte Johnson and Roddy McDowall (Batman). Dove may as well retain Danny Sugerman (No One Here Gets Out Alive) or Stephen King (several bad readings) as readers. All in All, A Confederacy of Dunces on tape was a HUGE disappointment. I had to go back and re-read the book to ease my suffering after listening to this Dove Audio product. HMB"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces. John Kennedy Toole. New York: Grove Press, 1980. 394 pg.Many high school students detest reading novels. Students have come to hate reading because of dry, slow, or overly difficult novels chosen by their teachers. A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole is a perfect example of this type of novel. The story is about Ignatius, an obese man in his thirties that still lives with his mother and always stumbles into unusual situations. The slow plot and the ineffectiveness of the novel to captivate the reader only further restrain the reader's ability to enjoy the novel. Because of this disability, readers will find it difficult to empathize with Ignatius. A Confederacy of Dunces was long, drawn out, difficult to read and utterly pointless.The author's style is very unique. John Toole uses precise words for describing not only character's emotions, but also everything else, \\"A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once,\\" (1). In this, the very first sentence of the story, the reader understands what an fatiguing read this novel will be. Because of the extensive descriptions the book seems ten times longer than it is. In Ignatius' diary, Toole uses language that is difficult to follow and focus on because of the complicated phrases and his long descriptions. For example, \\"We must hasten back on the wings of prose to the factory and its folk, who prompted my rather lengthy digression...and subsequent pratfall the sources of a great feeling of camaraderie.\\"(123). The slow moving plot is another reason as to why the book is laborious to read. It is hard to concentrate and keep focus when there is so little action in the story and so much repetition.This constant repetition becomes annoying and tedious to read. The entire story is surrounded by Ignatius' entries continuously repeating what has already been said. For instance, the reader finds out from an eye-witness account from Mr. Levy that, \\"\\"What are you people doing down there on the floor?\\"(86). Again the reader gets another account of the situation, when just pages later Mr. Levy states, [...] When I went there this morning everybody was on the floor. Don't ask me what they were doing. It could have been anything,\\" (98). Unsurprisingly, the same instance is brought up again this time in Ignatius's journal, \\" My downfall occurred literally [...] and I plummeted to the floor [...],\\" (122). While Toole tries to allow the reader to see from the different character's point of views, he just makes it more lengthy and dull.The author's style and the weak connection between the characters and reader made John Kennedy Toole's novel, A Confederacy of Dunces, monotonous and unexciting. I would not recommend this book to anyone ... but there are always exceptions to any rule. To people who have a large vocabulary or who have trouble sleeping at night; this is the book for you."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I was interested in reading this book due to the positive comments and information I received about it and the intriguing information I had heard about the author. I had been told that the book was hilarious and that the characters were quirky and indiosyncratic creations reflecting the absurdity of the world itself. I could not wait to open the pages and to begin the journey. Upon cracking open the first pages and entering the world of Ignatius Reilly, I perceived something very different indeed. Ignatius is an intellectual and selfish individual that is as highly sterotyped and stylized as a character of this nature might ever be. The same goes for the other characters of the book. Jones speaks in an expected ignorant southern &quot;black&quot; style of the period. Myrna is a picture perfect rendition of an off-the-wall, political, independent thinking, student, and Dorian and his gang are the ultimate pictures of a stereotyped flaming gay social group. The story starts out a bit slow but picks up as the reader covers the first few chapters. What happens as the story develops, one might ask? It develops into a slapstick and absurd comedy of a total loser and the subplots of those around him. One stupid act or lie leads to another and before you know it, or as you might suspect, Ignatius has created a giant nasty snowball of nothing but trouble. Loose ends begin to tighten as the characters finally collapse, one on top of another, in front of a trolley that has come to a screeching halt. If you are a reader that enjoys the Three Stooges then this is the book for you, no underlying meaning, no symbology, just pure slapstick with a touch of grease and filth. Jones, the ignorant vagrant, is the only character with any redeeming qualities in the entire novel. He thinks. He questions. He has the capabilities to learn and to want more for himself. He is the only virtue to the book. And talk about unsatisfying! Does this sound unsatisfied now? Wait until you reach the end of the story! All of the things you could have accomplished in the time it took you to read this book - mopping the floor, paying bills, picking up that gallon of milk..."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I had to give up after 60 pages, and scanned the rest. There was some interest in the way he writes and his strange, stupid characters. But it gets tedious after awhile - nothing happening, and certainly NO humor. What a waste of time."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I chose this title for my review for two reasons: I believe that the book is highly overrated and not worth the critical praise it has received and because it ties in with the gross mentions of bodily functions that come up repeatedly in the story.Maybe it is only a difference in type of sense of humor, but I did not find this book to be funny at all. Sure it was a relatively easy read as Toole uses simple and flowing language, but the main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, whom many consider to be hilarious, only serves to make me angry. Ignatius is supposed to be a \\"genius\\" but he is the most immature character in any book that I have read in a long time. Ignatius went to college and even earned a Masters Degree, but he still has no steady job, lives with his mother, and gets car sick almost every time he is in a moving vehicle. He is a huge, fat, disgusting baby who goes through life thinking he is better than everyone else, as if he is the Second Coming or something. Ignatius treats his own mother like garbage, demanding things from her and ordering her around when really he is dependent upon her. This is one of the reasons I hated Ignatius, because he doesn't show any respect to anyone, even those who care for him.The parts of the book that are supposedly funny are nothing more than ridiculous exaggerations and gross details. The incredible thing is that I have actually witnessed people laugh at loud at such nonsense as Ignatius falling while an employee of Mr. Levy, and then being such a baby that he thought he was paralyzed when really he was only too fat to stand up. The details such as Ignatius masturbating to the thought of his old dog is not funny; it is sick. I don't know what gave Toole that idea but it is just not right. Many of the situations Ignatius finds himself in are so absurd and unreal that they seem crazy and unbelievable instead of funny as they were obviously intended to be.While the book does read quickly, I found myself bored after only about twenty pages. I actually fell asleep reading this book, not once, but twice. Ignatius is annoying and disgusting, what with his \\"valve\\" problem and everything, and the exact opposite of a true \\"genius.\\" The only character that I remotely liked in the story was Jones, the black man who could never catch a break in life, but always seemed to know his place.The setting for the book, New Orleans, was a good choice for this story which had potential, but just didn't follow through on it. It is too bad that Toole died such an untimely death before he was given a chance to redeem himself. I hated this book, possibly because of a different taste in humor or possibly because I was forced to read it for a class. I did not find it funny at all. I didn't laugh at loud. I didn't even smirk. For those who loved this book, I am very happy for you, that you were able to take a pointless book with no real plot and find enjoyment in it.

Well, I thought that I would be faithful to the author and finish what I started. Mind you it was an uphill battle the entire way.

It reminded me of old high school friends who constantly tried to make faces or hoot out tiresome jokes or recite plays on words that left the rest of us either groaning in disgust or avoiding the person entirely.I have no idea how this won a prestigious award or garnered so many positive reviews. Maybe our tastes have sunk this low that Toole's suicide somehow places him in that rarefied air of the great \\"misunderstood\\" writer who was really trying to communicate complex truth in seemingly ridiculous narrative. No, I think it was a foolish man writing foolishness."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces is one of those books you could read several times in a row and each time it would grow progressively funnier, like a wine grows progressively more flavorful. It is one of those books you could flip through, find a random passage to read, and immediately find yourself laughing. It is a hilarious story, to be certain, but the greatest thing about it isn't necessarily its abundant humor. The greatest thing about it is the genuine literary power it contains. It isn't just about cheap laughs. It's a novel, a profoundly well told story that exposes the extraordinary talent of its author as much as the author's sense of humor.The main character, Ignatius J Reilly, is the spoiled, arrogant, pompous result of bad parenting and too much free time. He fancies himself a scholarly intellectual, capable of more scholastic achievements and philosophical breakthroughs than anyone else in New Orleans, when in reality he is an unemployed, frustrated college dropout whose only real passion is the lute. Some of the book's more hilarious moments are the confrontations between Ignatius and his mother, whom he still lives with at the tender age of 35. His mother, having decided that Ignatius's overwhelming lack of motivation is beyond her control, is discovering life again. She's going out, having fun, meeting people - destroying her worldview, as Ignatius would say. And Ignatius, having decided that the world is utterly incapable of digesting his gargantuan intellect, is flailing in a string of bad jobs and failed attempts at manuscripts. Ignatius and his mother are prone to having massive arguments, so loud that the neighbors will shout through their living room windows at them, that usually end in Ignatius locking himself in his room with his lute and his wounded ego for hours on end.While the story has a host of amusing characters, such as Patrolman Mancuso (determined to bust Ignatius on no grounds other than just general stupidity) and Levy Pants (Ignatius's disgruntled boss), the real enchantment of the story comes from something deeper, something stronger and maybe even tragic. Ignatius cannot find his place in the world and his mother has lost all hope. The city they live in is deteriorating, and even if its troubles are depicted in a comical manner, they are still present. The book may be a comedy, but it has the heart of a tragedy. As we discover at the end of the story, Ignatius is lonelier and even more lost than anyone could realize."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Arguably the best dialogue of any book ever written in the United States. Every single voice is distinct. Try doing that sometime in your own writing. Try differentiating your characters by voice. It's damn near impossible. Word has it that Toole was a mimic with a spot-on ability to imitate dozens of New Orleans characters, and he'd entertain his friends with his impressions into the wee hours of the morning."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"One of the funniest books ever written.The author, unfortunately, committed suicide after failing to sell the book. It was sold by his mother, after his death, and won a Pulitzer. The story behind the book is almost as good as the book itself.In any case, it is a comic masterpiece. It includes some of the most original characters in literature, involved in situations which should (if you posess any sense of humor whatsoever) have you laughing aloud many, many times.I envy you, if you have not read this book yet, but are about to do so. You are about to discover a tremendous joy."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"\\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" is the standard by which all humorous and satirical novels should be measured. John Kennedy Toole's wickedly profane masterpiece refutes the conventional wisdom is that \\"serious\\" literature is never a funny matter.Toole's principal character, the unforgettable Ignatius J. Reilly is an unlikely champion of the dispossessed and downtrodden. Toole's characterization of Ignatius Reilly is the comic equal of Joseph Heller's wise-ass bombardier Yossarian in \\"Catch 22\\", or Phillip Roth's sexually obsessed Alexander Portnoy in \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\". Toole's characters are quirky denizens of the bottom rung of rigid social order in of New Orleans in the mid-1960s. It was an era when that rigid social was imploding from the tidal wave of the civil rights movement.Beneath the Toole's humor lies a darker message about the provincial attitudes of southerners and their deep seated intolerance for those who are different. Toole is exploring the same Southern Gothic territory as author Flannery O' Conner's world, but unlike O' Conner, Toole has absolutely no reverence for the rigid southern customs of civility. Toole's message was that southern society was not only intolerant to its black citizens but to anyone else who refused to fit into southern standards that governed conventional behavior. Toole's prescription is to parody the intolerance of southern behavior as a farce. Like Great Britain's comic troupe, Monty Python, Toole spares no sacred cow in his humor and may offend the sensibilities of those in polite society. Even as he recklessly shoots from the hip when he aims his humor, Toole often creates most memorable comic moments, when he does so.A few years back, I presented \\"Confederacy\\" as my selection for a reading group I participated in. It was a rather staid group of serious readers. At our first meeting to discuss \\"Confederacy\\", nobody could read a passage or discuss events of the book without somebody erupting into gales of teary eyed laughing. The laughter was so highly contagious that soon everyone in the group would be consumed in a chorus of hyena-like laughter. After an hour or so, the fits of laughter took on a curious life of their own. Almost as soon as club members were sufficently calmed from a previous explosion of laughter, someone would blink and ignite yet another convulsive round of laughing. We finally had to adjourn discussion because everyone was too paralyzed with laughter to continue. In the end, the book club members agreed that \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\" had serious literary merit, but those merits could not be discussed because the content of the book was just too damned funny."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces is certainly one of the most unusual novels I have ever read. Unusual from start to finish, the book is full of humor and absurdity. The protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly, can be so infuritating at times, with his round-the-clock selfishness, ridiculous and sabotaging ploys, flagrant disrespect, utter laziness, extreme gluttony, and condescending ways, that I would love to strangle him as I'm sure many others would as well. So what makes this book praiseworthy, since it lacks any real taste and decency, is that, despite the character Reilly's hundreds of flaws, as a reader you can't help but root for him. You root for him in his endeavors, not out of sympathy, for there are very few people in this novel worthy of any sympathy, but because the longer he suffers the funnier it is. His adventures with Paradise Vendors get better and better each day with Ignatius finding new things that reveal life is miserable. His crusade for Moorish dignity is about as wacky as its title, but yet you want to see how far it will go and can't help but be disappointed when Ignatius calls it to a halt after his plant is knocked over.There are several parts of the novel like these where laughing out loud can't be helped but for many other parts the humor is well-disguised in smaller details like the characters' mannerisms and the day-to-day conversations that Reilly doesn't enjoy with the many people he encounters.For those not intrigued by the odd humor, the storyline may string you along for longer than you might want. For a large portion of the novel it is not clear how the many sub-plots will come together and the curiosity to know how they all relate will make you keep turning the pages. Then when they do all finally come together at a rather climatic ending a groan from the reader can be the only response. The ending truly irked me personally, for having been an avid follower of Ignatius's adventures and mishaps I really did want to see him suffer for everything that he put me through."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Seldom does one find a character as grossly unhygienic and obese, yet highly alluring as Ignatius J. Reilly. He wears the same clothes day in and day out, feeds mainly on cake and Dr. Nut, and can hardly keep his job as a hot-dog vendor. Yet, he captivates readers' attentions as a vacuum sucks up dust. I believe the secret to John Kennedy Toole's success in A Confederacy of Dunces lies in his ability to meticulously embody Henri Bergson's comic theory in his characters.According to Bergson, what one finds humorous is often linked with what one finds mechanical, rigid, and inelastic. In Ignatius J. Reilly, Toole naturally encompasses these characteristics. His inability to control his precarious valve, his eccentric, medieval way of thought, and his fear of Greyhound Scenicruisers turn Ignatius into a person unlike any other. In fact, these humorous traits make Ignatius seem less like a person and more like a machine that is incapable of adapting to changing environments. We as readers cannot help but burst out laughing at his foolish ideas (Crusade for Moorish Dignity), his obstinately bothersome body (\\"'Oh!' 'What are you doing? Are you fooling with that valve again? Nobody else got him a valve but you. I ain't got no valve.' 'Everyone has a valve!' Ignatius screamed. 'Mine is simply more developed. I am trying to open a passage which you have succeded in blocking. It may be permanently closed now for all I know.'\\" p. 60), and his foul hygiene (\\"Braah\\" pp. every other).If not for the gloriously entertaining plot, Toole's skillful development of characters should be enough to pick up this book. You'll fall in love with the most disgusting man you've ever met."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I really enjoyed Ignatius as a character in the novel, \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\". He reminded me of another character from one of my favorite literary works, \\"Don Quixote\\". They both wander around in seemingly odd outfits trying to right the wrongs of society. Ignatius seems to live his life as if the world revolves around him. Because of this, I initially disliked his character, as many people do. However, if you are able to get past Ignatius' egotistic personality, you might find him to be quite a hilarious character. His actions and ideas highly absurd, and he can very easily turn a normal situation into a disaster. For example, during Ignatius' first days of work he is asked to do some filing. While attempting to use a stool and tool recommended by another staff member, he falls to the floor and supposedly hurts his back. Now, his back isn't really injured, but he makes it out to seem as if he is dying. From here, the comedy only grows as his complaints and actions become more absurd. Reading this, we would not want to be the one there to deal with Ignatius, but thinking of it happening to someone else gives it a comical effect. As many have said, comedy can only be funny if it is happening to someone else.As for the novel itself, I think readers are generally at one end of the spectrum or the other; you either love it or hate it. I also think that the opinion of the novel is strongly dependent on the reader's view of Ignatius. If all you see is an annoying, repulsive man in a red coat and green hunting cap, then you would probably dislike the book as well. You probably couldn't find humor in Ignatius' actions, and since the story is centered on Ignatius, it would also be hard to find the novel funny. Personally, I enjoyed Ignatius as a character, once I got past my initial reactions to him. I began to see the comedy in his actions and, at time, could really picture some of the unusual scenes as they unfolded. Once I did this, the book became much more enjoyable as well."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Confederacy of Dunces is the hilarious story of that gross abomination Ignatius J Reilly. Immediately his outrageous character will stand out and make a lasting impression on you (you probably have never encountered an Ignatiesque character before, this alone could be a good enough reason to give the book a try). Hopefully you will gag, cackle and chuckle yourself to tears at Ignatius' intellectual ravings while the story waddles on, for it is really a matter of taste in humor that will decide whether you like this book or not. This story is not primarily plot driven; instead humor takes control and leads the turn of events on to a real gaggler of a finish. For some the slight lack of a strong plot will take away interest, but the beauty of the book is in the humor and character depth. Regardless of reviewers taste, all seem to agree it captures the New Orleans feel fully. Toole's style is offbeatly fresh and original. Clear and frank prose make the wry description of characters and their actions/conversations classic. It is such a shame Toole and his only sense of humor left this world underappreciated, for he could have produced more who knows how funny works. This is a unique and exceptional book that anyone with an open mind or love of humor will relish. Hat's off to you Toole."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It took me some time to warm up to \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\", but by the end I definitely appreciated the humor. The protagonist, one Ignatius J. Reilly, is someone I would never, ever want to meet in real life, but from a safe distance he's incredibly funny. That is Toole's greatest strength: the development of interesting and very original characters that defy stereotypes. I don't know if Ignatius is a genius, but I can say without hesitation that he is certainly unique. I can't think of any other character I have encountered that is remotely similar to him, from his...eccentric...personal hygiene habits to his advocation of a return to medieval society. The characters that might be stereotypical, such as Ignatius' drunken mother Mrs. Reilly or the witty black observer Jones, have more development and depth than mere stereotypes.Toole also conveys a regional flavor very well. The characters' dialects, the French quarter and other actual places, and regional characters all contributed to a very strong sense of atmosphere - the book did not seem like it could have taken place anywhere else because of how Toole intwertwined his setting with the story.The other thing that really impressed me was the intricate web connecting each charatcer. As I approached the end of the book and the events and characters became more and more intertwined, I found myself occasionally laughing aloud simply out of surprise at a new twist. (For example, the reappearance of Mr. Robichaux, the old man from the beginning...) I went from being kind of apathetic about what would happen to reading the end faster because I was so curious to see what would happen next and how all the twists and turns would be resolved.In conclusion, I'm not going to recommend this book to everyone, because it isn't for everyone. However, if you have a flexible sense of humor (especially an appreciation of irony) and some patience, you will probably find \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" very funny indeed. Just remember to give it some time, and don't be put off by the crude physical humor."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces, set in New Orleans, is the story of Ignatius J. Reilly and the events that unfold because of his mother's car crash into a building. Ignatius, like Quixote, belongs in a different century than the one his is living in. He is a fat, pugnacious man who enjoys watching television programs and movies only to ridicule them and annoy the people around him. By far, the funniest part of this book stems from the dialogue between Ignatius and everyone else. It took some time for me to get accustomed to Ignatius and his grotesque manner. At one point I was so revolted by Ignatius, I put the book down for a week or so. Soon enough, I picked it up again, in eager anticipation of reading about another of Ignatius' humorous escapades.Toole writes the novel in a clear and lucid manner. With this book, I went on a journey through the streets of New Orleans from many perspectives. From Patrolman Mancuso, the pitiful undercover cop who cannot seem to overcome his run of bad luck to Jones, the street savvy black man working as a floor sweeper in a nightclub to Mr. Levy, the owner of a floundering pants factory, to Mrs. Reilly, the badgered mother of the irritating Ignatius, and Ignatius himself.I enjoyed this book, and although it got somewhat repetitive at times, Ignatius' comedic mannerisms and ridiculous appearance drew me into the story. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys ridiculous, verbal, and situational humor."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"One of the funniest and most creative books I've ever read.

I was wandering through the market in the French Quarter when I came across a tiny book stall. Drawn to Confederacy, I picked it up. An old man came up to me and said &quot;You have to read that book. Then, come back and tell me what you thought of it.&quot; I told him I was leaving the next day and that it wasn't likely but he said &quot;Just come back and talk to me about it. I'll still be here.&quot; I was intrigued and I needed a souvenier for my boyfriend, so I bought the book. Well, I brought it home and my boyfriend nearly died. Apparently, he read the book a few years earlier, loved it so much that he bought it for ten of his friends for Christmas. He had always tried to find a nice hardcover version but was never successful. What are the chances? The book itself is unique and a great read. What an adventure! What an unusual character!

The reason I only gave four stars is, well, because the character Ignatius is sometimes annoying by his theories or the things that he thinks and says and he grosses me out at times with the amount of food he eats.

I couldn't resist reading some of the 1-star reviews (which are often somewhat comical in themselves), and am now of the opinion that those reviewers were simply so ashamed at their inability to appreciate the book, their freshly discovered feelings of self-loathing so great and all-encompassing, that it simply enraged them. Able to neither articulate these feelings, nor locate their true origin, they lashed out at the nearest inanimate object, as is perhaps their tribal custom.So be it. Their great loss.To those readers possessed of an elevated sense of humor, and an appreciation for literary genius: read this book. Purchase a few copies, actually, because when you lend it to friends -- which invariably happens -- you'll find that you never get it back."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This novel is like a hairless cat -- cute and revolting. Undeniably, Ignatius J. Reilly is one of the most monstrously original characters in all of fiction, taking a back seat not even to the great worthies drawn by Dickens. He is all the more compelling because he is contemporary--and growing more contemporary all the time. All he needs is a cell phone and a computer and he threatens to become a generational representative of the 21st Century. He is surrounded by an almost equally zany and memorable cast, though the story itself is scarcely worth the price of the Big Chief tablet it was probably written on. The book defies categorization in the same way that junk food fails to fit into a food group. It is not \\"literature\\" in the sense that it deals with significant themes worth thinking about. Nor is it a good story, well told. But neither is it wholly worthless tripe. Perhaps the passage of a hundred years will transform Ignatius J. Reilly into a character of Ahab-like stature along with Moby-like dimensions. For now, it's just an ugly, amusing, disgusting, memorable, absurd farce that both appeals and repels in equal parts, like a comfortable, yellowed bedsheet that hasn't been washed in six months."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"**Please note**: I am not reviewing the actual book (plot, style, character, etc.) \\"A Confederacy of Dunces,\\" but rather the formatting quality specific to the Kindle edition. (This is a classic story, and my thoughts on it would not add to the many salient, accurate reviews of its greatness that exist here and elsewhere.)Put simply, the formatting is very strange. The font is not the usual Kindle font -- it is much larger, and quite faded/faint. As you may know, in the printed versions of the book, there are sections where the font is smaller. On the Kindle, this is fine in full, bright light, but when reading in not so bright light (light that would otherwise be fine for properly formatted books), this will lead to some eye strain and possibly some instances where you may struggle to process the smaller typeface. These sections of smaller typeface make setting the book to a smaller font on your Kindle inadvisable.There are also very strange carriage returns that do not coordinate with the printed version, resulting in very large spaces between most paragraphs and even some sentences. You may find screens that contain only a couple of 2 or 3 sentence paragraphs. If you are a fast reader, and you are reading on the default (larger in this case) font, this will result in page turn clicks every few seconds, which grow rather annoying over the course of reading the book (especially if you are sitting/lying near someone that is already driven crazy by normal Kindle clicking!).All in all, though, these issues shouldn't stop you from purchasing the Kindle edition (@ $7.99, it's a bargain relative to some other books). Just know that you will be clicking more than normal, and, if you often read in lower light settings, you may have some intermittent problems.A Confederacy of Dunces"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A book about nothing, a few weeks in the life of Ignatius Reilly, an unforgettable \\"hero\\" (but does someone who has so many defaults wrapped around a core of goodwill - or was it the opposite - deserve that name ?) revolted about pretty much anything that surrounds him : contemporary pop culture, fashion, work and work organization, and so on, nothing pleases him in out outside world, and he joyfully excels at making himself useless in it. Following Ignatius' \\"adventures\\" (once again a strange word since, due to his lifestyle, going to the supermarket is in itself an odyssey) is like following a 200kgs genius child of Hunter S. Thompson (a soft core version though) in an adult's body leaving behind him a mixed trail of comedy and drama. The book is famous for being one of the best novels about the New Orleans language and culture (or at least what it was back in the 60s-70s) and the influence the French/Meditteranean lifestyle had on that part of the USA, something which might be obvious and add to the book's exotism but didn't strike me, maybe because I'm so close to the french culture it was hard to find it \\"out of the ordinary\\"...(feedback/analysis on that point are more than welcome)A weird hero for our weird world."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"To set the stage for my review, imagine a burned out high school senior, entering his first year of college.

At the end of my first term, my roommate suggested that I read this, saying that it was the best book he had ever read. Now, up to this point, my approach on reading had been completely shattered. I would read all the little details, losing sight of the beauty of the novel-after all, there had to be a test at the end, right?

Toole was a literary genius and this comical farce is a testament to his brilliance. The central character is Ignatius Reilly, who is a unique literary creation. You can look high and low through all of literature and you won't find another character like Ignatius: he is a singularity. Toole brings most of the major characters into the story in the first 20 pages. And the dialogues are so good that you always know what character is speaking. The story takes place in New Orleans and Toole captures the subtleties of dialect within the city.And it is a great city to host this zany adventure. Ignatius is a disciple of the great Late Antiquity philosopher, Boethius, except that Ignatius lives in the 20th century! in New Orleans! The Wheel of Fortune, a concept important to Boethius, spins and Ignatius finds himself harassed by the police, working for a sinking pants-maker, and selling hot dogs on the streets of New Orleans. But it isn't just characters (Burma Jones is a creation of genius) and good dialogue that make this book work. Toole laces the tale with short, seductive descriptions of people and places. A classic (in my mind) is when he describes Lana, the owner of The Night of Joy bar, fondling money she's received for selling pornographic pictures. Toole describes her as a priestess holding the host (here a coin) and raising it heavenward as smoke from her cigarette (this takes place on a bar counter) curls up like incense in a medieval rite.One important subplot is the love story - if you can call it that - of Ignatius and a radical girlfriend, Myrna. Ignatius's actions are in large part motivated by his desire to impress Myna. But beware, this is unlike any love story you'll find anywhere else. Don't wait 25 years to plunge into this grand farce like I did. Experience a classic and get ready to chuckle."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"COD is a marvelous treat.

I have a little bit more faith in the taste and decency of movie makers since Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy became something that was the opposite of crappiness. Nevertheless, I'm nervous because A Confederacy of Dunces is something, like The Beatles and my Momma, that you DO NOT mess with.This book is ridiculously good on so many levels. Take, for instance, the main character:Ignatius J Reilly is a colossus, a hypochondriac misfit Everyman put upon by a boozy simpleton of a mother and a cast of goofs incapable of understanding his worldview. Not to mention, he's funny as all get out and simultaneously absurd and real. Toole writes this guy so well that you could imagine him waddling into your bedroom, with a storm of stench laced with the scent of stale tea bags trailing behind him.He's a momma's boy in a low-rent New Orleans neighborhood, a homebody who passes harsh judgment rooted in Medieval authoritarianism on crappy pop culture, modern politics and the dupes who surround him. He is plagued by panic attacks, hypochondria, indigestion and the memory of his long-dead dog, whom he remembers more fondly than his late father.Tragic, right? Yes, but somehow John Kennedy Toole was able to turn this sad sack into a hilarious buffoon of a blowhard.If he were real and living in the 2000s, Ignatius would be like one of those nerdy blogger guys who sit at home, fashioning themselves as a know-it-all talk show host, spewing venom and judgment on a world that doesn't hear them.Ignatius is like a lot of dudes you know. He sits around talking about all the big stuff he's doing: Writing a &quot;manifesto&quot; that he thinks could be made into a movie one day, trying to start a political movement, becoming a voice for the great unwashed. But for all his passion, his short attention span and his half-baked attempts to put his big plans into action causes him to constantly defeat himself.AND THAT's JUST ONE CHARACTER!Toole, who was a white dude, does justice to the book's only black protagonist, Burma Jones. Somehow, this uneducated janitor/vagrant comes across as smart and insightful without being a dupe, a clod or what Spike Lee calls &quot;The Super Dooper Magical Negro,&quot; the prototypical Hollywood and literary Black character in White stories who saves all the White people with mystical Voodoo insights or all-out magical powers (see most Coen Brothers' movies or Steven King books for examples of this phenomenon).As far as the movie version of A Confederacy of Dunces goes: The rumor is that Philip Seymour Hoffman or Jack Black would play Ignatius. Both would be perfect, but to be believable even these chubbies would need to gain like 75 pounds to do Toole's king fatty justice. Also, Steven Soderbergh is behind the project. He's like the Midas of Hollywood, so as long as he's doing it, it could be done right."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"No need to recap plot as there are over 500 other reviews here for that. I just wanted to throw in my two cents.\\"Dunces\\" is a wild ride through the wacky New Orleans of the early 1960s. The dialogue of certain characters (Jones, Irene, Santa) approaches Twain in its ability to recreate Southern dialect. It's odd though that Ignatius several times disparages Twain as a writer, I wonder what's behind this criticism? Ignatius is a wonderful character, a true misanthropist that others with even a hint of misanthropy in their hearts will take to. I even found myself feeling sorry for the big dope in his isolation from society. The depiction of blacks and gays is so un-PC that it's refreshingly hilarious to read in today's times.However, the ending was a little disappointing in the way that all of the storylines were wrapped up with a happy outcome.

The way Kennedy has written it makes each scene of the book almost picturesque -- I have a REALLY good idea what all of the characters look like...This is one book that is required reading for all of my friends."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This might be the most satisfying read I've ever had. Funny and sad and vivid, and with a perfect ending. Read this book now!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The satirical genius of John Kennedy Toole will be sorely missed. A Confederacy of Dunces is sometimes hilarious, sometimes sad - but seldom boring (the exceptions being the over-long excerpts from Ignatius Reilly's diary). The contrast between the twisted mind of Ignatius (who is wonderfully characterized) and the secondary characters provides an interest in the main character that might otherwise be watered down. And yet the secondary characters are also real and provide a lively backdrop for Toole's book.There are also some serious underlying messages in 'Confederacy'. Exposing the perceived flaws of 20th century living being paramount, along with the author's political wisdomsThe second half of the story slows down a bit after a pacey first half. Nonetheless, 'A Confederacy of Dunces' is one I shall take to my desert island with me, because it's a book which can be read time and again, just to enjoy the characters."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Short and sweet, this book is one of my favorites . If the Pulitzer Prize never leads me to another book I love, I'm still in it's debt.Read it!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is one of my Top Five books of all time. I first read this book in High School and have been giving it as gifts and harrassing people to read it ever since. It is such a fresh story, so different from anything I've ever read. It is entertaining, and tells several different stories which all tie in together at the end like some sort of miracle. It is one of those books that each time you read it there is something new you missed. It is hilarious, but also sad, because the book is haunted with the memory of John Kennedy O'Toole, who took his life while still very young."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have read this book three times now and let me tell you, everytime I read it I laugh harder than the time before! John Kennedy Toole has created a sarcastic, witty, misunderstood, often hilarious character that almost everyone can relate with on some level, with Ignatius J. Reilly. The hilarity starts in the very first chapter and doesn't stop. Had Mr. Toole not died tragically early in his career he may very well have been one of the most influential authors of our time. This book will have you laughing until you cry, then crying for more when your done!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This was a great book for book group. The main character is rich in his seriousness and comic-sadness. Sometimes likable, sometimes not. But always trying to make good. It's creative, bizarre, and sweet. Our conversation turned to questions of mental illness, it's meaning, it's impact on a person and on his/her community and family. (many of us are therapists) And do we really want to medicate it all away, and what of it do we want to medicate away and what of it to keep."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"While the book as a &quot;comedy&quot; is worth the read alone, its satire of race relations, civil rights, and the stereotypical New Orlenian are perfect. The book has a wonderful array of character: the Civil Rights crusader M. Minkoff, Ignatius' discouraged mother Irene, the obese and condescending Ignatius J. Reilly, and many more. As a Louisiana resident, I particularly enjoyed reading about places which I have frequented often; nonetheless, this book is a must read for all."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"and never read it till now. Outstanding characters. I wanted to reach into the book and strangle the main character, Ignatius, several times but then could not wait to see what he would do next."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I don't laugh easy. A book is good if it can make me chuckle, but at some parts of this book, my sides hurt and my eyes were watering! Ignatius J. Reilly and his outrageous adventures as Fortuna keeps spinning him all around New Orleans make this masterpiece a side-splitting rollercoaster ride from cover to cover. Inexplicably sad and unbelievably funny, A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is a must-read for EVERYBODY, EVERYWHERE!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"&quot;You know I can't stand books about the South,&quot; I growled when my friend handed me &quot;Dunces&quot; as reverently as though he were giving me Aladdin's lamp. And indeed, I did always give up on books with a Southern locale and cast of characters.Until this one. It stands apart in every respect from those depressing Southern books. Written in sparkling modern prose, this is a serious book which is bursting with raw, zany humor. I didn't like the protagonist at first, but he grows on you. Very much like the hero of the currently popular serious/funny novel here on the West Coast, &quot;Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf&quot; by Asher Brauner, which is not only a very good book but also small enough for you to take along in your pack for a quick read on a plane or bus ride."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is an excelent piece of liturature. Ignatius' language and story line are incredible. Ignatius is funny and keeps you wanting to read more. I recomend this book with no reserve."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Like many of the reviews Ignatius J. Reilly is either adored or despised. I'd have to say for myself that the first three chapters made me want to throw Ignatius and this book into the fireplace. Slowly Ignatius gained my appreciation. This educated fool, with his brash comments and warped sense of imagination made me laugh out loud. By the end of the book, I felt myself cheering for him. If you don't like satire, stay away from this book. Ignatius is the type of character that you'll either love or hate."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I was so happy reading this book, to have found something so great I enjoyed every page. As other reviewers have noted, this one will make you laugh out loud. Good serious writing that is humorous as well is an American tradition started by Mark Twain and continues through Toole. I also recommend highly Brauner's Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf -- currently the best funny novel. Confederacy of Dunces was written forty years ago and won the Pulitzer Prize many years after the author's death, but it is as fresh, interesting and enjoyable today as it was then."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book gets better every time I read it. Toole develops the characters wonderfully and the dialogue is tremendous. Ignatius is a man born in the wrong century and he gives a good funny critique of this one. Although Fortuna spins his wheel down through most of the book, at the end it takes an upward turn. This is the only book J K Toole wrote as an adult so savor this one fine read. There is an e mail discussion group on this book. Order this one now. You will find yourself reading and re-reading this classic."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Not my kind of book! However, from the outset I was captivated by the larger-than-life characters who were carrying on such small, miserable and bizarre existences. What kept me reading was the bizarre and fatalistic way in which the characters repeatedly impacted each others lives. I finished the book because I had to witness the inevitable explosion that takes place when opposing forces are brought together. Tremendously rich characters with brilliantly conceived, hilarious interactions!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Very very funny and outragious. Wonderful time spent reading it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Count me as another reader who, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, determined to re-read Confederacy of Dunces for its setting in the city of New Orleans. This was a return trip for me, having first read CoD back in the early 80s. In the time since, I've been able to visit the city several times; those memories and the state of NOLA post-disaster made the depictions of Magazine Street and the Quarter and the Riverfront more poignant.But more than that, the post-disaster scenes of New Orleans have affected my experience of the book this time around; the broken-down neighborhoods and weary slums didn't seem so cheerily cartoonish this time. Jones working for 'minimal wage' wasn't quite so funny and the scenes in the Levy Pants factory with its sorry conditions seemed darker and more desperate than amusing. Yes, the novel is meant to be a rollicking farce and it has its guffaw moments, but it's no longer the hilarious corker that kept me laughing page after page at the first reading. I guess, 20 years later, neither I or New Orleans are the same as we were back then."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The late John Kennedy Toole penned a veritably irrefutable masterpiece in the ingenious A Confederacy of Dunces. Although inestimably depressing that he committed suicide due to Simon Schuster's publication refusal, Toole and his incomparable genius live on vicariously through this resounding work of undeniable merit.I find it seemingly impossible and self-defeating to sum up this great work so as not to be redundant or spoil it for others. Suffice it to say, I tore through this book in two days and reveled in its farcical and satirical ingenuity as I laughed out loud early and often, as it were, that I actively yearned for it not to come to a close. The anachronistic, bombastic, and verbose rhetoric of our intrepid & endearing protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly, riotously pervades A Confederacy of Dunces and makes for the most incredibly vital and overtly comical character I have encountered since Shakespeare's Falstaff himself in Henrvy IV I&II.; John Kennedy Toole's amazingly vivid characterization and unparalleled cynicism emanate throughout this bona fide tour de force with an unmistakably resonant subtlety. As the irrepressible Ignatius would note, it would be absolutely shameless effrontery and an utterly unspeakable abomination for A Confederacy of Dunces NOT to be mentioned among the top 10 American novels of all-time - this goes without saying. 5 Shining Stars!\\"I dust a bit...in addition, I am at the moment writing a lengthy indictment against our century. When my brain begins to reel from my literary labors, I make an occasional cheese dip.\\""},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"simply brilliant.... A Confederacy of Dunces has been described as \\"the only successful satire ever written by an american author.\\" This being so, does a satire need to be funny in order to poignant? True, Toole's wit by far makes A Confeceracy of Dunces a hilarious work, but if one doesn't find it amusing is it not successful? Of course not. Satires are not meant to be necessarily funny. The greatest satirist ever, Jonathan Swift, upon publishing A Modest Proposal, had people believing every word he said, ready to slaughter Irish babies in order to solve the hunger problem in Ireland.But it was not found to be humorous.What makes a satire successful is the fact that it reveals basic humans truths through a slew of characters and mocks those truths. Ignatius doesn't need to \\"evolve\\" to make him a brilliant work of satirical fiction. He represents the naysayers, the traditionalists, the purists, the holier-than-thous who are so stuck in their preconceptions that they can't see past their own unkept lifestyles. Ignatius' way is the only way, for him, and this is why his character is brilliant. The humor behind Ignatius is not necessarily how he acts, but what he is willing to do to prove himself correct and to prove other people, namely his mother, to be lower than dirt. Ignatius' self righteousness can be seen in almost anyone, to an extent, or someone we all know, not necessarily because we would actually act in that way, but because it's so bizarre and extremist.The other characters are meant as a backdrop for Ignatius' ludicrous behaviour, but each can stand as an independent character. God help us if Hollywood decides to make a movie revolving around Lana Lee."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This novel is well-constructed and the prose made me thirsty for more and the antics made me guffaw. Etc.But I am sure that the experience of this book would be different were it not for the preface by Percy. Maybe Percy is the author of the book. Maybe O'Toole is the author of Percy. Because the nice bittersweet story about the provenance of the novel at the beginning puts this ulterior sympathy in your head and also the expectation to find some inner sadness in the book. Well, of course there is a kind of sadness in the book, if we evaluate Ignatius by our own standards, e.g., it's sad that he's fat. Also it's at first depressing that Iggy has a problem with Modern Life. But he only talks like he does. Anyway, a claim: this book has a romantic appeal owing to the preface. We get slipped another, richer chracter with the (inner) travails of Iggy but who isn't so superficially exotic, and we endow Iggy with all the praeternatural vitality that a postmortem-vindicated imagination should have. This doesn't vitiate the five-star rating, because, you get the preface too when you buy the book, right?"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Like the best of art, this is a book that can be enjoyed on a low-level pure-entainment level, and can be enjoyed at five stars. But it is also that great art kind of book that can be enjoyed at whatever high level you might like - this is fantastic literature that be deconstructed, critiqued, torn apart, and otherwise delved into to find layers and layers and layers of life meaning in it.What's the highest level/compliment any piece of artwork can achieve? That it either entertained me greatly, or that it changed my life in some way. This book works on both levels.I read a lot on the subway, since I get about an hour a day riding the rails of NYC, and I read this book mostly on the 1/9 line. Even though this is a public space, I laghed out loud numerous times. Some of this book is just plain outrageously funny - the gut-crunching painful kind of laughter-inducing humor of Gallagher, Toy Story 2, or the Beavis and Butthead movie. But other parts of the book are full of emotion and ennui - the main character of the book is not altogether psychologically with-it, but yet, he has a profound and honest insight into a lot of the supidity and cultural BS and killing-oneself-and-one's-world behavior that so many &quot;sane&quot; people go after - consumerism, nationalism, idealism, ego gratification, etc. And that's the genius of the book - a very intelligent &quot;hero&quot; who is also a fat, lazy, neurotic can't-hold-a-job still-living-with-mom loser.I hate to say anything more, because I hate reviews that tell the story of the book but never comment on the story and thus ruin all the fun for the reader. I can't begin to tell you how much I love this book, and how often while I was reading it that I said to people &quot;YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!!&quot; What more do I need to say? Read this book! It should be in the library of everyone, and is one of those rare books that I really wish everyone in the country would read. We'd be a better society if everyone knew it. But alas, 98% of Americans prefer crap to well-written thinking literature, so this pulitzer winning book is forever relgated to the bowels of the used bookstores.

Big mistake. While still a ridiculous tragi-comedy, it must have been a slow year in 1981 for Pulitzer Prize contenders. Maybe I just know too many people with Ignatius Reilly tendencies now. Perhaps the book's editors couldn't bring themselves to tighten up the work of a dead author. Anyway I cut it, I found it tiresome on second reading (though I will admit to laughing out loud repeatedly)."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I know many many people love this book. I have read excellent reviews of it from many readers of it. But I found that I could not really get into it. It seemed to me as if the whole joke of the thing was there in the beginning, and it was repeated over and over. I did not find aside from an occasional surprise the book to be truly funny. In fact what I felt almost from the beginning was an underlying sadness and despair, a kind of desperation. The mixture of the low and the high which so many comment about did not really work for me. For I found the low just not very interesting.I know I am a minority here. The writer Walker Percy who is responsible for the book's publication calls it a comic masterpiece.

We were riding in a brand new, beautiful Danish coach and I was in the company of three, very proper looking, older Danish ladies. Along with my body, my mind was tired and when my mind gets tired it amplifies things. Bad gets worse, funny gets rib cracking, if you know what I mean? I was on the part about Miss Trixie. I could not contain myself. I would read one sentence and burst into hideous laughter. Then I would calm myself and read another and the same thing would happen. I would go back and read the same sentence and just crack up. I couldn't stand it. I was making a complete fool out of myself and had lost control. I could not stop reading and I could not stop laughing. When I looked at the ladies I thought they might be plotting to send for someone to bring a sizable bag with a few rocks in it to take care of this &quot;offensive&quot; Yankee. At this time I decided to extract my hideous self to the hallway and read out there. I thought I was getting strange looks in the compartment, but here, in the hallway, I knew it wouldn't be long before someone showed up with some manacles and the bag. I was forced to retreat to the compartment and the proper Danish ladies. I started reading again. The laughter followed. Burst after burst of demented hyena laughter. I have a laugh that has been labled contagious and the next thing, I'm hearing little chuckles from the proper Danish ladies. I look at them and start laughing. They look at me and burst into laughter and then all break out cigars and start smoking. Cool. This is the funniest book I have ever read, all three times, and I'm ready for it again. My step father, who is rather proper and hates the disgusting commercial TV violence and rotten launguage picked it up and started in the middle. I raised an eybrow and watched. He turned to the front, read the Forward, and never stopped. He read it in a day and a half. This is a book that I pick up in used book stores to give to people I meet who like to read good stuff and have open and uncluttered minds, slightly sick.

I would like to add my reccomendation for how to read this book. A good friend of mine handed me &quot;Confederacy of Dunces&quot; while sitting beside me on a plane from Minneapolis to New Orleans. I was transported in more ways than one. If you ever thought about going to New Orleans, do it, and read this book before, during and/or after your trip. I found myself feeling as if I were a part of the story when I walked past the very music store Ignatius J. Reilly waits for his mother in front of in the first chapter of the book. I was able to bring the flavor of New Orleans home with me as I continued to read. We all can't jet off to New Orleans as often as we'd like, but &quot;Confederacy of Dunces&quot; can take us there in a style that hilarious doesn't even begin to describe. I only hope John Toole's spirit knows what a great gift he left us in this book. I look forward to curling up with my dog, &quot;Reilly&quot; and reading it again.

I love when the characters are \\"live people\\" to me, I think about them even after I put the book down. The story is realistic and whimsical.

His mother runs a close second, with all her oddities, and her hold over a perenially anarchistic, defiant, and flamboyantly overweight adult son.The real life story of author John Kennedy Toole is equally spellbinding and, were it not for the insistant persistence of his mother, this Pulitzer-prize-winner would have remained undiscovered.One of the funniest books ever written. Humor mixed with pathos is difficult, but Toole managed it brilliantly.Every character and deed in the book come together at the end of this overwhelming dramatic farce -- a work as magnificently gigantic as the protagonist himself.And how many other fictional characters have bronze statues erected in their honor in the very area where the book opens?If you can't buy it, get it from your library.

The misunderstood 'genius' of the huge character guarantees entertainment, and he's not the only extreme character. Of course, the knowledge that the writer took his own life at the age of thirty-two casts a slight shadow over the tale. I looked for clues he might've revealed through written word as to why he committed suicide. If not for the persistence of Toole's mother, readers might not have been introduced to these unforgettable characters. Readers like myself are grateful she persisted in having this delightful novel published.Chrissy K. McVayauthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"\\"When he had finished the first hot dog, Ignatius prepared and consumed another, contemplationg other kindnesses that might postpone his having to go to work again.\\"Anyone who has ever been a cynic, procrastinator, college student,or waste of life can appreciate the lazy mess that Toole illistrates through dysfunctional Ignatius J. Reilly. This thirty year old bum reminds me of the ever-present \\"that guy,\\" the one who go to great lengths to ensure their own laziness or alternative lifestyle. Whether he is faking injury, going to movies he knows he will hate, preaching medival christian values, telling horror stories about Scenicruiser buses, or explaining his mysterious \\"valve,\\" Ignatius endlessly finds new ways to avoid conforming or producing. Toole may go to extremes to make Ignatius's adventures more humorous, but I still enjoyed Ignatius's lifestyle because he is an exaggeration of the kind of dysfunction we see everyday. His suto-intellectual, self-rightous feelings of superiorty work as an absurd parody to so many irrational actions that people back up with idealogy and theology (but never geometry...).Another reason to enjoy and relate to Toole's rediculous scenarios is that the story is a product of dysfunctional people directing other dysfunctional people. I believe all the characters could be members of the confederacy of dunces, because not only are their actions absurd, but they usually attempt or succeed in influencing others. Myrna Minkoff, Ignatius's nympho/rebel/\\"free thinking\\" college pal clearly has a few screws loose on her own and shouldn't be giving advice to anyone, let alone a 30 year old who mastrubates to dogs. But, Myrna's crazy beliefs actually get to Ignatius and spark his intrest in another crazy idea, The Crusade for Moorish Dignity. This pattern of dysfunction feeding dysfuction repeats itself in many of the stories relationships (Ms. Levy and Ms. Trixie, Ignatius and Mrs. Reilly, Manusco and Mrs. Reilly etc.) One might say that the stories characters don't appear to be so far off from the back and forth absurdity of politics, relationship battles, or overly-analytical English classes.So critical of the world around him, and equally so unaware of himself, Toole's anti hero reminds us why our friends have a responsibility to laugh at our complaints and say \\"shut up and do your work.\\""},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole is a very funny book and I would recommend it highly to comedy lovers of all tastes. It contains the kind of grotesque physical humor one might expect to enjoy in a Marx brothers movie or low-brow cartoon like South Park, hilarious absurdity that would not seem out of place in an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus, as well as more subtle irony.This is a novel full of bizarre characters and absurd events and situations, but the funniest parts are all centered around a very strange protagonist, Mr. Ignatius J. Reilly. Ignatius is an extremely interesting character, a completely unique personality. He is a gigantic man, who, at the age of 30 lives at home with his mother. Extremely independent and unconventional, he seems largely unaware of the real world, except as something that occasionally intrudes on his thoughts and whims. He does not know or really care how an adult is expected to behave. A Master of Arts in Medeival Studies, he writes polemics condemning his century and calls frequently and vocally for a return to the Dark Ages, the age of good, authoritarian popes, \\"decent kings\\" and the philosophers he admires. He refuses to leave the city of New Orleans, condemns anything new as a violation of \\"taste and decency\\" and abhors the idea of sex. He spends his life scribbling on tablets in a dirty room in his mother's home until one day financial crisis strikes, and he is forced to get a real job. Ignatius's (rhymes with pugnacious) half hearted attempts at interacting with real grown ups in the real world is one of the primary sources of humor in this novel. It is so funny because we see Ignatius as a character who is ridiculously unflexible, a man who is incapable or unwilling to adjust his thinking and behavior to events around him as society requires we do to work together and survive. This sort of mechanical inelasticity, according to comic theorist Henri Bergson, is present in anything that is funny to us, and it is definitely present in Ignatius with his unthinkingly self centered world view and his preoccupation (to the point of absent mindedness) with all things Medeival. Additionally, Ignatius's physical peculiarities and his lack of hygiene and table manners, as described by the author, add an aspect of physical comedy or bathroom humor, funny because it interjects what is taboo into unexpected situations, which will appeal to other readers. Other characters in the novel are important and contribute to its humor, but it is the protagonist Ignatius J. Reilly that really makes this book funny and worthwhile."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces is the story of a medieval man stuck in modern New Orleans. The adventures of Ignatius J. Reilly are exaggerated and absurd, yet the overall feeling of the story is melancholy. Ignatius' failure to succeed in this world forms the foundation of the novel, and the comedy surrounding this failure leaves a picture that is humorous but depressing.Toole's writing is of a virtuoso quality, his writing is easy to understand and incredibly clear-it is as if a camera were following the characters through their absurd situations.The other strong point of the novel is the originality of its premise. Though Ignatius may be a throwback to Quixote, he is a completely original personality, with his own set of mannerisms, phrases, and ideas. By the end of the novel the reader will know everything there is to know about him. The other characters are also very original. Mancuso-the costume donning policeman, Robichaux-the old man who fears communists, Jones-the street-smart black man working at the Night of Joy. All of these characters have their own trademark speech patterns and phrases, which makes them more realistic.The main problem in the book is the lack of any significant plot progression or character development. Though the characters are all interesting, they never change. They stick to their initial personalities for the entire story. Nothing really happens in the book, Ignatius gets a job, loses it, not much changes. The only continual change is Ignatius' declining health. The order in which Ignatius gets/loses jobs could easily be reversed with little change to the story. This lack of a plot becomes very noticeable about half way through the book, and the story becomes repititious.This repitition is okay if you like the type of humor in the novel. I believe this is the reason for the huge differences in opinion regarding this novel. If you enjoy hearing of Ignatius' valve or his tirades on the lack of taste/theology/geometry of our society, then you will thoroughly enjoy the book. If Ignatius annoys or disgusts you, the book will become extremely dull.This book is an excellent work of comedy, from there it's just a matter of taste."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"...wouldn't it have been even better 100 pages ligher? Ignatious and the undercover cop are really the only funny characters here. Anything with Mrs. Reilly and Santa was pretty boring. The way all the pieces fit together at the end is very entertaining."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I had a hard time getting through this book, but I read it. Did not see the humor in making fun of such a sad character."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. I f I ever wrote a book, I would want it to be this one. I have been buying copies since I first read it in New Orleans in 1980. A must-have for anyone who loves a great laugh!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"After reading A Confederacy of Dunces I was really disappointed in the book. The novel was supposed to be humorous. However, as I started to read more into the book I felt really annoyed with the characters in the book, and with the book itself. A theme that the author, John Kennedy Toole, tries to display is that the characters are foolish and unhappy because people in society aren't helping one another and that is a major reason why they are unhappy.The characters, especially Ignatius, annoyed me because they weren't unhappy just because no one was helping them, it was also the fact that they didn't try to do something for themselves and be happy. Few people today in society will help someone so they can make their lives happier. My opinion is that this is a book that I could not read over again. I do not recommend this book if you want to laugh all it did was irritate me."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The only interesting thing that kept me going through this book is the fact that so many people loved it. I am quite an omnivorous reader, but this book offers nothing. Even the fart jokes are not funny. I can't understand people (90%!) who professed unrestrained love for this book. Only a little better I can understand those who hated it - probably just a reaction to all the hipe. I did not love or hate this book. This book did not offend me. It bored me."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I finally had to put this away without finishing. I found it tedious and not even remotely funny. I got through about half of it and never found anything to hold my interest."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book was good, I have to admit it. I usually disagree with critics so this is a one off for me. I am afraid all the promises of \\"comic fugue\\" might have contributed to my lack of laughter until most of the way through the book. I actually didn't crack a laugh until about 2/3 of the way through the story, at a point when George, having paid money, gets stuck babysitting the weenie wagon. Then I about rolled over in stitches there and for a few pages after that. Perhaps Ignatius (is this supposed to be a pseudonym for Ignoramus?) is so astonishingly dimwitted that part of me altogether rejected his worldview. It was grating to read his written diatribes. I mostly skimmed them. Oh, and, maybe I'm too innocent, but I found the relationship between himself and his mother to be depressingly grating. It's just not pleasant to read stuff like that again and again throughout the book.That said, the characters are amazingly well developed, complex and satisfying. I LOVED the ending, loved the fact that Ignatius the Ignoramus had maybe 5-10% good sense and numerous redeeming qualities, including liking cats and rolling like a plump wheel of fortune himself (as another reviewer said) and eventually bumbling his way to helping several people to a positive conclusion.Another thing I liked is that Ignatius (the Ignoramus) was a pure and total failure, from beginning to end. NOTHING whatsoever came out the way he envisioned it, in fact EVERYTHING came out to be opposite, including (and delightfully) the ending. The way the tension developed in his relationship with Myrna minx was very good and contributed a lot to the satisfying ending. The fact that things go the opposite way to his liking but turn out well makes the book very, very satisfying to read.I would read it again. Despite not laughing that much, it was time well spent and enriching."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"According to many people, this is a classic. Now I won't go that far, but this book introduces us to one of the greatest type of characters - the educated buffoon. I like to refer to it as the first smart-stupid comedy.The first thing I must say is that the readability is quite lacking. The superfluous flowery language, the street vernacular, and the outdated slang make it quite annoying to read at some points. I know that many people say that that is part of its charm. That may be true, but nonetheless, it's not an easy Sunday read.That said, this book is character driven, and Toole really delves into the eccentricities of all characters involved. The plot really revolves on Ignatius Reilly; a master's educated fat doofus with tons of book knowledge, but no social skills whatsoever. A computer nerd way before computers really were popular. A Comic book guy way before the Simpsons. He deals with his mother, his mother's friends, a bad luck cop, a mysterious hipster girl from New York, the owners and employees of a pants factory and a seedy bar all in complex and humorous interminglings.Not only funny, it sheds life on a non-classical dysfunctional family, the city of New Orleans in the past, and a whole lot more. While the humor and insight is entertaining, the fluidity of the novel takes away from a great novel."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"What can I say about this book that will accurately surmise the story and its habitual moments of hilarity? Well, it's not that easy. The book is not exactly based on a clearly defined story line but rather on the interactions and failed enterprises of some very colorful characters in New Orleans. The story of these individuals (individuals one might refer to as dolts, hence the use of the word \\"dunces\\" in the title), is spearheaded by one Ignatius J. Reilly. At thirty-three Ignatius is stuck in prepubescence, can't keep a job to save his life, and suffers from an impassioned antipathy for modernity. He is taunted through correspondence by an associate named Myrna Minkoff, who is 'socially loose' and condemns Ignatius - with unparallel buffoonery - for not doing anything with his life. The rest of the characters Toole presents us with are equally farcical and suffer from that nincompoop condition that plague Ignatius and Myrna.But Ignatius and Myrna are only two of the characters you will encounter in this great book. To meet the rest of the confederacy you must read the story."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I am sad to admit that I'd never heard of this book until I was loaned it by a roommate, but fortunately it was well worth the wait and one of the best literary surprises I've read recently. The main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, is a larger than life, disheveled and slightly deranged man who haunts the French Quarter of New Orleans and the rest of the cast, each an absurd caricature in their own right, mingles with each other in very funny and unexpected ways.While the characters and their hijinx certainly propel the story along, just as imporant as the people who inhabit New Orleans is the city itself, with its quirks and originality on full display. It is a wonderful and loving reminder of the pre-Katrina hedonistic, lively New Orleans, but at same time the author does not hide the racism, segregation and other problems from which they city also suffered. This was one best depictions of a place I've ever read.Finally, the author also does a brilliant job of pacing the story and bringing everything in it full circle, just as Ignatius had been predicting all along in his discussions of Fortuna. It was a very clever trick that can not fully be described, in a short review, but alone makes this story worth reading.A Confederacy of Dunces is a fantastic, lively, and hilarious book which is loose and frenzied, but it is written with fantastic structure. I would highly recommend it for people who like a good laugh, New Orleans or enjoyable fiction, but also people who enjoy reading books through an academic lens. It is very well crafted, but also a lot of fun."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"this is probably the best book that i have read in the last 10 years. the charachters are vivid. in my humble opinion if you dont like this book then you have been corrupted by the formula driven books that are currently on the best seller lists."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It may very well be the funniest novel in American literature. One thing is for certain: it is unique. I've wracked my brains to think of a parallel to it, and the closest I can come is P. G. Wodehouse with his Bertie and Jeeves characters. But this really doesn't come that close, except for the zaniness of the characters. Ignatius Reilly stands alone. He is repulsive, yes...but not in an evil sense. His self-deluded, self absorbed worldview leads him into some of the most preposterous statements regarding the people and social conventions of his native New Orleans that you are likely ever to read. His fulminations are at once breathtaking in their verve and linguistic acrobatics, while at the same time so absurd as to pass beyond lunacy. How in the world the author came up with some of these dialogues is a wonder and you must read this book if only to experience the world according to Ignatius Reilly. There is an undertone of sadness to this work, and I can't quite figure it out. There is nothing overtly tragic or sad here, and yet somehow or other, a gray fog seeps out of the text and at the end of a particularly funny episode, you stop laughing long enough to feel the tug of poignant humanity. Where does it come from? It's hard to explain. But reading this book was an experience well worth the effort."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I had to read this novel for my American Literature class and all I can say is that....THIS IS THE MOST WICKED TIGHT BOOK I'VE EVER BEEN FORCED TO READ. Don't judge this book by the cover (or by the title at that matter) this is a very good read. This is the funniest book I've read since The Grandissimes. For those who don't know what this story is about, think if Oliver Hardy (from the classic Laurel and Hardy film shorts) ate Don Quixote and you get the books \\"hero,\\" Ignatius J Reilly.Ignatius is a big fat slob who lives still lives with his mother despite the fact that he is in his thirty's and is a college grad. As I learned in my Lit. class, this is a picaresque story, it focuses on the main characters interior human psyche. Since the entire book follows Ignatius's episodic adventures there is no itinerary. The entire novel is full of parody's of social norms. But it's not just about stuff I learned in class, this book is all about laughter. Throughout all of the chapters I was laughing my head off, the library literally had to throw me out because of scene I was making. This book has it all; a fat person who eats and complains all the time, New Orleans, a policeman who dresses in funny outfits and hangs out in a mens room, flaming gay people, hot dogs, everything! It's a rollercoaster of a ride that will make your valve open and your moustache smile and your eyes water with tears of joy. So stop waisting your time reading what other people thought of this book, go out and read it. Develope your own opinon for crying out loud!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is truly a great book. Humor is much underrated in our lives. The ability to laugh at our selves is important. This is not a book of flowery words. This is a humorously philosophical look at our selves and our condition not a didactic diatribe. For that it deserves serious consideration and respect.Ignatius J. Reilly is not a hero. He is an exaggeration. He is both rigorously, uncompromisingly correct and absurdly tragic at the same time. We have met the enemy and he is us.This book, with its protagonist so heroically intellectual and pathetically tragic, is an exaggerated mirror of our own situation in life. In addition Ignatius is so extremely and precisely developed in his own philosophy, no one could possibly understand him. In truth we are all just as unique as Ignatius J. Riley is but we rarely notice our uniqueness or come to grips with our isolation. We are all misunderstood and frustrated with our inability to express ourselves and our inability to pursuade others of what we know is right.This is not a book about heroes with a happy ending. There is no didactic, simple message here about good vs. evil. Those people, who read this book and reject it because they don't like the characters, fail to see the point, that we are all a crazy mixed up mess of good and bad. There can be no simple message in the mess. We are after all... human, we are fallible. We are stupid about some things, smart about others. We succeed and we fail. We are all industrious and lazy to some degree. We are locked into this absurd existence, but to be human and aware and alive is to endure our absurdity with glee and joy of life wherever we can get it even if it's just a guilty hotdog, to laugh at it all. Because we are all part of it, and if we could stand back and look at it from the outside, we would see it is wonderful.This is a book for beatniks during the rightwing, conformist '50s. A book for anyone who has ever known they were right about something despite being a minority of one in a crowd of thousands of idiots. A book for flawed people who can still be amused by their flaws. A book for outsiders who have retained their dignity in dirty clothes.So just read it and take it for what it is. Enjoy the crazies and clowns while you still can."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is a gem. I can't describe how interesting it was to read. The main character of this book is the slob, bum, obese, yet strangely pedantic Ignatius Reilly.Ignatius is the protagonist of the story, and he is the whole mass of the story's bulk. We meet Ignatius in the beginning, described in a language that has yet to be emulated. We hear of his \\"supercilious blue and yellow eyes\\" and his mannerisms.From the beginning the reader will be entranced by this towering giant of a character. And the language that Ignatius uses! It's too good to be true. It's not English really. It's just Ignatius's language.That's one of the best things about this book. The way that the character's talk is one of the hallmarks of this book. It's what sets this apart. This quirky New Orleans story features hilarious depictions of characters in the debauche French Quarter (where Ignatius has many a wild adventure!).I am at a loss with words now, I think my valve is starting to close! If you never read this book, you will soon understand what I mean! I have no more words of wisdom save one: read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I could not help but read nearly 50 pages at least upon every sitting while reading this book. Absolutely amazing. So many side stories, twist and turns, that, in the end, comlpletely fall together in a most amazing way. This book is truly a representation of modern literature at its best. Set in New Orleans, this book is a story of an intelligent man lost in a world of confusion and ignorance whose mishaps seem to effet everyone in the area. So many things are involved that cause the reader to never lose interest. Absolutely amazing. I laughed out loud on several occations. This book is filled with comedy, sorrow, and best of all, great writing. You will become lost in this world of the main character Ignatius J. Reilly, and feel the way he does. I even found myself talking like him in conversations after reading. This book is all the hope needed for modern literature. Truly a book that must be read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I've never laughed so hard in my life. If you ever wondered what life looks like throughthe eyes of a hotdog vendor,while living over the edge of reality, then you must read this book. It's an absolute delight to the imagination and funny bone."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"As funny as this book is, as dead-on as the dialogue is, as fascinatingly complex as the supporting cast is, the centerpiece of this fantastic novel is (of course) Ignatius Reilly. But perhaps Toole's greatest accomplishment is in carefully tempering Ignatius' buffoonery with a profound sense of sadness. With his thunderous, pretentious, hilarious and desperate lamentations on Modern Society, Ignatius is at once the Town Cryer, the Royal Hero and the Village Idiot."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I suppose this isn't the worst book I have ever put down half-read. But I can't imagine why anyone would waste their time or money on it. The &quot;humor&quot; is just boring and occasionally disgusting. If the sound of flatulence or the sight of ill-fitting trousers on an obese person drive you into paroxysms of laughter, this book is undoubtedly for you. If you're plagued by subtlety and taste, and your sense of humor admits the odd guilty pleasure, I suggest instead The Liar, by Stephen Fry: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=156947012"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Length:: 8:05 MinsThis is a highly acclaimed comic novel, and a lot of people think it's hilarious. Despite the fact that Ignatius is not a 'nice' person the reader can relate to, he IS a complex creature of paradox, and we can at least empathize with him - as long as we understand him. This video review is devoted to such an understanding - an outline of the plot (in form, not content), the main character, his themes, and his various styles of humor."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The details of everyday life in A Confederacy of Dunces add up to a complex picture of New Orleans in the early sixties. We get a sense, as well, of the changes coming on a broader level: the old world is passing away, and a new world is coming into being on the streets of the Quarter.Critical Theory students at Louisiana State University are analyzing this text nine different ways, and finding a multitude of meanings. They understand how New Historical analysis proves especially delightful and insightful."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"John Kennedy Toole's masterpiece and Pulitzer Prize winning novel, A Confederacy of Dunces is much more than an epic comedy, but a tour de force in post-modernistic art--a true study in American Literature. The character dynamic within the pages of this text will stay with you forever. Ignatius, the main character, will keep you laughing throughout the entire book, however, the novel as a whole will bring you to tears. Toole had talent, a force rarely seen from a writer--especially in modern times.Anyone who has rated this book under four stars can consider themselves illiterate degenerates (as Ignatius might say) and completely responsible for the lack of talent, and most likely admirers of Paris Hilton and reality TV. For the vast majority of you who has given this book the credit it deserves, I commend you; for you show me there is still hope in within the literary arts.No review can depict the true nature of this book--it's something you just need to read. Because deep within the epic character, Ignatius, lies a truth within each of us and A Confederacy of Dunces will expose much more than fits of laughter--but a meaning in life when all hope diminishes."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I am not a big fan of dark comedy, so this book is three stars for me, but I still acknowledge \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\" as a very unique book.If you enjoy reading about the misadventures of largely unsympathetic characters (as many do), you will find few books that do it as well as this one. On the other hand, just to warn readers whose tastes tend more toward mine, if you like to have a protagonist with whom you can truly empathize in order to feel fully absorbed in a story, this one may not be for you.A very good book that isn't for everyone. (Then again, how many books achieve greatness trying to be everything to everyone?) This book knows what it wants to be and does it well. I just wasn't the right reader."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"populate a novel.One wonders how much O'Toole patterned his desperately comic hero after his own existence, prior to his suicide before the book was ever published.There is a wealthy of literary caricature here, along with the flavor of N'Awlins, complete with its colorful denizens. Ignatius' run-in with the world of gays and lesbians at a consciousness-raising political rally he holds is a chapter of sheer insanity.Although I much preferred the quietly unique characters such as Officer Mancuso, and the love of Ignatius' life, the ornery Myrna, Ignatius and his mother are truly one of the most odd couples to ever grace the page of an American novel. Always colorful and entertaining, Toole's novel delights, although, in my opinion, it fell short of what standard I believe should be achieved for a Pulitzer.Hundreds of reviewers can't be wrong - read \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\", particularly if you've ever lived in the deep south!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is the best book ever written in my opinion.
